Pappalardi Jr. (December 30, 1939 - April 17, 1983) was an American music producer, songwriter, vocalist, and bassist. He is best known to the public as the bassist and co-lead vocalist of the band Mountain, whose song \\"Mississippi Queen\\" peaked at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has become a classic rock radio staple. Originating in the eclectic music scene in New York's Greenwich Village, he became closely attached to the British power trio Cream, writing, arranging, and producing for their second album Disraeli Gears. As a producer for Atlantic Records, he worked on several projects with guitarist Leslie West; in 1969 their partnership evolved into the band Mountain. The band lasted less than five years, but their work influenced the first generation of heavy metal and hard rock music. Pappalardi continued to work as a producer, session musician, and songwriter until he was shot and killed by his wife Gail Collins in 1983. ==Early life== Pappalardi was born in The Bronx, New York City. A classically trained musician, he graduated from New York City's The High School of Music & Art and attended the University of Michigan.The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches By Jeremy Simmonds (C)2006 ==Career== In 1964 Pappalardi was a member of Max Morath's Original Rag Quartet (ORQ) in their premier engagement at New York's Village Vanguard with several other musicians. Along with Pappalardi on guitarr√≥n (Mexican acoustic bass) were pianist-singer Morath, who revived classic ragtime played in the Scott Joplin manner, Barry Kornfeld, a NYC studio folk and jazz guitarist, and Jim Tyler, a Baroque and Renaissance lutenist playing four-string banjo and mandolin. The ORQ then toured the college and concert circuit during the following year, and opened four engagements with the Dinah Shore show in Las Vegas and elsewhere. Pappalardi studied classical music at the University of Michigan. Upon completing his studies and returning to New York, he was unable to find work and so became part of the Greenwich Village folk-music scene where he made a name for himself as a skilled arranger; he also appeared on Tom Paxton as well as Vince Martin and Fred Neil albums for Elektra Records. From there he moved into record production, initially concentrating on folk and folk-rock acts for artists such as The Youngbloods and Joan Baez. As a producer, Pappalardi is perhaps best known for his work with Cream, beginning with their second album, Disraeli Gears. Pappalardi has been referred to in various interviews with the members of Cream as \\"the fourth member of the band\\" as he generally had a role in arranging their music. He contributed instrumentation for his studio arrangements and he and his wife, Gail Collins, wrote the Cream hit \\"Strange Brew\\" with Eric Clapton. He also produced The Youngbloods' first album. As a musician, Pappalardi is widely recognized as a bassist, vocalist, and founding member of the American hard rock band-heavy metal forerunner Mountain, a band born out of his working with future bandmate Leslie West's soul-inspired rock and roll band The Vagrants, and producing West's 1969 Mountain solo album. The band's original incarnation actively recorded and toured between 1969 and 1971. Pappalardi produced the band's albums, and co-wrote and arranged a number of the band's songs with Collins and West. The band's signature song \\"Mississippi Queen\\" is still heard regularly on classic rock radio stations. They also had a hit with the song \\"Nantucket Sleighride\\" written by Pappalardi and Collins. Pappalardi generally played Gibson basses live and on Mountain's recordings. He is most often shown with an EB-1 but there are photographs of him playing an EB-0 live. He was known for playing a Gibson EB-1 violin bass through a set of Sunn amplifiers that, he claimed, once belonged to Jimi Hendrix. ==Later life and death== Woodlawn Cemetery Pappalardi was forced to retire because of partial deafness, ostensibly from his high-volume shows with Mountain. He continued producing throughout the 1970s, released a solo album (Don't Worry, Ma) and recorded with Kazuo Takeda's band Creation (who had opened for a reunited Mountain during their 1973 tour of Japan). In May 1973, the British music magazine NME reported that Pappalardi would be producing and playing bass on Queen of the Night, the debut album for Maggie Bell, former singer of Stone the Crows, but this proved to be a false rumor. He also worked on the NBC show Hot Hero Sandwich in 1979. Pappalardi was shot and killed by his wife, Gail, on April 17, 1983, in their East Side Manhattan apartment, with a derringer he had given her as a gift a few months previously. She was subsequently charged with second-degree murder and was found guilty of the lesser criminally negligent homicide.TeamRock.com, http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-04-17/felix-pappalardi-meets-a-tragic-end, 17 Apr 2014.

The leading figure of the clan was either a (usually male) sibling, cousin, or parent of the empress or consort. Consort kins can be seen as a manifestation of nepotism in Sinospheric imperial politics. While some were competent, only relying on their female relatives for their initial audiences with the emperor and then proving their worth at their positions (e.g. Wei Qing and Huo Qubing), many turned out to be corrupt and incompetent (e.g. Yang Guozhong).

Most of his work consisted of cassettes recorded alone in his home, and his music was frequently cited for its \\"pure\\" and \\"childlike\\" qualities. Johnston spent extended periods in psychiatric institutions and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He gathered a local following in the 1980s by passing out tapes of his music while working at a McDonald's in Austin, Texas. His cult status was propelled when Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was seen wearing a T-shirt that featured artwork from Johnston's 1983 album Hi, How Are You. Beyond music, Johnston was accomplished as a visual artist, with his illustrations exhibited at various galleries around the world. His struggles with mental illness were the subject of the 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston. He died in 2019 of what is suspected to have been a heart attack. ==Early life== Johnston was born in Sacramento, California, and grew up in New Cumberland, West Virginia. He was the youngest of five children of William Dale \\"Bill\\" Johnston (1922‚Äì2017) and Mabel Ruth Voyles Johnston (1923‚Äì2010). He began recording music in the late 1970s on a $59 Sanyo monaural boombox, singing and playing piano as well as the chord organ. Following graduation from Oak Glen High School, Johnston spent a few weeks at Abilene Christian University in West Texas before dropping out. He later attended the art program at the East Liverpool campus of Kent State University, during which he recorded Songs of Pain and More Songs of Pain. ==Career== ===1980s‚Äì1990s=== When Johnston moved to Austin, Texas, he began to attract the attention of the local press and gained a following augmented in numbers by his habit of handing out tapes to people he met. Live performances were well-attended and hotly anticipated. His local standing led to him being featured in a 1985 episode of the MTV program The Cutting Edge featuring performers from Austin's \\"New Sincerity\\" music scene. In 1988, Johnston visited New York City and recorded 1990 with producer Mark Kramer at his Noise New York studio. This was Johnston's first experience in a professional recording environment after a decade of releasing home-made cassette recordings. His mental health further deteriorated during the making of 1990. In 1989, Johnston released the album It's Spooky in collaboration with singer Jad Fair of the band Half Japanese. In 1990, Johnston played at a music festival in Austin, Texas. On the way back to West Virginia on a private two-seater plane piloted by his father Bill, Johnston had a manic psychotic episode; believing he was Casper the Friendly Ghost, Johnston removed the key from the plane's ignition and threw it outside. His father, a former U.S. Air Force pilot, managed to successfully crash-land the plane, even though \\"there was nothing down there but trees\\". Although the plane was destroyed, Johnston and his father emerged with only minor injuries. As a result of this episode, Johnston was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. Interest in Johnston increased when Kurt Cobain was frequently photographed wearing a T-shirt featuring the cover image of Johnston's album Hi, How Are You that music journalist Everett True gave him. Cobain listed Yip/Jump Music as one of his favorite albums in his journal in 1993. In spite of Johnston being resident in a mental hospital at the time, there was a bidding war to sign him. He refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because Metallica was on the label's roster and he was convinced that they were Satanic and would hurt him, also dropping his longtime manager, Jeff Tartakov, in the process. Ultimately he signed with Atlantic Records in February 1994 and that September released Fun, produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers. It was a commercial failure. In June 1996, Atlantic dropped Johnston from the label. alt=an outline cartoon drawing of a smiling frog with eye stalks reminiscent of a snail In 1993, the Sound Exchange record store in Austin, Texas, commissioned Johnston to paint a mural of the Hi, How Are You? frog (also known as \\"Jeremiah the Innocent\\") from the album's cover. After the record store closed in 2003, the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when the Mexican grill franchise Baja Fresh took ownership and decided that they would remove the wall that held the mural. A group of people who lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact. In 2018, the building housed a Thai restaurant called \\"Thai, How Are You\\". Thai How Are You permanently closed in January of 2020. The building remains empty. ===2000s=== In 2004, he released The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered, a two-disc compilation. The first disc featured covers of his songs by artists including Tom Waits, Beck, TV on the Radio, Jad Fair, Eels, Bright Eyes, Calvin Johnson, Death Cab for Cutie, Sparklehorse, Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips and Starlight Mints, with the second disc featuring Johnston's original recordings of the songs. In 2005, Texas-based theater company Infernal Bridegroom Productions received a Multi-Arts Production/MAP Fund grant to work with Johnston to create a rock opera based on his music, titled Speeding Motorcycle. Johnston in 2006 In 2006, Jeff Feuerzeig released a documentary about Johnston, The Devil and Daniel Johnston; the film, four years in the making, collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston (and in some case, others) had produced over the years to portray his life and music. The film won high praise, receiving the Director's Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. The film also inspired more interest in Johnston's work, and increased his prestige as a touring artist. In 2006, Johnston's label, Eternal Yip Eye Music, released his first greatest-hits compilation, Welcome to My World. Through the next few years Johnston toured extensively across the world, and continued to attract press attention. His artwork was shown in galleries such as in London's Aquarium Gallery, New York's Clementine Gallery and at the Liverpool Biennial in 2006 and 2008, and in 2009, his work was exhibited at \\"The Museum of Love\\" at Verge Gallery in Sacramento, California. In 2008, Dick Johnston, Johnston's brother and manager, revealed that \\"a movie deal based on the artist's life and music had been finalized with a tentative 2011 release.\\" He also said that a deal had been struck with the Converse company for a \\"signature series\\" Daniel Johnston shoe. Later, it was revealed by Dick Johnston that Converse had dropped the plan. In early 2008, a Jeremiah the Innocent collectible figurine was released in limited runs of four different colors. Later in the year, Adjustable Productions released Johnston's first concert DVD, The Angel and Daniel Johnston ‚Äì Live at the Union Chapel, featuring a 2007 appearance in Islington, London. Is and Always Was was released on October 6, 2009, on Eternal Yip Eye Music. In 2009, it was announced that Matt Groening had chosen Johnston to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in May 2010, in Minehead, England. Also that year, Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called Hi, How Are You. The game is similar to Frogger, but features Johnston's art and music. Johnston played it during its development and liked it, although he was not familiar with the iPhone. ===2010s=== On March 13, 2012, Johnston released his first comic book, Space Ducks ‚Äì An Infinite Comic Book of Musical Greatness at SXSW, published by BOOM! Studios. The comic book ties-in with the Space Ducks album and an iOS app. Johnston collaborated with skateboarding and clothing company Supreme on numerous collections (consisting of clothing and various accessories) showcasing his artwork. On March 1, 2012, Brooklyn-based photographer Jung Kim announced her photo book and traveling exhibition project with Johnston titled DANIEL JOHNSTON: here, a collaboration that began in 2008 when Kim first met Johnston and began photographing him on the road and at his home in Waller, Texas. On March 13, 2013, this photography book was published, featuring five years of documentation on Johnston. The opening exhibition at SXSW festival featured a special performance by Johnston along with tribute performances led by Jason Sebastian Russo formerly of Mercury Rev. The second exhibition ran in May and June 2013 in London, England, and featured a special performance by Johnston along with tribute performances by the UK band Charlie Boyer and the Voyeurs with Steffan Halperin of the Klaxons. On October 10, 2013, Jason Pierce of Spiritualized hosted the New York City opening of the exhibition, which included special tribute performances led by Pierce and Glen Hansard of The Swell Season and The Frames. In November 2015, Hi, How Are You Daniel Johnston?, a short documentary about Johnston's life, was released featuring Johnston as his 2015 self and Gabriel Sunday of Archie's Final Project as Johnston's 1983 self. The executive producers for the film included Lana Del Rey and Mac Miller. In July 2017, Johnston announced that he would be retiring from live performance and would embark on a final five-date tour that fall. Each stop on the tour featured Johnston backed by a group that had been influenced by his music: The Preservation All-Stars in New Orleans, The Districts and Modern Baseball in Philadelphia, Jeff Tweedy in Chicago, and Built to Spill for the final two dates in Portland and Vancouver. == Death == On September 11, 2019, Johnston was found dead from a suspected heart attack at his home in Waller, Texas, a day after he was released from the hospital for unspecified kidney problems. It is believed that he died overnight. ==Discography== Studio albums == References == ==External links== Official *Hi How Are You: Daniel Johnston's official website *Daniel Johnston's official fan website *Daniel Johnston's digital download site Other * *New York Times article on Daniel Johnston (Feb 2006) *Daniel Johnston on MusicAustin *Secret Tones review of The Devil and Daniel Johnston (by John Barron) *\\"Songs of Pain\\" interview with Daniel Johnston (Apr. 2008) on MonsterFresh.com *Daniel Johnston, Paris, 2007 *Exclusive Images of unreleased Daniel Johnston signature model Converse *Feature on Daniel Johnston in German magazine ZOO, Summer 2005 *\\"Coloring Daniel Johnston\\" (Jan. 2012), a tribute to Daniel Johnston from Spanish bands Category:1961 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American male singers Category:American male guitarists Category:American painters Category:American comic strip cartoonists Category:American comics artists Category:Outsider musicians Category:Album- cover and concert-poster artists Category:Abilene Christian University alumni Category:Kent State University alumni Category:American members of the Churches of Christ Category:People with schizophrenia Category:Musicians from Sacramento, California Category:Musicians from Austin, Texas Category:Homestead Records artists Category:People from New Cumberland, West Virginia Category:Songwriters from West Virginia Category:Singers from West Virginia Category:Shimmy Disc artists Category:American indie rock musicians Category:20th-century American singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:Singers from California Category:Songwriters from California Category:Singers from Texas Category:Songwriters from Texas Category:20th- century American guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:Avant-pop musicians Category:Guitarists from California Category:Guitarists from West Virginia Category:Guitarists from Texas Category:20th-century American pianists Category:Artists with disabilities Category:People with bipolar disorder Category:American male pianists ","title":"Daniel Johnston"},{"id":"299442","text":" USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) is the third and final , nuclear-powered, fast-attack submarine in the United States Navy.

Original schedules called for Jimmy Carter to be commissioned in late 2001 or early 2002. Electric Boat was awarded an $887 million extension to the Jimmy Carter contract on 10 December 1999 to modify the boat for testing new submarine systems and classified missions previously carried out by . During modification, her hull was extended to create a 2,500-ton supplementary middle section which forms a Multi-Mission Platform (MMP). This section is fitted with an ocean interface for divers, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and special operation equipment; ROV handling system, storage, and deployment space for mission systems, and a pressure-resistant passage between the fore and aft parts of the submarine to accommodate the boat's crew.RADM Davis, J.

Jimmy Carter has additional maneuvering devices fitted fore and aft that allow her to keep station over selected targets in odd currents. Intelligence experts speculate that the MMP may find use in missions as an underwater splicing chamber for optical fiber cables. ===Deployments=== On 19 November 2004 Jimmy Carter completed alpha sea trials, her first voyage in the open seas. On 22 December, Electric Boat delivered Jimmy Carter to the US Navy, and she was commissioned 19 February 2005 at NSB New London. Jimmy Carter began a transit from NSB New London to her new homeport at the Bangor Annex of Naval Base Kitsap, Washington on 14 October 2005 but was forced to return when an unusually high wave caused damage while the submarine was running on the surface. The damage was repaired and Jimmy Carter left New London the following day, arriving at Bangor the afternoon of 9 November 2005. In November 2010 Jimmy Carter was revealed as the first US asset to provide intelligence after the North Korean bombardment of Yeonpyeong. Reports indicated that a UAV from the boat was used shortly after the incident. In 2017 Jimmy Carter returned to her homeport at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, flying a Jolly Roger flag, traditionally indicative of a successful mission. ==Awards== *2007 Battle Efficiency Award, commonly known as a \\"Battle E\\". *2012 Battle Efficiency Award. *2013 Presidential Unit Citation ==Gallery== File:Jimmy_Carter_with_model_of_SSN-23.jpgFormer President Carter holding a model of the boat that carries his name.

Throughout, Berman was the only constant band member. During the last few albums, Cassie Berman became a regular member of the band. They disbanded in 2009. ==Background== ===Early years=== Berman was living in Hoboken, New Jersey with two University of Virginia friends, Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich and recording discordant tapes in their living room. Around this time Berman worked as a security guard at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art, which influenced their music. \\"We were working at the Whitney with all this conceptual art, and we were learning about it ‚Ä¶ and so I thought, \\"Well let‚Äôs just make this record that looks like a record, and has song titles and everything, but the songs would be the ones we make at home that sound terrible.\\" said Berman. Although Silver Jews is often called a Pavement side project, it was formed at about the same time as Pavement. Walnut Falcons was tossed around as a potential band name before settling on Silver Jews. Berman has misrepresented the origin of the band's name as coming from the transcription of a billboard that he saw reading \\"Silver Jewelry\\", but he has stated in an interview that the name was actually intended to be a pseudonym for a conceptual art piece and later evolved into the actual band. Others claim, however, that the name pays homage to Silver Apples, The Silver Beatles, and slang for blonde-haired Jews. In an interview with Vish Khanna on the June 12, 2019 episode of Kreative Kontrol, Berman stated, \\"Silver Jews was a very burdensome band name. It confused people: I never made it clear what I meant by it. It wasn‚Äôt until the end until I realized what a proper definition of Silver Jew would be outside of the context of my music, which would be a Jew that was Jewish down through patrilineal descent, which would be a Jew that‚Äôs not a Jew, really. It‚Äôs the outsiders to the outsiders.\\" ===Touring=== Silver Jews performing at Webster Hall in 2006 Though Berman had pointedly avoided playing live throughout much of the band's existence, then Silver Jews surprised fans by embarking on their first-ever tour following the release of Tanglewood Numbers in 2005. They toured North America, Europe, and Israel in 2006. A documentary, titled Silver Jew, was filmed during the band's time in Israel. ===Break up=== On January 22, 2009, Berman announced via the official Drag City messageboard that he planned to retire from music and that the Silver Jews would play their final show on Bluegrass Underground at Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville, Tennessee at 3 pm on January 31, 2009. The caverns are located 333 feet underground, and only 300 general admission tickets were made available. Berman stated that he would play his 15 favorite Silver Jews songs. He also wrote that his intentions are to move to \\"screenwriting or muckraking\\". He closed the entry by saying, \\"I always said we would stop before we got bad. If I continue to record I might accidentally write the answer song to 'Shiny Happy People'.\\" Berman originally planned for the concert to be recorded and aired sometime in February 2009 on Nashville's famed WSM AM radio station; however, the day before the show, Berman posted on the Drag City message board to say that he had \\"negotiated out of the WSM part out of the deal.\\" The concert was documented by several 16 mm film cameras, and Berman has hinted at a possible DVD release of the show at some point in the future. The last song that the Silver Jews performed live was \\"Smith and Jones Forever\\". ===Post-breakup releases=== On June 19, 2012, Early Times was released by Drag City. Early Times is a compilation of EPs and singles that were released before the debut LP Starlite Walker. ===Post Silver Jews projects=== Brian Kotzur (drummer) is the frontman/drummer for Tim Chad and Sherry and also plays drums for Super Bowl Rocket Ship. William Tyler plays guitar for Tim Chad and Sherry. ===Possible reunion=== In 2015, Bob Nastanovich posted a photo to his Facebook page featuring the band rehearsing. He said that the band is working on two new songs, \\"The Veranda Over The Toy Shoppe\\", and \\"Wacky Package Eyes\\". David Berman later said the photo was a prank. Berman instead returned with new project Purple Mountains in July 2019, but died the following month. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Starlite Walker (1994) * The Natural Bridge (1996) * American Water (1998) * Bright Flight (2001) * Tanglewood Numbers (2005) * Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea (2008) ===EPs=== * Dime Map of the Reef (1992) * The Arizona Record (1993) * Tennessee (2001) ===Singles=== * \\"Dime Map of the Reef\\" (1992) * \\"Silver Jews and Nico\\" (1993) * \\"Blue Arrangements\\" (1998) * \\"Send in the Clouds\\" (1998) * \\"Self Ignition\\" (1998) * \\"Hot as Hell\\" (1999) ===Compilations=== * Early Times (2012) ==Filmography== * Silver Jew (2007) ==References== Category:Alternative rock groups from New York (state) Category:Drag City (record label) artists Category:Indie rock musical groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups established in 1989 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2009 Category:Musical groups from New York City ","title":"Silver Jews"},{"id":"299472","text":"A Caenorhabditis elegans is stained to highlight the nuclei of its cells. Multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to unicellular organisms. All species of animals, land plants and most fungi are multicellular, as are many algae, whereas a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular, like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus Dictyostelium. Multicellular organisms arise in various ways, for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells. Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, because the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed \\"pluricellular\\" rather than \\"multicellular\\". ==Evolutionary history== ===Occurrence=== Multicellularity has evolved independently at least 25 times in eukaryotes, and also in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and land plants.http://public.wsu.edu/~lange-m/Documnets/Teaching2011/Popper2011.pdf It evolved repeatedly for Chloroplastida (green algae and land plants), once or twice for animals, once for brown algae, three times in the fungi (chytrids, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and perhaps several times for slime molds and red algae. The first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3‚Äì3.5 billion years ago. To reproduce, true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells (i.e., sperm and egg cells), an issue that is studied in evolutionary developmental biology. Animals have evolved a considerable diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100‚Äì150 different cell types), compared with 10‚Äì20 in plants and fungi.Margulis, L. & Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116. ===Loss of multicellularity=== Loss of multicellularity occurred in some groups.Seravin L. N. (2001) The principle of counter-directional morphological evolution and its significance for constructing the megasystem of protists and other eukaryotes. Protistology 2: 6‚Äì14, . Fungi are predominantly multicellular, though early diverging lineages are largely unicellular (e.g., Microsporidia) and there have been numerous reversions to unicellularity across fungi (e.g., Saccharomycotina, Cryptococcus, and other yeasts).Parfrey, L.W. & Lahr, D.J.G. (2013), p. 344. It may also have occurred in some red algae (e.g., Porphyridium), but it is possible that they are primitively unicellular.Seckbach, Joseph, Chapman, David J. [eds.]. (2010). Red algae in the genomic age. New York, NY, U.S.A.: Springer, p. 252, . Loss of multicellularity is also considered probable in some green algae (e.g., Chlorella vulgaris and some Ulvophyceae).Richter, Daniel Joseph: The gene content of diverse choanoflagellates illuminates animal origins, 2013. In other groups, generally parasites, a reduction of multicellularity occurred, in number or types of cells (e.g., the myxozoans, multicellular organisms, earlier thought to be unicellular, are probably extremely reduced cnidarians). ===Cancer=== Multicellular organisms, especially long-living animals, face the challenge of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development. Changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process. Cancer in animals (metazoans) has often been described as a loss of multicellularity. There is a discussion about the possibility of existence of cancer in other multicellular organismsRichter, D. J. (2013), p. 11. or even in protozoa.Lauckner, G. (1980). Diseases of protozoa. In: Diseases of Marine Animals. Kinne, O. (ed.). Vol. 1, p. 84, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK. For example, plant galls have been characterized as tumors, but some authors argue that plants do not develop cancer. ===Separation of somatic and germ cells=== In some multicellular groups, which are called Weismannists, a separation between a sterile somatic cell line and a germ cell line evolved. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., vertebrates, arthropods, Volvox), as a great part of species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g., land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 295-297.Niklas, K. J. (2014) The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity. ==Origin hypotheses== Tetrabaena socialis consists of four cells. One hypothesis for the origin of multicellularity is that a group of function-specific cells aggregated into a slug-like mass called a grex, which moved as a multicellular unit. This is essentially what slime molds do. Another hypothesis is that a primitive cell underwent nucleus division, thereby becoming a coenocyte. A membrane would then form around each nucleus (and the cellular space and organelles occupied in the space), thereby resulting in a group of connected cells in one organism (this mechanism is observable in Drosophila). A third hypothesis is that as a unicellular organism divided, the daughter cells failed to separate, resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism, which could later develop specialized tissues. This is what plant and animal embryos do as well as colonial choanoflagellates.In a Single-Cell Predator, Clues to the Animal Kingdom‚Äôs Birth Because the first multicellular organisms were simple, soft organisms lacking bone, shell or other hard body parts, they are not well preserved in the fossil record.A H Knoll, 2003. Life on a Young Planet. Princeton University Press. (hardcover), (paperback). An excellent book on the early history of life, very accessible to the non- specialist; includes extensive discussions of early signatures, fossilization, and organization of life. One exception may be the demosponge, which may have left a chemical signature in ancient rocks. The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested Grypania spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon (Gabonionta). The Doushantuo Formation has yielded 600 million year old microfossils with evidence of multicellular traits. Until recently, phylogenetic reconstruction has been through anatomical (particularly embryological) similarities. This is inexact, as living multicellular organisms such as animals and plants are more than 500 million years removed from their single-cell ancestors. Such a passage of time allows both divergent and convergent evolution time to mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups of modern and extinct ancestral species. Modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such as alloenzymes, satellite DNA and other molecular markers to describe traits that are shared between distantly related lineages. The evolution of multicellularity could have occurred in a number of different ways, some of which are described below: ===The symbiotic theory=== This theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms, each with different roles. Over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other they would not be able to survive independently, eventually leading to the incorporation of their genomes into one multicellular organism. Each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species. This kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently, such as in the relationship between clown fish and Riterri sea anemones. In these cases, it is extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long if the other became extinct. However, the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism's DNA could be incorporated into one single genome to constitute them as a single species. Although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts in animal and plant cells‚Äîendosymbiosis), it has happened only extremely rarely and, even then, the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction, separately replicating their DNA during mitosis of the host species. For instance, the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite lichen, although dependent on each other for survival, have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more. ===The cellularization (syncytial) theory=== This theory states that a single unicellular organism, with multiple nuclei, could have developed internal membrane partitions around each of its nuclei. Many protists such as the ciliates or slime molds can have several nuclei, lending support to this hypothesis. However, the simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory. Multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions. The macronucleus serves the organism's needs, whereas the micronucleus is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium. ===The colonial theory=== The Colonial Theory of Haeckel, 1874, proposes that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the symbiotic theory, which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. At least some, it is presumed land-evolved, multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g., cellular slime molds) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those that evolved within aquatic environments), multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division. The mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete cytokinesis, though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve cellular differentiation. 650px The advantage of the Colonial Theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently in 16 different protoctistan phyla. For instance, during food shortages the amoeba Dictyostelium groups together in a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other. Other examples of colonial organisation in protista are Volvocaceae, such as Eudorina and Volvox, the latter of which consists of up to 500‚Äì50,000 cells (depending on the species), only a fraction of which reproduce.AlgaeBase. Volvox Linnaeus, 1758: 820. For example, in one species 25‚Äì35 cells reproduce, 8 asexually and around 15‚Äì25 sexually. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, as the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed \\"pluricellular\\" rather than \\"multicellular\\". ===The Synzoospore theory=== Some authors suggest that the origin of multicellularity, at least in Metazoa, occurred due to a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation, rather than through a gradual evolution of cell differentiation, as affirmed in Haeckel‚Äôs Gastraea theory.Mikhailov K. V., Konstantinova A. V., Nikitin M. A., Troshin P. V., Rusin L., Lyubetsky V., Panchin Y., Mylnikov A. P., Moroz L. L., Kumar S. & Aleoshin V. V. (2009). The origin of Metazoa: a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation. Bioessays, 31(7), 758‚Äì768, . ===GK-PID=== About 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called guanylate kinase protein-interaction domain (GK-PID) may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells. ===The role of viruses=== Genes borrowed from viruses and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have recently been identified as playing a crucial role in the differentiation of multicellular tissues and organs and even in sexual reproduction, in the fusion of egg cell and sperm.Rafi Letzter: An Ancient Virus May Be Responsible for Human Consciousness, in: Live Science, February 02, 2018 Such fused cells are also involved in metazoan membranes such as those that prevent chemicals crossing the placenta and the brain body separation.Eugene V. Koonin: Viruses and mobile elements as drivers of evolutionary transitions. In: Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci., 2016 Aug 19, doi:10.1098/rstb.2015.0442 Two viral components have been identified. The first is syncytin, which came from a virus.Mi S1, Lee X, Li X, Veldman GM, Finnerty H, Racie L, LaVallie E, Tang XY, Edouard P, Howes S, Keith JC Jr, McCoy JM.: Syncytin is a captive retroviral envelope protein involved in human placental morphogenesis. In: Nature. 2000 Feb 17;403(6771):785-789. doi:10.1038/35001608, The second identified in 2007 is called EFF1, which helps form the skin of Caenorhabditis elegans, part of a whole family of FF proteins. Felix Rey, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris has constructed the 3D structure of the EFF1 proteinJamin, M, H Raveh-Barak, B Podbilewicz, FA Rey et al. (2014) \\"Structural basis of eukaryotic cell-cell fusion\\" (Cell, Volume 157, Issue 2, 10 April 2014), Pages 407‚Äì419, doi:10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.020 and shown it does the work of linking one cell to another, in viral infections. The fact that all known cell fusion molecules are viral in origin suggests that they have been vitally important to the inter-cellular communication systems that enabled multicellularity. Without the ability of cellular fusion, colonies could have formed, but anything even as complex as a sponge would not have been possible.Slezak, Michael (2016), \\"No Viruses? No skin or bones either\\" (New Scientist, No. 2958, 1 March 2014) p.16 === The Oxygen Availability Hypothesis === This theory suggests that the oxygen available in the atmosphere of early Earth could have been the limiting factor for the emergence of multicellular life. This hypothesis is based on the correlation between the emergence of multicellular life and the increase of oxygen levels during this time. This would have taken place after the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) but before the most recent rise in oxygen. Mills concludes that the amount of oxygen present during the Ediacaran is not necessary for complex life and therefore is unlikely to have been the driving factor for the origin of multicellularity. === Snowball Earth Hypothesis === A snowball Earth is a geological event where the entire surface of the Earth is covered in snow and ice. The most recent snowball Earth took place during the Cryogenian period and consisted of two global glaciation events known as the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. Xiao suggests that between the period of time known as the \\"Boring Billion\\" and the Snowball Earth, simple life could have had time to innovate and evolve which could later lead to the evolution of multicellularity. The snowball Earth hypothesis in regards to multicellularity proposes that the Cyrogenian period in Earth history could have been the catalyst for the evolution of complex multicellular life. Brocks suggests that the time between the Sturtian Glacian and the more recent Marinoan Glacian allowed for planktonic algae to dominate the seas making way for rapid diversity of life for both plant and animal lineages. Shortly after the Marinoan, complex life quickly emerged and diversified in what is known as the Cambrian Explosion. === Predation Hypothesis === The Predation Hypothesis suggests that in order to avoid being eaten by predators, simple single-celled organisms evolved multicellularity to make it harder to be consumed as prey. Herron et al performed laboratory evolution experiments on the single-celled green alga, C. reinhardtii, using paramecium as a predator. They found that in the presence of this predator, C. reinhardtii does indeed evolve simple multicellular features. ==Advantages== Multicellularity allows an organism to exceed the size limits normally imposed by diffusion: single cells with increased size have a decreased surface-to- volume ratio and have difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the cell. Multicellular organisms thus have the competitive advantages of an increase in size without its limitations. They can have longer lifespans as they can continue living when individual cells die. Multicellularity also permits increasing complexity by allowing differentiation of cell types within one organism. Whether these can be seen as advantages however is debatable. The vast majority of living organisms are single cellular, and even in terms of biomass, single cellular organisms are far more successful than animals, though not plants. Rather than seeing traits such as longer lifespans and greater size as an advantage, many biologists see these only as examples of diversity, with associated tradeoffs. ==See also== * Bacterial colony * Embryogenesis * Fauna Europaea * Organogenesis * Unicellular Organisms ==References== ==External links== * Tree of Life Eukaryotes Category:Developmental biology Category:Evolutionary biology Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Multicellular organism"},{"id":"299475","text":"Lance Bangs (born September 8, 1972)\\"Lance Bangs: Born 8 September 1972\\"BBC.

The group consists of frontman Daniel Smith and a number of various artists with whom he collaborates. Smith has also released solo work as Brother Danielson. When joined by his family the band is known as Danielson Famile or Danielson Family, whose members have included Smith; his \\"siblings Andrew, David, Megan, and Rachel; wife Elin; friends Christiaan & Melissa Palladino; [and] daughters Lilly and Ida\\". Sufjan Stevens has also recorded and performed with the group. The band is known for Smith's squeaky, falsetto vocals, innovative musical arrangements, and matching uniforms \\"that act, according to Daniel, as 'visual reminders of the spiritual and emotional healing taking place' within audience members.\\" During some performances Smith has \\"worn a nine-foot tall, hand-made nine-fruit tree to 'bear the good fruit,'\\" in reference to the fruit of the Holy Spirit. ==History== In 1993, while attending Rutgers University as a senior, Daniel Smith experienced a spiritual reawakening: > \\"This was the year I stopped running away from home, picked up my acoustic > guitar again and changed from being Dan back to Daniel. I woke up to the > fact that I have an amazing family, an amazing childhood and I began to > relate everything I was thinking and doing with this in mind... I began > reading the Bible and praying again and songs and art started flowing. I > would meet with my dad and talk philosophy and theology and I became a child > again.\\" Smith has cited the major influence his musician father had on him growing up and the importance of lyrical content. Smith began recording songs that would later compose the album A Prayer for Every Hour: \\"some from my solo 4-track, some with my friends Jason Faunce and Missy Forsyth backing and some with my brothers and sisters backing. Danielson became the name of the songs that I write. I had become \\"Daniel\\" and realized that I am a son.\\" He submitted the album as his final thesis (and received an 'A' grade) and performed, joined by his siblings, at the senior art show. Smith then sent the album out to several indie labels but only received a response from Tooth & Nail in California, who picked up the album and released it in 1994. Daniel Smith, his siblings, and friend Chris Palladino began to perform in New York City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia as the \\"Danielson Famile.\\" The group released Tri-Danielson!!! (Alpha) and Tri-Danielson!!! (Omega) in 1998 and 1999 respectively, earning them further college radio play and broadening their indie audience. Both LP's were recorded and produced by Kramer. The band became known for their onstage costumes (initially nurse uniforms with large red hearts sewn on) as well as their homemade T-shirts and other merchandise. While the lyrical content was unabashedly Christian, Danielson Famile nevertheless received strong press and support from secular audiences due to their musical inventiveness. Danielson signed to Secretly Canadian Records in 2001 and released Fetch the Compass Kids, which was recorded by Steve Albini. Smith then released a solo record in 2004 (Brother Is to Son) as Brother Danielson. It was followed in May 2006 by the ambitious Ships, which featured contributions from a total of 20 musicians, including Deerhoof, Sufjan Stevens, Why?, Serena Maneesh, and Half- handed Cloud. The band was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England. In 2011, Smith released Best of Gloucester County, the first Danielson album released solely through his Sounds Familyre Records label. In June 2014, Danielson and Jad Fair (of Half Japanese) released a collaborative album \\"Solid Gold Heart\\". The album came about as part of Jad Fair's Artist In Residence project with Indianapolis label Joyful Noise Recordings. Daniel Smith has cited his musical influences as including \\"T.Rex, Rapeman, B.A.L.L., Syd Barrett, Bob Dylan, Bongwater, My Bloody Valentine, Beat Happening, Cypress Hill, Ween, Donovan, Sonic Youth, Royal Trux, Beatles, Half Japanese, A Tribe Called Quest, [David] Bowie, Can, Pixies, Minutemen, James Brown, Tom Waits, Daniel Johnston, Brian Eno, Larry Norman, Captain Beefheart and more.\\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * A Prayer for Every Hour, Danielson, Independent, 1994 * Tell Another Joke at the Ol' Choppin' Block, Danielson Famile, Tooth and Nail, 1997 * Tri-Danielson!!!

Tax deductions are a form of tax incentives, along with exemptions and credits. The difference between deductions, exemptions and credits is that deductions and exemptions both reduce taxable income, while credits reduce tax. ==Above and below the line== Above and below the line refers items above or below adjusted gross income, which is item 37 on the tax year 2017 1040 tax form. Tax deductions above the line lessen adjusted gross income, while deductions below the line can only lessen taxable income if the aggregate of those deductions exceeds the standard deduction, which in tax year 2018 in the U.S., for example, was $12,000 for a single taxpayer and $24,000 for married couple.Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1 ==Limitations== Often, deductions are subject to conditions, such as being allowed only for expenses incurred that produce current benefits. Capitalization of items producing future benefit can be required, though with some exceptions. A deduction is allowed, for example, on interest paid on student loans. Some systems allow taxpayer deductions for items the influential parties want to encourage as purchases. ==Business expenses== Nearly all jurisdictions that tax business income allow deductions for business and trade expenses. Allowances vary and may be general or restricted. To be deducted, the expenses must be incurred in furthering business, and usually only include activities undertaken for profit. ===Cost of goods sold=== Nearly all income tax systems allow a deduction for the cost of goods sold. This may be considered an expense, a reduction of gross income,PRATHAM MANGAT system computes taxable income by subtracting deductions from gross income. Gross income, under 26 USC 61 is defined as gains from the sale of property plus other income. Gains, in turn, are defined in 26 USC 1001 as the amount realized less the adjusted basis of property sold. or merely a component utilized in computing net profits.The UK system computes income chargeable to tax as net business profits, plus other income, with adjustments. In such systems, the locally recognized generally accepted accounting principles apply. See, e.g., IAS 2, Inventories. The manner in which cost of goods sold is determined has several inherent complexities, including various accounting methods. These include: *Conventions for assigning costs to particular goods sold where specific identification is infeasible.Examples of alternatives to specific identification include first- in-first-out (FIFO), average cost, and last-in-first-out (LIFO). Many EU countries do not permit LIFO. *Methods for attributing common costs, such as factory burden, to particular goods.Among the methods commonly used are: i) factory burden rate, in which overhead costs are assigned to goods produced based on labor hours or labor dollars; ii) standard costs, in which a cost including overheads is periodically determined for each type of goods and inventory and cost of goods sold are adjusted periodically for variances of actual costs from such standards; and iii) activity based costing, in which costs are assigned based on factors which drive the incurrence of such costs. Numerous variations on these are available in many systems. *Methods for determining when costs are recognized in computing cost of goods sold or to be sold.Generally, determinations depend upon the overall method of accounting or overarching principles of local GAAP. These include the cash receipts and disbursements method, accrual methods, and deferred cost methods. Under these principles there may be a need to determine when amounts are properly treated as incurred. *Methods for recognizing costs of goods that will not be sold or have declined in value.GAAP often requires that the decline in value of unsold goods be charged to income when the decline occurs. This is often accomplished through a lower of cost or market value inventory accounting method, or inventory reserves. Some systems provide for differences in these determinations for financial reporting and tax purposes. ===Trading or ordinary and necessary business expenses=== Many systems, including the United Kingdom, levy tax on all chargeable ‚Äúprofits of a trade‚Äù computed under local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).[ UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988 (ICTA) section ]. The HMRC Business Income Manual at BIM 31001 states that \\"the starting point is accounts prepared in accordance with ordinary principles of commercial accountancy, and the commercial profits are then adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Taxes Acts.\\" Under this approach, determination of whether an item is deductible depends upon accounting rules and judgments. By contrast, the U.S. allows as a deduction \\"all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business...\\"26 USC 162(a). subject to qualifications, enhancements, and limitations.Johnston, Kevin. \\"A List of Deductible Business Expenses for Schedule C.\\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/list-deductible-business-expenses- schedule-c-21156.html. 29 June 2018. A similar approach is followed by Canada, but generally with fewer special rules. Such an approach poses significant definitional issues. Among the definitional issues often addressed are: *What constitutes a trade or business? Generally, the business must be regular, continuous, substantial, and entered into with an expectation of profit.In this regard, the United States Tax Court has issued well in excess of one thousand rulings. Among the factors considered are: a) whether the transactions are regular and continuous (discussed, e.g., prior to the income tax in Lewellyn v. Pittsburgh, B. & L. E. R. Co., 222 Fed. 177 (CA3, 1915), a case cited by the Tax Court), (b) whether the purported business is substantial (see, e.g., ), (c) whether the transactions were profit motivated (see, e.g., Doggett v. Burnet, (1933) , 65 F2d 191; also see hobby loss rules at 26 USC 183).UK Business Income Manual 20200 describes various badges of trade. *What expenses are ordinary and necessary? The phrase deals with what expenses are appropriate to the nature of the business, whether the expenses are of the sort expected to help produce income and promote the business, and whether the expenses are not lavish and extravagant. Note that under this concept, the same sorts of expenses are generally deductible by business entities and individuals carrying on a trade or business. To the extent such expenses relate to the employment of an individual and are not reimbursed by the employer, the amount may be deductible by the individual.See IRS Form 2106. Business deductions of flow-through entities may flow through as a component of the entity's net income in some jurisdictions. Deductions of flow-through entities may pass through to members of such entities separately from the net income of the entity in some jurisdictions or some cases. For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all deductions of partnerships (and S corporations in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or S corporation shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.26 USC 704(b) and 26 USC 170. ===Accounting methods=== One important aspect of determining tax deductions for business expenses is the timing of such deduction. The method used for this is commonly referred to as an accounting method. Accounting methods for tax purposes may differ from applicable GAAP. Examples include timing of recognition of cost recovery deductions (e.g., depreciation), current expensing of otherwise capitalizable costs of intangibles,26 USC 174. and rules related to costs that should be treated as part of cost of goods not yet sold.26 USC 263A. Further, taxpayers often have choices among multiple accounting methods permissible under GAAP and/or tax rules. Examples include conventions for determining which goods have been sold (such as first-in-first-out, average cost, etc.), whether or not to defer minor expenses producing benefit in the immediately succeeding period, etc. Accounting methods may be defined with some precision by tax law, as in the U.S. system, or may be based on GAAP, as in the UK system. ===Limits on deductions=== Many systems limit particular deductions, even where the expenses directly relate to the business. Such limitations may, by way of example, include: *Maximum deductions for use of automobilesUK: [ ICTA __], [ ]. U.S.: 26 USC 280F. *Limits on deducting compensation of certain key employeesU.S.: 26 USC 162(m). *Limits on lobbying or similar expendituresU.S.: 26 USC 162(e). *Nondeductibility of payments considered in violation of public policy, such as criminal finesU.S.: 26 USC 162(f). *Limits on deductions for business-related entertainment.U.S.: 26 USC 274(n). In addition, deductions in excess of income in one endeavor may not be allowed to offset income from other endeavors. For example, the United States limits deductions related to passive activities to income from passive activities.26 USC 469. Income from passive activities includes not only operating income but also gains from disposition of the activity or assets used in the activity. See IRS Publication 925. In particular, expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include: * The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges; * The cost of storing products the business sells; * Direct labor costs for workers who produce the products; and * Factory overhead expenses. In 2005, the Australian government amended its taxation legislation to remove deductions for expenses incurred in conducting criminal business activities. This came after the Federal Court ruled in Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa that a heroin dealer was entitled to a tax deduction for money stolen from him in a drug deal. ==Capitalized items and cost recovery (depreciation)== Many systems require that the cost of items likely to produce future benefits be capitalized.See, e.g., 26 USC 263; International Financial Reporting Standards ([IFRS]), particularly IAS 16, applicable in most EU jurisdictions for determining business profits as the starting point for taxable income. Examples include plant and equipment, fees related to acquisition o of developing intangible assets (e.g., patentable inventions). Such systems often allow a tax deduction for cost recovery in a future period. A common approach to such cost recovery is to allow a deduction for a portion of the cost ratably over some period of years. The U.S. system refers to such a cost recovery deduction as depreciation for costs of tangible assetsU.S.: 26 USC 168, which prescribes depreciable lives by broad class; and as amortization for costs of intangible assets. Depreciation in these systems is allowed over an estimated useful life, which may be assigned by the government for numerous classes of assets, based on the nature and use of the asset and the nature of the business.For lives by class of assets, see: U.S. see Rev. Proc. 87-56, as updated, reproduced in IRS Publication 946; Canada Income Tax Regulations section 1100 et seq. The annual depreciation deduction may be computed on a straight line, declining balance, or other basis, as permitted in each country's rules.The U.S. permits declining balance switching to straight line in a particular year, by life of asset class. See Rev. Proc. 87-57, reproduced in IRS Publication 946 for percentages that may be used at the option of the taxpayer. Many systems allow amortization of the cost of intangible assets only on a straight-line basis, generally computed monthly over the actual expected life or a government specified life.For international government specified lives by class of intangible asset, see the table in Tax amortization lives of intangible assets Alternative approaches are used by some systems. Some systems allow a fixed percentage or dollar amount of cost recovery in particular years, often called ‚Äúcapital allowances.‚ÄùUK: ICTA , ___; Canada: [ Income Tax Act section 20.(1(a))], which provides for deduction as provided in regulations; see [ Income Tax Regulations Part XI, sections 1100 et seq], Capital Allowances. This may be determined by reference to the type of asset or business.Canadian rules cited above specify more than 30 classes for which specific percentages are allowed. Some systems allow specific charges for cost recovery for some assets upon certain identifiable events.For example, Germany allows a deduction for ‚Äúdepreciation‚Äù for assets that have come to be worth significantly less than their unrecovered cost due to identifiable events. English language . Capitalization may be required for some items without the potential for cost recovery until disposition or abandonment of the asset to which the capitalized costs relate. This is often the case for costs related to the formation or reorganization of a corporation, or certain expenses in corporate acquisitions.See INDOPCO v. Commissioner. However, some systems provide for amortization of certain such costs, at the election of the taxpayer.26 USC 248 for corporations, 26 USC 709 for partnerships. ==Non-business expenses== Some systems distinguish between an active trade or business and the holding of assets to produce income.26 USC 212; UK [ ICTA ]. In such systems, there may be additional limitations on the timing and nature of amounts that may be claimed as tax deductions. Many of the rules, including accounting methods and limits on deductions, that apply to business expenses also apply to income producing expenses. ===Losses=== Many systems allow a deduction for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets. This deduction may be limited to gains from the same class of assets. In the U.S., a loss on non- business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains. Also, in the U.S. a loss on the sale of the taxpayer's principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft. ===Personal deductions=== Many jurisdictions allow certain classes of taxpayers to reduce taxable income for certain inherently personal items. A common such deduction is a fixed allowance for the taxpayer and certain family members or other persons supported by the taxpayer. The U.S. allows such a deduction for ‚Äúpersonal exemptions‚Äù for the taxpayer and certain members of the taxpayer's household.26 USC 151, 152. The amount is adjusted annually for inflation, and was $3,650 for 2009. The UK grants a ‚Äúpersonal allowance.‚ÄùFor 2009, the amount was ¬£6,475, with additional allowances for married couples over age 75. Both U.S. and UK allowances are phased out for individuals or married couples with income in excess of specified levels. In addition, many jurisdictions allow reduction of taxable income for certain categories of expenses not incurred in connection with a business or investments. In the U.S. system, these (as well as certain business or investment expenses) are referred to as ‚Äúitemized deductions‚Äù for individuals. The UK allows a few of these as personal reliefs. These include, for example, the following for U.S. residents (and UK residents as noted): *Medical expenses (in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income)26 USC 213. *State and local income and property taxes26 USC 164(a)(2). Individuals may elect for a tax year after 2003 to claim a deduction for state and local sales taxes in lieu of the deduction for state and local income taxes. *Interest expense on certain home loans26 USC 163 subsection (h) of which limits the deduction of personal interest. *Gifts of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations, subject to certain maximum limitations,26 USC 170 Qualifying organizations generally include organizations that are tax exempt under 26 USC 503(c)(charitable organizations) or (d) (religious orders), as well as certain other organizations. Generally, the deduction is limited to 50% of gross income. This limitation is reduced in certain circumstances. Amounts in excess of the limitation may be deducted in future years, also subject to limitations. *Losses on non-income-producing property due to casualty or theft,26 USC 165. *Contribution to certain retirement or health savings plans (U.S. and UK),26 USC 219, which provides deductions for contributions to ‚Äú401(k)‚Äù and ‚ÄúIRA‚Äù plans, among others, and 26 USC 223, which provides deductions for contributions to ‚Äúhealth savings accounts‚Äù that are used to pay for medical expenses. *Certain educational expenses.26 USC 221 and 222. Many systems provide that an individual may claim a tax deduction for personal payments that, upon payment, become taxable to another person, such as alimony.See, e.g., 26 USC 215. Such systems generally require, at a minimum, reporting of such amounts,See, e.g., Form IRS Form 1040, line 31b. and may require that withholding tax be applied to the payment. ==Groups of taxpayers== Some systems allow a deduction to a company or other entity for expenses or losses of another company or entity if the two companies or entities are commonly controlled. Such deduction may be referred to as ‚Äúgroup relief.‚ÄùUK [S380 ICTA et seq ] Generally, such deductions function in lieu of consolidated or combined computation of tax (tax consolidation) for such groups. Group relief may be available for companies in EU member countries with respect to losses of group companies in other countries.See, e.g., UK draft guidance following the Marks & Spencer case. ==International aspects== Many systems impose limitations on tax deductions paid to foreign parties, especially related parties. See International tax and Transfer pricing. ==References== ==Further reading== *Crowningshield, Gerald, and Gorman, Kenneth: Cost Accounting, *Horngren, Charles T., et al.: Cost Accounting, *Hoffman, William, et al.: Individual Income Taxes (annual editions; 2011 edition ) *Pratt, James, and Kulsrud, William: 2010 Federal Taxation, *Whittenberg, Gerald, and Altus- Buller, Martha: Income Tax Fundamentals, *Schneider, Leslie: Federal Income Taxation of Inventories *Weltman, Barbara: J.K.Lasser's 1001 Deductions ‚Ä¶, ==External links== Australia: Australian Taxation Office: *Main site Canada: *Laws *Canada Revenue Agency: **Main site **Deductions index United Kingdom: HM Revenue and Customs: *Main site *HMRC manuals **Business Income Manual (BIM) United States: Internal Revenue Service: *Main site *Some relevant publications: **334 Business expenses: Tax Guide for Small Business **463 Travel and entertainment deductions **501 Exemptions and standard deduction **529 Miscellaneous deductions **565 Business Expenses **936 Home mortgage interest **946 Depreciation *A few relevant forms (also see related instructions) **Form 1040 (individual tax return), Schedules C (business) and E (rental) **Form 1065 (partnership return of income), page 1, and Schedule K **Form 1120 (corporation tax return), page 1 **Form 2106 (employee business expenses) **Form 4562 (depreciation and amortization) **Form 4797 (gain or loss on business assets) **Form 8825 (rental realty income) India: *Official page of Indian Income-tax e-Filing portal Category:Tax terms ","title":"Tax deduction"},{"id":"299489","text":"Charles de Batz de Castelmore (), also known as d'Artagnan and later Count d'Artagnan ( 1611 ‚Äì 25 June 1673), was a French Musketeer who served Louis XIV as captain of the Musketeers of the Guard. He died at the Siege of Maastricht in the Franco-Dutch War. A fictionalized account of his life by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras formed the basis for the d'Artagnan Romances of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, most famously including The Three Musketeers (1844). The heavily fictionalized version of d'Artagnan featured in Dumas' works and their subsequent screen adaptations is now far more widely known than the real historical figure. == Early life == Chateau de Castelmore D'Artagnan was born at the castle of Castelmore near Lupiac in south-western France. His father, Bertrand de Batz lord of Castelmore, was the son of a newly ennobled merchant, Arnaud de Batz, who purchased the castle of Castelmore. Charles de Batz went to Paris in the 1630s, using the name of his mother Fran√ßoise de Montesquiou d'Artagnan. D'Artagnan found a way to enter into the Musketeers in 1632 through the support of his uncle, Henri de Montesquiou d'Artagnan or perhaps thanks to the influence of Henri's friend, Monsieur de Tr√©ville (Jean-Armand du Peyrer, Comte de Troisville). D‚ÄôArtagnan joined the guards in the mid-1630s and served under Captain des Essarts. The regiment saw much action in the early 1640s, taking part in sieges at Arras, Aire-sur-la-Lys, la Bass√©e and Bapaume in 1640‚Äì41 and Collioure and Perpignan in 1642. Whether or not d‚ÄôArtagnan was personally involved is unclear, but it is likely he took part in some, if not all, of these sieges. While in the Musketeers, d'Artagnan sought the protection of the influential Cardinal Mazarin, France's principal minister since 1643. In 1646, the Musketeers company was dissolved, but d'Artagnan continued to serve his protector Mazarin. == Career == Statue of d'Artagnan in Maastricht D'Artagnan had a career in espionage for Cardinal Mazarin, in the years after the first Fronde. Due to d'Artagnan's faithful service during this period, Louis XIV entrusted him with many secret and delicate situations that required complete discretion. He followed Mazarin during his exile in 1651 in the face of the hostility of the aristocracy. In 1652 d'Artagnan was promoted to lieutenant in the Gardes Fran√ßaises, and fought at the Battle of Stenay in 1654, as well as in sieges at Landrecies and Saint-Ghislaine, then to captain in 1655. In 1658, he became a second lieutenant in the newly reformed Musketeers. This was a promotion, as the Musketeers were far more prestigious than the Gardes-Fran√ßaises. D'Artagnan was famous for his connection with the arrest of Nicolas Fouquet. Fouquet was Louis XIV's finance commissioner and aspired to take the place of Mazarin as the king's advisor. Fouquet was also a lover of grand architecture and employed the greatest architects and artisans in the building of his Chateau Vaux-le-Vicomte. He celebrated the completion with a most extravagant feast, at which every guest was given a horse. The king however felt upstaged by the grandeur of the home and event and, suspecting that such magnificence could only be explained through Fouquet's pilfering the royal treasury, three weeks later had d'Artagnan arrest Fouquet. To prevent his escape by bribery, d'Artagnan was assigned to guard him for four years until Fouquet was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1667, d'Artagnan was promoted to captain- lieutenant of the Musketeers, the effective commander as the nominal captain was the king. As befitted his rank and position, he could be identified by his striking burgundy, white, and black livery‚Äîthe colours of the commanding officer of the Musketeers. Another of d'Artagnan's assignments was the governorship of Lille, which was won in battle by France in 1667. D'Artagnan was an unpopular governor and longed to return to battle. He found his chance when Louis XIV went to war with the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War. After being recalled to service, d'Artagnan was subsequently killed in battle on 25 June 1673, when a musket ball tore into his throat at the Siege of Maastricht. The French historian Odile Bordaz believes that he was buried in Saint Peter and Paul Church in Wolder, the Netherlands. In contrast, the archaeologist Wim Dijkman, curator of Maastricht, of which Wolder is a district, says that there is no historical or archeological evidence of the claim.Le Monde Culture du 20 11 2008. == Marriage and descent == D'Artagnan married on March 5, 1659, Anne-Charlotte Boyer de Chanlecy lady of Sainte- Croix, born in 1624 (daughter of Charles Boyer, lord of Chanlecy and Sainte- Croix and of Claude de Rymon, lady of la Rochette) widow of Jean-Elenor de Damas. But quickly the couple did not live together anymore. D'Artagnan preferred the battlefields and his wife left Paris and lived on his land of Sainte-Croix where she died on December 31, 1683.

The real d'Artagnan's life was used as the basis for Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras' novel Les m√©moires de M. d'Artagnan. Alexandre Dumas in turn used Sandras' novel as the main source for his d'Artagnan Romances (The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne), which cover d'Artagnan's career from his humble beginnings in Gascony to his death at Maastricht. Although Dumas knew that Sandras's version was heavily fictionalised, in the preface to The Three Musketeers he affected to believe that the memoirs were real, in order to make his novel more believable. D'Artagnan is initially portrayed by Dumas as a hotheaded youth, who tries to engage the Comte de Rochefort and the three musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in single combat. He quickly becomes friends with the musketeers, and has a series of adventures which put him at odds with Cardinal Richelieu, then First Minister of France. In the end, Richelieu is impressed by d'Artagnan, and makes him a lieutenant of the musketeers. This begins his long career of military service, as detailed in the sequels. D'Artagnan's role among the musketeers is one of leadership (his skills and brains impress the musketeers greatly), but he is also regarded as a sort of prot√©g√© given his youth and inexperience. Athos sees him not only as a best friend and fellow musketeer but nearly as a son. At the end of the series, his death at the siege of Maastricht is given an extra tragic twist ‚Äì he is mortally wounded while reading the notice of his promotion to the highest military rank. Some scholars believe aspects of D'Artagnan are drawn from the life and character of Dumas's mixed-race father, General Thomas- Alexandre Dumas. The incident when D'Artagnan challenges Porthos, Athos, and Aramis to duels on the same afternoon might be based on an incident in General Dumas's youth when he was insulted; and their subsequent friendship on General Dumas's youthful companionship with fellow soldiers in the Queen's Dragoons.Tom Reiss, The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012), 8, 77, 86; Claude Ribbe, Le diable noir (Monaco: Alph√©e, 2008), 17-18. === In other works === * The Dutch novel In het krijt by C.

The film employs a reverse chronology and follows two men through the streets of Paris as they seek to avenge a brutally raped girlfriend. Much of the film's soundtrack was composed by Thomas Bangalter, one half of the electronic music duo Daft Punk. Irr√©versible competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and won the Bronze Horse at the Stockholm International Film Festival. Irr√©versible has been associated with a series of films defined as the cin√©ma du corps (\\"cinema of the body\\"), which according to Palmer share affinities with certain avant-garde productions: an attenuated use of narrative, assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair. Irr√©versible has also been associated with the New French Extremity movement. The film was particularly controversial upon its release for its graphic portrayal of violence, specifically the scene where a man is savagely bludgeoned to death with a fire extinguisher and its 10-minute long take rape of Alex (Monica Bellucci), who is then brutally beaten into a coma. It had accusations of apparent homophobia as well. American film critic Roger Ebert called Irr√©versible \\"a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable\\". ==Plot== Irr√©versible contains fourteen scenes presented in reverse chronological order. They are arranged here in chronological order. # An Italian woman living in France named Alex (Monica Bellucci) is reading An Experiment with Time by J. W. Dunne in a park, surrounded by playing children. Beethoven's 7th Symphony is heard in the background. The camera spins around faster and faster until it blacks out into a strobe effect, accompanied by a pulsing, roaring sound. A rapidly spinning image of a lawn sprinkler resembling the cosmos can be dimly perceived. A title card reads: \\"Le Temps Detruit Tout\\" (\\"Time destroys everything\\") ‚Äì a phrase uttered in the film's first scene. The film ends. (The use of Beethoven's 7th Symphony also ties this film directly to No√©'s next picture, Enter The Void, where the same song is used in the title sequence. # Alex sits on the bed clothed, her hand on her belly. A poster for Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, with the tagline \\"The Ultimate Trip\\", is above the headboard. # Alex lies in bed with Marcus (Vincent Cassel) after having sex. Alex reveals she might be pregnant, and Marcus is pleased with the possibility. They prepare to go to a party, and Marcus leaves to buy wine. Alex takes a shower, then uses a home pregnancy test that confirms she is pregnant. She is elated. # At a nearby Paris M√©tro station and aboard a subway train, Alex, Marcus and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) are on their way to a party. They discuss sex, and Pierre refers to the fact that he and Alex were once dating, but are no longer in a relationship. He implies that Marcus stole Alex from him. # Alex, Marcus, and Pierre have arrived at the party. Alex is annoyed by Marcus's unrestrained use of drugs and alcohol and his flirtatious behavior with other women, and consequently decides to leave the party alone. # On her way home, Alex sees a pimp called \\"Le Tenia\\" (\\"The Tapeworm\\") (Jo Prestia) beating a transsexual prostitute named Concha (Jaramillo) in a pedestrian underpass. Once the man sees Alex, he releases Concha and turns his attention to Alex, who attempts to flee, but Le Tenia catches her and threatens her with a knife. Le Tenia pins Alex to the ground and anally rapes her for several minutes of screentime, after which he brutally beats her into unconsciousness. # Marcus and Pierre leave the party and encounter commotion on the street. Marcus wails as he discovers Alex's bloodied body being wheeled on a stretcher into an ambulance by paramedics. # Alex is hospitalized and revealed to be comatose. Marcus and Pierre are questioned by the police. They then talk to a street thug named Mourad (Mourad Khima) and his friend Layde (Hellal). The two gangsters promise, if they get paid, to help them find the rapist, who Mourad claims is Le Tenia. Marcus and Pierre go looking for the man who raped Alex. Marcus is still high on drugs and very agitated. # The men track down Concha, Le Tenia's last victim. At first, she refuses to talk to them. After Marcus threatens to slash her with a piece of broken glass, she identifies Le Tenia as the rapist and says he can be found at a gay BDSM nightclub called The Rectum. They are soon chased by angry sex workers seeking to defend Concha. Mourad and Layde run in a different direction. # Marcus and Pierre hail a taxi. Marcus assaults the taxi driver and steals the car. # Marcus and Pierre are seen driving in the taxi. They encounter people in and around a local bar as they attempt to locate The Rectum. While sitting in the taxi, Pierre begs to go to the hospital to see Alex, but Marcus gets angry and breaks the windshield with a wrench. # Marcus and Pierre go to The Rectum, but do not know what Le Tenia looks like. Marcus finds Le Tenia standing with another man, Mick. Thinking Mick is Le Tenia, Marcus assaults him, but Mick wrestles him to the ground, breaks Marcus's arm, and attempts to rape him on the club floor. Pierre defends Marcus by using a fire extinguisher to crush Mick's skull, killing him. Le Tenia stands by and stares, shocked and amused that he got away. # Police arrest Pierre and put him in handcuffs. An ambulance arrives, and Marcus is put on a stretcher and taken from the club. Outside, Mourad and Layde shout insults at Pierre and Marcus. The murdered man is revealed not to be Le Tenia after all. Rather, the man standing next to him in the club was the real Le Tenia. # Across the street in a small apartment, two men are talking about sex. One of them is \\"the Butcher\\", the protagonist of No√©'s previous film, I Stand Alone. In a drunken monologue, the Butcher reveals that he was arrested for having sex with his own daughter. The subject of their discussion shifts to the commotion in the streets outside. Without looking out the window, they derisively attribute the commotion to the patrons of The Rectum. Outside, Mourad is seen talking to a police officer. ==Cast== ==Production== No√© first found financing for Irr√©versible after he pitched the story to be told in reverse, in order to capitalize on the popularity of Christopher Nolan's film Memento (2000). Noe has admitted in interviews that during the production of the film he would use the drug; cocaine in order to help him carry the large cameras needed to capture the rotating shots in the film. https://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/why-gaspar-noe-directed-on-cocaine- masturbated-in-his-own-film-and-shot-a-live-birth-55975/ Irr√©versible was shot using a widescreen lightweight Minima Super16 mm camera. The film consists of about a dozen apparently unbroken shots melded together from hundreds of shots. This included a 9-minute-long rape and sodomy scene, portrayed in a single, unbroken shot. Computer-generated imagery was used in post-production for the penis in the rape scene. Another example is the scene where Pierre beats up a man's face and skull to pulp. CGI was used to augment the results, as initial footage using a conventional latex dummy proved unconvincing.Palmer, Tim (2014). p. 88‚Äì90 During sixty minutes of its running time, the film uses extremely low-frequency sound to create a state of nausea and anxiety in the audience. ==Reception== Bellucci at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival The film premiered in France on 22 May 2002 through Mars Distribution. It competed at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2003 through Metro Tartan Distribution, and the United States on 7 March 2003 through Lions Gate Films. Audience reactions to both the rape scene and the murder scene have ranged from appreciation of their artistic merits to leaving the theater in disgust. Newsweek's David Ansen stated that \\"If outraged viewers (mostly women) at the Cannes Film Festival are any indication, this will be the most walked-out-of movie of 2003.\\" In the same review, Ansen suggested that the film displayed \\"an adolescent pride in its own ugliness\\". Critical response to the film was divided, with some critics panning the film and others considering it one of the year's best. The film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 122 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.75/10. The website's critics' consensus states: \\"Though well-filmed, Irr√©versible feels gratuitous in its extreme violence.\\" The American film critic Roger Ebert argued that the film's structure makes it inherently moral; that by presenting vengeance before the acts that inspire it, we are forced to process the vengeance first, and therefore think more deeply about its implications. Irr√©versible won the top award, the Bronze Horse for best film, at the 2002 Stockholm International Film Festival. It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Award by the Film Critics Circle of Australia. It was voted Best Foreign Language Film by the San Diego Film Critics Society, tied with The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares). It grossed $792,200 from theatrical screenings. Irr√©versible received three votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films and in 2016 was listed by critic Andreas Borcholte as one of the ten best films since 2000. ==Controversy== Film critic David Edelstein argues that \\"Irr√©versible might be the most homophobic movie ever made.\\" No√©'s depiction of gay criminal Le Tenia inexplicably raping the female lead, Alex, remains the film's most controversial image. In his defense, No√© has stated, \\"I'm not homophobic\\", further stating that \\"I also appear in Irr√©versible, masturbating at the gay club\\", as a means of showing that \\"I didn't feel superior to gays.\\" ==See also== * Tempus edax rerum ==References* * * Irreversible on Le Temps D√©truit Tout (Unofficial & International website about Gaspar No√©) Category:2002 films Category:2002 crime drama films Category:2002 crime thriller films Category:2002 LGBT- related films Category:2000s mystery drama films Category:2000s psychological drama films Category:2002 psychological thriller films Category:2000s thriller drama films Category:2000s avant-garde and experimental films Category:English-language films Category:Films about prostitution in France Category:Films directed by Gaspar No√© Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films shot in Paris Category:French crime drama films Category:French crime thriller films Category:French films Category:French LGBT-related films Category:French avant-garde and experimental films Category:French-language films Category:Homophobia in fiction Category:Italian-language films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:LGBT-related thriller films Category:French mystery drama films Category:2000s mystery thriller films Category:French nonlinear narrative films Category:Obscenity controversies in film Category:One-shot films Category:Rape and revenge films Category:Spanish- language films Category:StudioCanal films Category:Transgender-related films Category:French psychological drama films Category:French psychological thriller films Category:French thriller drama films Category:2002 drama films ","title":"Irr√©versible"},{"id":"299493","text":"A tax credit is a tax incentive which allows certain taxpayers to subtract the amount of the credit they have accrued from the total they owe the state. It may also be a credit granted in recognition of taxes already paid or a form of state support. == Credit for payments == Many systems refer to taxes paid indirectly, such as taxes withheld by payers of income, as credits rather than prepayments. In such cases, the tax credit is invariably refundable. The most common forms of such amounts are payroll withholding of income tax or PAYE, withholding of tax at source on payments to nonresidents, and input credits for value added tax. == Individual income tax credits == Income tax systems often grant a variety of credits to individuals. These typically include credits available to all taxpayers as well as tax credits unique to individuals. Some credits may be offered for a single year only. === Low income subsidies === Several income tax systems provide income subsidies to lower income individuals by way of credit. These credits may be based on income, family status, work status, or other factors. Often such credits are refundable when total credits exceed tax liability. ==== United Kingdom ==== In the United Kingdom, the Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit were paid directly into the claimant's bank account or Post Office Card Account. In exceptional circumstances, these can be paid by cashcheque (sometimes called giro) however payments may stop if account details are not provided. A minimum level of Child Tax Credits is payable to all individuals or couples with children, up to a certain income limit. The actual amount of Child Tax Credits that a person may receive depended on these factors: the level of their income, the number of children they have, whether the children are receiving Disability Living Allowance and the education status of any children over 16. Since 2018 Child tax credit has been replaced by Universal Credit for most people. Working Tax Credit is paid to single low earners with or without children who are aged 25 or over and are working over 30 hours per week and also to couples without children, at least one of whom is over 25, provided that at least one of them is working for 30 hours a week. If the claimant has children they could claim Working Tax Credit from age 16 upward provided that they are working at least sixteen hours per week.Child Poverty Action Group Welfare benefits and tax credits handbook, 2011/12 It is being replaced by Universal Credit. Tax Credits were capped which many sources claimed affects the poorest families disproportionately. A survey by End Child Poverty estimated that roughly 1.5 million parents have reduced spending on basics like food and fuel. According to Gavin Kelly of the Resolution Foundation, tax credits help raise living standards of low paid workers. He wrote in the New Statesman, \\"Perhaps the biggest misconception is the voguish notion that if tax credits are cut, employers will somehow decide to offer pay rises to fill the gap. This is saloon-bar economics espoused by some on both left and right.\\" On 15 September 2015, the House of Commons votedBBC (London) 15 September 2015 Commons back Osborne plan for tax credit cuts to decrease Tax Credit thresholds, a law that came into effect on 6 April 2016.Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and Determination of Rates) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 UK Draft Statutory Instruments, Retrieved 26 October 2015 Opponents claimed that it would harm those on low incomes. Simon Hopkins, Chief Executive of charity Turn2us commented \\"Today's vote in the House of Commons will mean one thing for many of the poorest working families in the UK; they are going to get poorer. Tax credits are a vital source of income for those on a low wage and for many they make up a substantial portion of their monthly income.Parliament has voted, must charities take up the slack? Turn2us, Politics Home, 16 September 2015, retrieved 26 October 2015 The IFS supported the opposition view that the effects of the changes would disproportionately reduce the income of poor families, even taking into account reductions in income tax and an increase in the National Living Wage. The government responded that the tax credit system had, for too long, been used to subsidise low pay and the changes would bring total expenditure on tax credits back down to more sustainable levels seen in 2007‚Äì08. On 26 October 2015 the House of Lords supported a motion from Baroness Meacher delaying the imposition of the cuts until a new consideration of the effects could be made by the House of Commons.The Independent (London) 27 October 2015 \\"Tax credits: House of Lords votes to delay cuts by three years\\" ==== United States ==== The U.S. system grants the following low income tax credits: *Earned income credit: this refundable credit is granted for a percentage of income earned by a low income individual. The credit is calculated and capped based on the number of qualifying children, if any. This credit is indexed for inflation and phased out for incomes above a certain amount. For 2016, the maximum credit was $6,269 for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children. *Credit for the elderly and disabled: a nonrefundable credit up to $1,125. *Retirement savings contribution credit: a nonrefundable credit of up to 50% for up to $2000 of contributions to qualified retirement savings plans, such as IRAs (including the Roth, SEP and IRA), 401(k)/403(b)/457 plans and the Thrift Savings Plan; phased out starting (for the 2014 tax year) at incomes above $18,000 for single returns, $27,000 for heads of household, and $36,000 for joint returns.IRS form 8800, 2014 tax year *Mortgage interest credit: a nonrefundable credit that may be limited to $2,000, granted under specific mortgage programs. *Premium tax credit: this refundable credit is provided to individuals and families who obtain healthcare insurance policies through a healthcare exchange, and whose income falls between 100% and 400% of the applicable federal poverty line. It was first introduced in the 2014 tax year. === Family relief === Some systems grant tax credits for families with children. These credits may be on a per child basis or as a credit for child care expenses. The U.S. system offers the following nonrefundable family related income tax credits (in addition to a tax deduction for each dependent child): *Child credit: Parents of children who are under age 17 at the end of the tax year may qualify for a credit up to $1,000 per qualifying child. The credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of tax liability, and may be listed on Line 51 of Form 1040. For every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above the threshold limit ($110,000 for married joint filers; $75,000 for single filers), the amount of the credit decreases by $50. *Child and dependent care credit: If a taxpayer must pay for childcare for a child under age 13 in order to pursue or maintain gainful employment, he or she may claim a credit up to $3,000 of his or her eligible expenses for dependent care. If one parent stays home full-time, however, no child care costs are eligible for the credit. *Credit for adoption expenses: a credit up to $10,000, phased out at higher incomes. Taxpayers who have incurred qualified adoption expenses in 2011 may claim either a $13,360 credit against tax owed or a $13,360 income exclusion if the taxpayer has received payments or reimbursements from his or her employer for adoption expenses. For 2012, the amount of the credit will decrease to $12,650, and in 2013 to $5,000.Presti and Naegele Tax Newsletter, FAQ: What tax breaks come with raising a child?, February 2012. * Family tax credit is a payment for each dependent child aged 18 or young === Education, energy and other subsidies === Some systems indirectly subsidize education and similar expenses through tax credits. The U.S. system has the following nonrefundable credits: *Two mutually exclusive credits for qualified tuition and related expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is 100% of the first $2,000 and 25% of the next $4000 of qualified tuition expenses per year for up to two years. The Lifetime Learning CreditLifetime Learning Credit is 20% of the first $10,000 of cumulative expenses. These credits are phased out at incomes above $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns) in 2009. Expenses for which a credit is claimed are not eligible for tax deduction. *First time homebuyers credit up to $7,500 (closing date before Sept. 30, 2010). *Credits for purchase of certain nonbusiness energy property and residential energy efficiency. Several credits apply with differing rules. == Business tax credits == Many systems offer various incentives for businesses to make investments in property or operate in particular areas. Credits may be offered against income or property taxes, and are generally nonrefundable to the extent they exceed taxes otherwise due. The credits may be offered to individuals as well as entities. The nature of the credits available varies highly by jurisdiction. === United States === U.S. income tax has numerous nonrefundable business credits. In most cases, any amount of these credits in excess of current year tax may be carried forward to offset future taxes, with limitations. The credits include the following (for a full list see section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code): *Alternative motor vehicle credit: several credits are available for purchase of varying types of non-gasoline powered vehicles. *Alternative fuel credits: a credit based on the amount of production of certain non-petroleum fuels. *Disaster relief credits *Credits for employing individuals in certain areas or those formerly on welfare or in targeted groups *Credit for Increasing Research Activities *A variety of industry specific credits Many sub-Federal jurisdictions (states, counties, cities, etc.) within the U.S. offer income or property tax credits for particular activities or expenditures. Examples include credits similar to the Federal research and employment credits, property tax credits, (often called abatements), granted by cities for building facilities within the city, etc. These items often are negotiated between a business and a governmental body, and specific to a particular business and property. ==== Federal nonrefundable investment tax credits ==== Tax credits, while they come in many forms, are authorized incentives under the Internal Revenue Code (and some state tax codes) to implement public policy. Congress, in an effort to encourage the private sector to provide a public benefit, allows a participating taxpayer a dollar for dollar reduction of their tax liability for investments in projects that probably would not occur but for the credits. ==== Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit ==== The legislative incentive program to encourage the preservation of ‚Äúhistorical buildings‚Äù. Congress instituted a two-tier Tax Credit incentive under the 1986 Tax Reform Act. A 20% credit is available for the rehabilitation of historical buildings and a 10% credit is available for non-historic buildings, which were first placed in service before 1936. Benefits are derived from tax credits in the year the property is placed in service, cash flow over 6 years and repurchase options in year six. ==== Renewable Energy/Investment Tax Credit (ITC) ==== The investment tax credit is allowed section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. This investment tax credit varies depending on the type of renewable energy project; solar, fuel cells ($1500/0.5 kW) and small wind (< 100 kW) are eligible for credit of 30% of the cost of development, with no maximum credit limit; there is a 10% credit for geothermal, microturbines (< 2 MW) and combined heat and power plants (< 50 MW). The ITC is generated at the time the qualifying facility is placed in service. Benefits are derived from the ITC, accelerated depreciation, and cash flow over a 6-8 year period.US Internal Revenue Code - Title 26 (PDF) U.S. Government Publishing Office, Retrieved 12 December 2015 Though set to expire at the end of 2015, the ITC for residential solar installations was renewed in December 2015. The credit will continue at 30% through 2018, and will slowly decline to 10% in 2022. The ITC for other technologies (including geothermal) was extended by one year.Renewables Boom Expected Thanks to Tax Credit Scientific American, Retrieved 28 April 2016 Installations will be considered eligible for the ITC based on the date that construction starts.BUSINESS ENERGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (ITC) U.S. Department of Energy, Retrieved 28 April 2016  Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC)  Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows an income tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as adjusted for inflation for 2013) for the production of electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC),Renewed Tax Credit Buoys Wind-Power Projects, March 21, 2013 New York Times was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.  Low Income (Affordable) Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)  Under this program, created in the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the U.S Treasury Department allocates tax credits to each state based on that states population. These credits are then awarded to developers who, together with an equity partner, develop and maintain apartments as affordable units. Benefits are derived primarily from the tax credits over a 10-year period.  Qualified School Construction Bond (QSCB)  QSCBs are U.S. debt instruments used to help schools borrow at nominal rates for the rehabilitation, repair and equipping of their facilities, as well as the purchase of land upon which a public school will be built. A QSCB holder receives a Federal tax credit in lieu of an interest payment. The tax credits may be stripped from QSCB bonds and sold separately. QSCBs were created by Section 1521 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Internal Revenue Code Section 54F also addresses QSCBs. ==== Research & Development Tax Credit ==== The Credit For Increasing Research Activities (R&D; Tax Credit) is a general business tax credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 41 for companies that incur research and development (R&D;) costs in the United States. For most companies, this credit is worth 7-10% of qualified research expenses each year.R&D; tax credit calculator It can be used to offset income or payroll taxes, depending on the situation.Qualified Small Business Payroll Tax Credit for Increasing Research Activities ==== Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) ==== The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal tax credit providing incentives to employers for hiring groups facing high rates of unemployment, such as veterans, youths and others. WOTC helps these targeted groups obtain employment so they are able to gain the skills and experience necessary to obtain better future job opportunities. The WOTC is based on the number of hours an employee works and benefits the employer directly. In December 2014, the credit was extended retroactively to the beginning of 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (TIPA), P.L. 113‚Äì295. That act authorized the credit only through December 31, 2014. Later, through the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act), Congress modified and extended the WOTC through December 31, 2019.DOL Employment and Training Administration ==== American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) ==== The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was signed into law in February 2009. The AOTC replaced the Hope Scholarship credit for Tax Years 2009 and 2010, increased the benefits for nearly all Hope credit recipients and many other students by providing a maximum benefit up to $2,500 per student, 100 percent of their first $2,000 in tuition and 25 percent of the next $2,000, expanding the income range over which taxpayers can claim a credit, and making the credit partially refundable. Critics have complained that complexity and restrictions on eligibility make the actual benefits per post-secondary student much lower than the theoretical maximum, and that even with tax credits, higher education remains tax-disadvantaged compared to other investments. === State tax credits === Approximately 43 states provide a variety of special incentive programs that utilize state tax credits. These include Brownfield credits, Film Production credits, Renewable energy credits, Historic Preservation credits and others. The amount of credit, the term of credit and the cost of the credit differs from state to state. These credits can be either in the form of a certificate, which can be purchased as an asset, or in a more traditional pass through entity. The tax credits can generally be used against insurance company premium tax, bank tax and income tax. ==== Oregon Residential Energy Tax Credit (RETC) ==== The state of Oregon's RETC is a tax credit for solar systems. In 2016, Oregon Governor Kate Brown released a new budget proposal that does not extend the RETC program. In 2015, RETC gave $12.2 million in tax credits; in 2014, that amount was approximately $4.2 million. Under the budget proposal, the credit will sunset at the end of 2017. Extension of the tax credit is a top priority for Oregon's solar industry. == Value added tax == Resellers or producers of goods or providers of services (collectively, providers) must collect value added tax (VAT) in some jurisdictions upon billing or being paid by customers. Where these providers use goods or services provided by others, they may have paid VAT to other providers. Most VAT systems allow the amount of such VAT paid or considered paid to be used to offset VAT payments due, generally referred to as an input credit. Some systems allow the excess of input credits over VAT obligations to be refunded after a period of time. == Foreign tax credit == Income tax systems that impose tax on residents on their worldwide income tend to grant a foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes paid on the same income. The credit often is limited based on the amount of foreign income. The credit may be granted under domestic law and/or tax treaty. The credit is generally granted to individuals and entities, and is generally nonrefundable. See Foreign tax credit for more comprehensive information on this complex subject. == Credits for alternative tax bases == Several tax systems impose a regular income tax and, where higher, an alternative tax. The U.S. imposes an alternative minimum tax based on an alternative measure of taxable income. Mexico imposes an IETU based on an alternative measure of taxable income. Italy imposes an alternative tax based on assets. In each case, where the alternative tax is higher than the regular tax, a credit is allowed against future regular tax for the excess. The credit is usually limited in a manner that prevents circularity in the calculation. == See also == *Tax choice == References == == External links == *Work Opportunity Tax Credit *Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency *TAX CREDITS, REBATES & SAVINGS - Department of Energy.

The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded in 1949 and was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. Its original constitution was promulgated on 7 October 1949. It was heavily based on the \\"Weimarer Reichsverfassung\\", (Weimar Constitution)http://web.wm.edu/law/publications/lawreview/documents/Vol49-4_Markovits.pdf?svr=law such that the GDR would be a federal and democratic republic. Because the original version did not accurately reflect the actual political climate of the GDR, it was decided in 1968 to replace the old constitution with a new version. ==1949 constitution== The first constitution of the GDR was proclaimed on 7 October 1949, based largely on a draft prepared by the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in September 1946. The constitution both resembled and differed from Western parliamentary democracies in various respects. With regard to state organization, the 1949 constitution resembled, at least superficially, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). As in other parliamentary-democratic systems, provision was also made for two legislative assemblies, the States Chamber (L√§nderkammer) and the People's Chamber (Volkskammer), and the election of a prime minister (Ministerpr√§sident) by the party with the largest mandate in the People's Chamber. The president of the GDR, like his Western counterpart, had a very limited role and was removable by a joint two-thirds majority vote in both houses Lawmaking was essentially the job of the Volkskammer rather than the L√§nderkammer, but the latter could propose draft laws to the former. The legislative process also exhibited important differences from the West German model; the East German upper house, the L√§nderkammer, for example, which represented the interests of the individual states, occupied a much weaker position than its West German counterpart. The Volkskammer was constitutionally defined as the highest organ of state power. Article 51 stated that the members of the Volkskammer were to be elected in universal, equal, and secret elections based on the relative majority principle. Another important difference concerned the role of political parties in the government. According to Article 92, parties with at least 40 seats in the Volkskammer, which then had a total of 400 members, had the right to representation in the government. This policy was consistent with the SED's Marxist Alliance Policy, which stipulated that in order to achieve its aims, the party of the working class must initially work with and through other parties. It also ensured that if the SED was ever demoted to a minority position, its continued influence in the government would be safeguarded if it maintained a minimum of 40 seats. A set of basic human rights, including the right to strike (Article 14) and to emigrate (Article 10) retained features of a liberal Rechtsstaat and formally guaranteed that sovereignty would remain vested in the people. The 1949 constitution was a compromise; it could have served either as a basis for building a socialist (and eventually Communist) society or as the basis for a democratic all-German republic. Critics have pointed out that the absence of a genuinely independent constitutional judiciary (since it and all other governmental organs were subordinated to the Volkskammer) rendered the document virtually meaningless, however. As time progressed, the authorities ignored most of its formal provisions and permitted the emergence of a centralized political order similar to that of other Communist countries, in which the state bodies did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the SED and its Politburo. Several important amendments were made at the initiative of the SED in the eighteen years in which the constitution was in force. An amendment of August 1950 eliminated state parliaments and called for the election of parliamentary deputies through the creation of a joint platform and lists organized by the National Front, the SED-dominated umbrella organization of all political parties and mass organizations. A 1952 decision replaced the five states (L√§nder) with fifteen administrative districts (Bezirke) that were tied more directly to the central government. (The United States, Britain, and France never recognized East Berlin as a Bezirk of the GDR.) This step effectively neutered the L√§nderkammer, and formed the basis for its formal dissolution by constitutional amendment in December 1958. A series of amendments known as the Law Toward the Completion of the Constitution were passed by the People's Chamber in March 1954, when the country was formally granted sovereignty by the Soviet Union. These amendments delineated the features of the country's new sovereignty and a formal military structure, which prepared the ground for the obligatory military service clause of 1955. Finally, upon the death of President Wilhelm Pieck on 7 September 1960, a constitutional amendment of 12 September 1960 replaced the office of President with the Council of State (Staatsrat der DDR); Walter Ulbricht became its first chairman. The same constitutional amendment also acknowledged the role of the recently formed National Defense Council of the GDR (Nationale Verteidigungsrat der DDR) in GDR defense policy. ==1968 constitution== Ulbricht signing the new constitution, 8 April 1968 At the Seventh Party Congress of the SED in April 1967, Ulbricht called for a new constitution, declaring that the existing constitution no longer accorded \\"with the relations of socialist society and the present level of historical development\\". A new constitution was needed to conform with the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist belief in the progression of history and the role of the working class led by the SED. The new constitution would also reflect the role of the state as the party's main instrument in achieving the goal of a socialist and eventually communist society. A commission in the Volkskammer was tasked in December 1967 to draft a new constitution. Two months later the commission produced a document, which, after \\"public debate\\", was submitted to a plebiscite on April 6, 1968. Approved by a 94.5 percent margin, the new Constitution went into effect three days later on 9 April 1968. While the 1949 constitution was at least superficially a liberal democratic document, the 1968 constitution was a fully Communist document. Modeled closely on the 1936 Soviet Constitution, it integrated all the constitutional changes that had taken place since 1949 into a new \\"socialist\\" framework, but it reduced certain rights provided in the earlier version. Article 1 of the 1968 constitution began with the words, \\"The German Democratic Republic is a socialist state of the German nation. It is the political organization of the workers in the cities and in the countryside, who jointly under the leadership of the working class and their Marxist- Leninist party will realize Socialism.\\" While the old document made no mention of the SED, Article 1 of the new constitution unequivocally declared that \\"the leadership of the state is to be exercised through the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party\\"‚Äîthe SED. The 1949 constitution had declared Germany a \\"democratic republic\\", whereas the new one described East Germany as a \\"socialist state of the German nation\\". Under the old constitution, power derived from \\"the people\\", while Article 2 of the new Constitution stated that power emanated from \\"the worker in city and country\\". Significant changes introduced into the 1968 document included: * Article 6, which committed the state to adhere to the \\"principles of socialist internationalism\\" and to devote special attention to its \\"fraternal ties\\" with the Soviet Union * Article 9, which based the national economy on the \\"socialist ownership of the means of production\\" * Article 20, which granted freedom of conscience and belief * Article 21, which maintained that the \\"basic rights\\" of citizenship were inseparably linked with \\"corresponding obligations\\" * Article 47, which declared that the principle of \\"democratic centralism\\" is the authoritative maxim for the construction of the socialist state The 1968 document effectively codified the actual state of affairs that had prevailed in the GDR for two decades. It was one of Ulbricht's last significant victories before his ouster in 1971. ==1974 amendments== 1974 amendment, signed by Chairman of the Council of State Willi Stoph. With the rise of Erich Honecker in May 1971 and the increasing international recognition of the GDR, the regime attempted to abandon the concept that the GDR was the sole legitimate government of the entire German nation. Instead, the policy of Abgrenzung (demarcation) was instituted, with the desired effect of creating a separate GDR national identity. As a result, the 1968 constitution was amended by the Volkskammer on 27 September 1974 to delete the reference to the German nation; indeed, the use of the word \\"German\\" was cut back almost to a bare minimum. The amended document increased the emphasis on solidarity and friendship with the Soviet Union. In practice, however, ties between East Germans and their West German countrymen increased, in part due to the policies of Ostpolitik and d√©tente followed by both East and West during the 1970s. Article 1 of the 1974 constitution began with the words, \\"The German Democratic Republic is a socialist state of workers and farmers. It is the political organization of the workers in the cities and in the countryside under the leadership of the working class and their Marxist-Leninist party.\\" ==1989‚Äì90 proposals== In the wake of the Peaceful Revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall, the constitution was significantly revised in November 1989 to prune out its Communist character. Most notably, Article 1, which effectively gave the SED a monopoly of power, was deleted. In April 1990, the democratic forum Runder Tisch (Round Table) developed a proposal for a new GDR constitution to reflect the democratic changes that swept across the GDR. However, by that time, the newly freely-elected Volkskammer (parliament) was moving in the direction of outright unification with the Federal Republic, and so the draft constitution went nowhere. ==See also== ===Constitutions of Germany=== * Constitution of the German Empire (1871‚Äì1919) * Weimar Constitution (1919‚Äì1933) * Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, 1949‚Äì) ===Others=== *History of East Germany ==References== ==External links== *1949 Constitution of the GDR (full text in German) *1968 Constitution of the GDR (full text in German) *Excerpts from the 1968 Constitution (in English) *1974 Constitution of the GDR (full text in German) *1990 Proposed draft of a new GDR constitution (full text in German) *East Germany ‚Äì Constitution of 1949 Category:Government of East Germany Category:East German law East Germany Category:1949 in East Germany Category:1968 in East Germany Category:1974 in East Germany Category:Constitutions of Germany Category:1949 in politics Category:1968 in politics Category:1974 in politics Category:1949 in law Category:1968 in law Category:1974 in law Category:1949 documents Category:1968 documents ","title":"Constitution of East Germany"},{"id":"299496","text":"ROV may refer to: *Real options valuation *Recreational Off highway Vehicle, also known as Side by side or UTV (Utility Task Vehicle) *Remotely operated underwater vehicle *Republic of Vietnam was the name for South Vietnam during (1955‚Äì75) *Rostov-on-Don Airport, an airport in southern Russia (former IATA airport code) *Platov International Airport (IATA airport code) == See also == * Rov, a concept in Judaism ","title":"ROV"},{"id":"299497","text":" SS Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, was a sidewheel steamer that operated between Central America and the eastern coast of the United States during the 1850s. She was originally named the SS George Law, after Mr. George Law of New York. The ship sank in a hurricane in September 1857, along with 425 of her 578 passengers and crew and of gold, contributing to the Panic of 1857. ==Sinking== On 3 September 1857, 477 passengers and 101 crew left the Panamanian port of Col√≥n, sailing for New York City under the command of William Lewis Herndon. The ship was laden with of gold prospected during the California Gold Rush. After a stop in Havana, the ship continued north. On 9 September 1857, the ship was caught up in a Category 2 hurricane while off the coast of the Carolinas. By 11 September, the winds and heavy seas had shredded her sails, she was taking on water, and her boiler was threatening to fail. A leak in one of the seals between the paddle wheel shafts and the ship's sides sealed its fate. At noon that day, her boiler could no longer maintain fire. Steam pressure dropped, shutting down both the bilge pumps. Also, the paddle wheels that kept her pointed into the wind failed as the ship settled by the stern. The passengers and crew flew the ship's flag inverted (a distress sign in the US) to signal a passing ship. No one came. A depiction of the sinking A bucket brigade was formed, and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water. During the calm of the hurricane, attempts were made to get the boiler running again, but these failed. The second half of the storm then struck. The ship was now on the verge of foundering. Without power, the ship was carried along with the storm and the strong winds would not abate. The next morning, September 12, two ships were spotted, including the brig Marine. Only 153 passengers, primarily women and children, made their way over in lifeboats. The ship remained in an area of intense winds and heavy seas that pulled the ship and most of her company away from rescue. Central America sank at 8:00 that evening. As a consequence of the sinking, 425 people were killed. A Norwegian bark, Ellen, rescued an additional 50 from the waters.http://www.columbia.edu/~dj114/SS_Central_America.pdf Another three were picked up over a week later in a lifeboat. Commander William Lewis Herndon. U.S.N. ==Aftermath== In the immediate aftermath of the sinking, greatest attention was paid to the loss of life, which was described as \\"appalling\\" and as having \\"no parallel\\" among American navigation disasters. At the time of her sinking, Central America carried gold then valued at approximately (modern monetarily 2019 dollar equivalent to $550 million, assuming a gold value of $1,528.40 per troy ounce). The loss shook public confidence in the economy, and contributed to the Panic of 1857. The valuation of the ship itself was substantially less than those lost in other disasters of the period, being $140,000 (). Commander William Lewis Herndon, a distinguished officer who had served during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and explored the Amazon Valley, was captain of Central America, and went down with his ship. Two US Navy ships were later named USS Herndon in his honor, as was the town of Herndon, Virginia. Two years after the sinking, his daughter Ellen married Chester Alan Arthur, later the 21st President of the United States. ==Search and discovery== The ship was located by the Columbus-America Discovery Group of Ohio, led by Tommy Gregory Thompson, using Bayesian search theory. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was sent down on 11 September 1988.Kinder, Gary. \\"Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea\\". New York: Atlantic Monthly, 1998. Print. Significant amounts of gold and artifacts were recovered and brought to the surface by another ROV built specifically for the recovery. The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $100‚Äì150 million. A recovered gold ingot weighing sold for a record $8 million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time. Thirty-nine insurance companies filed suit, claiming that because they paid damages in the 19th century for the lost gold, they had the right to it. The team that found it argued that the gold had been abandoned. After a legal battle, 92% of the gold was awarded to the discovery team in 1996. Thompson was sued in 2005 by several of the investors who had provided $12.5 million in financing, and in 2006 by several members of his crew, over a lack of returns for their respective investments. In 2009 he had an off-shore account in the Cook Islands of 4.16 million.Columbus Ohio Dispatch 30 November 2018 Thompson went into hiding in 2012. A receiver was appointed to take over Thompson's companies and, if possible, salvage more gold from the wreck, in order to recover money for Thompson's various creditors. In March 2014, a contract was awarded to Odyssey Marine Exploration to conduct archeological recovery and conservation of the remaining shipwreck. The original expedition had only excavated \\"5 percent\\" of the ship. Thompson was located in January 2015, along with assistant Alison Antekeier, by US Marshals agents, and was extradited to Ohio to provide an accounting of the expedition profits. In November 2018 Thompson agreed to surrender 500 gold coins-but then claimed he has no access to the missing coins.Columbus Ohio Dispatch 17 November 2018 On 28 November 2018 a jury awarded Investors 19.4 million in compensatory damages-3.2 Million to the Dispatch Printing Company [which had put up 1 million of 22 million invested] and 16.2 million to the court appointed receiver of the other investors. ==See also== Other successful treasure recoveries include: * Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha (1622) * SS Georgiana (1865) * SS Republic (1865) * RMS Republic (1903) ==References== ==Further reading== * Kinder, Gary.

Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge. Oxford: Berg, 2007. . Coming to prominence towards the end of the new wave of British heavy metal, Venom's first two albums, Welcome to Hell (1981) and Black Metal (1982), are considered major influences on thrash metal and extreme metal in general. Venom's second album proved influential enough that its title was used as the name of the black metal genre. ==History== ===Early years (1978‚Äì1981)=== Venom's original personnel came from three different bands: Guillotine, Oberon and Dwarfstar. The original Guillotine featured Jeffrey Dunn and Dave Rutherford on guitars, Dean Hewitt on bass guitar, Dave Blackman on vocals, and Chris Mercater on drums who replaced Paul Burke, the original drummer when the band was founded. Blackman and Mercater were later also replaced by drummer Anthony Bray and vocalist Clive Archer. Later, Dean Hewitt was replaced by Alan Winston on bass. The band name then changed to Venom. In late 1979, Conrad Lant replaced Dave Rutherford. Lant later switched to bass after the departure of Winston. The band members took on new stage names. Archer became \\"Jesus Christ\\", Lant \\"Cronos\\", Tony Bray \\"Abbadon\\", and Jeff Dunn \\"Mantas\\". Prime influences of the formative band were Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Mot√∂rhead, and Kiss. Other musicians that have influenced Venom are Deep Purple, Sex Pistols, the Who, the Tubes, Van Halen, the Rolling Stones, and Elvis Presley.Ankeny, Jason. Venom: Related. AllMusic. Retrieved 20 June 2016. Since the beginning of their career, Venom have often used \\"Satanic\\" lyrics and imagery. However, such references were mostly for shock value.Bradley Torreano: [ \\"In League with Satan - Venom\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved 24 January 2013. In late 1979 Lant introduced the band to his original song ideas as he didn't want to keep playing the same cover songs, and with Dunn he began writing new songs for the band. Lant had yet composed songs like \\"Sons of Satan\\", \\"Bloodlust\\" and \\"Welcome to Hell\\", while Dunn had yet composed songs like \\"Angel Dust\\", \\"Red Light Fever\\", \\"Buried Alive\\", \\"Raise the Dead\\" and \\"Live Like an Angel, Die Like a Devil\\". Dunn and Lant redefined together these songs with a mutual collaboration and then, after a few weeks Lant recorded a rehearsal session on a basic cassette recorder which he played for the label he worked for, although as the band rehearsed in an old church hall the sound was not good. In April 1980, Lant was able to persuade the label to give him some free studio time and the band recorded a three-song demo. Soon after, six more tracks were recorded for just ¬£50, with Lant taking vocal duties on the song \\"Live Like an Angel\\". Archer then left the band, and Venom's line-up became a trio. ===Classic line-up (1981‚Äì1986)=== Venom's professional recording debut was the 1981 single \\"In League with Satan\\"/\\"Live Like an Angel\\", which was released by Neat Records. Later that year they released their full-length debut, Welcome to Hell. Welcome to Hell was a big influence on future thrash bands. Venom's music was faster and harsher than most heavy metal contemporaries and while Satanism and other dark topics had been featured in metal before, the subject had rarely been more prominent. Lant was quoted as saying that this celebration of evil subjects was inspired by the perceived need to out-do musicians like Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath, who would \\"sing about evil things and dark figures, and then spoil it all by going: 'Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!'\\"[ \\"MMV: Review by James Christopher Monger\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved 24 January 2013. Their second album, 1982's Black Metal, is cited as perhaps the most important influence in the development of black metal, thrash metal, death metal, and other related styles that are often grouped under the extreme metal umbrella. Many defining elements of these genres are first found in the lyrics and song titles created by Lant, his unique singing style and larger than life presence. Venom's first two albums inspired cult followings to this day. While many of their NWOBHM peers (like Iron Maiden) had found measures of popular success or critical acclaim, or (like Def Leppard) were moving away from heavy metal towards hard rock, Venom were still regarded by critics as \\"a trio of buffoons\\". In 1984, Venom recorded the At War with Satan album, an epic 20-minute title track, with substantial influences of many different musical styles, which took up the first side of the LP. The title track written by Lant, was a deliberate way for him to shove a middle finger up to the critics who said Venom couldn't play. The B-side was focused on the rapid-fire, three-minute \\"scorchers\\" Venom were known for, including \\"Stand Up And Be Counted\\". A live video, The 7th Date of Hell Venom Live at Hammersmith Odeon, was also released that year. In 1985, Venom released their fourth studio album, Possessed, which was recorded in a stately home, and saw a band enjoying their success with different chefs being flown in every day during the album's recording, lavish parties of sex, drugs and rock n' roll. By this time Venom had released several singles (Warhead, Die Hard and Manitou to name a few) and live EPs (The Assault Series including Canadian Assault, American Assault and French Assault). Cronos and Abaddon appeared on the Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge video with Slayer and Exodus. Cronos cites the Possessed album as underestimated. \\"I don't think there's any songs that are kind of overlooked, I just think some songs maybe weren't recorded as well as we could have recorded them. Like say for example on the Possessed album, I still think there are great songs\\". During March/April of '86, Venom the band seems ready to record the fifth album (then never released), called Deadline, but internal relationships begin to deteriorate. A live album, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, and a second live video, Alive in '85, were released in 1986. Dunn then left the band to release a solo album. ===Line-up changes, Calm Before the Storm release and departure of Conrad Lant (1987‚Äì1988)=== Two guitarists, Mike Hickey and Jim Clare, were hired to replace Dunn. Their fifth album, 1987's Calm Before the Storm, moved away from Satanic themes in favour of \\"sword and sorcery\\" material.[ \\"Calm Before the Storm: Review by Steve Huey\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved 24 January 2013. This was a new direction for Venom, although it didn't last long with only a short Japanese and Brazilian tour in 1986, so the band decided to split, and Lant, Clare and Hickey all left to form Lant's solo band Cronos. ===Return to scene at the behest of Abaddon: The \\"Demolition Man\\" Dolan age (1988‚Äì1992)=== Bray was left as the only group member, but he was able to convince Music for Nations for a deal to release a new Venom album on the Under One Flag label, using Deadline demo tracks which were recorded with previous line-ups but never released. In 1988, Bray offered a vocals/bass role to Tony Dolan (The Demolition Man) from Atomkraft. Bray and Dolan wrote new material prior to Dunn's rejoining the band along with rhythm guitarist Al Barnes. Together they recorded Prime Evil (1989), Tear Your Soul Apart (1990) and Temples of Ice (1991). Barnes then left the band, and Steve White from Atomkraft was hired as his replacement. They released The Waste Lands in 1992, also without success. Music for Nations refused to release any more Venom albums, so Dolan and Dunn quit, effectively disbanding Venom. Bray continued to release compilation and live albums up to 1995. Nonetheless, Dolan, Dunn and Bray continued performing as a trio. ===Reunion of classic line-up (1995‚Äì1999)=== In 1995, Lant, Dunn and Bray reunited the \\"classic\\" line-up, beginning by headlining the Waldrock Festival on 24 June 1995. They recorded and self-released the Venom '96 EP with four re-recorded old tracks and one new song, resulting in a record deal with the SPV label. Following this was a live CD/video box set, The Second Coming, composed entirely of songs from their classic era such as \\"Welcome to Hell\\", \\"Countess Bathory\\", \\"In Nomine Satanas\\" and \\"Black Metal\\". An album, Cast in Stone, was next released in 1997, split between two discs which was one of all new material and the other with re-recordings of popular early-'80s songs. ===Recent work (1999‚Äìpresent)=== Hellfest 2008 By time 1999 arrived, it was time to supply SPV with the second album in their deal and internal conflicts between members of the band did not take long. Eric Cook (manager of Venom) and Abaddon met each other and decided not to work with Cronos again. Abaddon wrote a letter to Cronos, with the intent of firing him out of the band. The letter written by the drummer communicates that the role of Cronos in the band and his service is no longer necessary and that he would carry on the band with Jeff \\"Mantas\\" Dunn and other people. So Cronos called the German record company SPV/Steamhammer to communicate the situation of the band. and wish everyone good luck for whatever they decide to do. At that point the record company furiously refused point blank to have a line-up of Venom who had no Cronos in the band. After that, Cronos answered Abaddon telling him: \\"You can't kick the Devil out of hell, I‚Äôm firing you!\\". Despite this, the band tried to invite Abaddon to play with them again but Bray did not want to perform on the album and he was replaced by a nu-metal drummer called \\"Anton\\" whom, among other things, was the younger Lant brother. This line-up released Resurrection in 2000 on SPV. However, in 2002 Dunn was next to leave the group and Lant replaced him with a US guitarist, Mike Hickey, who had already taken part in the 1987 release, \\"Calm Before the Storm,\\" and Cronos solo albums. In late 2005, Venom released a career-spanning four-disc box set, MMV, which includes an exclusive mini-poster of the band's seven-date tour of Europe with Metallica and a 60-page picture book, with interviews and pictures. The set includes all their best-known songs, along with rarities like live tracks, demos and outtakes. This line-up of the band released the Metal Black album in 2006. In 2007 Mike Hickey left the band and guitarist Stuart \\"Rage\\" Dixon joined the band and this line-up released the record Hell the following year. In 2009 drummer Danny \\"Dante\\" Needham joined the band and Lant wrote that this will be known as \\"The Epic Line-Up of Venom\\", and they set off on a full South American tour. After headlining festivals around the world for the next couple of years gaining in popularity, they released the Fallen Angels album on 28 November 2011. Venom perform at Brutal Assault 2014 Venom released their fourteenth studio album, From the Very Depths, on 27 January 2015. The band also played one song, \\"Rise\\", they were working on in the studio, live for the audience at Rockfest 2014. A three-track EP, 100 Miles to Hell, was released on 22 December 2017. Their fifteenth album, Storm the Gates, was released on 14 December 2018. ===Reunion of the Venom '89/'90 line-up under the name \\"Venom Inc.\\"=== In April 2015, in anticipation of a date of the M-pire of Evil (Mantas and Demolition Man band) at the Keep It True Festival in Germany, the organizers of the festival, asked Mantas and Demolition Man if they could play the songs of Venom with Abaddon. Mantas had not talked to Abaddon since 1998. So after thinking a bit, the two ex-Venom played along with Abaddon without having done any rehearsals for the show. At this point the three brought together the Venom line-up of 1988‚Äì1992 under the name of Venom Inc. for the sake of the fans (instead of the name \\"Iron & Steel\\", that was initially conceived by the members themselves). On 3 February 2017, Venom Inc. signed with Nuclear Blast and released their first album, Av√©, on 11 August 2017. The two singles off the album were \\"Dein Fleisch\\" and \\"Ave Satanas\\". After playing on the Blood Stained Earth Tour 2017, the band continued to play until the beginning of March 2018, when at the end of the Australian tour, Abaddon asked for a break from the band's activity (due to the birth of his daughter, Anja) and agreed that he would be temporarily replaced by the band's front of house engineer Jeramie Kling for a period of one or two months (until April 2018) to complete the European tour before he came back. However, following some internal disagreements, Abaddon was fired and replaced by Kling. Meanwhile, Kling (from The Absence) took his place on the band's European tour and on recordings for the next record. ==Musical style and influences== As Venom were one of the first incarnations of extreme metal, influencing many thrash metal, black metal, death metal, and other extreme metal bands, their exact genre has been a topic of debate. Venom have been labelled various genres by members of the press. Most prominent genres are black metal, thrash metal, and speed metal.Black metal according to: *MusicMight Venom page *[ AllMusic] Venom page *Eduardo Rivadavia Black Metal review Thrash metal according to: *Keith Kahn- Harris Extreme Metal book *Popmatters.com Celtic Frost article Speed metal according to: *Revolver Venom update Cronos insists on calling it black metal, without passing judgment on the genre that later would flourish in Norway: ==Legacy and influence== Welcome to Hell influenced several later bands. Venom's music helped shape the development of many thrash metal bands, specifically the \\"Big Four of Thrash\\" (who in turn were highly influential): Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth (Metallica opened for Venom on an early 1980s tour, and Venom opened for Metallica and Slayer on the Ride the Lightning tour, and Slayer played with them and Exodus on the Combat Tour in 1985). Venom would also be of extreme importance to the black metal scene and even the early death metal scene. Swiss band Hellhammer (later to become Celtic Frost) and Norwegian band Mayhem are among the major black metal acts influenced by Venom; Quorthon, the frontman of Swedish band Bathory, called Black Metal \\"one of the best albums ever made\\" in an interview, although he later downplayed Venom's influence on him. Music critic Bradley Torreano wrote that Venom \\"caught the attention of both metalheads and punks, the band was emulated by the former and turned into camp icons by the latter.\\" Henry Rollins once compared the band to Spinal Tap.Rollins, Henry, Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag, 2.13.61 Publications, 1994 Although they did not make it to MTV's top 10 heavy metal bands list, they were given an \\"honorable mention\\". Reflecting on Venom's 40th anniversary, Cronos said that without Venom, well known bands such as Metallica or Slayer would not exist. He explained, \\"We were the band that was influenced by Mot√∂rhead and the Sex Pistols, but we took their sound and made something completely new out of it. We were completely new; no one had heard anything like us. And of course, unbeknown to us, in America there were these kids who were listening to our records and then shaping what we were doing into their own thing. Slayer would be an example of that. And I agree, without us those bands either wouldn‚Äôt exist, or would sound very different from the way they do.\\" He also cited the line-up consisting of himself, along with guitarist Stuart \\"Rage\\" Dixon and drummer Danny \\"Dant√©\\" Needham as \\"the best one we've ever had.\\" ==Criticism== While many fans and musicians see Venom as an important band, their music has nonetheless been the subject of debate. The biggest criticism is Satanism, which is the main driving force behind the band's music and album covers. Cronos explained in 2008 that the reasoning behind it is for entertainment purposes. Critic Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic writes that though Welcome to Hell influenced \\"literally thousands\\" of bands, Venom were \\"critically reviled\\". Critic James Christopher Monger, however, declares that the members of Venom 'grew as musicians' as their careers progressed. Ethnographer Keith Kahn-Harris argues that Venom's limited technical skill, particularly early in their career, was a profound, though inadvertent factor in Venom's influence: being unable to mimic more technically proficient metal of their predecessors or peers, Venom instead opted to focus on sheer speed, creating music that was inspired by earlier metal, yet simultaneously innovative. ==Members== ;Current members * Conrad \\"Cronos\\" Lant ‚Äì bass (1979‚Äì1987, 1995‚Äì2002, 2005‚Äìpresent), rhythm guitar (1979), vocals (1980‚Äì1987, 1995‚Äì2002, 2005‚Äìpresent) * Stuart \\"La Rage\\" Dixon ‚Äì guitars (2007‚Äìpresent) * Danny \\"Dante\\" Needham ‚Äì drums (2009‚Äìpresent) ;Former members * Jeffrey \\"Mantas\\" Dunn ‚Äì guitars (1978‚Äì1985, 1989‚Äì1992, 1995‚Äì2002) * Anthony \\"Abaddon\\" Bray ‚Äì drums (1978‚Äì1992, 1995‚Äì1999) * Clive \\"Jesus Christ\\" Archer ‚Äì vocals (1979‚Äì1980) * Mike \\"Mykvs\\" Hickey ‚Äì guitars (1987, 2005‚Äì2007) * Jim Clare ‚Äì guitars (1987) * Tony \\"Demolition Man\\" Dolan ‚Äì vocals, bass (1989‚Äì1992) * Al Barnes ‚Äì guitars (1989‚Äì1991) * Trevor \\"V.X.S\\" Sewell ‚Äì keyboards (1991‚Äì1992) * Steve \\"War Maniac\\" White ‚Äì guitars (1992) * Anthony \\"Antton\\" Lant ‚Äì drums (1999‚Äì2002, 2005‚Äì2009) ==Discography== Studio albums * Welcome to Hell (1981) * Black Metal (1982) * At War with Satan (1984) * Possessed (1985) * Calm Before the Storm (1987) * Prime Evil (1989) * Temples of Ice (1991) * The Waste Lands (1992) * Cast in Stone (1997) * Resurrection (2000) * Metal Black (2006) * Hell (2008) * Fallen Angels (2011) * From the Very Depths (2015) * Storm the Gates (2018) EPs * Canadian Assault (Canada 1984) * American Assault (USA 1985) * French Assault (France 1985) * Scandinavian Assault (Sweden 1985) * German Assault (Germany 1985) * Japanese Assault (Japan 1985) * Hell at Hammersmith (UK 1985) * Tear Your Soul Apart (1990) * Venom '96 (UK 1996) * 100 Miles to Hell (UK 2017) Live albums * Official Bootleg (1985) * Eine kleine Nachtmusik (1986) * The Second Coming (1997) * Witching Hour (2003) UK singles * In League with Satan (1981) * Bloodlust (1982) * Die Hard (1983) * Warhead (1984) * Manitou (1984) * Nightmare (1985) * Antechrist (2006) * Hammerhead (2011) Compilation albums * From Hell to the Unknown...

He served a single two-year term from 1981 to 1983. He is one of two people to have defeated Bill Clinton in an election, the other being the late U.S. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas' 3rd congressional district. ==Early years, family, education== White was born on June 4, 1933, in Texarkana in Bowie County, Texas, as Durward Frank Kyle Jr. His father, Durward Frank Kyle, died when White was seven, and White's mother, the former Ida Bottoms Clark, married Loftin E. White of Highland Park, Texas. He took his stepfather's name and became \\"Frank Durward White\\". After the death of the stepfather in 1950, the Whites returned to Texarkana. White enrolled in the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico, and was subsequently recommended to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, by then U.S. Senator John L. McClellan of Arkansas. He graduated from the academy with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1956. He also excelled in the study of Spanish. Though he was a Naval Academy graduate, White became a pilot in the United States Air Force. One of his first missions in the Air Force, in 1957, was to fly members of the 101st Airborne Division from Kentucky to Little Rock in the Little Rock Integration Crisis. White was discharged from the Air Force in 1961 with the rank of Captain. From his first marriage to Mary Blue Hollenberg, a member of a prominent Little Rock family, White had three children. In 1975, two years after his divorce, White married Gay Daniels, 14 years his junior, who survived him. White and Daniels acquired custody of the children from his first marriage, but they had no children together. White was baptized as a youth in the Christian faith at Beech Street First Baptist Church in Texarkana in Miller County, Arkansas, later pastored by future Republican Governor Michael Dale \\"Mike\\" Huckabee. He and Gay attended the First United Methodist Church in downtown Little Rock for a short time. They left the Methodist congregation and, with other couples, established the fundamentalist Fellowship Bible Church. ==Business career== In 1961, having left the Air Force, White became an account executive for Merrill Lynch. He held that position until 1973 when he joined banker Bill Bowen in the management of Commercial National Bank in Little Rock. Bowen was a staunch Democrat who later opposed White politically though the two maintained a cordial business relationship. During this time, White would serve as the first director of the Little Rock Port Authority from 1972 to 1973. White was appointed by Democratic Governor David Pryor to head the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (AIDC). The industrial panel was originally created by Democratic Governor Orval Eugene Faubus and first directed by Winthrop Rockefeller, who in 1966 used his experience in the AIDC to get elected as Arkansas' first Republican governor since 1874. White left the AIDC after two years and became president of Capital Savings and Loan Association in Little Rock. Democrats later derided White's tenure at AIDC by pointing out that the number of industries which came to the state was much reduced from earlier and later years, a situation that Republicans attributed to a national recession. ==Campaign 1980== Early in 1980, White switched from Democratic to Republican affiliation to run for governor. First, he defeated former State Representative Marshall Chrisman, a businessman from Ozark in Franklin County, for the gubernatorial nomination. In a low-turnout open primary, White polled 5,867 votes (71.8 percent) to Chrisman's 2,310 (28.2 percent). Clinton also faced a stronger-than-expected challenger in his primary from Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer from Kingsland in Cleveland County in south Arkansas. Schwarzlose's 31 percent of the primary vote foreshadowed that Clinton could be in trouble for the upcoming general election. Despite this, it was widely expected that Clinton would win the election. White hired Paula Unruh of Tulsa to manage the campaign. She decided to focus upon (1) Clinton's unpopular increase in the cost of automobile registration tags and by (2) the Carter administration's sending thousands of Cuban refugees, some unruly, to a detention camp at Fort Chaffee, outside Fort Smith in Sebastian County in western Arkansas. Her decision paid big dividends, as White won with 435,684 votes (51.9 percent) to Clinton's 403,242 (48.1 percent). White won fifty-one of the state's seventy-five counties. A. Lynn Lowe of Texarkana, Clinton's Republican opponent in 1978, by contrast, had won only six counties. White was the second Republican ever elected governor in Arkansas since reconstruction. ==Two years as governor== White appointed numerous Arkansas Republicans to state positions. Former gubernatorial nominee Ken Coon was named to head the Arkansas Employment Security Division. Another former gubernatorial candidate, Len E. Blaylock of Perry County was named appointments secretary. Blaylock, who had a reputation as an extremely competent administrator, screened applicants for state positions. Former State Representative Preston Bynum of Siloam Springs in usually Republican Benton County in northwestern Arkansas, became White's chief aide. Harold L. Gwatney, an automobile dealer in Jacksonville, was named to the coveted position of adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard. White also depended on the advice of his legislative counsel, State Representative Carolyn Pollan of Fort Smith. New to the legislature with the White administration was Judy Petty of Little Rock, who had waged a nationally watched campaign against former U.S. Representative Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas' 2nd congressional district in 1974. White signed a law which required the teaching of creationism in Arkansas public schools, along with the theory of evolution. The law was subsequently overturned in 1982 in the court case McLean v. Arkansas. White also created a controversy within his own party in 1981, when he appointed Orval Faubus, a former Democratic governor, to head the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs. ==Re-election loss and later career== White was unable to secure a hold on the governorship. Chrisman and a third candidate, nutritionist Connie Voll of Lonoke, challenged him in the 1982 primary. Voll was the first woman to seek the GOP nomination for governor and the second to seek the party nomination for a statewide office since Leona Troxell. Clinton then defeated him in a rematch of the 1980 contest during the general election: 431,855 (54.7 percent) to 357,496 (45.3 percent). White won only nineteen counties in the 1982 rematch, which occurred in a nationally Democratic year when the nation was in a recession. After his defeat, White supported the selection of a former Rockefeller supporter, Morris S. Arnold, a law professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, to succeed the temporary state party Chairman Bob Cohee, originally of Baxter County. Cohee had become acting chairman on the death of Harlan Holleman in March 1982 and had resigned a federal position to work all year for White's unsuccessful reelection. Arnold defeated Cohee, but the Republican State Central Committee would not disclose the secret-ballot vote. Arnold did not serve the full two-year term and was succeeded by first vice-chairman Robert \\"Bob\\" Leslie. Arkansas gubernatorial terms became four years with the 1986 general election. In 1986, Faubus unsuccessfully challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination. White defeated former Lieutenant Governor Maurice L. Britt in the Republican primary. In the third White v. Clinton race, Clinton again easily prevailed, once again having benefited from a nationally Democratic year. White's loss in this election dramatically damaged his political image, making it very unlikely that he could win the governorship again. He returned to First Commercial Bank in Little Rock after his 1986 defeat as senior vice president until his retirement from the bank in 1998. White declined to seek the Republican nomination for governor again in 1990 and instead supported Sheffield Nelson in his primary race against U.S. Representative Tommy F. Robinson. That year, Clinton won election as governor for the fifth time; two years later he would become President of the United States. Without sufficient support and resources to run for elected office again, White left elective politics but remained active in Republican affairs. ==State banking commissioner and death== From 1998 to 2003, White served as Arkansas Banking Commissioner, an appointment from Governor Mike Huckabee. Although he was appointed on what was supposed to be a temporary basis, he remained in the post until shortly before his death from a heart attack in 2003, about two weeks before his seventieth birthday. White's time in the Banking Department was noted by his practice of visiting all of Arkansas' state-chartered banks at least once a year. White is interred at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock. The Arkansas Republican Party began hosting the \\"'Hi, I'm Frank White' Awards Dinner\\" in 2006 to honor those persons who have done the most to build the Arkansas GOP. ==See also== * List of Governors of Arkansas ==References== ==External links== * Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture entry: Frank White * Finding Aid, Frank White Papers, UA Little Rock Center for Arkansas History and Culture ==Further reading== * Arkansas Gazette, August 5, November 13, 22, 1981; October 29, December 5, 1982. * Who's Who in the South and Southwest, 18th edition (1982‚Äì1983), p. 803\\\\. * Arkansas Election Statistics, 1980 and 1982 (Little Rock: Secretary of State). * Shreveport Times, January 7, 1982.

He proposed that stories of fairies originated with an aboriginal race that occupied the British Isles before Celts and other groups arrived. ==Early life== David MacRitchie was the younger son of William Dawson MacRitchie and Elizabeth Elder MacRitchie. He was born in Edinburgh and attended the Edinburgh Southern Academy, the Edinburgh Institute and the University of Edinburgh. He did not gain a degree but qualified as a Chartered Accountant. His father had been a surgeon in the East India Company.Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society, 1925, p. 49.\\"Review of Scottish culture\\", Issue 10, National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, 1997, p. 131. ==Career as folklorist== In 1888 MacRitchie founded the Gypsy Lore Society to study the history and lore of Gypsies.\\"The English Gypsy Lore Society\\", The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 34, No. 134, Oct. ‚Äì Dec. 1921, p. 399. He was also a member of several folklore societies. In 1914 he joined the Council of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, serving as vice-president from 1917 ‚Äì 1920. He was noted for his interest in archaeology, being appointed as a trustee for Lord Abercromby's endowment for an Archaeology department at the University of Edinburgh. He was also a member of the Scottish Arts Club and Vice-president of the Philosophical Institution. In 1922 until his death he served as the treasurer of the Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society.Records of The Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society ==Fairy euhemerism== David MacRitchie was a prominent proponent of the euhemeristic origin of fairies, a theory tracable to the early 19th century that considers fairies in British folklore to have been rooted in a historical pygmy, dwarf or short-sized aboriginal race, that lived during Neolithic Britain or even earlier.Bihet, Francesca (2019) Late-Victorian Folklore Studies and Fairy- Lore. In: Betwixt and Between, 18-19 May 2019, Museum of Witchcraft and Magic, Boscastle. http://eprints.chi.ac.uk/4685/ ===Origins=== MacRitchie is often credited as being the founder of the euhemerist school regarding British fairies.Scottish fairy belief: a history Edward J. Cowan, Dundurn Press Ltd., 2001, p. 21. However, historian Edward J. Cowan has noted that the folklorist John Francis Campbell first founded this school of thought about 30 years before MacRitchie.Cowan, 2001, pp. 21‚Äì22.MacRitchie himself acknowledged the earlier work of Campbell in his Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893).The idea is also found in Sven Nilsson's The primitive inhabitants of Scandinavia (1868). Carole G. Silver, Professor of English at Yeshiva University has also traced the euhemerist theory of fairies further back to Walter Scott in his Letters on Demonology (1830).\\"On the Origin of Fairies: Victorians, Romantics, and Folk Belief\\", Carole Silver, Browning Institute Studies, Vol. 14, The Victorian Threshold, 1986, p. 143. With the emergence of anthropological schools in the late 19th century, various renowned anthropologists such as Edward Burnett Tylor (1871) became proponents of the euhemeristic origin of fairies, in direct conflict with the religious or psychological theories of their origin.Silver, 1986, p. 149. ===The theory=== Ainu from David MacRitchie's The Testimony of Tradition (1890). MacRitchie believed the native inhabitants of Britain looked similar. Fairy Euhemerism, as developed by MacRitchie attempts to rationally explain the origin of fairies in British folklore and regards fairies as being a folk-memory of a \\"small-statured pre- Celtic race\\" or what Tylor theorised as possible folk memories of the aborigines of Britain.The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries, by W.Y. Evans- Wentz, 1911, p. 234 Tylor, \\"Primitive Culture\\", 1871, pp. 385‚Äì386. MacRitchie's theory subsequently became known in the late 19th century by folklorists as the \\"Ethnological or Pygmy Theory\\".Wentz, 1911, pp. 234‚Äì235. The euhemeristic theory of fairies became considerably popular through MacRitchie's key works The Testimony of Tradition (1890) and Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893).\\"Were Fairies an Earlier Race of Men?\\", Canon J. A. Macculloch, Folklore, Vol. 43, No. 4, 31 December 1932, p. 366.\\"Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics\\", Part 9, James Hastings, Kessinger Publishing (reprint), 2003. p. 126. Different theories, however, in the late 19th century and early 20th century surfaced concerning the racial origin of the proposed dwarf aborigines of Britain and these theories ranged from proposing that they were real African Pygmies, Eskimos or a short statured Mediterranean race.\\"Folklore and the fantastic in nineteenth-century British fiction\\", Jason Marc Harris, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, pp.64‚Äì66.The fairy tales of Oscar Wilde, Jarlath Killeen, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, p. 137.The different racial theories are found discussed at length by T. Rice Holmes in his Ancient Britain and the invasions of Julius Caesar (1907). MacRitchie himself argued in his Testimony of Tradition, under a chapter subheading entitled \\"A Hairy Race\\" (p. 167), that they were somewhat connected to the Lapps or Eskimos, but were a distinct race because of their very long beards, concluding: \\"one seems to see the type of a race that was even more like the Ainu than the Lapp, or the Eskimo, although closely connected in various ways with all of these\\" (p. 173). In MacRitchie's view the indigenous population of Britain were thus a \\"quasi-European\\" Ainu race, with minor Mongoloid traits who he considered ancestral to the Picts, a view earlier proposed by Walter Scott.Scott pioneered the \\"Lapp‚àíDwarf parallel\\", writing \\"there seems reason to conclude that these duergar [dwarfs] were originally nothing else than the diminutive natives of the Lappish, Lettish and Finnish nations.\\"Science, Vol. 21, No. 523, 10 February 1893, pp. 82‚Äì83.Cowan, 2001, p. 21. The identification of fairies with Picts MacRitichie based primarily on the earlier accounts by Adam of Bremen and the Historia Norwegi√¶ which describe the Picts of Orkney as \\"only a little exceeding pygmies in stature\\".Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), footnote 51 MacRitchie also discovered through The Orcadian Sketch-Book by Walter Traill Dennison (1880) that legends across Scotland describe the homes (usually underground dwellings) of the fairies as \\"Pict's Houses\\" and so he believed the Picts were literally the basis of fairies in British folklore.The testimony of tradition, David MacRitchie, Paul. Trench, Tr√ºbner, 1890, pp.60‚Äì67.Cowan, 2001, p. 21. In Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), The Northern Trolls (1898) and The Aborigines of Shetland and Orkney (1924) MacRitchie attempted to further identify the fairies of British folklore with the Finfolk of Orkney mythology, the Trows of Shetland myth, the Fianna of Old Irish Literature and the Trolls as well as the Svart√°lfar and Svart√°lfaheimr (elves or dwarfs) of Norse mythology. A 12th-century Irish manuscript is found referenced in Fians, Fairies and Picts which equates the Fianna to fairies, but this is one of the few literary sources MacRitchie used as evidence; instead he turned to philology and comparative mythology.Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893), footnote 21 ====Support==== MacRitchie's rationalisation of fairies, as having their basis as a historical population of diminutive size, won over much support from anthropologists from the late 19th century who questioned the religious or psychological origin of fairies.Silver, 1986, pp. 47‚Äì52.Professor J. Kollmann, of Basel, in his Pygmden in Europa (1894), argues for the existence of a European pygmy race in Neolithic times A notable proponent of the theory who had read MacRitchie's earlier works published in the Celtic Review was Grant Allen, who became convinced that fairies were modelled on an indigenous population of Britain, specifically the Neolithic long barrow makers.Macculloch, 1932, p. 362.\\"Who were the Fairies\\", Cornhill Magazine, 1881, xliii. 338f. The archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins found MacRitchie's views also appealing, since in his Early Man in Britain and His Place in the Tertiary Period (1880) he considered Upper Paleolithic culture across Europe (including Britain) to have been founded by a proto-Eskimo or Lapp race, a view at the time which was popularised after the discovery of \\"Chancelade Man\\", in southwestern France by Leo Testut in 1889.\\"The Arrival of Man in Britain in the Pleistocene Age\\", W. Boyd Dawkins, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 40, Jul. ‚Äì Dec. 1910, pp. 233‚Äì263.Recherches anthropologiques sur le Squelette quaternaire de Chancelade, Bull. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Lyon, 1889. Scientific consensus after the 1930s, however, agreed that the remains of \\"Chancelade Man\\" were Cro-Magnon; however, some modern anthropologists still propose Cro- Magnon morphological traits appear distinctly in Lapps.Niskanen, M. (2002). The Origin of the Baltic-Finns from the Physical Anthropological Point of View. Mankind Quarterly Volume XLIII Number 2, Winter. Within folklore, MacRitchie's euhemeristic view of fairies developed a racialist school which considered that the fairies and other beings such as elves and goblins of British myth represented primitive pre-Aryans, a view proposed most notably by John S. Stuart Glennie, Laurence Waddell and Alfred Cort Haddon.Phoenician Origin of the Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons (1924, 2nd ed. 1925), in this work Waddell cites MacRitchie.Silver, 1986, p. 150.Folk Memory Or the Continuity of British Archaeology by Walter Johnson (1908) is another work in this vein. According to Haddon: \\"fairy tales were stories told by men of the Iron Age of events which happened to men of the Bronze Age in their conflicts with men of the Neolithic Age\\".Quoted in \\"Fairies in nineteenth-century art and literature\\", Nicola Bown, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 166. In both Haddon's and Waddell's view, the fairies or other beings of British folklore were based on the Neolithic inhabitants of Britain. Among folklorists who considered, supported or praised MacRitchie's views were Laurence Gomme, who in 1892 published Ethnology in Folklore, which argued folklore preserved a strong racial history of conquered or replaced indigenous peoples. The folklorist Charles G. Leland, who positively reviewed MacRitchie's book The Testimony of Tradition (1890), wrote \\"The book should be of exceptional interest to every folk-lorist, both on account of its subject-matter and also on account of the manner in which it is treated\\".The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 3, No. 11, Oct. ‚Äì Dec. 1890, pp. 319‚Äì320. ====Criticism==== MacRitchie's theories of fairies sparked criticism from proponents of the religious or psychological origin of fairies.Macculloch; 1932, p. 366 ff; Silver, 1986, pp. 143‚Äì152. Walter Evans-Wentz strongly criticised MacRitchie's theory in his The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (1911).The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries This prompted MacRitchie to respond to such criticisms in several articles published in the Celtic Review (October 1909, January 1910).\\"A New Solution of the Fairy Problem\\", David MacRitchie, The Celtic Review, Vol. 6, No. 22, Oct. 1909, pp. 160‚Äì176. It was mostly however MacRitchie's theory that the Picts were a dwarf or short statured race which was strongly rejected.Cowan, 2001, pp. 21‚Äì35. Most historians of the day rejected Mackenzie's \\"Pygmy-Pict\\" theory. T. Rice Holmes, for example, mocked MacRitchie's claims, considering them eccentric and baseless since no archaeological evidence had ever proven of a \\"race of pre-neolithic or even prehistoric pygmies existed in this country\\".Ancient Britain and the invasions of Julius Caesar, Clarendon Press, 1907, p. 393. Critics attempted to pick holes in MacRitchie's claims on mythology; for example, Evans-Wentz noted that the Fianna of Irish myth are sometimes described as \\"giants\\". MacRitchie acknowledged these criticisms in his own writings but attempted to work around them and provide solutions: Therefore in MacRitchie's view the Irish myths and folkloric accounts which describe the Fianna as \\"giants\\" only did so in a non-literal figurative sense to describe their savage type nature, not size. This idea was later expanded upon in his The Savages of Gaelic Tradition (1920) yet was not well received by contemporary folklorists.Celtic Review, \\"The Pygmy-Fairy theory examined\\" (June 1921). However, ancient authors such as Macrobius shared MacRitchie's beliefs that the \\"giants\\" of mythology were not giants in size, but huge in impiety (or their primitiveness).Macrobius well explains the meaning of \\" giants\\" as distinguished for their enormous impiety : \\"Gigantes autem, quid aliud fuisse credendum est, quam Hominum quandam impiam gentem, Deos negantem ?\\" Saturnal. I. 20. According to MacRitchie there were also \\"two\\" Pictish races, the former were the aboriginal dark Lappish or Ainu race, while a later white-skinned, red-headed group invaded them, who he considered the Caledonians.Ancient and modern Britons, a retrospect, Vol. I, 1884; see also \\"Memories of the Picts\\", David MacRitchie, The Scottish Antiquary, or, Northern Notes and Queries, Vol. 14, No. 55 (Jan. 1900), pp. 121‚Äì139. ==British origin of Gypsies== In his Ancient and Modern Britons, MacRitchie claimed that the Gypsies were not of foreign origin, but were in fact the more conservative element of the native British population who had retained their nomadic way of life while the majority adopted a settled lifestyle. He further claimed that the ancient Britons were a dark- skinned people, a claim which elicited the interest of Afrocentrist authors, but has no support amongst mainstream historians or scientists. Modern genomic research indicates they originated in India. ==References== ==Works== Accounts of the Gypsies of India (1886) Publications by MacRitchie include: * Ancient and Modern Britons, a Retrospect, 1884 * Accounts of the Gypsies of India, 1886 * The Testimony of Tradition, 1890 * The Ainos, 1892 * The Underground Life, 1892 * Fians, Fairies and Picts, 1893 * Scottish Gypsies under the Stewarts 1894 * Pygmies in Northern Scotland, 1892 * Some Hebridean Antiquities, 1895 * Diary of a Tour through Great Britain, (editor) 1897 * The Northern Trolls, 1898 * Memories of the Picts, 1900 * Underground Dwellings, 1900 * Fairy Mounds, 1900 * Shelta, the Caird's Language, 1901 * Hints of Evolution in Tradition, 1902 * The Arctic Voyage of 1653, 1909 * Celtic Civilisation, No date * Druids and Mound Dwellers, 1910 * Les Pygmies chez les Anciens Egyptiens et les Hebreux (with S.T.H.

The OAC curriculum was codified by the Ontario Ministry of Education in Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior (OS:IS) and its revisions. The Ontario education system had five years of secondary education, known as Grade 13 from 1921 to 1988; grade 13 was replaced by OAC for students starting high school (grade 9) in 1984. OAC continued to act as a fifth year of secondary education until it was phased out in 2003 ==History== The fifth year in the Ontario secondary school system had existed in Ontario for 82 years, from 1921 to 2003, first as Grade 13, and then as the Ontario Academic Credit. The first attempt to reform the education system in Ontario was initiated in 1945, with the Royal Commission on Education, which proposed a three-tiered education system with six years of elementary education, followed by four years of secondary education, and culminating in three years of junior colleges. However, the commission's report was shelved after five years, in part due its potential to re-open the politically sensitive issue of separate school funding and in part due to the Minister of Education's prior interference in curriculum redesign a year earlier. The threat to the fifth year of secondary school education in Ontario grew significantly during the 1960s, with growing opposition to the grade 13 departmental examinations from parents. This led to the establishment of the Grade 13 Study Committee in 1964 by Minister of Education Bill Davis, which recommended the elimination of both the departmental examinations, and grade 13. A subsequent recommendation in 1968, in the Hall-Dennis Report, also called for the elimination of grade 13. In spite of these recommendations, however, grade 13 was maintained by the Ontario government. A significant opposition amongst parents, businesses and universities regarding the education reforms had surfaced by the 1970s, in which they believed there was a decline in academic standards, a lack of focus in the curriculum, and lax discipline in schools. Combined with financially pressured school boards beginning to call for the abolition of grade 13 as a means of financial restraint, this resulted in the government reevaluating its secondary education system. The resulting document was the Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior (OS:IS), which had called for the formal elimination of grade 13, without formally eliminating the fifth year of secondary education. Acting upon the recommendations of the document, Ontario formally eliminated grade 13 in 1984, and introduced the Ontario Academic Credit system. The new system allowed for students to graduate from secondary schools in four years, while also maintaining the fifth year, known as OAC, which had courses catering for students planning to proceed with post-secondary education. Despite the fact that students were able to graduate from the secondary school system in four years, a fifth year of secondary education continued to persist in Ontario, with fewer than 15 percent of students exercising the option to graduate in four years, with reports that between 20 percent and 25 percent of students choose to repeat one or more OAC years. Another Royal Commission on Learning, set up in 1995 by the then-NDP provincial government, had recommended the elimination of OAC. The incoming Progressive Conservative provincial government acted upon the recommendations of the commission in 1998, but students still in the five-year system would continue in the OAC system until they graduated. The motivation for phasing out OAC was largely thought of as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservatives, and to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the provinces. The reforms led to a new, standardized curriculum documented in Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements (OSS). The OAC year was replaced with an extra ten days of schooling in each lower grade, and the material was integrated into the earlier years of education. The last graduating class of OAC was in 2003. ==Course load== There were two high school diplomas in Ontario, the Secondary School Graduation Diploma (SSGD) which was awarded after Grade 12 and the Secondary School Honours Graduation Diploma (SSHGD) awarded after Grade 13. This practice ended with the replacement of both diplomas in 1988 with the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) under OS:IS. OS:IS more formally allowed for the completion of schooling after only 12 grades. Under OS:IS, OAC year was the final year of high school in Ontario. OAC courses were the highest level courses in Ontario high schools until the formal elimination of the Ontario Academic Credit. To enter university, students were required to complete 30 high school credits (courses can have different credit values, but most courses were worth 1 credit; some courses were compulsory and there were other restrictions), 6 of which had to be at the OAC level. Assuming that one had taken the necessary prerequisite courses, one could complete an OAC course before the OAC year, and so in many schools it was common for Grade 11 or Grade 12 students to have taken some OAC courses. Students who completed these requirements in 4 years of high school were permitted to graduate; this practice was known as fast- tracking, finishing Grade 12 in four years with 30 credits if the student was college bound. Under the old Grade 13 system, the SSGD represented 27 credits and the SSHGD usually represented 33 credits (however, as long as you could pass the 6 credits required for an SSHGD, the Ontario school system was required to award the OSSHGD, even if you had less than 33 credits overall). A minority of students completed the old program in four years by completing eight credits per year and one summer school credit (usually Grade 12 mathematics, as each maths course had the previous year as prerequisite). Students with an average of 80 percent or higher in six OAC courses were named Ontario Scholar. The award continues to exist today, although it requires the student to have 80 percent or higher in six grade 12 courses. ==Consequences of elimination== The elimination of the fifth year of high school education in Ontario led to a number of consequences, most notably the double cohorts in 2003, in which an unusually high proportion of students graduated in Ontario. Since the elimination of OAC, some have noted that a greater proportion of students have entered post-secondary education. However, in a paper published by Harry Krashinsky of the University of Toronto, the author found that the elimination of OAC had a large and negative impact on academic performance in university. ===Double cohorts=== The elimination of OAC led to a spike in more than 100,000 students graduating in 2003, with the last OAC (OS:IS) class and the first Grade 12 (OSS) class graduating in the same year. This strained many Ontario post-secondary institutions, as the spike in students forced the institutions to either construct or rent new buildings for student housing. With the increase in students entering post-secondary education, the provincial government set aside additional funding for colleges and universities to build more infrastructure such as residences and classrooms. They also had to provide more resources such as upgrading libraries, adding more study areas, creating new programs, and hiring additional professors and teaching assistants. For those who are unable to enter post-secondary institutions, the provincial government allocated more funding for the apprentice program. The spike in students graduating in 2003 had also led to more competitive admission standards in most Ontario universities along with arbitrarily short-lived higher standards to graduate from universities. Some students under OS:IS who feared that they might not be able to gain admission to the university of their choice as a result of the double cohort decided to fast-track to graduate before 2003; as well, some students under OSS decided to take an extra year of high school to graduate in 2004 or delayed application to post-secondary institutions. Double-cohort students who chose the latter options in their turn affected those in the year after them, creating a ripple effect. In June 2007, a cascade double-cohort effect occurred at universities and the job market, as double cohort students who were finishing their undergraduate studies in April competed for graduate spaces in universities or employment in the job market. ===Drinking age=== The elimination of OAC resulted in the majority of incoming first-year students in Ontario universities to drop from 19 to 18 years of age. This created a legal liability to universities as the majority of first-year students were now below the legal drinking age (it is 19 in Ontario). This has forced the universities to eliminate or police many frosh-week events and traditions that allegedly encouraged drinking and has banned the consumption of alcohol at most frosh-week events. Queen's University's Student Orientation Activities Review Board (SOARB) noted in 2005 that \\"first-year students seemed to show more desire to drink than those of the past few years. Student drinking, prior to attendance, compromised events at which no alcohol was available... The Board wonders if there is merit to making the evening hours busier to avoid allowing time to \\"pre-drink\\" before events.\\" With a significant minority of students below the legal drinking age, 18-year-olds are legally excluded from campus events and social activities. The temporal nature of this exclusion and the stress associated with establishing a social network in an unfamiliar environment creates intense pressure for underage students to either find ways to subvert the Ontario drinking laws (by purchasing fake IDs, using real IDs of other people, or drinking in private residences with ill-gotten alcohol) or sacrifice relationships with those of legal drinking age. ==Assessment of elimination== Patrick Brady and Philip Allingham of Lakehead University have argued that the provincial government's attempt to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the continent's 12 grades system has only been partially successful. While the fifth year of secondary education was formally eliminated, both have noted that the fifth year in secondary schools is still a norm in Ontario, with students in Ontario still opting to take a fifth year in secondary school, colloquially known as the victory lap. In the first few years after OAC had been eliminated, more than 32 percent of students returned for a fifth year. The percentage of students who opt for a fifth year has since decreased between 15 percent to 20 percent, with some predicting it to level out around that level. In the 2007-2008 year, students over the age of 19 made up 3.7 percent of all secondary day school enrolment in Ontario. Both Brady and Allingham note that the motivations behind the victory lap can be traced to the province's history of a fifth year of secondary school education, making it a basic assumption of secondary school life for students in Ontario. They also note that it may represent a form of transition anxiety, as students seek to prolong their secondary education, which can be seen as a safe environment, or to acquire further maturity before moving on to their post-secondary education. They also note how the centrality of secondary school life can make a student prolong it. While they found it was not a universal phenomenon, they noted a number of students who returned for a fifth year primarily to continue their participation in the school's non-academic programming. In Brady's and Allingham's study, they had also found differences between genders. While close to half of male participants in their study opted to spend a fifth year in secondary schools, only one in five females choose to do so. They also noted that the motivations of both genders differed, with females opting to victory lap in order to gain additional academic credits, while males primarily opted for a fifth year in order to participate in sports and to gain maturity. ==See also== *Education in Canada *Education in Ontario == References == Category:1984 establishments in Ontario Category:2003 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Education in Ontario Category:Educational years ","title":"Ontario Academic Credit"},{"id":"299516","text":"OAC or OAc may refer to: ==Organizations== * Objectivist Academic Center, an educational institution founded by the Ayn Rand Institute * Ohio Arts Council * Ohio Athletic Conference, an NCAA Division III athletic conference * One America Committee * Online Archive of California * Ontario Academic Credit * Ontario Agricultural College * Ontario Arts Council * Orthodox Anglican Church, a denomination of the Continuing Anglican movement in America, part of the Orthodox Anglican Communion * Orthodox Anglican Communion, a worldwide Continuing Anglican body of which the Orthodox Anglican Church is a part ==Other== * Acetoxy group (OAc), a chemical functional group * Object Action Complex * Oral anti-coagulant * Amtrak station code for Oakland Coliseum Station * Olivetolic acid cyclase, an enzyme ","title":"OAC"},{"id":"299522","text":"David Brock (born July 23, 1962) is an American liberal political consultant, author, and commentator who founded the media watchdog group Media Matters for America. He has been described by Time as \\"one of the most influential operatives in the Democratic Party\\". Brock began his career as a right-wing investigative reporter during the 1990s. He wrote the book The Real Anita Hill and the Troopergate story, which led to Paula Jones filing a lawsuit against Bill Clinton. In the late-1990s, he switched sides, aligning himself with the Democratic Party and in particular with Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2004, he founded Media Matters for America, a non-profit organization which describes itself as a \\"progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media\\". He has since also founded super PACs called American Bridge 21st Century and Correct the Record, has become a board member of the super PAC Priorities USA Action and has been elected chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). ==Early life and education== David Brock was born in Hackensack, New Jersey and was adopted by Dorothea and Raymond Brock.Stated in Brock's Blinded by the RightLei, Richard. \\"The Reliable Source\\", The Washington Post, August 1, 2004. Accessed September 28, 2018. He has a younger sister, Regina, who was also adopted. Brock was raised Catholic. His father, whom Brock has described as \\"a Pat Buchanan conservative\\", was a marketing executive. Brock grew up in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, where he went to Our Lady of the Assumption School, and later attended Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey. During his sophomore year of high school, Brock's family moved to the Dallas, Texas, area where Brock attended Newman Smith High School. Brock became editor of his high school newspaper, which he says he \\"fashioned into a crusading liberal weekly in the middle of the Reaganite Sunbelt\\".Brock, David. \\"Blinded by the right: the conscience of an ex-conservative\\", p. 14.

Accessed November 25, 2017. \\"David Brock... Born: July 23, 1962, in Hackensack, N.J.; grew up on Windsor Street and Sussex Road in Wood-Ridge, N.J.\\" Brock attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked as a reporter and editor for The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper. Brock arrived at college as a liberal Democrat, but at Berkeley he was \\"repelled by the culture of doctrinaire leftism\\" and turned to the political right. The turning point came with a column supporting the US invasion of Grenada that he wrote for The Daily Californian and that led to demands he resign from the newspaper staff. \\"I thought it was McCarthyism of the left,\\" Brock later said. \\"I thought it was extremely intolerant.\\" He then founded a neoconservative weekly, the Berkeley Journal. He graduated from Berkeley with a B.A. in history in 1985. ==Journalism career== ===Conservative journalism=== While he was at Berkeley, Brock contributed an op-ed to The Wall Street Journal entitled \\"Combating Those Campus Marxists\\". It drew the attention of John Podhoretz, who at the time was the editor of Insight, a weekly newsmagazine published by The Washington Times. Podhoretz flew Brock to Washington, D.C., for an interview and hired him as a writer of the weekly conservative news magazine Insight on the News, a sister publication of The Washington Times, a job Brock took up in 1986. After working at Insight, Brock spent some time as a fellow at The Heritage Foundation. ===The Real Anita Hill=== In March 1992, in a 17,000-word article for The American Spectator, Brock challenged the claims of Anita Hill, who had accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Shortly thereafter Brock became a full-time staff member at that publication. In 1993, Brock expanded his article into a book, The Real Anita Hill. Brock's description of Hill in the book as \\"a bit nutty and a bit slutty\\" was widely quoted. The book became a best-seller. It was later attacked in a book review in The New Yorker by Jane Mayer, a reporter for The New Yorker, and Jill Abramson, who was at that time a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. The two later expanded their article into the book Strange Justice, which cast Anita Hill in a much more sympathetic light. It, too, was a best-seller. Brock replied to their book with a book review of his own in The American Spectator.. In that review, he asserted that Mayer and Abramson had no evidence to claim that Clarence Thomas was a habitual user of pornography. Later, in his book Blinded By the Right, he wrote, \\"When I wrote those words, I knew they were false. I put a lie in print.\\" ===Troopergate=== In a January 1994 The American Spectator story about Bill Clinton's time as governor of Arkansas, Brock, by then on staff at the magazine, made accusations that bred Troopergate. Among other things, the story contained the first printed reference to Paula Jones, referring to a woman named \\"Paula\\" who state troopers said offered to be Clinton's partner. Jones called Brock's account of her encounter with Clinton \\"totally wrong\\", and she later sued Clinton for sexual harassment, a case that became entangled in the independent counsel's investigation of the Whitewater controversy, and set in motion a series of developments that led to the exposure of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and, ultimately, to Clinton's impeachment trial. The story received an award later that year from Joseph Farah's Western Journalism Center, and was partially responsible for a rise in the magazine's circulation. ===The Seduction of Hillary Rodham=== After the success of The Real Anita Hill, Simon & Schuster's then-conservative-focused Free Press subsidiary paid Brock a large advance to write a book about Hillary Clinton. The expectation was that it would be a takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill Clinton. The project, however, took a different turn, and the resulting book, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham, proved to be largely sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton. Given the large advance and tight one-year deadline by Free Press, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In Blinded by the Right (2002), Brock said that he had reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against the Clintons, could not find any evidence of wrongdoing and did not want to make any more misleading claims. Brock further said that his former friends in right-wing politics shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack the Clintons. National Review proposed another theory: since \\"no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock\\", he could not collect the kind of information he was after. National Review also suggested that while writing the book, Brock had been \\"seduced\\" by Sidney Blumenthal, a champion and friend of the Clinton circle. When the book came out, it was widely criticized for not breaking any new ground. John Balzar, reviewing the book in the Los Angeles Times, called it \\"[e]xhaustive to the point of exhaustion\\" and \\"predictably critical but unexpectedly measured, at least in comparison to what Beltway gossips anticipated\\". James B. Stewart, reviewing the book in The New York Times, said that Brock had \\"tried to do his subject justice in the broadest sense\\" but added that \\"[a]t times he goes too far,\\" often \\"echo[ing] her apologists\\" and \\"dismiss[ing] or rationaliz[ing] the sometimes powerful evidence that Hillary Rodham Clinton has lied...by invoking a relativism rooted in Republican precedents.\\" ==Changing sides== The Nation has described Brock as a \\"conservative journalistic assassin turned progressive empire-builder\\" while National Review has called him a \\"right-wing assassin turned left-wing assassin\\" and Politico has profiled him as a \\"former right-wing journalist-turned-pro-Clinton crusader\\". In July 1997, Esquire magazine published a confessional piece by Brock entitled \\"Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man\\" in which he recanted much of what he said in his two best-known American Spectator articles and criticized his own reporting methods. Discouraged at the reaction his Hillary Clinton biography received, he said, \\"I ... want out. David Brock the Road Warrior of the Right is dead.\\" Four months later, The American Spectator declined to renew his employment contract, under which he was being paid over $300,000 per year. Writing again for Esquire in April 1998, Brock apologized to Clinton for his muckraking journalism about Troopergate. In 2001, Brock accused one of his former sources, Terry Wooten, of leaking FBI files for use in his book about Anita Hill. Brock defended his betrayal of a confidential source by saying, \\"I've concluded that what I was involved in wasn't journalism, it was a political operation, and I was part of it.... So I don't think the normal rules of journalism would apply to what I was doing\\". === Blinded by the Right === Brock's book Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative was published in 2002. In this book, an \\"outgrowth\\" of Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man, Brock charted what the Daily Beast called his \\"remarkable metamorphosis to ardent acolyte from sworn enemy of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\\" Brock apologized for his attacks on the Clintons and Anita Hill and claimed that he had now risen above character assassination. He wrote that he had been \\"a mad dog, an emotional monster,\\" \\"a whore for the cash,\\" \\"a Jew in Hitler's army,\\" and \\"a witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine,\\" and asserted that he hadn't known \\"what good reporting was.\\" Many critics responded with skepticism to Brock's claim to have reformed himself. The reviewer for The Washington Post wrote that Brock \\"quotes the worst things critics said about him, and agrees with every word\\". Christopher Hitchens, in The Nation, called Brock's book \\"an exercise in self-love, disguised as an exercise in self-abnegation,\\" and declared that Brock was failing to state the truth. These and other critics noted that Brock, while claiming to feel remorse for his attacks on the Clintons and professing to have put personal assaults behind him, now seemed as eager to go after targets on the right as he had once gone after targets on the left. Hitchens responded with disgust, for example, to Brock's \\"coarse attack\\" in the book on Juanita Broaddrick, who had accused Bill Clinton of rape. Hitchens was particularly harsh, stating that Brock \\"inserts a completely gratuitous slander against a decent woman, all of whose independent assertions have survived meticulous fact-checking\\". Many readers on the left, however, greeted the book with enthusiasm, and eagerly welcomed Brock. This was especially true of the Clintons. Shortly after the book's publication, Bill Clinton phoned Brock at home and praised it lavishly. Later, according to Politico, \\"Brock was invited to the former president's Harlem office where he was shocked to discover Clinton had purchased dozens of copies ‚Äî and stuffed them into a big cabinet\\". Clinton, it turned out, was mailing them to friends across the country. Clinton \\"insisted\\" that Brock contact his speaking agent and give talks around the country attacking conservatives. According to The Nation, Democratic donors \\"loved Brock's conversion story, particularly since he'd been inside the machine they hoped to replicate.\\" Brock's book is seen as having propelled him into a favorable position among the Democratic Party establishment. ===The Republican Noise Machine=== Brock directly addressed the right-wing \\"machine\\" in his 2004 book, The Republican Noise Machine, in which he detailed an alleged interconnected, concerted effort to raise the profile of conservative opinions in the press through false accusations of liberal media bias, dishonest and highly partisan columnists, partisan news organizations and academic studies, and other methods. Publishers Weekly described it as a \\"blistering j'accuse\\" that, compared to Blinded by the Right, was \\"a less gossipy and more systematic assault on the right-wing media juggernaut.\\" Brock, according to PW, depicted the mainstream media as being \\"cowed by spurious charges of 'liberal bias'\\" and as therefore having \\"abandoned their role as objective arbiters of truth in favor of an uncritical airing of partisan ideology in the name of 'balance.'\\" PW stated that Brock could not \\"be accused of nonpartisanship.\\" Also in 2004, he featured briefly in the BBC series The Power of Nightmares, where he stated that the Arkansas Project engaged in political terrorism. ==Political operative career== ===Media Matters for America=== In 2004, Brock founded the progressive media watchdog group Media Matters for America (MMA) which describes itself as being ‚Äúdedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.‚Äù Brock said that he founded the organization to combat the conservative journalism sector that he had once been a part of. He founded the group with help from the Center for American Progress. Initial donors included Leo Hindery, Susie Tompkins Buell, and James Hormel. Media Matters is known for its aggressive criticism of conservative journalists and media outlets, including its \\"War on Fox News.\\" The New York Times, in a 2008 profile, called MMA \\"a highly partisan research organization\\" and quoted Democratic operative James Carville as saying that MMA was \\"more effective than any single entity\\" on the left. Pollster Frank Luntz called MMA \\"one of the most destructive organizations associated with American politics today.\\" In a 2011 interview with Politico, Brock vowed to wage \\"guerrilla warfare and sabotage\\" against Fox News. When Brock proposed the idea of Media Matters, Hillary Clinton invited him to the Clintons' Chappaqua home to pitch the idea to potential donors. MMA, according to a 2015 article in The Daily Beast, \\"operates from a posh Washington office space with a multi-million-dollar budget and nearly 100 employees.\\" In 2014, The Nation stated that \\"Brock, in partnership with fundraiser Mary Pat Bonner‚Äîoften described as his secret weapon‚Äîhas turned out to be unparalleled at maintaining rich liberals' loyalty and support.\\" An insider told The Nation that Brock and Bonner \\"are probably the most effective major-individual-donor fundraising team ever assembled in the independent-expenditure progressive world.\\" It was reported in June 2015 that when the House Select Committee on Benghazi questioned Sidney Blumenthal, committee members asked no fewer than 45 questions about Brock and Media Matters. The committee was reportedly interested in Sidney Blumenthal's paid work for Brock's nonprofits, and in the question of \\"whether Blumenthal and Brock did anything improper as they helped Clinton manage the political fallout from the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of State.\\" ===Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign=== Brock was active in Hillary Clinton's campaign for the presidency in 2008. ===American Bridge 21st Century=== Brock announced in 2010 that he was forming a Super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, to help elect liberal Democrats, starting with the 2012 election cycle. In 2011, Brock founded the PAC, which seeks \\"to track every utterance of every major GOP candidate.\\" The Los Angeles Times described him as having \\"reinvented the art of opposition research.\\" The group's work reportedly \\"did so much damage to Republicans in the 2012 elections\\" that they sought to replicate Brock's efforts. In describing Brock's intentions for the super-PAC, The New York Times referred to Brock as a \\"prominent Democratic political operative\\" and New York Magazine referred to Brock's \\"hyperpartisanship.\\" The group has more than 80 staffers. It has researchers based in Washington, D.C., plus \\"a national network of professional trackers\\" who follow the moves and statements of every conceivable contender for the Republican nomination. The Nation has described American Bridge as \\"the natural next step\\" after MMA, explaining that \\"Brock took the Media Matters method‚Äîwhich involves monitoring virtually every word uttered by the right- wing media‚Äîand transferred it to the realm of Republican politicians.\\" Democratic operative Paul Begala told The Nation that in 2012 American Bridge \\"produced for us a 950-page book of every business deal of Mitt Romney's career. We spent something like $65 million [2012 election], and I believe every single ad was in some ways informed by Brock's research.\\" In 2019, the American Bridge PAC disclosed $250,000 in independent expenditures for anti- Trump advertisements, according to the filings posted to the FEC's website. Earlier in the year, the organisation announced it will launch a $50 million effort to \\"weaken\\" Trump in Midwest states for the 2020 presidential election. Brock's efforts against the Republican Party have been criticised and referred to as \\"useless\\" by Democratic operatives. ===Correct the Record=== In late 2013 Brock founded Correct the Record, described by The New York Times as Hillary Clinton's \\"own personal media watchdog,\\" keeping track of all negative news surrounding her. Brock had first come up with the idea for the group that summer. \\"Having left the State Department,\\" he said, \\"Clinton didn't have the kind of robust operation that one would have if one was holding public office. That's where I saw the need.\\" The organization, whose staff \\"is crammed into a newsroom-style bullpen in the back corner of the offices of American Bridge 21st Century,\\" \\"keeps constant watch for any conceivable attacks against her, and then aggressively beats them back before they take hold.\\" In September 2015, Brock and Correct the Record produced a piece on Bernie Sanders, linking him to Hugo Chavez and British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. ===Priorities USA Action=== In early 2014, Brock was named to the board of Priorities USA Action as the super PAC also announced its support for a possible Hillary Clinton presidential run in 2016. In February 2015, Brock abruptly resigned his position with the super PAC. In his resignation letter, he accused Priorities officials of conducting \\"an orchestrated political hit job\\" against MMA and American Bridge. The New York Times had run an article questioning his groups' fundraising practices, and he charged that \\"current and former Priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations.\\" His resignation ‚Äúset off panic among influential Democrats,‚Äù because his other groups' research ‚Äúprovides the foundation for the multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns created with Priorities cash‚Äù and because ‚Äúkey Priorities donors have long- standing personal ties with him.‚Äù Brock was persuaded to return to Priorities later in 2015. ===The American Democracy Legal Fund=== Brock also founded and runs the American Democracy Legal Fund, a nonprofit that has been accused of existing solely to create ‚Äúa steady stream of lawsuits accusing Republicans of ethics and campaign finance violations.‚Äù ===American Independent Institute=== In 2014, Brock relaunched the American Independent News Network, formerly a network of progressive state-based reporting outlets, into the American Independent Institute, a group which provides grants for liberal investigative journalism projects. Brock serves as the group's president. The Institute finances journalists \\"investigating rightwing activities.\\" In 2014, it gave $320,000 in grants \\"to reporters investigating right-wing misdeeds.\\" ===CREW=== In 2014, Brock became the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington board of directors, in what was characterized as a more explicitly partisan stance for the organization. Brock was elected as CREW's board president after laying out a broad plan to turn the organization into a more muscular and partisan organization. Politico described this as ‚Äúa major power play that aligns liberal muscle more fully behind the Democratic Party ‚Äî and Hillary Clinton‚Äù and said that Brock had set forth a plan \\"to turn the group into a more muscular ‚Äî and likely partisan ‚Äî attack dog.\\" While CREW operates as a 501(c)3 nonprofit prohibited from engaging in partisan activity, Brock made clear he intends to create a more politically oriented arm registered under section 501(c)4, and also form a new overtly partisan watchdog group called The American Democracy Legal Fund registered under section 527, allowing it to engage in direct political activity. Along with Brock's election, consultant David Mercer and investor Wayne Jordan joined CREW's board of directors. When asked if CREW would still continue pursuing complaints against Democrats, Brock responded, \\"No party has a monopoly on corruption and at this early juncture, we are not making categorical statements about anything that we will and won't do. Having said that, our experience has been that the vast amount of violations of the public trust can be found on the conservative side of the aisle.\\" === Killing the Messenger === In his 2015 book Killing the Messenger: The Right-Wing Plot to Derail Hillary Clinton and Hijack Your Government, Brock described \\"how the Clintons quickly switched from prey to patrons, setting him on his current path as a fundraiser and progressive provocateur.\\" In the book, Brock accused The New York Times of being a ‚Äúmegaphone for conservative propaganda‚Äù directed inordinately at Clinton. He was particularly critical of the Times's senior politics editor and former Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan. At the same time, in the words of Politico, he depicted Bill and Hillary Clinton \\"as personal and political angels.\\" Calling the book a \\"trenchant j'accuse,\\" Publishers Weekly said that parts of it \\"read like a fund-raising prospectus\\" for MMA but concluded that while \\"Brock's rhetorical venom and naked partisanship will alienate some readers ... his sharp-eyed reporting makes for a spirited challenge to business-as-usual political discourse.\\" The Daily Beast described the book as ‚Äúpartly a sanitized summary of Brock's already exhaustively-chronicled personal history, partly an attack on the journalism establishment, and partly a call to arms on behalf of his favorite presidential candidate.‚Äù Hanna Rosin wrote that it reads like \\"pages that bullet-point Hillary's accomplishments as secretary of state or the achievements of the Clinton Foundation.\\" Rosin alleged that the book attempted to whitewash any criticisms surrounding the Clintons. Rosin stated: \\"So dogged is Brock's devotion to Hillary that it often gets in the way of his being credible, not to mention interesting.\\" Responding to Brock's criticism of The New York Times, Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, told CNN: \\"David Brock is an opportunist and a partisan who specializes in personal attacks.\\" Murphy complained that Brock's \\"partisanship has led him to lash out at some of our aggressive coverage of important political figures and it's unsurprising that he has now turned personal.\\" In October 2015, Brock gave a presentation at Georgetown University entitled \\"Is the Mainstream Media in Cahoots with Conservatives?\\". ===Purchase of Blue Nation Review=== In 2015, Brock formed an investment venture, True Blue Media, to purchase an 80 percent stake in Blue Nation Review, an online news website. Blue Nation Review was later re-branded as Shareblue. ===Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign=== The Los Angeles Times has described Brock as ‚Äúintegral to Hillary's run‚Äù for the presidency in 2016. Clinton adviser Paul Bagela commented: What kind of a movement would we be if we rejected converts? He saw the permanent intellectual and ideological infrastructure they have on the right and brought it to the left.‚Äù A March 6, 2015, article in National Review noted that while other ‚ÄúDemocratic kingmakers‚Äù were ‚Äúin retreat‚Äù in the wake of the news that Hillary Clinton had ‚Äúused a private e-mail account on a private server to avoid public scrutiny while secretary of state,‚Äù Brock remained fiercely loyal. Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe in 2015, Brock insisted that Clinton had violated no rules by using a private email server. It was reported on September 1, 2015, that a batch of Hillary Clinton's emails that had been made public included one from Brock entitled \\"Memo on Impeaching Clarence Thomas.\\" In the memo, Brock discussed possible ways of trying to bring down the Supreme Court justice whose cause he had championed in The Real Anita Hill. Politico reported in January 2016 that Brock was preparing a new advertisement that would call on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders \\"to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.\\" Brock was subjected to a storm of criticism for this plan, and only hours after Politico's report, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta scolded Brock on Twitter. Later in January, Brock responded to a Sanders campaign ad by telling the Associated Press: \\"From this ad, it seems black lives don't matter much to Bernie Sanders,\\" Sanders aides responded by accusing Brock of \\"mudslinging.\\" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement: \\"Bernie Sanders, as everyone knows, has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress. He doesn't need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton Super Pac.\\" Briggs added: \\"Twenty-five years ago it was Brock ‚Äì a mud-slinging, right-wing extremist ‚Äì who tried to destroy Anita Hill, a distinguished African American law professor. He later was forced to apologize for his lies about her. Today, he is lying about Sen Sanders. It's bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her Super Pacs. It is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock.\\" At a campaign event in Iowa in late January 2016, Bernie Sanders denied any plans to \\"bus in out-of-state college students to caucus for him,\\" charging that this was a lie and attributing it to Brock. It was reported on February 1, 2016, that Brock was still drawing a salary from American Bridge 21st Century, which was legally prohibited from coordinating with the Clinton campaign, while also drawing a salary from Correct the Record, which was \\"directly working with the Clinton campaign on Internet-based pushback against the controversies that have dogged her presidential bid.\\" This situation was described as \\"pushing campaign finance boundaries,\\" with experts saying that Brock had found loopholes to circumvent campaign finance restrictions. Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics suggested that Brock was \\"running a shadow campaign\\" via a network of groups that Maguire called \\"the Brocktopus.\\" On February 8, 2016, after the near-tie in the Iowa caucuses between Clinton and Sanders, Brock told Politico that \\"Senator Sanders is trying to live in the purity bubble, and it needs to be burst.\\" He described Sanders's efforts to link Clinton to Wall Street as an \\"artful smear,\\" and, in a reference to the Democratic National Committee's passing of data to the Sanders campaign the previous December, said that Clinton \\"would've been hounded out of the race if her staff had done what his did, in stealing data and misleading the press about it, then raising money off it.\\" Clinton's campaign, Brock insisted, \\"has stayed remarkably positive in the face of a relentlessly negative campaign from Sanders.\\" As for Sanders's platform, Brock maintained that \\"a unanimous chorus of serious progressive commentators ... find almost nothing of any substantive value in his so-called policies.\\" === Activism to bring forth sexual assault allegations === The New York Times reported in December 2017 that a group founded by Brock had spent $200,000 in an unsuccessful effort to bring forward accusations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race. He was reportedly considering doing the same to congressional Republicans. ==Personal life== Brock was formerly the domestic partner of William Grey; Fox News reported that their relationship ended in a bitter, three-year-long legal battle in which \\"Brock and Grey traded angry accusations, ... replete with charges of blackmail, theft and financial malfeasance\\" related to a house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware that the two once shared. The news channel further reported that Grey filed a lawsuit against Brock in January 2011, and Brock countersued Grey in March 2011. The dispute was settled at the end of 2011 on confidential terms. On March 22, 2017, Brock suffered a heart attack while at work at Media Matters headquarters; he was expected to fully recover. ==Controversies== ===Potential legal conflicts=== Brock's simultaneous involvement with Correct the Record, American Bridge, and Priorities USA Action raised legal questions, given that the first two groups work closely with Hillary Clinton's campaign while Priorities USA Action, the largest Democratic Party super PAC, is legally prohibited from doing so. Brock claimed to have stopped working directly with American Bridge, although its staffers continued to operate out of his office. Paul Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, considered complaining about Brock to the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department, charging that he was \\"creating new ways to undermine campaign regulation.\\" ===Comments about Brock=== In 2001, Jonah Goldberg wrote in National Review that while Brock has been \\"hailed by liberals for 'coming clean,' they would never really trust him.\\" He quoted reporter Jill Abramson as having said that \\"the problem with Brock's credibility\\" is that \\"once you admit you've knowingly written false things, how do you know when to believe what he writes?\\" Similarly, The Guardian referred in 2014 to \\"residual unease among some liberal operatives that Brock's conversion story fits into a pattern of opportunism and self-promotion rather than ideological transformation.\\" Observing in 2015 that Brock had admitted to mudslinging before, The Daily Beast noted a difficulty in dispatching fears he would do it again. Brock's claim that the Clintons have never committed any wrongdoing has received criticisms from many, including fellow Democrats, who have cited instances of abuse. Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks criticized Brock's negative coverage of the Bernie Sanders 2016 Presidential Campaign, specifically the alleged invention of the \\"Bernie Bro\\" controversy. Uygur said that Brock's January 10, 2017 open letter of apology to Sanders and his voters was disingenuous because it was motivated by a desire to raise money from wealthy Democratic donors and to foster a perception of himself as being a member of the U.S. progressive movement. ==Books== *The Real Anita Hill: The Untold Story.

Talmudic sources refer to the site as Beth Ilanim or Botnah, where it was one of the three most important \\"fairs\\", or market places, in Judea. Mamre lies approximately halfway between Halhul and historical Hebron, 4 kilometres north of the latter. ==Hebrew Bible== ===Names and events=== Mamre is the site where Abraham pitched the tents for his camp, built an altar (), and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of Sarah's pregnancy (). Genesis 13:18 has Abraham settling by 'the great trees of Mamre'. The original Hebrew tradition appears, to judge from a textual variation conserved in the Septuagint, to have referred to a single great oak tree, which Josephus called Ogyges. Mamre may have been an Amorite, a tribal chieftain after whom a grove of trees was named. Genesis connected it with Hebron or a place nearby that city.Pagolu, Augustine,The Religion of the Patriarchs, A&C; Black, 1998, pp.59-60. Mamre has frequently been associated with the Cave of the Patriarchs. According to one scholar, there is considerable confusion in the Biblical narrative concerning not only Mamre, but also Machpelah, Hebron and Kiryat Arba, all four of which are aligned repeatedly.Francesca Stavrakopoulou, Land of Our Fathers: The Roles of Ancestor Veneration in Biblical Land Claims, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011 pp.51-52 :'Throughout Genesis, all these toponyms crowd the ancestral burial site, jostling for recognition. Though it is often assumed these were all essentially the same place, the aligning, glossing or renaming of locations is frequently suggestive of changing or competing claims to ownership.' In Genesis, Mamre is also identified with Hebron itself ().Jericke, Detlef (2003) Abraham in Mamre: Historische und exegetische Studien zur Region von Hebron BRILL, p.4: Book of Genesis, 23:19;25:27.Letellier, Robert Ignatius (1995) Day in Mamre, Night in Sodom: Abraham and Lot in Genesis 18 and 19, BRILL, The Christian tradition of identifying a ruined site surrounded by walls and called in Arabic RƒÅmet el-·∏§alƒ´l ('Hill of the Friend', meaning: \\"the friend of God\\", i.e. Abraham), with the Old Testament Mamre, goes back to the earliest Christian pilgrims in the 4th century CE, and connect to a tradition from the time of Herod (1st century BCE).Jericke p.1. Elsewhere ()David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson, Pilgrimage and the Jews (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006). it is called 'the Terebinths of Mamre the Amorite'.Robert Alter, (tr.)

Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard (1998) Mercer Dictionary of the Bible Mercer University Press, p 543Haran, Menahem (1985) Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry Into Biblical Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School Eisenbrauns, p 53 The supposed discrepancy is often explained as reflecting the discordance between the different scribal traditions behind the composition of the Pentateuch, the former relating to the Yahwist, the latter to the Elohist recension, according to the documentary hypothesis of modern scholarship.Haran, Menahem (1985): The third, Priestly recension excludes any such attachment of Abraham to the Terebinth cult. ==Identification== Khirbet Nimra, an archaeological site next to Hebron and 2,5 km north of Ramat el- Khalil, has been identified as Persian and Hellenistic Mamre. Ramat el-Khalil is the site identified as Mamre in the time of King Herod (1st century BCE), Constantine the Great (3rd century CE), and possibly the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (12th-13th centuries CE). Khirbet es-Sibte (also Ain Sebta), the present-day site of the so-called Oak of Mamre, two kilometres southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century as the place where Abraham pitched his tents and saw the angels.Jericke p.2. ==History and archaeology== ===Main findings at Ramat el-Khalil=== The archaeological site of Mamre (Ramat el-Khalil, Grid Ref. 160300/107200) was first excavated by in 1926-28, followed by Sayf al-Din Haddad (1977), 'Abd el-Aziz Arjub (1984-85), and Yitzhak Magen (1986-88), Magen publishing his findings in 1991 and 2003. The outstanding components of the site are a large Roman-era enclosure, a Byzantine church, and a Crusader church. It must be noted that Denys Pringle's analysis leads to the firm conclusion that the Crusader-era Church of the Trinity, mentioned by medieval pilgrims, stood at the foot of a hill, not at its top, and certainly not at Ramat el-Khalil, where the remains of the Constantinian church were found undisturbed by any later building in 1926. The main periods of settlement are: Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader, with less substantial findings from the Iron Age IIc and the Hellenistic period. Archaeological excavation by Yitzhak Magen indicate that findings previously attributed to the biblical time of the Kings during the Iron Age, and the Hellenistic Hasmoneans, are in fact of far newer date, Byzantine or later. ===Bronze Age=== Bronze Age pottery shards found at the Ramat el-Khalil site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE, though there is no archaeological evidence for the site being occupied from the first half of the second millennium down to the end of the Iron Age. ===Herod: the enclosure=== The 2 m thick stone wall enclosing area 49 m wide and 65 m long was constructed by Herod the Great, possibly as a cultic place of worship.Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome (2008) The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 Oxford University Press US, p 370Robinson, Edward (1856) Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838-52: A Journal of Travels in the Year 1838 pp 215-216 It contained an ancient well, more than 5 m in diameter, referred to as Abraham's Well.Jericke p.?. According to Jericke among others, Persian and Hellenistic Mamre was located at nearby Khirbet Nimra, 1 km north of modern Hebron, where a pagan tree cult predated the composition of the biblical Abraham narrative. Herod transferred the Mamre tradition 2,5 km to the north, from the site at Khirbet Nimra to the site at Ramet el-Khalil. This was part of Herod's upgrade of Hebron as a cult centre dedicated to patriarch Abraham, by erecting two shrines: one at his tomb, and one at a site he connected to Abraham's place of residence, where the patriarch dined under a tree together with the three men. It has been noted that Hebron and Mamre were located in Idumaean territory, that both Jews and Idumaeans regarded Abraham as their common ancestor, and that Herod came from an Idumaean family that had only recently converted to Judaism. ===Josephus: the terebinth=== :Josephus' terebinth tree is distinct from the modern Oak of Mamre and stands at a different location Josephus (37‚Äìc. 100) records a tradition according to which the terebinth at Mamre was as old as the world itself (War 4.534). The site was soaked in legend. Jews, Christians and Pagans made sacrifices on the site, burning animals, and the tree was considered immune to the flames of the sacrifices.William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B. Dohrmann, Annette Yoshiko Reed (eds.) Jews, Christians, and the Roman Empire: The Poetics of Power in Late Antiquity, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013 pp.43-62 p.57 Constantine the Great (r. 302‚Äì337) was still attempting, without success, to stop this tradition. ===Late Roman period: Hadrian's temple=== The Herodian structure was destroyed by Simon bar Kokhba's army, only to be rebuilt by the Roman emperor Hadrian. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of the southern Judean mountains. This mercatus (Heb. yerid or shuq: ) or \\"fair, market\\" was one of the sites, according to a Jewish tradition conserved in Jerome,William Adler, The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy, in Natalie B. Dohrmann, Annette Yoshiko Reed (eds.) Jews, Christians, and the Roman Empire: The Poetics of Power in Late Antiquity, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013 pp.43-62 p.57 chosen by Hadrian to sell remnants of Bar Kochba's defeated army into slavery. ===Rabbinical tradition=== Due to the idolatrous nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their rabbis.Safrai, Zeev (1994) The Economy of Roman Palestine, Routledge, p 254 According to the Jerusalem Talmud: ===Late Roman and Byzantine Christian rule=== Eusebius and Sozomen describe how, notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of Constantine the Great's reign (302‚Äì337), the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after Eutropia, Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character. Constantine, informed of these pagan practices, attempted without success to put an end to the festive rituals celebrated around the tree. He angrily wrote to Macarius, bishop of Jerusalem and all the other bishops of Palestine and admonished them, letting them know that he had ordered the comes Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and punish those holding on to pagan practices.Life of Constantine By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) p 301 The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had a basilica built, dedicated to Saint George and the enclosure of the Terebinth of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.Fergusson, James (2004) Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology and Arts in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ Asian Educational Services, p 7 The 1957 plan and reconstruction of the site made after the excavation performed by German scholar A. E. Mader in 1926-1928, shows the Constantinian basilica along the eastern wall of the Haram Ramet el- Khalil enclosure, with a well, altar, and tree in the unroofed western part of the enclosure.Magen, Itzhaq, The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, Jerusalem 1993, via www.quondam.comSafrai, Zeev (1994) The Economy of Roman Palestine, Routledge, p 249Netzer, Ehud and Laureys-Chachy, Rachel (2006) The Architecture of Herod, the Great Builder, Mohr Siebeck, , p. 231 The venerated tree was destroyed by Christian visitors taking souvenirs, leaving only a stump which survived down to the seventh century.Taylor, Joan E. (1993) Christians and the Holy Places: The Myth of Jewish-Christian Origins Oxford University Press, , pp 86-95Stanley, Arthur Penrhyn (1856) Sinai and Palestine, in Connection with Their History, J. Murray, p. 142 The fifth-century account by Sozomen (Historia Ecclesiastica Book II 4-54) is the most detailed account of the practices at Mamre during the early Christian period. Antoninus of Piacenza in his Itinerarium, an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticoes, and an unroofed atrium. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (cancellus). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ's birthday.Jacobs, Andrew S., Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity, Stanford University Press, 2004, p.130. Arculf, a Frankish bishop who toured the Levant in around 680, writes, indicating a slightly erroneous location in relation to the Tombs of the Patriarchs: > A mile to the north of the Tombs that have been described above, is the very > grassy and flowery hill of Mambre, looking towards Hebron, which lies to the > south of it. This little mountain, which is called Mambre, has a level > summit, at the north side of which a great stone church has been built, in > the right side of which between the two walls of this great Basilica, the > Oak of Mambre, wonderful to relate, stands rooted in the earth; it is also > called the oak of Abraham, because under it he once hospitably received the > Angels. St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from > the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he > did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, > although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been > formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, > protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this > wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips > are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the > veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, > that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch > Abraham. A vignette of the Constantinian basilica with its colonnaded atrium appears on the 6th-century Madaba Map, under the partially preserved Greek caption \\"Arbo, also the Terebinth. The Oak of Mambre\\".Franciscan cyberspot Arbo, also the Terebinth. The Oak of Mambre - (Ramat al-Khalil) ===Early Muslim period=== The monastery on the site continued after Umar's conquest.Adamnanus, De Locis Sanctis, 11, 11. 6, CCSL 175, 211. ===Crusader period=== Yitzhak Magen was in 1993 of the opinion that during the Crusades, the site may have been used by a Church of the Trinity. Denys Pringle firmly refutes this possibility, based on the analysis of pilgrims' reports.Pringle,1998, p. 203 ===After mid-12th century: new locations=== The last clear identification and description of the Byzantine church remains at Ramat el-Khalil come from the Russian pilgrim known as Abbot Daniel (1106/8). After the middle of the 12th century the reports become vague and the location of \\"Abraham's Oak\\" seems to have migrated to one or more locations situated on the road connecting Ramat el- Khalil with Hebron. What is nowadays considered the traditional location of the Oak of Abraham is a site originally known in Arabic as Ain Sebta, which used to be outside historical Hebron but is now within the urban sprawl of the Palestinian city. As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \\"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly Eucherius of Lyon], Benjamin of Tudela, the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er R√¢meh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, Ball√ªtet Sebta, where is a fine specimen of Sindian (Quercus Pseudococcifera).\\" Ballut is the Arabic word for oak. ==Today== The Palestinian authorities have made the site accessible to visitors under the name Haram Ramat Al Khalil.Mamre (Haram Ramat Al Khalil), visit Palestine.com, retrieved 13 April 2020 ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== *Adamnanus, De Locis Sanctis *Alter, Robert (tr.)

The school comprises a preparatory school, senior school and sixth form, as well as boarding provision for both boys and girls. The school is coeducational, and employs the \\"Diamond Model\\". The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the IAPS, the AGBIS, and the AMDIS. Founded in 1557 and opened in 1558, the school has a Tudor schoolroom, a Victorian chapel and several Grade II listed buildings. Situated on Ingrave Road, astride Middleton Hall Lane and Shenfield Road, the school is set in over of land in the centre of Brentwood. The current headmaster is Michael Bond. ==History== ===16th‚Äì18th century=== Brentwood School and the Martyr's Elm, 1847 The licence to found the school as The Grammar School of Antony Browne, Serjeant at the Law, in Brentwood was granted by Mary I to Sir Antony Browne on 5 July 1558 and the first schoolmaster, George Otway, was appointed on 28 July 1558. In 1568 the school moved to a purpose-built schoolroom, which is extant. The commemoration stone was laid by Browne's stepdaughter, Dorothy Huddleston, and her husband Edward, Browne himself having died in 1567.Historical Notes from Brentwood School, School Lists (AKA The Blue Book) The school room is beside the site of the execution of nineteen-year-old William Hunter, who was burned at the stake for denying the doctrine of transubstantiation. The Martyr's Elm grew, allegedly, on the spot of his immolation. It was Browne who, as a Justice of the Peace under Queen Mary, had sentenced Hunter. Some believe the school was founded as Browne's penance for Hunter's martyrdom when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne; however, the school was already in operation under Mary's licence when Elizabeth succeeded. Although Browne had drawn up statutes for the school, they were never legally adopted and so were re-drawn in 1622 by his descendants and John Donne, Dean of St Paul's. ===19th century=== Brentwood School Combined Cadet Force (CCF) was founded in 1861 and so is one of the earliest CCFs in the country. ===20th century=== 300px 60 Old Brentwoods were killed on active service during the First World War and 173 during the Second World War. Their names are listed in the school chapel, and commemorated by the Memorial Hall for the first war and the pavilion for the second. The school was a direct grant grammar school from the 1960s until the abolition of the scheme in 1977. Brentwood was originally a boys' school, but the Governors made the decision to allow a small number of girls to enter the sixth form in 1974. By the early 1980s there were 23 girls in the sixth form. Initially based in Newnum House, the girls' school opened in 1988, admitting girls from ages 11 to 18. ===21st century=== In 2007, Brentwood School celebrated its 450th anniversary with a commemorative service in St Paul's Cathedral. The school's Combined Cadet Force (CCF) celebrated its 150th anniversary on 8 October 2011 by holding a special afternoon of events featuring a Guard of Honour by Lt General Brown CBE. The Royal British Legion Youth Band of Brentwood played at the start and end of the afternoon. In 2012, The Earl of Wessex visited the school to open the new sixth form centre, featuring a 400-seat auditorium, named The Wessex Auditorium in his honour. In 2016, work finished on a new academic centre in the heart of the School, named the Bean Academic Centre after former Headmaster Edwin Bean, quadrupling the size of the original library. ==Traditions== ===School motto=== The school has two mottoes: Virtue, learning and manners, derived from the school statutes of 1622, and Incipe, a Latin (lang-lato begin) motto added in the 19th century. The school promotes Incipe as make a good start, especially to first year senior school pupils and in the preparatory school, which has a publication named after it. It is recognised, though, that Virtue, learning and manners is the official whole school motto. ===School arms=== The arms of Brentwood School are derived from those of the founder, Sir Antony Browne, and his wife. As part of the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the school's founding, a special variant of Sir Antony Browne's Coat of Arms was granted by the Honourable Sir George Rothe Bellew, Garter Principal King of Arms and Sir John Dunamace Heaton-Armstrong, Clarenceux King of Arms on 19 July 1957. A red border was added to the arms to distinguish them as the school's, as opposed to those of Browne.Christe-Murray, David. The Arms of Brentwood School. Middlesex; Hubners Ltd. ===Houses=== There are five-day houses, named North Town, South Town, East Town, West Town, and Weald, and two boarding houses, Mill Hill for girls and Hough House for boys. The boarding houses together make up a sixth house, School house. The school was entirely boarding until the 1940s, but as Brentwood grew into the large commuter town that it is today, demand for day education increased and the number of boarding houses was reduced accordingly. The boarding houses are home to c.60 pupils, many from countries such as Hong Kong, China, Russia, India, Germany, Italy and South Korea. Competitions in sport, music, drama, debating and other activities are held on a regular basis between the houses. Pupils' house membership can be determined by the style of their tie; yellow for North, red for South, light blue for East, dark blue for West and claret for Weald. The boarding boys wear a maroon tie with a double silver stripe and boarding girls wear green ties with a double silver stripe. ===Praepostors=== The school elects a group of sixth form students to become praepostors (praes) each year. These are usually students with academic or sporting strengths and those involved in the local community. Being appointed a praepostor means increased responsibility in the school. Praes return to school outside normal school hours to help organize and facilitate events, and they are the main representatives of the pupil body throughout the school. Senior praes are praepostors with a greater level of responsibility and are typically asked to contribute more. They are also expected to delegate work to other praes and students. The Head of School is elected by the staff. ==The school today== ===Academic=== The school is separated into three sections: the preparatory school (ages 3 to 11), the senior school (ages 11 to 16) and the sixth form (ages 16 to 18). Brentwood operates in a diamond school format, in which the preparatory school and sixth form are co-educational while the senior school teaches boys and girls separately. Brentwood Preparatory School teaches children aged 3‚Äì11, from Nursery through to Year 6. Classes are usually small, with an average size of 20 per class. The prep school follows the National Curriculum but teaches some supplementary subjects such as French and Latin. There is also a broad extracurricular programme, which all pupils are encouraged to follow, featuring dance, drama and music, as well as sports such as hockey and golf. The senior school teaches pupils from the age of 11 until the end of GCSE courses at 16+. Many pupils move into the senior school from the preparatory school, but others are drawn from other local primary and preparatory schools; around 1/3 of pupils join the school from the maintained sector. Admission to the senior school is by entrance examination. In addition to core subjects (English, mathematics, sciences, MFL), pupils' GCSE and IGCSE options include computer science, drama, DT, food technology, geography, Greek, history, Latin, music, RS The sixth form is for pupils aged 1618 who are studying for 'A' levels and the International Baccalaureate. There are currently c.300 pupils in the sixth form. 'A' level options include classics, computer science, DT, economics, English literature, history, mathematics and MFL. ===Sport=== The school has a strong sporting tradition, in both intra- and extramural terms. Sports offered include Association football, cricket, fencing, gymnastics, hockey, netball, rifle shooting, Rugby football, squash, swimming and tennis. School teams have met with some success over the years, for example winning the Essex Schools FA Cup three times in four seasons. Historically, the school has been successful in the Public Schools Fencing Championships, winning the overall title 34 times since 1962. In netball, the girls' U13 netball team won the 2015/6 national finals to be crowned National Champions. Improvements to sporting facilities in recent years have included a 25-metre indoor swimming-pool and learner pool, a fitness suite, 4 additional squash courts and an indoor rifle range. The school is set in of grounds and has two playing-fields; one is situated directly on the school site and another, The Heseltines, adjacent to the school. These contain football, rugby, cricket and hockey pitches, an all-weather AstroTurf pitch, tennis and netball courts, an athletics track and field, and woods used for cross-country runs. In 2013, an additional AstroTurf was completed for the preparatory school. Ex-England test cricketer Geraint Jones is the school's cricket coach. ===Drama and music=== The school hosts various theatrical performances and shows. In any academic year the theatrical line-up will include a winter/spring play/musical, a sixth-form comedy charity show and a dance show. Recent shows have included My Fair Lady and Habeas Corpus, Les Mis√©rables and West Side Story and into the Woods also. Every year the school holds inter- house music and drama competitions, often with guest adjudicators. The school has a long musical tradition, and a close association with Brentwood (Roman Catholic) and Chelmsford (Anglican) cathedrals; a number of pupils and staff sing in the choir of each cathedral. The music department has 4 full-time teaching staff and 20 visiting teachers. In 1996, Brentwood was the first school in the country to use Sibelius software and ever since has been an integral part of the Music departments GCSE, A-level and IB music courses. A Sibelius suite is available in the school's music department for student and staff use. There is a range of musical opportunities with a symphony orchestra, brass and string ensembles, a junior choir, a choral society (known in the school as Christmas Choir) and a barbershop group. Recent choral performances have included Belshazzar's Feast (Walton), the Requiems of Mozart, Verdi and Faur√©, and Gloria by Poulenc. The Brentwood School Big Band, which is now in its 34th year, often performs concerts for charity outside school and tours European every other year. The Big Band has released a number of albums, most recently \\"Music to Drive By\\" in 2013. In 2008, the year of Brentwood School's 450th Anniversary, the school took part in a service in St Paul's Cathedral, in which the choir performed various English choral works. In the same year, a cantata The Old Red Wall, composed by the former Director of Music David Pickthall, was premiered at the 450th Anniversary Festival at the Brentwood Centre. The cantata was based on the school song The Old Red Wall and featured new text by David Dunn. ===Model United Nations=== Since 2013, Brentwood has hosted an annual Model United Nations (BMUN) conference. In the past it has been a one-day conference, however in 2015 it lasted for two days (5 and 6 December). Students from schools across the south east attend and it has a capacity of approximately 200 students. ===Sir Antony Browne Society (SABS)=== SABS is a society that focuses on furthering the education of sixth formers through a series of guest speakers and debates. Junior SABS is available for the younger pupils. Regular meetings are held in Old Big School, at which students are able to experience lectures on societal issues or topics to concerning science, the arts and sport, or a members' debate. Old Brentwoods such as Jack Straw and Griff Rhys Jones are regular speakers. Other speakers have been political figures, such as George Galloway and Vicky Pryce, and the philosopher A. C. Grayling. ===Royal visits and connections=== The licence to found the school was granted by Queen Mary to Sir Antony Browne on 5 July 1558.https://www.sds-heritage.co.uk/159-1558/ Her Majesty The Queen visited the school in 1957 to open the new science department, now named The Queens Building, the foundation stone of which had been laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Col. Sir Francis Whitmore. The Earl of Wessex visited the school in 2011 for the opening ceremony of the new sixth form centre and the naming of the Wessex Auditorium, and later to inspect a Combined Cadet Force Guard of Honour. Princess Anne visited the School in November 2012. ===RIBA Award=== In 2012, Brentwood School's sixth form centre was winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) East of England Award. The institute described the development as having drawn \\"inspiration from the existing Victorian vicarage\\" and that \\"the new design is expressed in a language that is both contextual and contemporary. The sculpting of the roofs creates non-standard, domestic-scaled classrooms filled with natural light, reminiscent of the gabled roofs of the Victorian vicarage, but with an added measure of playfulness.\\" ==Sexual abuse allegations== In 1997 Gareth Stafford-Bull, who taught fencing at the school (and was also an under-20s coach for the England fencing team), went missing and was sacked by the school in his absence following allegations that he had indecently assaulted pupils. The 41-year-old was later found dead in his car at Brighton. ==Notable former pupils== The official alumni logo for the Old Brentwoods community Old Brentwoods are those who have attended the school (preparatory, senior school or sixth form) for any length of time. The logo used to represent Old Brentwoods and the Society of Old Brentwoods is the wing and claw, derived from the arms of Sir Antony Browne. A crown was added to the logo in 1957 to celebrate The Queen's visit to the school. The colours of Old Brentwoods are dark blue, light blue and gold. Light blue and dark blue were traditionally featured as stripes on the blazers of Old Brentwoods and are still used today to represent the alumni community. The colours were carried across to the alumni logo, with the addition of gold on the inclusion of the crown in 1957. ===Old Brentwoods=== Also see the school's own list of Old Brentwoods at *David

(GM). He joined GM in 1958 as a design engineer at Oldsmobile and was key in the development of the front-wheel drive Toronado. He was also involved with the team that created the first catalytic converter. ==Background and personal life== Stempel was born July 15, 1933 in Trenton, New Jersey to Carl (a banker) and Eleanor Stempel. He was one of four children. His brother Jack worked in aerospace, brother Ted was a teacher, and a sister, Dorothy, was a social worker. He graduated from Bloomfield High School in New Jersey in 1951. During his teen years, he worked as a mechanic in Bloomfield, New Jersey to earn his college tuition by fixing his fellow students' cars. He received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1955 where he had been a tackle on the football team. He attended night classes and earned an MBA from Michigan State University in 1970 and later received an honorary doctorate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Stempel was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Engineering Society of Detroit. He was the first chairman of the American Quality Foundation, developed by the American Society for Quality Control. He was a member of the board of directors and chairman of the National Industrial Advisory Council to the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America, Inc.; the National Minority Supplier Development Council; and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association; the Highway Users Federation and the United Way of Southeastern Michigan. He was a member of Detroit's Conference Board, The Business Roundtable, and The Business Council and he was a trustee of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Detroit Renaissance, and New Detroit, Inc. In November 1975, Stempel's son Timothy, 13, had been kidnapped. Stempel received a ransom demand of $150,000, which he paid. His son was later freed and kidnappers were apprehended and convicted. Stempel enjoyed attending auto races and motorsports events, and working on his cars, including his 1974 Corvette. He also enjoyed skiing and surf-casting. Prior to his death, the Stempels lived and raised horses in Loxahatchee, Florida and Oxford, Michigan. Stempel died in West Palm Beach, Florida on May 7, 2011 at the age of 77. With his wife Pat (n√©e Patricia Bachmann), he had three children, a daughter Barbara and sons Timothy and Peter. ==Early career at General Motors== After serving two years in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Stempel joined GM's Oldsmobile Division as a senior detailer in the chassis design department in 1958, later serving as senior designer (1962); transmission design engineer (1964); motor engineer (1969); and assistant chief engineer (1972). Stempel subsequently worked on the team that developed the 1966 Toronado, the first modern American front- wheel-drive car. According to a GM biography, Stempel designed the Toronado's front suspension and its engine and transmission mounting system. Stempel joined the engineering department of the Chevrolet Division as chief engineer in 1974 and was named Chevrolet's director of engineering in 1975. In 1978, Stempel was appointed general manager of the Pontiac Motor Division where he worked on the Fiero - which used a plastic-body/space frame technology that became integral to GM's subsequent minivans and the Saturn lineup. In 1980, he was moved into the Managing Director position at Adam Opel AG, the German subsidiary of GM. In 1982, he returned to Detroit as General Manager of Chevrolet. In January 1984, he was promoted to the dual responsibility of Vice President and Group Executive in Charge of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group. He was elected to the board of directors (February, 1986) and became CEO (August, 1990) where he served until he was voted out in 1992 - shortly after a recession when GM had closed a dozen plants, lost 74,000 jobs and lost $7 billion. Though he suffered a heart attack soon after leaving GM in 1992, Stempel continued to visit the North American International Auto Show and continued to maintain his interest and passion for automobiles and the automobile industry. ==Later career== In 1993, Stempel joined Stanford Ovshinsky, founder of Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) as an adviser. Stempel was named chairman in 1995. Shortly after Stempel became chairman, ECD partnered engineered and provided the nickel-metal hydride batteries powered the EV-1. In 1999, ECD partnered with Intel in a joint-venture called Ovonyx which developed nonsilicon-based memory for electronic devices for Intel, Samsung Electronics and BAE Systems. Subsequently, ECD formed joint ventures with Texaco Energy Systems Inc., GE Plastics and Belgium-based N.V. Bekaert S.A. The promising technologies were unfortunately met with losses. Before retiring in 2007, Stempel was chairman of Energy Conversion for almost 12 years. Ovshinsky called Stempel \\"a visionary who saw the need for the U.S. to be independent of foreign oil.\\" Before retiring in 2007, Stempel was chairman of Energy Conversion for almost 12 years. At the time of his death, Stempel served on the board of directors of Envia Systems, a Newark, California-based company that provided GM's battery engineering team with access to advanced lithium-ion cathode technology delivering higher cell energy density and lower cost. In March 2010, he had joined the board of directors of Genesis Fluid Solutions Holdings, a water purification company in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Bloomfield High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:General Motors former executives Category:Worcester Polytechnic Institute alumni Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:People from Bloomfield, New Jersey Category:Businesspeople from Trenton, New Jersey Category:American chief executives in the automobile industry Category:People from Loxahatchee, Florida ","title":"Robert Stempel"},{"id":"299532","text":"Patchoulialso spelled \\"patchouly\\" or \\"pachouli\\" (; Pogostemon cablin), from Tamil paccu·∏∑i, is a species of plant from the family Lamiaceae, commonly called the \\"mint\\" or \\"deadnettle\\" family. The plant grows as a bushy perennial herb, with erect stems reaching around 75 centimetres (2.5 ft) in height and bearing small, pale pink-white flowers. It is native to tropical regions of Asia , and is now extensively cultivated in China, Indonesia, Japan, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Maldives, Malaysia, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, Taiwan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, South America and the Caribbean. ==Perfume== The heavy and strong scent of patchouli has been used for centuries in perfumes and, more recently, in incense, insect repellents, and alternative medicines. The word derives from the Tamil patchai () (green), ellai () (leaf). In Assamese it is known as xukloti. In Kannada it is known as Pachhethene. Pogostemon cablin, P. commosum, P. hortensis, P. heyneasus and P. plectranthoides are all cultivated for their essential oil, known as patchouli oil. ==Cultivation== Patchouli grows well in warm to tropical climates. It thrives in hot weather but not direct sunlight. If the plant withers due to lack of water, it will recover well and quickly after rain or watering. The seed-producing flowers are very fragrant and blossom in late fall. The tiny seeds may be harvested for planting, but they are very delicate and easily crushed. Cuttings from the mother plant can also be rooted in water to produce additional plants. ==Essential oil== Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin) essential oil ===Extraction=== Extraction of patchouli's essential oil is by steam distillation of the dried leaves, requiring rupture of its cell walls by steam scalding, light fermentation, or drying. The main chemical component of patchouli oil is patchoulol, a sesquiterpene alcohol. Leaves may be harvested several times a year and, when dried, may be exported for distillation. Some sources say the highest quality oil is produced from fresh leaves distilled close to where they are harvested;Grieve, Maude (1995) A Modern Herbal . 2007 others that boiling the dried leaves and fermenting them for a period of time is best.Leung A, Foster S Encyclopedia of common natural ingredients used in food, drugs and cosmetics John Wiley and Sons 1996 ===Components=== * Germacrene-B * Patchoulol * Norpatchoulenol ==Uses== ===Perfume=== Patchouli is used widely in modern perfumery, by individuals who create their own scents and in modern scented industrial products such as paper towels, laundry detergents and air fresheners. Two important components of its essential oil are patchoulol and norpatchoulenol. ===Insect repellent=== One study suggests that patchouli oil may serve as an all-purpose insect repellent. More specifically, the patchouli plant is claimed to be a potent repellent against the Formosan subterranean termite. ===Incense=== Patchouli is an important ingredient in East Asian incense. Both patchouli oil and incense underwent a surge in popularity in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, mainly as a result of the hippie movement of those decades. ===Culinary=== Patchouli leaves have been used to make a herbal tea. In some cultures, patchouli leaves are eaten as a vegetable or used as a seasoning. ===Toys=== In 1985 Mattel used patchouli oil in the plastic used to produce the action figure Stinkor in the Masters of the Universe line of toys.Stinkor: Masters of the Universe ==References== ===Notes=== Category:Pogostemon Category:Incense material Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Insect repellents Category:Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine Category:Essential oils Category:Hippie movement Category:Plants described in 1848 ","title":"Patchouli"},{"id":"299535","text":"James Guy Tucker Jr. (born June 13, 1943) is an American politician and attorney from Arkansas. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 43rd Governor of Arkansas, the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, Arkansas Attorney General, and U.S. Representative. Tucker resigned the governorship and was replaced by Mike Huckabee on July 16, 1996, after his conviction for fraud during the Whitewater affair. ==Early life== Tucker was born in Oklahoma City and moved to Arkansas before school age. He attended public schools in Little Rock, graduating from Hall High School in 1961. He had his first taste of politics when he ran for and was elected Vice-President of Key Club International (the largest and oldest high school service organization in the United States). He served in that organization from 1960‚Äì61. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Harvard University in 1963. ==Early career== Tucker served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1964, but was discharged for medical reasons (chronic ulcers) after finishing at the top of the first phase of his officer candidate training class at Camp Upshur at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia. In early 1965, Tucker found passage to southeast Asia by tramp steamer from San Francisco and entered South Vietnam as an accredited freelance war correspondent. With one brief sojourn home, he remained in the war zone through 1967, personally participating in a number of engagements. Late that year, he published Arkansas Men at War, a compendium of interviews with troops from the state he had followed into combat. The book received generally favorable reviews. Following a brief stint as an assistant professor of American history at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, Tucker returned to the University of Arkansas Law School in 1968 as a second-year student, graduated, and was admitted to the bar that same year. ==Law career== Tucker practiced as a junior associate with the Rose Law Firm, from which he ran for prosecuting attorney in 1970. He served as prosecutor for the Sixth Judicial District of Arkansas 1971‚Äì1972. In that office, he oversaw the prosecution of more than 1,000 backlogged felony cases inherited from previous administrations. He won convictions in several cases considered by local observers as \\"impossible\\" successfully to prosecute, including one kidnapping. Twelve \\"guest\\" judges were temporarily reassigned from other circuits by the state supreme court at Tucker's request to clear the docket. He was appointed by the Governor to the Arkansas Criminal Code Revision Commission and served from 1973 to 1975, during which time he was credited with spearheading the group's broad revision of the state's criminal laws. An investigation into police corruption he began was stymied by a county grand jury appointed by a circuit judge who was a political ally of the chief of police. However, the following year, a federal grand jury, building on Tucker's work, issued a scathing report which led to a shake-up of the department and the resignation of the chief, senior detectives and complicit city officials. ==Political career== Tucker (left) meets with President Bill Clinton at the White House, 1993 Tucker was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention and was elected Arkansas Attorney General in November 1972 at the age of 29. He easily defeated the Republican nominee Edwin Bethune, then of Searcy in White County, and later Tucker's successor as U.S. Representative from the Little Rock‚Äìbased Arkansas's 2nd congressional district. Tucker served two 2-year terms as attorney general, 1973‚Äì1977. He and the state's chief justice served as co-chairmen of the Arkansas Criminal Code Revision Commission. This was the first effort at codification of the state's criminal code and was adopted by the State's General Assembly. Tucker also began intervening in utility rate cases before the Arkansas Public Service Commission and fought to require \\"scrubbers\\" on a large coal-fired generation plant. He served as co-chairman of the Consumer Protection Committee of the National Association of Attorneys General. Running from his post as attorney general, Tucker was elected as a Democrat to the Ninety-fifth Congress and served one term, January 3, 1977 ‚Äì January 3, 1979. He served on the Ways & Means Committee, on the Sub-Committee on Social Security, and on a special committee on welfare reform. He relinquished the seat to wage an unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate in 1978. He was defeated by the sitting governor, David Pryor. In the same election, Bill Clinton, who had replaced Tucker in 1977 as attorney general, was elected governor. Tucker resumed his law practice. A consistent intra-party rival of Clinton, he was defeated by Clinton when both sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1982 following Clinton's defeat by Republican Frank White in 1980. He then became a partner in the firm of Mitchell, Williams, Selig & Tucker and served as lead trial counsel in complex litigation. Eight years later, Tucker announced his intention to run for the governor's office again against Clinton, who was seeking a fifth term and was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president. However, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and ran instead for the post of lieutenant governor. Tucker recognized that Clinton had his eyes on the presidency and might not serve a full term. Tucker, in accordance with a state constitutional provision barring a governor from executing his or her duties while traveling outside of the state, served as acting governor on a near-constant basis between Clinton's campaign launch during the summer of 1991 and the election in November 1992, relinquishing gubernatorial powers and duties only on the few occasions when Clinton returned to the state, such as to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector. Tucker succeeded to the governorship upon Clinton's resignation on December 12, 1992. Tucker called a special session of the General Assembly that same week to solve a financial crisis for the state's medicaid system. At his urging, the legislature adopted a soft drink tax, proceeds of which were placed in a trust account for Medicaid matching purposes. The soft drink industry obtained sufficient signatures to attempt a repeal. The soft drink tax prevailed with over 60% of the vote. Tucker won election in 1994 with over 59% of the vote against Republican Sheffield Nelson to a four-year term as governor and was sworn into a full four-year term on January 10, 1995. ==Conviction and resignation== Tucker was convicted of one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud on May 28, 1996, as part of Kenneth Starr's investigation of the Whitewater scandal. Tucker was tried with fellow defendants James B. McDougal and his wife Susan McDougal. The prosecution was conducted primarily by OIC prosecutor Ray Jahn. Tucker chose not to testify in his own defense upon the advice of his attorney. Tucker received a lenient sentence of four years' probation and house detention in part because of his poor health. He was placed on the Mayo Clinic liver transplant list in June 1996. Arkansas, like most other states, has a provision in its state constitution barring convicted felons from elective office. As a result, Tucker announced his intention to resign. As lieutenant governor, Mike Huckabee, a Republican, was preparing to be sworn in, Tucker announced he would delay his resignation until the trial court hearing on several grounds, including the post-trial discovery that a juror in his trial was married to a man whose cocaine possession conviction Tucker had twice refused to commute. Furthermore, this juror was the niece of local activist Robert \\"Say\\" McIntosh, who had demonstrated against Tucker during the trial. Arguing that his conviction was thus tainted, and that the Arkansas constitution was vague about his status as a convicted felon until his post trial motions were ruled on. However, several hours later he did resign that same day, under the threat of impeachment by the legislature which had informally gathered to witness Huckabee's swearing in. ==Business== Beginning in the early 1980s, while practicing law, Tucker and his wife Betty began building cable television and pay per view systems in central Arkansas, and later in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth corridor north of DFW Airport and in southern Florida. In the early 1990s, Tucker partnered with Insight Cable to purchase and expand cable television systems in London. That company later merged with others and was taken public in London. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Tucker and his wife, along with James Riady, established a cable television company in Indonesia. In 1998, in the midst of an Indonesian financial and political crisis, the company almost went bankrupt. Tucker traveled to Indonesia in January 1999 and with the Riady family created a new company called Kabelvision, and built and expanded systems in greater Jakarta ('Jabotabek'), in Surabaya, and in Bali. In 2000, the company was merged into new company called AcrossAsia Multimedia Ltd. It was listed on the Global Emerging Markets (GEM) Exchange in Hong Kong that same year. With AcrossAsia Multimedia, they built what was then the largest cable TV and Internet infrastructure in Indonesia. ==Health problems== Beginning during his college years at Harvard, Tucker suffered from an auto- immune disease, later diagnosed as primary sclerosing cholangitis. It created severe liver problems which seriously debilitated him and threatened his life (he had nearly died from gastro-intestinal bleeding in 1994, and had steadily worsened since). On Christmas Day 1996, Tucker received a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. ==See also== *List of Governors of Arkansas ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Further reading== *(Updated 7-4-97).

The Elm was planted on the spot where Hunter was incinerated.William Hunter was a Marian martyr burnt to death in Brentwood, England at the age of 19 on 27 March 1555, on Ingrave Road. He had lost his job in London as a silk-weaver because he refused to attend the Catholic mass, despite an order that everyone in the City of London had to attend, and had come to live with his parents in Brentwood, but got into a dispute when discovered reading the Bible for himself in Brentwood Chapel. He refused to accept the Catholic dogma of transubstantiation according to which the bread and wine of the communion become the body and blood of Jesus. He was taken before Antony Browne, then the local Justice, but later Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, but refused to retract his position. Hunter was then sent to Bishop Bonner in London. He resisted both threats and bribes--Bonner offered to make him a Freeman of the City of London and give him ¬£40--and was eventually returned to Brentwood to be burnt. He was the first Essex martyr of the reign of Mary Tudor.

As an acknowledged military tactician, without whose leadership the communist partisans may well have failed in their battle to win Albania for the Marxist-Leninist cause, Shehu exhibited an ideological understanding and work ethic that singled him out for rapid promotion in the communist party.Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia, Volume 1 Author Bernard A. Cook Publisher Taylor & Francis, 2001 , Mehmet Shehu shared power with Enver Hoxha from the end of the Second World War. According to official Albanian government sources, he committed suicide on December 17, 1981, after which the entire Shehu clan (his wife, Fiqirete Shehu Sanxhaktari, sons and other of his relatives) were arrested and imprisoned while Mehmet Shehu himself was denounced as \\"one of the most dangerous traitors and enemies of his country\\".Albania as dictatorship and democracy: from isolation to the Kosovo War, 1946-1998 Volume 3 of Albania in the Twentieth Century: A History, Owen Pearson Volume 3 of Albania and King Zog, Owen Pearson Author Owen Pearson Edition illustrated Publisher I.B.Tauris, 2006 , Persistent rumors remain, however, that Shehu was actually murdered on orders from Hoxha. == Early years == Shehu was born in √áorrush, Mallakast√´r District, southern Albania, in the family of a Tosk Muslim Imam. His father was known as \\"the fanatical sheikh\\" and participated in the 1914 peasant rebellion against the rule of prince Wilhelm of Wied, with peasant demanding a return of the Ottoman rule. Shehu graduated in 1932 at the Tirana Albanian Vocational High School funded by the American Red Cross. His focus was on agriculture. Unsuccessful in finding employment within the Ministry of Agriculture he managed to get a scholarship to attend the Nunziatella military academy of Naples, Italy. After being expelled from this school for his pro-Communist sympathies in 1936 he gained entry to the Tirana Officers School, but he left the following year after volunteering to fight for the republican side in the Spanish Civil War. He joined the Spanish Communist Party and rose to the command of the Fourth Battalion of the XIIth Garibaldi Brigade. After the defeat of the Republican forces he was arrested in France in early 1939 as he was retreating from Spain along with his friends. He was imprisoned in an internment camp in France and later was transferred to an Italian internment camp, where he joined the Italian Communist Party. == Activity in World War II == Mehmet Shehu as a partisan, 1944 In 1942 he returned to Albania, which was under Italian occupation, where he immediately joined the Albanian Communist Party and the Albanian resistance. In 1943, he was elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. In August 1943, due to his military experience, he rose swiftly to commander of the 1st Partisan Assault Brigade. Thereafter, he was the commander of 1st Partisan Assault Division of the National Liberation Army. From 1944 to 1945 he was a member of the Anti- Fascist Council of National Liberation (the provisional government). == After WWII == After Albania was liberated from the German occupation in November 1944, Shehu became the deputy chief of the general staff and, after he studied in Moscow, became the chief of the general staff. Later, he was also a lieutenant general and a full general. In 1948, Shehu \\"expurgated\\" from the party the element who \\"tried to separate Albania from the Soviet Union and lead her under Belgrade's influence\\". This made him the nearest person to Enver Hoxha and brought him high offices. After the purge of Ko√ßi Xoxe, he took over the Ministry of Internal Affairs. However, he remained in Hoxha's shadow. From 1948, he was a member of the Central Committee and the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania, and, from 1948 to 1953, he was a secretary of the Central Committee. He lost the latter position on June 24 when Enver Hoxha gave up the posts of Minister of Defence and Minister of Foreign Affairs while retaining the premiership. Hoxha was probably not willing to yield too much power to him. From 1948 to 1954 he was deputy prime minister (deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers) and Minister of Internal Affairs. The latter post made him commander of the secret police, the Sigurimi. In 1954, he succeeded Hoxha as Prime Minister. From 1974 he was also the Minister of People's Defence while from 1947 to his death he was a deputy of the People's Assembly. == Hard line man == During the war, Shehu won a reputation for brutality. On his command most clan chiefs in the mountains of northern Albania were executed. In 1949, he ordered 14 Catholic tribesmen in the Mirdita region executed after underground fighters aligned with conservative Albanian political exiles working as Italian Navy espionage agents executed Bardhok Biba, a relative of Catholic tribal leader Gjon Markagjoni who had turned against the tribal system to become a ranking Communist district official. Mike Burke, the American spymaster who set up a 1950 paramilitary project to destabilize and oust the Albanian government, said in 1986 that Shehu was \\"one tough son of a bitch\\", whose security forces gave U.S. agents \\"a tough time\\". At the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (October 1961) Anastas Mikoyan, one of the Soviet leaders, quoted Mehmet Shehu, who had said at an Albanian Party Congress: \\"Whoever disagrees with our leadership in any respect, will get spat in the face, punched on the chin, and, if necessary, a bullet in his head.\\" == Last years == Shehu was considered Enver Hoxha's right-hand man and the second most powerful man in Albania. For 40 years Hoxha was Shehu's friend and closest comrade. Shehu was one of those who prepared the Chinese-Albanian alliance and the break with the Soviet Union (December 1961). His relationship with Hoxha was damaged, however, when his son married a woman who had anti-Communist relations in the United States. This led to a meeting of the Politburo regarding his future. On December 17, 1981, he was found dead in his bedroom in Tirana with a bullet wound to his head. According to the official announcement on Radio Tirana, he committed suicide in a nervous breakdown. After his death, Shehu was claimed to have been a spy not only for Yugoslavia, but also the CIA and the KGB. In Hoxha's book Titoites (1982) several chapters are dedicated to Shehu's denunciation. In 1982, the Party of Labour issued a second edition of its official history, removing all references to Shehu. Reportedly, Shehu had begun speaking out against Hoxha's isolationism. He had reached out to some western nations like Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany to see about making diplomatic ties. Albanians speculated that Hoxha, who was in the last years of his life, wanted to secure his legacy and did not want a successor who might outshine him. He was branded as a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs enemy‚Äù and was buried in a wasteland near the village of Ndroq near Tirana. Shehu‚Äôs family was also punished. His widow, Fiqerete, (born Sanxhaktari) and two of his sons were arrested without any explanation and later imprisoned on different pretexts. One son committed suicide and his wife died in prison in 1988. One of Shehu's surviving sons later launched a campaign to prove that his father had, in fact, been murdered. After the fall of Communism and his release from prison in 1991, Mehmet Shehu's younger son Bashkim started seeking his father's remains. On November 19, 2001, it was announced that Mehmet Shehu's remains had been found. A fictionalised account of Mehmet Shehu's fall and death is the subject of Ismail Kadare's novel The Successor (2003). == See also == * History of Albania == References == ==Bibliography== *Shehu, Duro.

The fourth of the protocols was meant to prohibit non-conventional deliveries of nuclear weapons, i.e. by means other than being dropped from aircraft or carried on ballistic missiles. This included postal delivery or being assembled in secret, close to the target, before being detonated. ==Plot== On New Year's Eve 1986, professional thief Jim Rawlings breaks into the apartment of a senior civil servant and inadvertently discovers stolen top secret documents. Despite being a notorious and infamous criminal, he is enough of a patriot to send the documents anonymously to MI5 so that they might locate the traitor. In Moscow, British defector Kim Philby drafts a memorandum for the Soviet General Secretary stating that, should the Labour Party win the next general election in the United Kingdom (scheduled for sometime in the subsequent eighteen months), the \\"hard left\\" of the party will oust the moderate populist Neil Kinnock in favour of a radical new leader who will adopt a true Marxist-Leninist manifesto, including the expulsion of all American forces from the United Kingdom and the country's withdrawal from (and repudiation of) NATO. In conjunction with a GRU general, an academic named Krilov, and a master strategist, they devise \\"Plan Aurora\\" to secure a Labour victory by exploiting the party's support for unilateral disarmament. John Preston, an ex-Parachute Regiment soldier-turned-MI5 officer, who was exploring hard-left infiltration of the Labour Party, is tasked to investigate the stolen documents and discovers they were leaked by George Berenson, a passionate anti-communist and staunch supporter of apartheid South Africa. Berenson passed on the documents to Jan Marais, who he believes is a South African diplomat, but is in fact a Soviet false flag operative. SIS chief Sir Nigel Irvine eventually confronts Berenson with the truth and \\"turns\\" him, using him to pass disinformation to the KGB. As part of Plan Aurora, Soviet agent Valeri Petrofsky arrives under deep cover in the United Kingdom and establishes a base in a house in Ipswich. From there, he travels around the country collecting packages from various couriers who have smuggled them into the country either hidden or disguised as seemingly harmless artefacts. One of the couriers, masquerading as a sailor, is assaulted by Neds in Glasgow and hospitalised, where he commits suicide rather than submit to interrogation. Preston investigates and finds three out- of-place looking metal discs in a tobacco tin in his gunny sack. He shows the discs to a metallurgist who identifies the outer two as aluminium but the third as polonium, a key element in the initiator of an atomic bomb. Preston reports his findings to his antagonistic MI5 superior, Acting Director-General Brian Harcourt-Smith, who ignores them, has Preston taken off the politically embarrassing case and requests the human resource department to arrange that Preston take leave. Irvine, however, suspects that a major intelligence operation is underway, and has Preston work unofficially for him to search for other Soviet couriers (his absence from the office would be explained by the coincidental order to take leave). Simultaneously, he uses Berenson to pass a deliberate piece of disinformation to the KGB. In Moscow, the director of foreign operations for the KGB, General Karpov, discovers Aurora's existence. He determines that the general secretary is responsible, and blackmails Krilov into revealing the plan: in contravention of the Fourth Protocol, the component parts of a small atomic device are to be smuggled into the United Kingdom, to be assembled and exploded near RAF Bentwaters a week before the general election. Irrefutable evidence will be left that the explosion was an accidental detonation of an American tactical nuclear weapon, leading to a general wave of anti-Americanism, support for unilateral nuclear disarmament and for the only major party committed to disarmament, the Labour Party. The day after they win the election, the hard left will take over and begin to dismantle the Western alliance in Europe. Preston attempts, albeit fruitlessly, to uncover other couriers connected to the operation. A month into the investigation, a bumbling Czechoslovakian operative, originally believed to be an Austrian, under the name 'Franz Winkler' arrives at Heathrow with a forged visa in his passport and is shadowed to a house in Chesterfield. Preston's patience is rewarded when Petrofsky shows up to use the radio transmitter that is located there. He trails Petrofsky to his rented house, where the bomb has been assembled. An SAS team is called in to storm the house, and wounds Petrofsky before he can detonate the bomb. Despite Preston's express wishes, the commander kills the Spetsnaz man during the raid. Before dying Petrofsky manages to say one last word: \\"Philby\\". Preston confronts Irvine with his theory that the operation was deliberately blown by Philby; the latter did not know Petrofsky's location but instead sent Franz Winkler, with an obviously false visa, to the location of the transmitter, and ultimately, to Petrofsky. Irvine admits to sabotaging the KGB's British operation by leaking disinformation through Berenson to General Karpov that they were closing in on their suspect. In turn, Karpov (and not Philby) sent Winkler, sabotaging Plan Aurora. By sending Winkler, Karpov has thwarted a British publicity victory as Irvine understood the implication that Petrofsky must not be captured alive or exposed in the media. Irvine also admits that Philby has indeed been passing intelligence to the British embassy in Moscow (via carrier pigeons), hoping to earn repatriation back to the United Kingdom, but he did not expose Plan Aurora, and even if he had, as far as Irvine is concerned, \\"he can rot in hell.\\" At the novel's end, Harcourt-Smith is not confirmed as Director-General of MI5, because of his poor judgment in the case, and subsequently resigns from MI5 altogether. Preston also resigns but, through Irvine, finds lucrative private-sector employment that enables him to obtain full custody of his son. Marais is taken into custody by South African intelligence and Berenson's efforts are rendered unusable to the KGB, as Irvine intends to use his own spy network and plant the suspicion that Berenson was, in fact, a double agent, so that his information will be considered suspect. ==Adaptations== *In 1985 The Fourth Protocol was adapted into a computer game for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 home computers. *In 1987 the book was made into a film starring Michael Caine and Pierce Brosnan.

Most taxpayers are allowed a choice between the itemized deductions and the standard deduction. After computing their adjusted gross income (AGI), taxpayers can itemize deductions (from a list of allowable items) and subtract those itemized deductions from their AGI amount to arrive at the taxable income. Alternatively, they can elect to subtract the standard deduction for their filing status to arrive at the taxable income. In other words, the taxpayer may generally deduct the total itemized deduction amount, or the applicable standard deduction amount, whichever is greater. The choice between the standard deduction and itemizing involves a number of considerations: * Only a taxpayer eligible for the standard deduction can choose it. * U.S. citizens and aliens who are resident for tax purposes are eligible to claim the standard deduction. Nonresident aliens are not eligible. * If the taxpayer is filing as \\"married, filing separately\\", and his or her spouse itemizes, then the taxpayer cannot claim the standard deduction. In other words, a taxpayer whose spouse itemizes deductions must either itemize as well, or claim \\"0\\" (zero) as the amount of the standard deduction.https://www.irs.gov/app/vita/basic_module.jsp * The taxpayer must have maintained the records required to substantiate the itemized deductions. * If the amounts of the itemized deductions and the standard deduction do not differ much, the taxpayer may take the standard deduction to reduce the possibility of adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The amount of standard deduction cannot be changed following an audit unless the taxpayer's filing status changes. * If the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to file a shorter tax form such as 1040EZ or 1040A, he or she would prefer not to prepare (or pay to prepare) the more complicated Form 1040 and the associated Schedule A for itemized deductions. * The standard deduction is not allowed for calculating the alternative minimum tax (AMT). If the taxpayer claims the standard deduction for regular income tax, he or she cannot itemize deductions for the AMT. Thus, for a taxpayer who pays the AMT (i.e., their AMT is higher than regular tax), it may be better to itemize deductions, even if it produces a result which is less than the standard deduction. Deductions are reported in the tax year in which the eligible expenses were paid. For example, an annual membership fee for a professional association paid in December 2009 for year 2010 is deductible in year 2009. ==Examples of allowable itemized deductions== Allowable deductions include: * Medical expenses, only to the extent that the expenses exceed 10% of the taxpayer's Adjusted gross income (changed from 7.5% as of January 1, 2013 except for individuals 65 and over, who used the 7.5% floor until January 1, 2017).https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/2013-changes-to- itemized-deduction-for-medical-expenses (E.g., a taxpayer with an Adjusted gross income of $20,000 and medical expenses of $5,000 would be eligible to deduct $3,000 of their medical expenses ($20,000 X 10% = $2,000; $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000). Allowable medical expenses include: ** Capital expenditures that are advised by a physician, where the facility is used primarily by the patient alone and the expense is reasonable (e.g., a swimming pool for someone with a degenerative disease, an elevator for someone with heart disease) ** Payments to doctors, dentists, surgeons, chiropractors, psychologists, counselors, physical therapists, osteopaths, podiatrists, home health care nurses, cost of care for chronic cognitive impairment ** Premiums for medical insurance (but not if paid by someone else, or with pre-tax money such as in Cafeteria plans) ** Premiums for qualifying long-term care insurance, depending on the taxpayer's age ** Payments for prescription drugs and insulin ** Payments for devices needed to treat or compensate for a medical condition (crutches, wheelchairs, prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids) ** Mileage for travel to and from doctors and medical treatment ** Necessary travel expenses **Non-deductible medical expenses include: *** Over-the-counter drugs *** Health club memberships (to improve general health & fitness) *** Cosmetic surgery (except to restore normal appearance after an injury or to treat a genetic deformity) * State and local taxes paid, but the entire sum of this category is capped at $10,000 starting in tax year 2018.https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/20/pf/salt-deductions-new-tax- plan/index.html These include: ** Either State income tax or state and local general sales taxes paid during the tax year, but not both. ** Property taxes, including vehicle registration fee, if assessed by reference to the value of the property. This amount is in addition to the previous choice of either income or sales tax. ** but not including: *** Use taxes *** Excise taxes *** Fines or penalties * Mortgage loan interest expense on debt incurred to purchase up to two homes, subject to limits (up to $1,000,000 in purchase debt, or $100,000 in home equity loans for loans taken out on or before December 15, 2017 or $750,000 in purchase debt for loans taken out after December 15, 2017) ** Discount points paid to discount the interest rate on up to two homes; points paid upon acquisition are immediately deductible, but points paid on a refinance must be amortized (deducted in equal parts over the lifetime of the loan) * Investment interest expenses (interest paid to borrow money used for investing, including interest paid on margin accounts), up to the amount of income reported from investments; the balance is deferred until more investment income is declared * Charitable contributions to allowable recipients; this deduction is limited to 30%-60% of AGI, depending on the characterization of the recipient. Donations can be money or goods but the value of donated services provided cannot be deducted. Reasonable expenses necessary to provide donated services such as mileage, special uniforms, or meals can be deducted. Non-cash donations valued at more than $500 require special substantiation on a separate form. Non-cash donations are deductible at the lesser of the donor's cost or the current fair market value, unless the non-cash donation has been held for longer than a year, in which case it can only be deducted at fair market value. If appreciated stock is donated, the deduction is the fair market value of the stock on the date of the donation and the taxpayer never has to pay taxes on the inherent gain. **Eligible recipients for charitable contributions include: *** Churches, synagogues, mosques, other houses of worship *** Federal, state, or local government entities *** Fraternal or veterans' organizations **Non-eligible recipients include: *** Individuals *** Political campaigns or political action committees (PACs) * Casualty and theft losses, to the extent that they exceed 10% of the taxpayer's AGI (in aggregate), and $100 (per event, $500 starting tax year 2009) ** Many areas of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York were declared disaster areas for tax year 2011, after Hurricane Sandy.

By contrast, a person who wins $3,000 in various gambling activities during the year and loses $3,500 in other gambling activities in that year can deduct only $3,000 of the losses against the $3,000 in income, resulting in a break-even gambling activity for tax purposes for that year‚Äîwith no deduction for the remaining $500 excess loss.) Unused non- professional gambling losses may not be carried forward to subsequent tax years. However, professional gamblers are allowed to deduct losses from other income. ==Miscellaneous itemized deductions (Tax Years 2017 and earlier)== Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, miscellaneous itemized deductions are not deductible for tax years 2018 to 2025. For tax years before 2018: Miscellaneous itemized deductions are subject to a 2% floor,26 U.S.C. ¬ß 67 a.k.a. the \\"2% Haircut.\\" A taxpayer can only deduct the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions that exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income.26 U.S.C. For example, if a taxpayer has adjusted gross income of $50,000 with $4,000 in miscellaneous itemized deductions, the taxpayer can only deduct $3,000, since the first $1,000 is below the 2% floor. There are 12 deductions listed in 26 U.S.C. ¬ß 67(b). These are not miscellaneous itemized deductions, and thus not subject to the 2% floor (although they may have their own rules). Any deduction not found in section 67(b) is a miscellaneous itemized deduction.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 67(b) Examples include: * Job-related clothing or equipment, such as steel-toed boots, hardhats, uniforms (if they are not suited for social wear: suits and tuxedoes are not deductible, even if the taxpayer does not like to wear them, but nurses' and police uniforms are), tools and equipment required for work * Union dues * Unreimbursed work-related expenses, such as travel or education (so long as the education does not qualify the taxpayer for a new line of work; law school, for example, is not deductible) (repealed, effective January 1, 2018Schwartz, Bruce H.

It is in the northern Nevada section of the Great Basin with a lakebed that is a dry remnant of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. The Great Basin, named for the geography in which water is unable to flow out and remains in the basin, is a rugged land serrated by hundreds of mountain ranges, dried by wind and sun, with spectacular skies and scenic landscapes. The average annual precipitation (years 1971-2000) at Gerlach, Nevada (extreme south-west of the desert) is . The region is notable for its paleogeologic features, as an area of 19th-century Emigrant Trails to California, as a venue for rocketry, and as an alternative to the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah, for setting land speed records (Mach 1.02 in 1997). It is also the location for the annual Burning Man event. The Black Rock Desert is part of the National Conservation Area (NCA), a unit of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NCA is located in northwest Nevada, and was established by legislation in 2000. It is a unique combination of desert playa, narrow canyons, and mountainous areas. Humans have been in Black Rock Desert since approximately 10,000 B.P. Around 1300 AD the area was settled by the Paiute people. The large black rock formation was used as a landmark by the Paiute and later emigrants crossing the area. The landmark is a conical outcrop composed of interbedded Permian marine limestone and volcanic rocks. At its base is a large hot spring and grassy meadow, which was an important place for those crossing the desert headed for California and Oregon. In 1843, John Fremont and his party were the first white men to cross the desert, and his trail was used by over half the 22,000 gold seekers headed to California after 1849. In 1867, Hardin City, a short-lived silver mill town was established (now a ghost town). ==Geography== Black Rock Point with mirage Black Rock Desert, Nevada, February 26, 2017, Sentinel-2 true-color satellite image, scale 1:190,000.

The widest definition of the Black Rock Desert region is the watershed of the basin that drains into the playa. The intermittent Quinn River is the largest river in the region, starting in the Santa Rosa Range and ending in the Quinn River Sink on the playa south of the Black Rock Range. The watershed covers including the Upper and Lower Quinn River, Smoke Creek Desert, Massacre Lake, and Thousand Creek/Virgin Valley watersheds of northwestern Nevada as well as small parts across the borders of California and Oregon. If the playa is wet for a month or so, the shallow waters teem with fairy shrimp, or anostraca born of eggs that lie dormant in the silt crust for long periods of time - sometimes for many years. The edges of the playa and the Quinn River Sink stay wet longer than the rest of the playa, which concentrates the fairy shrimp and migratory birds in those areas. More than 250 species of neo-tropical migrant birds and many other water birds stop in Black Rock-High Rock Country for varying lengths of time. When wet, especially in spring, the playa is a favorite place for these winged visitors to rest and feed. When it rains, the playa can become extremely sticky, bogging down four-wheel-drive vehicles. Some areas of the Black Rock are environmentally sensitive and closed to all vehicles. Humboldt, Pershing and Washoe Counties of Nevada intersect at the Black Rock Desert. ===Mountain ranges=== The following mountain ranges are within or bordering the Black Rock Desert region.Calico Hills, Humboldt County, Nevada * Antelope Range * Badger Mountains * Black Rock Range * Calico Hills * Division Range * Fox Range * Granite Range * Hannan Range * High Rock Canyon Hills * Hog Ranch Mountains * Jackson Mountains * Kamma Mountains * Little High Rock Mountains * Massacre Range * Montana Mountains * Pine Forest Range * Poker Brown Mountains * Selenite Range * Sentinel Hills * Seven Troughs Range * Sheephead Mountains * Smoke Creek Mountains * Yellow Hills ===Geologic features=== The desert has numerous volcanic and geothermal features of the northwest Nevada volcanic region, including two Black Rock Points (west and east) at the southern end of the Black Rock Range and which have dark Permian volcanic rocks similar to another Permian black diabase dike formation in Nevada. The portion of the Lake Lahontan lakebed in the Black Rock Desert is generally flat with Lahontan salt shrub vegetation, widely scattered hot springs, and a playa. In areas of the lakebed along mountains, rain shadow results in desert precipitation levels. The continuous Fly Geyser of Fly Ranch is on private land and began in 1916 when water well drilling accidentally penetrated a geothermal source. The playa of the Black Rock Desert lakebed is ~ within an area bounded by the Calico Mountains Wilderness (north), Gerlach (west), the Applegate National Historic Trail (northeast), and the Union Pacific Railroad (south). The \\"South Playa\\" (~30 sq mi, with ~ in Washoe Co) is between Gerlach and the southwest boundary of the National Conservation Area (NCA), while the northeast NCA portion of the playa (including ~ in Humboldt Co) is between the NCA boundary and the Applegate National Historic Trail. A Nobles route between Gerlach and Black Rock Hot Springs extends through the length of the playa. The playa's Quinn River Sink of ~ is where the Quinn River discharges/evaporates ~ south- southwest of Black Rock Hot Springs. ===Mining=== Prospecting and mining has occurred in the Black Rock region since the mid-19th century. US Gypsum Corporation operated a gypsum mine and drywall (brand named Sheetrock) manufacturing plant in Empire, which employed 107 people and produced 266,300 tons of gypsum in 2008. Allied Nevada Gold Corporation re-opened the Hycroft Gold Mine in 2008 after acquiring it from Vista Gold Corp. Hycroft is a strip- mining operation in the Kamma Mountains near Sulphur on the east side of the Black Rock Desert. An opal mine is in the base of the Calico Hills on the west side of the desert. ===Paleontology=== Bones of the mammoths that roamed the area around 20,000 BC have been recovered. In 1979 a fossilized Columbian Mammoth was found. Copies of the bones are now exhibited at the Nevada State Museum, Carson City. ==Land speed records== The flatness of the Black Rock Desert's lakebed surface has led to the area's use as a proving ground for experimental land vehicles. It was the site of two successful attempts on the world land speed record: * In 1983, Richard Noble drove the jet-powered Thrust2 car to a new record of . Noble also headed up the team that beat the Thrust 2 record. * In 1997, ThrustSSC driven by Andy Green became the world's first, and so far, the only supersonic car, reaching . CSXT Space Shot, May 17, 2004 ==Rocketry records and attempts== In addition to the flat surface, distance from populated areas and uncontrolled airspace over the area also attract experimentation with rockets. The following are highlights of amateur rocketry records set at Black Rock: * On November 23, 1996, the Reaction Research Society launched a rocket to in altitude, a significant leap in amateur rocket altitude records at the time. * On May 17, 2004, the Civilian Space eXploration Team (CSXT) launched a rocket to in altitude, which was the first amateur rocket to exceed the K√°rm√°n line required to claim a space flight. Other rocket launches attempting various altitude records or space flights have occurred at Black Rock. In May 1999, JP Aerospace used a rockoon (balloon-launched rocket) in an unsuccessful suborbital space flight attempt covered by CNN. The rocket reached , which was far less than the intended Karman Line to reach space. CSXT made unsuccessful space launch attempts in 2000 and 2002 before the successful 2004 space flight. JP Aerospace returned to the desert in 2009, launching an armchair to the edge of space for Space Chair, an advertisement for Toshiba electronic products.Clarke, Christine; \\"Behind the scenes: Toshiba \\"Space Chair\\" \\", Boards. 2009-12-14. Retrieved 2010-04-25. On September 21, 2013, the University of Southern California's Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (USCRPL) launched its first space shot attempt, Traveler, intended to achieve a max altitude of . The rocket experienced a catastrophic failure 3.5 seconds into flight at an altitude of approximately . If successful, Traveler would have been the first university/student designed and built rocket to exceed the K√°rm√°n line required to claim a space flight. RPL's second attempt, Traveler II, flew in May 2014. It also failed catastrophically, approximately one second into the flight. ==History== WPRR map with Gerlach, Ascalon, Trego, Cholona, Ronda, and Sulphur, Nevada More than ~15,000 years ago (15 tya), the Humboldt River flowed to the Smoke Creek- Black Rock Desert sub-basin, and during the recession of Lake Lahontan, the river diverted to the Carson Desert sub-basin. During the highest Lahontan water level (~12.7 tya), the lakebed was under about of water, under which sediment accumulated to form a flat lakebed. Great Basin tribes inhabited the area approximately 10,000 B.P., and a Fr√©mont Expedition encountered the site in 1843, but the Fortieth Parallel Survey (1867) conducted the first official exploration. In the late 1840s, Peter Lassen led California Trail emigrants through the desert's Applegate-Lassen Cutoff, an arduous route that took them hundreds of miles away from the gold lands of California. By 1910, Western Pacific's Feather River Route (Oakland-Salt Lake City) had been completed across the east side of the lakebed on the \\"general route first explored by Lieutenant E.G. Beckwith in 1854\\". By 1927, the desert had been used for filming The Winning of Barbara Worth (the 2003 Mythbusters pilot episode was also filmed in the area). In World War II, of the Black Rock Desert was used for a USAAF aerial gunnery training range, and post-war, the north region of the United States Navy's Lovelock Aerial Gunnery Range was in the Black Rock Desert area (the Black Rock Desert Gunnery Range had closed by 1964). In 1979, a fossilized Columbian Mammoth was found along the side of the lakebed. The first \\"Balls\\" rocket event was held at the desert in 1993, and in 1998, the first annual Gerlach Dash glider race from Reno to the desert was held. For its 30th anniversary, the Black Rock Press (University of Nevada, Reno) published a 1994 book of desert photographs. The Friends of the Black Rock/High Rock organized in 1999, (current weather conditions) and a National Conservation Area Act the next year created several protected areas of the desert. :a. :b. :c. :d. :e. :f. :g. :h Also in 2000, Lisa O'Shea died seven days after being scalded in Double Hot Springs when she attempted to rescue two dogs, and the Bureau of Land Management subsequently fenced \\"Double Hot\\". ===21st century=== Jack Lee Harelson was fined $2.5 million in 2002 for archeological looting of Elephant Mountain Cave, and in 2008, an injured man was rescued when an aircraft pilot radioed for help after noticing him lying face-down on the lakebed. In 2010, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Winnemucca District Office completed a roundup of 1,922 wild horses in the Calico Mountains Complex, of which 39 died of malnutrition due to overgrazing. From 1990 to 1997, and since 1998, the Black Rock Desert is the annual location for Burning Man. ==Transportation== Lakebed during 2006 rocket launch Nevada State Route 447 is the area's main highway and connects Gerlach to SR 427 at Wadsworth, Nevada, near Interstate 80. The desert's dirt roads are generally not usable in wet or snowy conditions. Old Highway 34 provides access to the playa on the west side and to the Hualapai Flat. Old Highway 48 (dirt) connects the playa to Lovelock, and Old Highway 49 (Jungo Road, dirt) provides access to the lakebed from the Sulphur and Jungo ghost towns. The Feather River Route uses the lakebed's east side between Sulphur and Gerlach. Light aircraft have landed on the lakebed for events (the nearby Empire and Reno-Tahoe International Airports provide commercial service for the area). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Closed installations of the United States Army Category:Deserts and xeric shrublands in the United States Category:Deserts of Nevada Category:Ecoregions of the United States Category:Geography of Humboldt County, Nevada Category:Geography of Pershing County, Nevada Category:Geography of Washoe County, Nevada Category:Great Basin deserts Category:Rocket launch sites in the United States ","title":"Black Rock Desert"},{"id":"299596","text":"A slipped half hitch [first edition 1947] Ashley, Clifford W..

It incorporates blame shifting and can manifest as shame dumping.Hotchkiss, Sandy; foreword by Masterson, James F. Why Is It Always About You?: The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (Free Press, 2003) Projection has been described as an early phase of introjection. ==Historical precursors== A prominent precursor in the formulation of the projection principle was Giambattista Vico. In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first enlightenment thinker to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion. The Babylonian Talmud (500 AD) notes the human tendency toward projection and warns against it: \\"Do not taunt your neighbour with the blemish you yourself have.\\" In the New Testament, Jesus also warned against projection: \\"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother‚Äôs eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‚ÄòLet me take the speck out of your eye,‚Äô when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\\" ==Psychoanalytic developments== Projection () was conceptualised by Sigmund Freud in his letters to Wilhelm Fliess,Jean-Michel Quinodoz, Reading Freud (London 2005) p. 24 and further refined by Karl Abraham and Anna Freud. Freud considered that, in projection, thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one's own are dealt with by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else.Case Studies II p. 210. What the ego repudiates is split off and placed in another.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 146. Freud would later come to believe that projection did not take place arbitrarily, but rather seized on and exaggerated an element that already existed on a small scale in the other person.Sigmund Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10) pp. 200‚Äì01. (The related defence of projective identification differs from projection in that the other person is expected to become identified with the impulse or desire projected outside,Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1997) p. 177. so that the self maintains a connection with what is projected, in contrast to the total repudiation of projection proper.)Otto F. Kernberg, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism (London 1990) p. 56. Melanie Klein saw the projection of good parts of the self as leading potentially to over-idealisation of the object.Hanna Segal, Klein (1979) p. 118. Equally, it may be one's conscience that is projected, in an attempt to escape its control: a more benign version of this allows one to come to terms with outside authority.R. Wollheim, On the Emotions (1999) pp. 217‚Äì18. == Theoretical examples == Projection tends to come to the fore in normal people at times of personal or political crisisErik Erikson, Childhood and Society (1973) p. 241. but is more commonly found in narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder.Glen O. Gabbard, Long- Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (London 2010) p. 33. Carl Jung considered that the unacceptable parts of the personality represented by the Shadow archetype were particularly likely to give rise to projection, both small- scale and on a national/international basis.Carl G. Jung ed., Man and his Symbols (London 1978) pp. 181‚Äì82. Marie-Louise Von Franz extended her view of projection, stating that \\"wherever known reality stops, where we touch the unknown, there we project an archetypal image\\". found in: Psychological projection is one of the medical explanations of bewitchment used to explain the behavior of the afflicted children at Salem in 1692. The historian John Demos asserts that the symptoms of bewitchment experienced by the afflicted girls were due to the girls undergoing psychological projection of repressed aggression. == Practical examples == *Victim blaming: The victim of someone else's actions or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility. In such cases, the psyche projects the experiences of weakness or vulnerability with the aim of ridding itself of the feelings and, through its disdain for them or the act of blaming, their conflict with the ego. The Pursuit of Health, June Bingham & Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press. *Projection of marital guilt: Thoughts of infidelity to a partner may be unconsciously projected in self-defence on to the partner in question, so that the guilt attached to the thoughts can be repudiated or turned to blame instead, in a process linked to denial.Sigmund Freud, On Psychopathology (Middlesex 1987) p. 198. *Bullying: A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity or vulnerability.Paul Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (1999) pp. 185‚Äì86. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict. *Projection of general guilt: Projection of a severe consciencePatrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1990) p. 142. is another form of defense, one which may be linked to the making of false accusations, personal or political. *Projection of hope: Also, in a more positive light, a patient may sometimes project his or her feelings of hope onto the therapist.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1990) p. 122. == Counter-projection == Jung wrote, \\"All projections provoke counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject.\\"General Aspects of Dream Psychology, CW 8, par. 519. Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual acting out.Ann Casement, Carl Gustav Jung (2001) p. 87. In a rather different usage, Harry Stack Sullivan saw counter-projection in the therapeutic context as a way of warding off the compulsive re-enactment of a psychological trauma, by emphasizing the difference between the current situation and the projected obsession with the perceived perpetrator of the original trauma.F. S. Anderson ed., Bodies in Treatment (2007) p. 160. == Clinical approaches == Drawing on Gordon Allport's idea of the expression of self onto activities and objects, projective techniques have been devised to aid personality assessment, including the Rorschach ink-blots and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Projection may help a fragile ego reduce anxiety, but at the cost of a certain dissociation, as in dissociative identity disorder.Trauma and Projection In extreme cases, an individual's personality may end up becoming critically depleted.R. Appignanesi ed., Introducing Melanie Klein (Cambridge 2006) pp. 115, 126. In such cases, therapy may be required which would include the slow rebuilding of the personality through the \\"taking back\\" of such projections.Mario Jacoby, The Analytic Encounter (1984) pp. 10, 108. The method of managed projection is a type of projective technique. The basic principle of the method is that a subject is presented with his own verbal portrait named by the name of another person, as well as with a portrait of his fictional opposition (V. V. Stolin, 1981). The technique is suitable for application in psychological counseling and might provide valuable information about the form and nature of his or her self-esteem == Criticism == Some studies were critical of Freud's theory. Research supports the existence of a false-consensus effect whereby humans have a broad tendency to believe that others are similar to themselves, and thus \\"project\\" their personal traits onto others. This applies to good traits as well as bad traits and is not a defense mechanism for denying the existence of the trait within the self. Instead, Newman, Duff, and Baumeister (1997) proposed a new model of defensive projection. In this view, repressors try to suppress thoughts of their undesirable traits, and these efforts make those trait categories highly accessible‚Äîso that they are then used all the more often when forming impressions of others. The projection is then only a by-product of the real defensive mechanism. == See also == == References == Category:Defence mechanisms Category:Borderline personality disorder Category:Narcissism Category:Bullying Category:Cognitive biases Category:Psychoanalytic terminology Category:Freudian psychology Category:Paranoia ","title":"Psychological projection"},{"id":"299610","text":"Due diligence is the investigation or exercise of care that a reasonable business or person is normally expected to take before entering into an agreement or contract with another party or an act with a certain standard of care. It can be a legal obligation, but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations. A common example of due diligence in various industries is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets for an acquisition. The theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate on the decision at hand and all its costs, benefits, and risks. == Etymology == The term ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù means \\"required carefulness\\" or \\"reasonable care\\" in general usage, and has been used in this sense since at least the mid-fifteenth century. It became a specialized legal term and later a common business term due to the United States‚Äô Securities Act of 1933, where the process is called \\"reasonable investigation\\" (section 11b3). This Act included a defense at Section 11, referred to later in legal usage as the ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù defense, which could be used by broker-dealers when accused of inadequate disclosure to investors of material information with respect to the purchase of securities. In legal and business use, the term was soon used for the process itself instead of how it was to be performed, so that the original expressions such as \\"exercise due diligence in investigating\\" and \\"investigation carried out with due diligence\\" were soon shortened to \\"due diligence investigation\\" and finally \\"due diligence\\". As long as broker-dealers exercised ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù (required carefulness) in their investigation into the company whose equity they were selling, and as long as they disclosed to the investor what they found, they would not be found liable for non-disclosure of information that was not discovered in the process of that investigation. The broker-dealer community quickly institutionalized, as a standard practice, the conducting of due diligence investigations of any stock offerings in which they involved themselves. Originally the term was limited to public offerings of equity investments, but over time it has become associated with investigations of private mergers and acquisitions as well. == Examples == === Business transactions and corporate finance === Due diligence takes different forms depending on its purpose: # The examination of a potential target for merger, acquisition, privatization, or similar corporate finance transaction normally by a buyer. (This can include self due diligence or ‚Äúreverse due diligence‚Äù, i.e. an assessment of a company, usually by a third party on behalf of the company, prior to taking the company to market.) # A reasonable investigation focusing on material future matters. # An examination being achieved by asking certain key questions, including, how do we buy, how do we structure an acquisition, and how much do we pay? # An investigation of current practices of process and policies. # An examination aiming to make an acquisition decision via the principles of valuation and shareholder value analysis. The due diligence process (framework) can be divided into nine distinct areas: # Compatibility audit. # Financial audit. # Macro-environment audit. # Legal/environmental audit. # Marketing audit. # Production audit. # Management audit. # Information systems audit. # Reconciliation audit. It is essential that the concepts of valuations (shareholder value analysis) be considered in a due diligence process. This is in order to reduce the number of failed mergers and acquisitions. In this regard, two new audit areas have been incorporated into the Due Diligence framework: * the Compatibility Audit which deals with the strategic components of the transaction and in particular the need to add shareholder value and * the Reconciliation audit, which links/consolidates other audit areas together via a formal valuation in order to test whether shareholder value will be added. The relevant areas of concern may include the financial, legal, labor, tax, IT, environment and market/commercial situation of the company. Other areas include intellectual property, real and personal property, insurance and liability coverage, debt instrument review, employee benefits (including the Affordable Care Act) and labor matters, immigration, and international transactions.Gary M. Lawrence, Due Diligence in Business Transactions, (Law Journal Press 1994, updated as needed). . Areas of focus in due diligence continue to develop with cybersecurity emerging as an area of concern for business acquirers. Due diligence findings impact a number of aspects of the transaction including the purchase price, the representations and warranties negotiated in the transaction agreement, and the indemnification provided by the sellers. Due Diligence has emerged as a separate profession for accounting and auditing experts and is typically referred to as Transaction Services. === Foreign Corrupt Practices Act === With the number and size of penalties increasing, the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) has caused many U.S. institutions to look into how they evaluate all of their relationships overseas. The lack of a due diligence of a company's agents, vendors, and suppliers, as well as merger and acquisition partners in foreign countries could lead to doing business with an organization linked to a foreign official or state owned enterprises and their executives. This link could be perceived as leading to the bribing of the foreign officials and as a result lead to noncompliance with the FCPA. Due diligence in regard to FCPA compliance is required in two aspects: # Initial due diligence ‚Äì this step is necessary in evaluating what risk is involved in doing business with an entity prior to establishing a relationship and assesses risk at that point in time. # Ongoing due diligence ‚Äì this is the process of periodically evaluating each relationship overseas to find links between current business relationships overseas and ties to a foreign official or illicit activities linked to corruption. This process will be performed indefinitely as long as a relationship exists, and usually involves comparing the companies and executives to a database of foreign officials. This process should be performed on all relationships regardless of location WorldCompliance.com and is often part of a wider Integrity Management initiative . In the M&A; context, buyers can use the due diligence phase to integrate a target into their internal FCPA controls, focusing initial efforts on necessary revisions to the target's business activities with a high-risk of corruption. While financial institutions are among the most aggressive in defining FCPA best practices, manufacturing, retailing and energy industries are highly active in managing FCPA compliance programs. ===Human rights=== Passed on May 25, 2011, the OECD member countries agreed to revise their guidelines promoting tougher standards of corporate behavior, including human rights. As part of this new definition, they utilized a new aspect of due diligence that requires a corporation to investigate third party partners for potential abuse of human rights. In the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises document, it is stated that all members will ‚ÄúSeek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations, products or services by a business relationship, even if they do not contribute to those impacts‚Äù. The term was originally put forth by UN Special Representative for Human Rights and Business John Ruggie, who uses it as an umbrella to cover the steps and processes by which a company understands, monitors and mitigates its human rights impacts. Human Rights Impact Assessment is a component of this. The UN formalized guidelines for Human Rights Due Diligence on June 16 with the endorsement of Ruggie's Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. === Civil litigation === Due diligence in civil procedure is the idea that reasonable investigation is necessary before certain kinds of relief are requested. For example, duly diligent efforts to locate and/or serve a party with civil process is frequently a requirement for a party seeking to use means other than personal service to obtain jurisdiction over a party. Similarly, in areas of the law such as bankruptcy, an attorney representing someone filing a bankruptcy petition must engage in due diligence to determine that the representations made in the bankruptcy petition are factually accurate. Due diligence is also generally prerequisite to a request for relief in states where civil litigants are permitted to conduct pre-litigation discovery of facts necessary to determine whether or not a party has a factual basis for a cause of action. In civil actions seeking a foreclosure or seizure of property, a party requesting this relief is frequently required to engage in due diligence to determine who may claim an interest in the property by reviewing public records concerning the property and sometimes by a physical inspection of the property that would reveal a possible interest in the property of a tenant or other person. Due diligence is also a concept found in the civil litigation concept of a statute of limitations. Frequently, a statute of limitations begins to run against a plaintiff when that plaintiff knew or should have known had that plaintiff investigated the matter with due diligence that the plaintiff had a claim against a defendant. In this context, the term ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù determines the scope of a party's constructive knowledge, upon receiving notice of facts sufficient to constitute ‚Äúinquiry notice‚Äù that alerts a would-be plaintiff that further investigation might reveal a cause of action. === Criminal law === In criminal law, due diligence is the only available defense to a crime that is one of strict liability (i.e., a crime that only requires an actus reus and no mens rea). Once the criminal offence is proven, the defendant must prove on balance that they did everything possible to prevent the act from happening. It is not enough that they took the normal standard of care in their industry ‚Äì they must show that they took every reasonable precaution. Due diligence is also used in criminal law to describe the scope of the duty of a prosecutor, to take efforts to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence, to (accused) criminal defendants. In criminal law, ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù also identifies the standard a prosecuting entity must satisfy in pursuing an action against a defendant, especially with regard to the provision of the Federal and State Constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial or to have a warrant or detainer served in an action. In cases where a defendant is in any type of custodial situation where their freedom is constrained, it is solely the prosecuting entities duty to ensure the provision of such rights and present the citizen before the court with jurisdiction. This also applies where the respective judicial system and/or prosecuting entity has current address or contact information on the named party and said party has made no attempt to evade notice of the prosecution of the action.Hawaii Revised Statues 353-66.5 and 604-7.2 ==Due diligence defence== In the United Kingdom, \\"proper use of a due diligence system\\" may be used as a defence against a charge of breach of regulations e.g. under the Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013 Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013, SI 233/2013 and the Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017,Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017, SI 1312/2017 businesses may be able to defend a charge of non-compliance with regulations if they can show that they have undertaken supplier due diligence to a necessary standard. ==See also== * Bias ratio (finance) * Data room, Virtual data room * Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol * Integrity management * Management due diligence * Model audit * Non-disclosure agreement * Operational due diligence (ODD) * Vetting ==References== Category:Corporate finance Category:American legal terminology Category:Criminal law Category:Contract law Category:Business terms Category:Mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Due diligence"},{"id":"299615","text":"The Church of Jesus Christ‚ÄìChristian is an American Christian Identity, white supremacist church, which was founded in 1946 by Ku Klux Klan organizer Wesley A.

The original problem for the engineers of the Macintosh was how to make optimum use of the 128 KB of RAM with which the machine was equipped, on Motorola 68000-based computer hardware that did not support virtual memory. Since at that time the machine could only run one application program at a time, and there was no fixed secondary storage, the engineers implemented a simple scheme which worked well with those particular constraints. That design choice did not scale well with the development of the machine, creating various difficulties for both programmers and users. ==Fragmentation== The primary concern of the original engineers appears to have been fragmentation - that is, the repeated allocation and deallocation of memory through pointers leading to many small isolated areas of memory which cannot be used because they are too small, even though the total free memory may be sufficient to satisfy a particular request for memory. To solve this, Apple engineers used the concept of a relocatable handle, a reference to memory which allowed the actual data referred to be moved without invalidating the handle. Apple's scheme was simple - a handle was simply a pointer into a (non relocatable) table of further pointers, which in turn pointed to the data. If a memory request required compaction of memory, this was done and the table, called the master pointer block, was updated. The machine itself implemented two areas in memory available for this scheme - the system heap (used for the OS), and the application heap. As long as only one application at a time was run, the system worked well. Since the entire application heap was dissolved when the application quit, fragmentation was minimized. The memory management system had weaknesses; the system heap was not protected from errant applications, as would have been possible if the system architecture had supported memory protection, and this was frequently the cause of system problems and crashes. In addition, the handle-based approach also opened up a source of programming errors, where pointers to data within such relocatable blocks could not be guaranteed to remain valid across calls that might cause memory to move. This was a real problem for almost every system API that existed. Because of the transparency of system-owned data structures at the time, the APIs could do little to solve this. Thus the onus was on the programmer not to create such pointers, or at least manage them very carefully by dereferencing all handles after every such API call. Since many programmers were not generally familiar with this approach, early Mac programs suffered frequently from faults arising from this. Palm OS and 16-bit Windows use a similar scheme for memory management, but the Palm and Windows versions make programmer error more difficult. For instance, in Mac OS, to convert a handle to a pointer, a program just de-references the handle directly, but if the handle is not locked, the pointer can become invalid quickly. Calls to lock and unlock handles are not balanced; ten calls to HLock are undone by a single call to HUnlock. In Palm OS and Windows, handles are an opaque type and must be de- referenced with MemHandleLock on Palm OS or Global/LocalLock on Windows. When a Palm or Windows application is finished with a handle, it calls MemHandleUnlock or Global/LocalUnlock. Palm OS and Windows keep a lock count for blocks; after three calls to MemHandleLock, a block will only become unlocked after three calls to MemHandleUnlock. Addressing the problem of nested locks and unlocks can be straightforward (although tedious) by employing various methods, but these intrude upon the readability of the associated code block and require awareness and discipline on the part of the coder. ==Memory leaks and stale references== Awareness and discipline are also necessary to avoid memory \\"leaks\\" (failure to deallocate within the scope of the allocation) and to avoid references to stale handles after release (which usually resulted in a hard crash--annoying on a single-tasking system, potentially disastrous if other programs are running). ==Switcher== The situation worsened with the advent of Switcher, which was a way for a Mac with 512KB or more of memory to run multiple applications at once. This was a necessary step forward for users, who found the one-app-at-a-time approach very limiting. Because Apple was now committed to its memory management model, as well as compatibility with existing applications, it was forced to adopt a scheme where each application was allocated its own heap from the available RAM. The amount of actual RAM allocated to each heap was set by a value coded into the metadata of each application, set by the programmer. Sometimes this value wasn't enough for particular kinds of work, so the value setting had to be exposed to the user to allow them to tweak the heap size to suit their own requirements. While popular among \\"power users\\", this exposure of a technical implementation detail was against the grain of the Mac user philosophy. Apart from exposing users to esoteric technicalities, it was inefficient, since an application would be made to grab all of its allotted RAM, even if it left most of it subsequently unused. Another application might be memory starved, but would be unable to utilize the free memory \\"owned\\" by another application. While an application could not beneficially utilize a sister application's heap, it could certainly destroy it, typically by inadvertently writing to a nonsense address. An application accidentally treating a fragment of text or image, or an unassigned location as a pointer could easily overwrite the code or data of other applications or even the OS, leaving \\"lurkers\\" even after the program was exited. Such problems could be extremely difficult to analyze and correct. Switcher evolved into MultiFinder in System 4.2, which became the Process Manager in System 7, and by then the scheme was long entrenched. Apple made some attempts to work around the obvious limitations ‚Äì temporary memory was one, where an application could \\"borrow\\" free RAM that lay outside of its heap for short periods, but this was unpopular with programmers so it largely failed to solve the problems. Apple's System 7 Tune-up addon added a \\"minimum\\" memory size and a \\"preferred\\" size--if the preferred amount of memory was not available, the program could launch in the minimum space, possibly with reduced functionality. This was incorporated into the standard OS starting with System 7.1, but still didn't address the root problem. Virtual memory schemes, which made more memory available by paging unused portions of memory to disk, were made available by third-party utilities like Connectix Virtual, and then by Apple in System 7. This increased Macintosh memory capacity at a performance cost, but did not add protected memory or prevent the memory manager's heap compaction that would invalidate some pointers. ==32-bit clean== Originally the Macintosh had 128 kB of RAM, with a limit of 512 kB. This was increased to 4 MB upon the introduction of the Macintosh Plus. These Macintosh computers used the 68000 CPU, a 32-bit processor, but only had 24 physical address lines. The 24 lines allowed the processor to address up to 16 MB of memory (224 bytes), which was seen as a sufficient amount at the time. The RAM limit in the Macintosh design was 4 MB of RAM and 4 MB of ROM, because of the structure of the memory map. This was fixed by changing the memory map with the Macintosh II and the Macintosh Portable, allowing up to 8 MB of RAM. Because memory was a scarce resource, the authors of the Mac OS decided to take advantage of the unused byte in each address. The original Memory Manager (up until the advent of System 7) placed flags in the high 8 bits of each 32-bit pointer and handle. Each address contained flags such as \\"locked\\", \\"purgeable\\", or \\"resource\\", which were stored in the master pointer table. When used as an actual address, these flags were masked off and ignored by the CPU. While a good use of very limited RAM space, this design caused problems when Apple introduced the Macintosh II, which used the 32-bit Motorola 68020 CPU. The 68020 had 32 physical address lines which could address up to 4 GB (232 bytes) of memory. The flags that the Memory Manager stored in the high byte of each pointer and handle were significant now, and could lead to addressing errors. In theory, the architects of the Macintosh system software were free to change the \\"flags in the high byte\\" scheme to avoid this problem, and they did. For example, on the Macintosh IIci and later machines, HLock() and other APIs was rewritten to implement handle locking in a way other than flagging the high bits of handles. But, many Macintosh application programmers and a great deal of the Macintosh system software code itself accessed the flags directly rather than using the APIs, such as HLock(), which had been provided to manipulate them. By doing this they rendered their applications incompatible with true 32-bit addressing, and this became known as not being \\"32-bit clean\\". In order to stop continual system crashes caused by this issue, System 6 and earlier running on a 68020 or a 68030 would force the machine into 24-bit mode, and would only recognize and address the first 8 megabytes of RAM, an obvious flaw in machines whose hardware was wired to accept up to 128 MB RAM ‚Äì and whose product literature advertised this capability. With System 7, the Mac system software was finally made 32-bit clean, but there were still the problem of dirty ROMs. The problem was that the decision to use 24-bit or 32-bit addressing has to be made very early in the boot process, when the ROM routines initialized the Memory Manager to set up a basic Mac environment where NuBus ROMs and disk drivers are loaded and executed. Older ROMs did not have any 32-bit Memory Manager support and so was not possible to boot into 32-bit mode. Surprisingly, the first solution to this flaw was published by software utility company Connectix, whose 1991 product MODE32 reinitialized the Memory Manager and repeated early parts of the Mac boot process, allowing the system to boot into 32-bit mode and enabling the use of all the RAM in the machine. Apple licensed the software from Connectix later in 1991 and distributed it for free. The Macintosh IIci and later Motorola based Macintosh computers had 32-bit clean ROMs. It was quite a while before applications were updated to remove all 24-bit dependencies, and System 7 provided a way to switch back to 24-bit mode if application incompatibilities were found. By the time of migration to the PowerPC and System 7.1.2, 32-bit cleanliness was mandatory for creating native applications and even later Motorola 68040 based Macs could not support 24-bit mode. ==Object orientation== The rise of object-oriented languages for programming the Mac ‚Äì first Object Pascal, then later C++ ‚Äì also caused problems for the memory model adopted. At first, it would seem natural that objects would be implemented via handles, to gain the advantage of being relocatable. These languages, as they were originally designed, used pointers for objects, which would lead to fragmentation issues. A solution, implemented by the THINK (later Symantec) compilers, was to use Handles internally for objects, but use a pointer syntax to access them. This seemed a good idea at first, but soon deep problems emerged, since programmers could not tell whether they were dealing with a relocatable or fixed block, and so had no way to know whether to take on the task of locking objects or not. Needless to say this led to huge numbers of bugs and problems with these early object implementations. Later compilers did not attempt to do this, but used real pointers, often implementing their own memory allocation schemes to work around the Mac OS memory model. While the Mac OS memory model, with all its inherent problems, remained this way right through to Mac OS 9, due to severe application compatibility constraints, the increasing availability of cheap RAM meant that by and large most users could upgrade their way out of a corner. The memory wasn't used efficiently, but it was abundant enough that the issue never became critical. This is ironic given that the purpose of the original design was to maximise the use of very limited amounts of memory. finally did away with the whole scheme, implementing a modern sparse virtual memory scheme. A subset of the older memory model APIs still exist for compatibility as part of Carbon, but map to the modern memory manager (a threadsafe malloc implementation) underneath. Apple recommends that code use malloc and free \\"almost exclusively\\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Classic Mac OS Category:Memory management ","title":"Classic Mac OS memory management"},{"id":"299619","text":"thumb300pxrightKetogenesis pathway. The three ketone bodies (acetoacetate, acetone, and beta-hydroxy-butyrate) are marked within an orange box Ketogenesis is the biochemical process through which organisms produce ketone bodies through breakdown of fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids. This process supplies energy under circumstances such as fasting or caloric restriction to certain organs, particularly the brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Insufficient gluconeogenesis can cause hypoglycemia and excessive production of ketone bodies, ultimately leading to a life-threatening condition known as non-diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketone bodies are not obligately produced from fatty acids, but rather any meaningful amount of them is synthesized only in a situation of carbohydrate and protein insufficiency, where fatty acids are the only readily available fuel for their production. ==Production== Ketone bodies are produced mainly in the mitochondria of liver cells, and synthesis can occur in response to an unavailability of blood glucose, such as during fasting. Other cells, e.g. human astrocytes, are capable of carrying out ketogenesis, but they are not as effective at doing so. Ketogenesis occurs constantly in a healthy individual. Ketogenesis in healthy individuals is ultimately under the control of the master regulatory protein AMPK, which is activated during times of metabolic stress, such as carbohydrate insufficiency. Activation in the liver inhibits lipogenesis, promotes fatty acid oxidation, switches off acetyl-CoA carboxylase, turns on malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and consequently induces ketogenesis. Ethanol is a powerful AMPK inhibitor and therefore can cause profound disruptions in the metabolic state of the liver, including halting of ketogenesis, even in the context of severe glucose shortage. Ketogenesis takes place in the setting of low glucose levels in the blood, after exhaustion of other cellular carbohydrate stores, such as glycogen. It can also take place when there is insufficient insulin (e.g. in type 1 (and less commonly type 2) diabetes), particularly during periods of \\"ketogenic stress\\" such as intercurrent illness. The production of ketone bodies is then initiated to make available energy that is stored as fatty acids. Fatty acids are enzymatically broken down in Œ≤-oxidation to form acetyl-CoA. Under normal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized by the citric acid cycle (TCA/Krebs cycle) and then by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to release energy. However, if the amounts of acetyl-CoA generated in fatty-acid Œ≤-oxidation challenge the processing capacity of the TCA cycle; i.e. if activity in TCA cycle is low due to low amounts of intermediates such as oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA is then used instead in biosynthesis of ketone bodies via acetoacetyl-CoA and Œ≤-hydroxy-Œ≤- methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). Furthermore, since there is only a limited amount of coenzyme A in the liver, the production of ketogenesis allows some of the coenzyme to be freed to continue fatty-acid Œ≤-oxidation. Depletion of glucose and oxaloacetate can be triggered by fasting, vigorous exercise, high- fat diets or other medical conditions, all of which enhance ketone production. Deaminated amino acids that are ketogenic, such as leucine, also feed TCA cycle, forming acetoacetate & ACoA and thereby produce ketones. Besides its role in the synthesis of ketone bodies, HMG-CoA is also an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol, but the steps are compartmentalised. Ketogenesis occurs in the mitochondria, whereas cholesterol synthesis occurs in the cytosol, hence both processes are independently regulated. ==Ketone bodies== The three ketone bodies, each synthesized from acetyl-CoA molecules, are: * Acetoacetate, which can be converted by the liver into Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate, or spontaneously turn into acetone. Most acetoacetate is reduced to beta- hydroxybutyrate, which serves to additionally ferry reducing electrons to the tissues, especially the brain, where they are stripped back off and used for metabolism. * Acetone, which is generated through the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, either spontaneously or through the enzyme acetoacetate decarboxylase. It can then be further metabolized either by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol) and then via propylene glycol to pyruvate, lactate and acetate (usable for energy) and propionaldehyde, or via methylglyoxal to pyruvate and lactate. * Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate (not technically a ketone according to IUPAC nomenclature) is generated through the action of the enzyme D-Œ≤- hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase on acetoacetate. Upon entering the tissues, beta-hydroxybutyrate is converted by D-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase back to acetoacetate along with a proton and a molecule of NADH, the latter of which goes on to power the electron transport chain and other redox reactions. Œ≤-Hydroxybutyrate is the most abundant of the ketone bodies, followed by acetoacetate and finally acetone. Œ≤-Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate can pass through membranes easily, and are therefore a source of energy for the brain, which cannot directly metabolize fatty acids. The brain receives 60-70% of its required energy from ketone bodies when blood glucose levels are low. These bodies are transported into the brain by monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 2. Therefore, ketone bodies are a way to move energy from the liver to other cells. The liver does not have the critical enzyme, succinyl CoA transferase, to process ketone bodies, and therefore cannot undergo ketolysis. The result is that the liver only produces ketone bodies, but does not use a significant amount of them. ==Regulation== Ketogenesis may or may not occur, depending on levels of available carbohydrates in the cell or body. This is closely related to the paths of acetyl-CoA: * When the body has ample carbohydrates available as energy source, glucose is completely oxidized to CO2; acetyl-CoA is formed as an intermediate in this process, first entering the citric acid cycle followed by complete conversion of its chemical energy to ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. * When the body has excess carbohydrates available, some glucose is fully metabolized, and some of it is stored in the form of glycogen or, upon citrate excess, as fatty acids (see lipogenesis). Coenzyme A is recycled at this step. * When the body has no free carbohydrates available, fat must be broken down into acetyl-CoA in order to get energy. Under these conditions, acetyl-CoA cannot be metabolized through the citric acid cycle because the citric acid cycle intermediates (mainly oxaloacetate) have been depleted to feed the gluconeogenesis pathway. The resulting accumulation of acetyl-CoA activates ketogenesis. Insulin and glucagon are key regulating hormones of ketogenesis. Both hormones regulate hormone-sensitive lipase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Hormone-sensitive lipase produces diglycerides from triglycerides, freeing a fatty acid molecule for oxidation. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl- CoA reduces the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, an enzyme that brings fatty acids into the mitochondria for Œ≤-oxidation. Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase and activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby reducing the amount of starting materials for fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting their capacity to enter the mitochondria. Glucagon activates hormone-sensitive lipase and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby stimulating ketone body production, and making passage into the mitochondria for Œ≤-oxidation easier. Insulin also inhibits HMG-CoA lyase, further inhibiting ketone body production. Similarly, cortisol, catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the amount of ketone bodies produced, by activating lipolysis (the mobilization of fatty acids out of fat tissue) and thereby increasing the concentration of fatty acids available for Œ≤-oxidation. Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor alpha (PPARŒ±) also has the ability to regulate ketogenesis, as it has some control over a number of genes involved in ketogenesis. For example, monocarboxylate transporter 1, which is involved in transporting ketone bodies over membranes (including the blood-brain barrier), is regulated by PPARŒ±, thus affecting ketone body transportation into the brain. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase is also regulated by PPARŒ±, which can affect fatty acid transportation into the mitochondria. ==Pathology== Both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are acidic, and, if levels of these ketone bodies are too high, the pH of the blood drops, resulting in ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is known to occur in untreated type I diabetes (see diabetic ketoacidosis) and in alcoholics after prolonged binge-drinking without intake of sufficient carbohydrates (see alcoholic ketoacidosis). Ketogenesis can be ineffective in people with beta oxidation defects. Individuals with diabetes mellitus can experience overproduction of ketone bodies due to a lack of insulin. Without insulin to help extract glucose from the blood, tissues the levels of malonyl- CoA are reduced, and it becomes easier for fatty acids to be transported into mitochondria, causing the accumulation of excess acetyl-CoA. The accumulation of acetyl-CoA in turn produces excess ketone bodies through ketogenesis. The result is a rate of ketone production higher than the rate of ketone disposal, and a decrease in blood pH. There are some health benefits to ketone bodies and ketogenesis as well. It has been suggested that a low-carb, high fat ketogenic diet can be used to help treat epilepsy in children. Additionally, ketone bodies can be anti-inflammatory. Some kinds of cancer cells are unable to use ketone bodies, as they do not have the necessary enzymes to engage in ketolysis. It has been proposed that actively engaging in behaviors that promote ketogenesis could help manage the effects of some cancers. ==See also== * Ketone bodies * Fatty acid metabolism * Ketosis * Ketogenic diet ==References== ==External links== * Fat metabolism at University of South Australia * James Baggott.

His most famous pieces include the United States Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial, 1954) in Arlington County, Virginia and the Malaysian National Monument (1966) in Kuala Lumpur. ==Biography== U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial at night Felix de Weldon was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary on April 12, 1907. He received his early education at St. Egichin's Grammar School. In 1925, he earned an AB from Marchetti College,Who's Who in Marine Corps History a preparatory college.Ness, Oral History Interview, 1969. From the University of Vienna's Academy of Creative Arts and School of Architecture, he earned his M.A. and M.S. degrees in 1927 and his PhD in 1929. De Weldon first received notice as a sculptor at the age of 17, with his statue of Austrian educator and diplomat Professor Ludo Hartman. In the 1920s, he joined artist's communes in France, Italy and Spain. De Weldon eventually moved to London, where he gained a number of commissions, among them a portrait sculpture of George V. A consequential trip to Canada to sculpt Prime Minister Mackenzie King brought De Weldon to North America. He settled in the United States in 1937. De Weldon enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II and was discharged with the rank of Painter Second Class (PTR 2). He became a United States citizen in 1945. In 1950, President Harry Truman appointed de Weldon to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.Thomas E. Luebke, ed. Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 543. In 1956, he was re-appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower, and again in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. In 1959, he received an honorary knighthood for his service to the British Crown. In 1951, De Weldon acquired the historic Beacon Rock estate in Newport, Rhode Island, where he lived until 1996 when he lost the property and most of his assets to financial hardship. Felix de Weldon died on June 3, 2003 at the age of 96, in Woodstock, Virginia and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. de Weldon is survived by his son Daniel DeWeldon. He was also the father of the late Byron deWeldon, who died June 6, 2017. Daniel is collaborating with Allen Nalasco on a biopic of his father's life titled \\"De Weldon ‚Äì The Man Behind The Monuments\\". Daniel will play the part of Felix during the height of his career. ==Work== Senator Bob Bartlett in the National Statuary Hall Approximately 1,200 de Weldon sculptures are located on seven countries. (A de Weldon monument of Richard Byrd is on McMurdo Sound, in Antarctica). At the conclusion of the war in 1945, the Congress of the United States commissioned de Weldon to construct the statue for the Marine Corps War Memorial (called Iwo Jima Memorial) in the realist tradition, based upon the famous photograph of Joe Rosenthal, of the Associated Press agency, taken on February 23, 1945. De Weldon made sculptures from life of three (on June 23, 2016, John Bradley was not believed to be in the photo)USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, June 23, 2016 of the six servicemen raising the replacement United States flag on Mount Suribachi, on Iwo Jima. The other three flag-raisers who were killed in action (on June 23, 2016, Harold Schultz was identified as a flag-raiser in the photo and was not KIA) later on the island were sculpted from photographs. De Weldon took nine years to make the memorial which was dedicated on November 10, 1954, and was assisted by hundreds of other sculptors. The result is the 100-ton bronze statue which is on display in Arlington, Virginia. De Weldon also contributed in creating Malaysia's Tugu Negara (National Monument) when the country's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman saw the Marine Corps War Memorial statue in his visit to America in October 1960 and personally met him for favour to design the monument. De Weldon was later conferred with the title Tan Sri, the Malaysian equivalent of a high-ranking knighthood. ==Images== File:USMC War Memorial 2008-06-23.JPGIwo Jima Memorial - Arlington, Virginia File:Richard Byrd's Bust.jpgRichard Evelyn Byrd memorial, McMurdo Station.

He is the author of best-selling non-fiction books‚ÄîInto the Wild; Into Thin Air; Under the Banner of Heaven; and Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman‚Äîas well as numerous magazine articles. He was a member of an ill-fated expedition to summit Mount Everest in 1996, one of the deadliest disasters in the history of climbing Everest. == Early life == Krakauer was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, as the third of five children of Carol Ann (n√©e Jones) and Lewis Joseph Krakauer. His father was Jewish and his mother was a Unitarian, of Scandinavian descent. He was raised in Corvallis, Oregon, from the age of two. His father introduced the young Krakauer to mountaineering at the age of eight. His father was \\"relentlessly competitive and ambitious in the extreme\\" and placed high expectations on Krakauer, wishing for his son to attend Harvard Medical School and become a doctor, \\"life's one sure path to meaningful success and lasting happiness.\\" He competed in tennis at Corvallis High School, and graduated in 1972. He went on to study at Hampshire College in Massachusetts, where in 1976 he received his degree in Environmental Studies. In 1977, he met former climber Linda Mariam Moore, and they married in 1980. They lived in Seattle, Washington, but moved to Boulder, Colorado, after the release of Krakauer's book Into Thin Air. == Mountaineering == After graduating from college, Krakauer spent five weeks alone in the wilderness of the Stikine Icecap region of Alaska and climbed a new route on the Devils Thumb, an experience he described in Eiger Dreams and in Into the Wild. In 1992, he made his way to Cerro Torre in the Andes of Patagonia‚Äîa sheer granite peak considered to be one of the most difficult technical climbs in the world. In 1996, Krakauer took part in a guided ascent of Mount Everest. His group was one of those caught in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which a violent storm trapped a number of climbers high on the slopes of the mountain. Krakauer reached the peak and returned to camp, but four of his teammates (including group leader Rob Hall) died while making their descent in the storm. A candid recollection of the event was published in Outside magazine and, later, in the book Into Thin Air. By the end of the 1996 climbing season, fifteen people had died on the mountain, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history to that point. This has been exceeded by the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche, and the 2015 earthquake avalanche disaster in which nineteen people were killed. Krakauer publicly criticized the commercialization of Mount Everest following this tragedy. == Journalism == Krakauer in 2009 Much of Krakauer's popularity as a writer came from his work as a journalist for Outside. In November 1983, he was able to give up his part-time work as a fisherman and carpenter to become a full-time writer. In addition to his work on mountain climbing, the topics he covered as a freelance writer varied greatly; his writing has also appeared in Architectural Digest, National Geographic Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Smithsonian. Krakauer's 1992 book Eiger Dreams collects some of his articles written between 1982 and 1989. On assignment for Outside, Krakauer wrote an article focusing on two parties during his ascent of Mt. Everest: the one he was in, led by Rob Hall, and the one led by Scott Fischer, both of whom successfully guided clients to the summit but experienced severe difficulty during the descent. The storm, and, in his estimation, irresponsible choices by guides of both parties, led to a number of deaths, including both head guides. Krakauer felt the short account did not accurately cover the event, and clarified his initial statements‚Äîespecially those regarding the death of Andy Harris‚Äîin Into Thin Air, which also includes extensive interviews with fellow survivors. In 1999, he received an Arts and Letters award for Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. == Books == === Eiger Dreams === Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains (1990) is a non-fiction collection of articles and essays by Jon Krakauer on mountaineering and rock climbing. It concerns a variety of topics, from ascending the Eiger Nordwand in the Swiss Alps, Denali in Alaska or K2 in the Karakoram, to the well-known rock climbers Krakauer has met on his trips, such as John Gill. === Into the Wild === Into the Wild was published in 1996 and spent two years on The New York Times Best Seller List. The book employs a non-linear narrative that documents the travels of Christopher McCandless, a young man from a well-to-do East Coast family who, in 1990, after graduating from Emory University, donated all of the money ($24,000) in his bank account to the humanitarian charity Oxfam, renamed himself \\"Alexander Supertramp\\", and began a journey in the American West. McCandless' remains were found in September 1992; he had died of starvation in Alaska on the Stampede Trail at near Lake Wentitika in Denali National Park and Preserve. In the book, Krakauer draws parallels between McCandless' experiences and his own, and the experiences of other adventurers. Into The Wild was adapted into a film of the same name, which was released on September 21, 2007. === Into Thin Air === In 1997, Krakauer expanded his September 1996 Outside article into Into Thin Air. The book describes the climbing parties' experiences and the general state of Everest mountaineering at the time. Hired as a journalist by the magazine, Krakauer had participated as a client of the 1996 Everest climbing team led by Rob Hall‚Äîthe team which ended up suffering the greatest casualties in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. The book reached the top of The New York Times' non- fiction bestseller list, was honored as \\"Book of the Year\\" by Time magazine, and was among three books considered for the General Non-Fiction Pulitzer Prize in 1998. The American Academy of Arts and Letters gave Krakauer an Academy Award in Literature in 1999 for his work, commenting that the writer \\"combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer. His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport.\\" Krakauer has contributed royalties from this book to the Everest '96 Memorial Fund at the Boulder Community Foundation, which he founded as a tribute to his deceased climbing partners. In a TV-movie version of the book, Krakauer was played by Christopher McDonald. Everest, a feature film based on the events of the disaster directed by Baltasar Korm√°kur, was released in 2015. In the film, Krakauer is portrayed by Michael Kelly. Krakauer denounced the movie, saying some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director Baltasar Korm√°kur responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film, and alleged that his version of events conflicted with the plot. In the book, Krakauer noted that Russian- Kazakhstani guide Anatoli Boukreev, Scott Fischer's top guide on the expedition, ascended the summit without supplemental oxygen, \\"which didn't seem to be in [the] clients' best interest\\".Krakauer, Jon. Into the Air. Anchor Books, 1999 paperback edition. p. 187. He also wrote that Boukreev descended from the summit several hours ahead of his clients, and that this was \\"extremely unorthodox behavior for a guide\\".Krakauer, Jon. Into the Air. Anchor Books, 1999 paperback edition. p. 218. He noted however that, once he had descended to the top camp, Boukreev was heroic in his tireless attempts to rescue the missing climbers. Five months after Into Thin Air was published, Boukreev gave his own account of the Everest disaster in the book The Climb, co-written with G. Weston DeWalt. Differences centered on what experienced mountaineers thought about the facts of Boukreev's performance. As Galen Rowell from the American Alpine Journal wrote to Krakauer, \\"the fact that every one of Boukreev's clients survived without major injuries while the clients who died or received major injuries were members of your party. Could you explain how Anatoli [Boukreev]'s shortcomings as a guide led to the survival of his clients‚Ä¶?\\"DeWalt p.267 In an article in the Wall Street Journal, Rowell cited numerous inconsistencies in Krakauer's narrative, observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers. Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: \\"[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke.\\" Conversely, Scott Fischer, the leader of Boukreev's team who died on the mountain, had complained continuously about Boukreev's shirking responsibility and his inability to meet the demands put upon him as the top guide‚Äîcomplaints documented in transcripts of radio transmissions between Fischer and his base-camp managers. After the publication of Into Thin Air and The Climb, DeWalt, Boukreev, and Krakauer became embroiled in disagreements about Krakauer's portrayal of Boukreev. Krakauer had reached a d√©tente with Boukreev in November 1997, but the Russian climber was killed by an avalanche only a few weeks later while climbing Annapurna.Author's postscript, 1999 edition of Into Thin Air. === Under the Banner of Heaven === In 2003, Under the Banner of Heaven became Krakauer's third non-fiction bestseller. The book examines extremes of religious belief, specifically fundamentalist offshoots of Mormonism. Krakauer looks at the practice of polygamy in these offshoots and scrutinizes it in the context of the Latter Day Saints religion throughout its history. Much of the focus of the book is on the Lafferty brothers, who murdered in the name of their fundamentalist faith. In 2006, Tom Elliott and Pawel Gula produced a documentary inspired by the book, Damned to Heaven. Robert Millet, Professor of Religious Understanding at Brigham Young University, an LDS institution, reviewed the book and described it as confusing, poorly organized, misleading, erroneous, prejudicial and insulting. Mike Otterson, Director of Media Relations for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), told the Associated Press, \\"This book is not history, and Krakauer is no historian. He is a storyteller who cuts corners to make the story sound good. His basic thesis appears to be that people who are religious are irrational, and that irrational people do strange things.\\" In response, Krakauer criticized the LDS Church hierarchy, citing the opinion of D. Michael Quinn, a historian who was excommunicated in 1993, who wrote that \\"The tragic reality is that there have been occasions when Church leaders, teachers, and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the Mormon past, but have offered to the Saints instead a mixture of platitudes, half-truths, omissions, and plausible denials\\". Krakauer wrote, \\"I happen to share Dr. Quinn's perspective\\". === Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman === In the October 25, 2007, season premiere of Iconoclasts on the Sundance Channel, Krakauer mentioned being deeply embroiled in the writing of a new book, but did not reveal the title, subject, or expected date of completion. Doubleday Publishing originally planned to release the book in the fall of 2008, but postponed the launch in June of that year, announcing that Krakauer was \\"unhappy with the manuscript\\". The book, Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman, was released by Doubleday on September 15, 2009. It draws on the journals and letters of Pat Tillman, an NFL professional football player and U.S. Army Ranger whose death in Afghanistan made him a symbol of American sacrifice and heroism, though it also became a subject of controversy because of the U.S. Army's cover-up of the fact that Tillman died by friendly fire, that is, he was killed by another U.S. soldier. The book draws on the journals and letters of Tillman, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and research Krakauer performed in Afghanistan. It also serves in part as a historical narrative, providing a general history of the civil wars in Afghanistan. Writing about the book in the New York Times book review, Dexter Filkins said that \\"too many of the details of Tillman‚Äôs life recounted here are mostly banal and inconsequential\\", but also stated, concerning Tillman's death, \\"While most of the facts have been reported before, Krakauer performs a valuable service by bringing them all together‚Äîparticularly those about the cover-up. The details, even five years later, are nauseating to read\\". In his review in the Los Angeles Times, Dan Neil wrote that the book is \\"a beautiful bit of reporting\\" and \\"the definitive version of events surrounding Tillman's death\\". === Three Cups of Deceit: How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way === Three Cups of Deceit is a 2011 e-book that made claims of mismanagement and accounting fraud by Greg Mortenson, a humanitarian who built schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan; and his charity, the Central Asia Institute (CAI). It was later released in paperback by Anchor Books. The book‚Äîand a related 60 Minutes interview broadcast the day before the book's release‚Äîwere controversial. Some CAI donors filed a class-action lawsuit against Mortenson for having allegedly defrauded them with false claims in his books. The suit was evenutally rejected. In December 2011, CAI produced a comprehensive list of projects completed over a period of years and projects CAI is currently working on. Mortenson and CAI were investigated by the Montana Attorney General, who determined that they had made financial \\"missteps\\", and the Attorney General reached a settlement for restitution from Mortenson to CAI in excess of $1 million. The 2016 documentary 3000 Cups of Tea by Jennifer Jordan and Jeff Rhoads claims that the accusations against Mortenson put forward by 60 Minutes and Jon Krakauer are largely untrue. Jordan said in 2014: \\"We are still investigating this story. So far, our findings are indicating that the majority of the allegations are grossly misrepresented to make him appear in the worst possible light, or are outright false. Yes, Greg is a bad manager and accountant, and he is the first to admit that, but he is also a tireless humanitarian with a crucially important mission.\\" === Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town === Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town (2015) explores how rape is handled by colleges and the criminal justice system. The book follows several case studies of women raped in Missoula, Montana, many of them linked in some way to the University of Montana. Krakauer attempts to illuminate why many victims do not want to report their rapes to the police, and he criticizes the justice system for giving the benefit of the doubt to assailants but not to victims. Krakauer was inspired to write the book when a friend of his, a young woman, revealed to him that she had been raped. Emily Bazelon, writing for the New York Times Book Review, gave the book a lukewarm review, criticizing it for not fully exploring its characters or appreciating the difficulty colleges face in handling and trying to prevent sexual assault. \\"Instead of delving deeply into questions of fairness as universities try to fulfill a recent government mandate to conduct their own investigations and hearings ‚Äì apart from the police and the courts ‚Äì Krakauer settles for bromides,\\" Bazelon wrote. \\"University procedures should 'swiftly identify student offenders and prevent them from reoffending, while simultaneously safeguarding the rights of the accused,' he writes, asserting that this 'will be difficult, but it's not rocket science\\". === As editor === , Krakauer edits the Exploration series of the Modern Library. == Selected bibliography == * Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains (1990) * Into the Wild (1996) * Into Thin Air (1997) (expanded from an article in Outside magazine) * Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith (2003) * Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman (2009) * Three Cups of Deceit (2011) * Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town (2015) * Classic Krakauer: Essays on Wilderness and Risk (2019) == Notes == == References == * * == External links == * * * Category:1954 births Category:20th-century American writers Category:21st- century American non-fiction writers Category:Jewish American journalists Category:American male journalists Category:American male writers Category:American mountain climbers Category:American non-fiction outdoors writers Category:American summiters of Mount Everest Category:American people of Scandinavian descent Category:Corvallis High School (Oregon) alumni Category:Hampshire College alumni Category:Jewish American writers Category:Journalists from Oregon Category:Living people Category:Male feminists Category:Mormon studies Category:People from Brookline, Massachusetts Category:People from Corvallis, Oregon Category:Writers from Boulder, Colorado Category:Writers from Oregon ","title":"Jon Krakauer"},{"id":"299653","text":"Richard Byrd may refer to: *Richard C.

Registered in April 1998, its total assets were worth over ‚Ç±8.5 billion (US$197 million) in 2008. 120 (20 percent) of DLSU faculty had been involved in 80 research projects between March 2008 and February 2009. 39 (12 percent) of its faculty had their research published in ISI-listed journals in 2008. Since 2000, DLSU has been the Commission on Higher Education Zonal Research Center for the 59 colleges and universities located in Las Pi√±as, Makati, Manila, Muntinlupa, Para√±aque, Pasay, Pasig, Pateros, Taguig and San Juan. Its functions include evaluation of research proposals for recommendation for CHED funding and monitoring of CHED-funded researches, among others. The College of Computer Studies Center for Empathic Human- Computer Interactions specializes in affective computing, a study that seeks to create machines capable of reacting to human emotions. The center is funded by the Philippine Department of Science and Technology. Emotion recognition (including laughter recognition), behavior prediction and the influence of music to emotion are among the center's research, many of which are in collaboration with Osaka University. The center, also in collaboration with Osaka, is the first one that constructed an empathic computing space in the Philippines. The Center for Micro-Hydro Technology for Rural Electrification of the College of Engineering, established in 2002 through Japan International Cooperation Agency funds, is engaged in designing micro hydro generators. The center, in coordination with the Philippine Department of Energy, has been involved in the electrification of remote areas using micro hydro installations. SINAG, the first Philippine solar car Both of the only two solar cars, SINAG (Tagalog for light beam) and SIKAT (brilliance), of the Philippines were made by DLSU engineering faculty and students. SINAG participated in the 2007 World Solar Challenge, and finished 12th among 40 entries. SIKAT (which has more advanced solar cells, a more aerodynamic body, and 100 kg less weight) will participate in the 2011 competition. The project is funded by several private companies, including Ford Philippines, Pilipinas Shell, Philippine Airlines and San Miguel Corporation. The College of Engineering is among the 18 \\"National Research Institutions\\" of the Asian Regional Research Programme on Environmental Technology, a project funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and coordinated by the Asian Institute of Technology that seeks to assess environmental degradation in Asia. The college has also conducted research on biodiesel from the pili nut and winged bean, and sustainable technology. In 2020, De La Salle University captured the attention of British diplomats and scientists with its research on converting wastewater or toilet sludge into nutrient-rich fertilizer. The study aims to find a sustainable alternative to importing phosphates as fertilizer for farms in the Philippines. The research project won ‚Ç±13 million from the Newton Fund of the U.K. government. The University's I-Nano facility has initiated a project on developing a Thermal Mechanical Garment (outer layer of a space suit) made from Abaca fiber. This is officially funded by the DOST and to be collaborated alongside the Technological University of the Philippines, FEATI University, Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, and the Philippine Textile Research Institute. The study aims to fabricate a layered structure of fabric out of Abaca fibers coated by a nanocomposite material for electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal resistance. ==Student life== Br. Connon Hall, location of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs As of 2010, the Council of Student Organizations, a union of DLSU-accredited student organizations, had 39 members. Founded in 1974, the council oversees implementation of university- wide activities, such as annual freshmen welcoming. The LaSallian (first published in 1960) and Ang Pahayagang Plaridel (Tagalog for The Plaridel Newspaper; first published in 1984) are the official student newspapers of the university. The two, written in English and Filipino respectively, are among the four periodicals managed by the Student Media Office. Other student media groups managed by the Student Media Office include the Malate Literary Portfolio, Green & White, Green Giant FM, and Archers Network. left ===Performing arts=== The De La Salle University Chorale is \\"the premiere chorale group in the university.\\" Since its establishment in 1987, it has won several awards from different international choir competitions, including the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in 1992 and 2010 for the chamber and folk music, and the grand prize in the Tampere Vocal Music Festival in 1995, among others. The La Salle Dance Company ‚Äì Street is the first champion of the UAAP Street Dance Competition, an annual event organized by the University Athletic Association of the Philippines since it was first introduced in the second semester of UAAP Season 73 in 2011. They have won the most number of titles in the seniors' division of the UAAP Street Dance Competition with four championships. They also represent the country as frequent finalists in the World Hip Hop Dance Championships. Other groups in the company specialize in contemporary and folk. Established around 1966, the Harlequin Theatre Guild is the official theater organization of DLSU. It has performed plays written by Palanca Awards laureates, including Unang Ulan ng Mayo (Tagalog for First Rainfall of May) by John Iremil Teodoro, which was staged for the fourth time in December 2011 in line with the LGBT month of Metro Manila and Rizal is My President: 40 Leadership Tips from Jose Rizal by Joshua So based on the book written by Napoleon G. Almonte and staged during the May 2009 Presidential Elections. Other notable organizations include the De La Salle Innersoul, Green Media Group, and Lasallian Youth Orchestra. ===Sports tradition=== Green Archer Statue The De La Salle Green Archers in 2010 De La Salle has several varsity teams and sport clubs participating in different sports competitions, most notably basketball, volleyball, football and cheerleading. The university was a founding member in 1924 of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), in which it won five General Championships (1972‚Äì73, 1974‚Äì75, 1976‚Äì77, 1977‚Äì78, and 1980‚Äì81) until La Salle withdrew from the league in 1981. Br. John Lynam FSC, established the first De La Salle basketball team. In 1924, he was one of the organizers of the pre-war National Collegiate Athletic Association as the first and oldest collegiate athletic association in the Philippines composed of De La Salle, San Beda, Ateneo, Letran, UP, UST, FEU, NU and UM. In 1986, De La Salle University was admitted into the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), an intercollegiate sporting association formed in 1938. Ever since joining the UAAP in 1986, DLSU has won three UAAP General Championships ‚Äì Season 75 (2012‚Äì13), Season 76 (2013‚Äì14), and Season 78 (2015‚Äì16), giving the university a combined eight General Championship titles in the seniors' division in the NCAA and UAAP. The DLSU Animo Squad was originally known in its pre-war NCAA years as Br. John Lynam's 1924 LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, then in 1926 as the LSC Yell Commanders. The DLSC Squad was the first and oldest Collegiate Coed Spirit Team in the Philippines. It was renamed decades later on as the post- war DLSC Cheerleading Squad, then in the 1980s as the DLSU Pep Squad until 2008, when it was renamed by Br. Bernard Oca FSC, as the present DLSU Animo Squad. The DLSU Green & White Spirit Team has since then won five cheer dance podium finishes in the span of its UAAP participation, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2011 and 2013. The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924 to 1926 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernard Oca's present DLSU Animo Squad has been continuously cheerleading for years. The first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from St. Scholastica's College, Manila before De La Salle College turned co-educational in 1973. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \\"Men of La Salle!, \\"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\\", \\"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\\" and several more. In 1941, the DLSC Green & White yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \\"Hail to De La Salle\\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \\"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \\"Invictus La Salle!\\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP. ==Partner institution== ===Malaysia=== *Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman ==Notable alumni== Jaime Sin Notable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include: *Jose Diokno ‚Äì Politician *Lorenzo Tanada ‚Äì Politician *Salvador H.

It was opened on 12 July 1997 and bombed by the United States on August 20, 1998. The industrial complex was composed of four buildings. It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum and employed over 300 workers, producing medicine both for human and veterinary use. The factory was destroyed in 1998 by a missile attack launched by the United States government, killing one employee and wounding eleven. The U.S. government claimed that the factory was used for the processing of VX nerve agent and that the owners of the plant had ties to the terrorist group al-Qaeda. These justifications for the bombing were disputed by the owners of the plant, the Sudanese government, and other governments. American officials later acknowledged \\"that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s.\\" The attack took place a week after the Monica Lewinsky scandal and two months after the film Wag the Dog, prompting some commentators to describe the attack as a distraction for the public from the scandal. ==Destruction== On 20 August 1998, the factory was destroyed in cruise missile strikes launched by the United States military allegedly in retaliation for the truck bomb attacks on its embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya on 7 August. The administration of President Bill Clinton justified the attacks, dubbed Operation Infinite Reach, on the grounds that the al-Shifa plant was involved with processing the deadly nerve agent VX, and had ties with the Islamist al- Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden, which was believed to be behind the embassy bombings and Operation Bojinka, an alleged large-scale terrorist plot. U.S. action on 20 August also hit al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, where bin Laden had moved following his May 1996 expulsion from Sudan. ==Evidence== Destroyed factory in 2008 The key piece of physical evidence linking the Al-Shifa facility to production of chemical weapons was the discovery of EMPTA in a soil sample taken from the plant during a CIA clandestine operation. EMPTA, or O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid, is classified as a Schedule 2B compound under the Chemical Weapons Convention, meaning that while it is a chemical weapons precursor (it can be used to manufacture VX nerve agent),Benjamin, Daniel & Steven Simon. \\"The Age of Sacred Terror\\", 2002. it also has legitimate small-scale applications outside of chemical warfare and so is permitted to be manufactured in small quantities. Although potential uses and patented processes using EMPTA existed, such as the manufacture of plastic, no known industrial uses of EMPTA were ever documented, nor were any products that contained EMPTA. It is, however, not banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, as originally claimed by the U.S. government. Moreover, the presence of EMPTA near (but outside) the boundary of Al-Shifa does not prove that it was produced in the factory; EMPTA could have been \\"stored in or transported near Al-Shifa, instead of being produced by it\\", according to a report by Michael Barletta. Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering claimed to have sufficient evidence against Sudan, including contacts between officials at Al-Shifa plant and Iraqi chemical weapons experts, with the Iraq chemical weapons program the only one identified with using EMPTA for VX production. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a Sudanese opposition in Cairo led by Mubarak Al-Mahdi, also insisted that the plant was producing ingredients for chemical weapons. According to Clinton Administration officials, the plant, moreover, was heavily guarded, and showed no signs of ordinary commercial activities. However, a British engineer, Thomas Carnaffin, who worked as a technical manager during the plant's construction between 1992 and 1996, stated that the plant was neither heavily guarded nor secret, and that he never observed evidence of the production of an ingredient needed for nerve gas. The group that monitors compliance with the treaty banning chemical weapons announced that EMPTA did have legitimate commercial purposes in the manufacture of fungicides and antibiotics, and the owner of the factory stated emphatically in interviews that the plant was not used for anything other than pharmaceuticals, and that there was no evidence to the contrary. Former Clinton administration counter terrorism advisor Richard Clarke and former national security advisor Sandy Berger also noted the facilities alleged ties with the former Iraqi government. Clarke also cited Iraq's $199,000 contract with al Shifa for veterinary medicine under the UN's Oil-for-Food Programme. David Kay, a former UN weapons inspector also said that Iraq may have assisted in the construction of the Al-Shifa plant, noting also that Sudan would be unlikely to have the technical knowledge to produce VX.Staff (21 August 1998) VX the most toxic of nerve agents CNN, Retrieved 17 August 2012 Officials later acknowledged, however, \\"that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s.\\" However, a Clinton State Department official stated that a money manager for bin Laden claimed that bin Laden had invested in Al Shifa. The Al Shifa manager lived in the same Sudan house where bin Laden had previously lived.Susman, Tina (27 August 1998) Bin Laden Link: El-Shifa Factory Chief Lives in House He Used to Occupy Newsday, Retrieved 17 August 2012 The U.S. State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate. James Risen reported in the New York Times: \\"Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak.\\" The Chairman of El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, who is critical of the Sudanese government, told reporters: \\"I had inventories of every chemical and records of every employee's history. There were no such [nerve gas] chemicals being made here.\\" In 2004, nonetheless, Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified to the 9/11 Commission by characterizing Al Shifa as a \\"WMD-related facility\\", which played a \\"chemical weapons role\\" such as to pose a risk that it, with the help of the alleged Iraqi chemical weapons program connections, might help Al Qaeda get chemical weapons technology. The Sudanese government wants the plant preserved in its destroyed condition as a reminder of the American attack and also invited the U.S. to conduct chemical testing at the site, however, the U.S. refused the invitation. Sudan has asked the U.S. for an apology for the attack but the U.S. has refused on the grounds it has not ruled out the possibility the plant had some connection to chemical weapons development. Directly after the strike the Sudanese government demanded that the United Nations Security Council conduct an investigation of the site to determine if it had been used to produce chemical weapons or precursors. Such an investigation was opposed by the U.S., which has also blocked an independent laboratory analysis of the sample allegedly containing EMPTA. Michael Barletta concludes that there is no evidence the Al-Shifa factory was ever involved in production of chemical weapons, and it is known that many of the initial U.S. allegations were wrong. ==Consequences== The Observer noted that \\"[T]he loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines\\" quoting Tom Carnaffin, technical manager with \\"intimate knowledge\\" of the destroyed plant.Vulliamy, Ed, et al., The Observer, 23 August 1998., as quoted in Ahmed, Nafeez Mosaddeq, \\"United States Terrorism in the Sudan\\", Media Monitors Network. Accessed 2011-08-19. A month later, Guardian correspondent Patrick Wintour elaborated that the plant \\"provided 50 per cent of Sudan‚Äôs medicines, and its destruction has left the country with no supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment for malaria\\". He continued that, despite this, the British government (who publicly backed the attack) refused requests \\"to resupply chloroquine in emergency relief until such time as the Sudanese can rebuild their pharmaceutical production\\".Wintour, Patrick, The Observer, 20 December 1998, as quoted in Ahmed, Nafeez Mosaddeq, \\"United States Terrorism in the Sudan\\", Media Monitors Network.

The factory was a principal source of Sudan's anti-malaria and veterinary drugs according to the CBW Conventions Bulletin.The CBW Conventions Bulletin December 1998 Germany's ambassador to Sudan from 1996 to 2000, Werner Daum, wrote an article in 2001 in which he called \\"several tens of thousands of deaths\\" of Sudanese civilians caused by a medicine shortage a \\"reasonable guess\\".Daum, Werner. \\"\\"several tens of thousands of deaths\\" Universalism and the West, Harvard International Review, \\"An Agenda for Understanding\\" by Werner Daum, The Future of War, Vol. 23 (2) - Summer 2001 Issue. Human Rights Watch reported that the bombing had the unintended effect of stopping relief efforts aimed at supplying food to areas of Sudan gripped by famine caused by that country's ongoing civil war. Many of these agencies had been wholly or partially manned by Americans who subsequently evacuated the country out of fear of retaliation. A letter by that agency to President Clinton stated \\"many relief efforts have been postponed indefinitely, including a crucial one run by the U.S.-based International Rescue Committee where more than fifty southerners are dying daily\\".Letter to Clinton Urges Sudan Factory Inspection Human Rights Watch, September 15, 1998 Mark Huband in the Financial Times wrote that the attack \\"shattered ... the expected benefits of a political shift at the heart of Sudan's Islamicist government\\" towards a \\"pragmatic engagement with the outside world\\".\\"shattered ... the expected benefits of a political shift at the heart of Sudan's Islamicist government\\" Mark Huband, Financial Times, 8 September 1998, cited The Left at War by Michael Berube, New York University Press 2009 Journalist Jason Burke, in the book Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror, claims that Operation Infinite Reach \\"merely confirmed to [bin Laden and his close associates], and others with similar views worldwide, that their conception of the world as a cosmic struggle between good and evil was the right one\\". ==Criticism== Christopher Hitchens wrote that the factory \\"could not have been folded like a tent and spirited away in a day or so. And the United States has diplomatic relations with Sudan. ... Well then, what was the hurry? ... There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look 'presidential' for a day.\\"\\"They bomb pharmacies, don't they?\\", Salon.com The 9/11 Commission Report evaluated such so-called \\"Wag the Dog\\" theories (the strikes being motivated to deflect attention from domestic, political troubles), and found no reason to believe them, nor disbelieve the testimony and assertions of former President Clinton, former Vice President Gore, CIA Chief Tenet, nor former security advisors Berger and Clarke that the destruction of Al Shifa was still, as of 2004, a justifible national security target. The U.S. Justice Department, under President George W. Bush, produced an alleged al-Qaeda defector as a witness on 13 February 2001, in its ongoing case against Osama Bin Laden. The witness, Jamal al-Fadl, testified that Al Qaeda operatives he was involved with had been engaged in manufacturing chemical weapons in Khartoum, Sudan, around 1993 or 1994. In 2001, The Guardian reported that \\"the factory's owner, Salah Idris, vigorously denied that he or the factory had any link with such weapons or any terrorist group. He attempted to sue the U.S. government for ¬£35 million after hiring experts to show that the plant made only medicines. Despite growing support for Idris's case in the U.S. and Britain, Washington refused to retract any of its claims and contested the lawsuit.Antony Barnett and Conal Walsh, \\"'Terror' link TVs guard UK\\", The Guardian (14 October 2001). The court dismissed the case under the political question doctrine, and Idris appealed unsuccessfully.EL SHIFA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES COMPANY v. UNITED STATES, No. 07-5174 The bombing of the al-Shifa factory resurfaced in the news in April 2006 after the firing of former CIA analyst Mary McCarthy. McCarthy was against the bombing of the factory in 1998, and had written a formal letter of protest to President Clinton. According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, she had voiced doubts that the factory had ties to al Qaeda or was producing chemical weapons. The New York Times reported: \\"In the case of the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, her concerns may have been well-founded. Sudanese officials and the plant's owner denied any connection to Al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, the internal White House debate over whether the intelligence reports about the plant were accurate spilled into the press. Eventually, Clinton administration officials conceded that the hardest evidence used to justify striking the plant was a single soil sample that seemed to indicate the presence of a chemical used in making VX gas.\\" ==Responsibility== Thomas Joscelyn quotes Daniel Benjamin, a former U.S. National Security Council staffer: \\"The report of the 9/11 Commission notes that the National Security staff reviewed the intelligence in April 2000 and concluded that the CIA's assessment of its intelligence on bin Laden and al-Shifa had been valid; the memo to Clinton on this was cosigned by Richard Clarke and Mary McCarthy, the NSC senior director for intelligence programs, who opposed the bombing of al- Shifa in 1998. The report also notes that in their testimony before the commission, Al Gore, Sandy Berger, George Tenet, and Richard Clarke all stood by the decision to bomb al-Shifa.\\" Former Secretary of Defense Cohen defended, in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission in 2004, along with other cited Clinton security cabinet members in their separate 9/11 Commission testimony, the decision to destroy Al-Shifa: \\"At the time, the intelligence community at the highest level repeatedly assured us that \\"it never gets better than this\\" in terms of confidence in an intelligence conclusion regarding a hard target. There was a good reason for this confidence, including multiple, reinforcing elements of information ranging from links that the organization that built the facility had both with Bin Laden and with the leadership of the Iraqi chemical weapons program; extraordinary security when the facility was constructed; physical evidence from the site; and other information from HUMINT and technical sources. Given what we knew regarding terrorists‚Äô interest in acquiring and using chemical weapons against Americans, and given the intelligence assessment provided us regarding the al-Shifa facility, I continue to believe that destroying it was the right decision.\\" ==See also== * Sudan‚ÄìUnited States relations ==References== ==External links== *A series of pictures of the Al-Shifa factory * * *US Terrorism in Sudan The Bombing of Al- Shifa and its Strategic Role in U.S.-Sudan Relations Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1998 Category:Industrial buildings in Sudan Category:History of Sudan Category:Clinton administration controversies Category:Buildings and structures in Khartoum Category:Al-Qaeda Category:Chemical warfare Category:Sudan‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Airstrikes by target Category:1997 establishments in Sudan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1997 Category:1998 disestablishments in Sudan ","title":"Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory"},{"id":"299670","text":"Jude's mugshot from her civil rights days. Judith [Jude] Milhon (March 12, 1939 ‚Äì July 19, 2003), in Washington D.C., best known by her pseudonym St. Jude, was a self-taught programmer, civil rights advocate, writer, editor, advocate for women in computing hacker and author in the San Francisco Bay Area. Milhon coined the term cypherpunk and was a founding member of the cypherpunks. On July 19, 2003, Milhon died of cancer. == Life == Judith Milhon was born March 12, 1939 in Washington D.C., raised in Indiana, to a military family of the Marine Corps. She married Robert Behling in 1961 and had one daughter, Tresca Behling, with him. Attracted to the growing countercultural movement, Milhon moved near Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and established a communal household with her husband, young daughter, and friends. In 1968 she moved to San Francisco with her friend and partner Efrem Lipkin and divorced her husband in 1970. At the time of her death in 2003 from cancer, she was survived by at least one child, Tresca Behling, and one grandchild, Emilio Zuniga, as well as her partner of over 40 years, Efrem Lipkin. ==Professional projects== Milhon taught herself programming in 1967 and landed her first job at the Horn and Hardart vending machine company of New York before she moved away to California to join the counterculture movement. She worked at the Berkeley Computer Company (an outgrowth of Project Genie), and she helped implement the communications controller of the BCC timesharing system. In 1971 she partnered with other local activists and technologists at Project One, where she was particularly drawn to the Resource One project, with the goal of creating the Bay Area‚Äôs first public computerized bulletin board system. In 1973, a subset of the Resource One group, including Milhon, broke away to create Community Memory in Berkeley. Later, she also worked on BSD, a Unix-based operating system developed by the Computer Systems Research Group at UC Berkeley. She was a member of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, and the author of several books. She was a senior editor at the magazine Mondo 2000 and frequent contributor to Boing Boing. ===Bibliography=== * The Joy of Hacker Sex (proposed) * How to Mutate & Take Over the World: an Exploded Post-Novel (1997) (with R.

She was active in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement helping to organize the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Dedicated to protest, Milhon was jailed for trespassing in Montgomery, Alabama as well as for for civil disobedience in Jackson, Mississippi. Activism within the cyber community was important to Milhon as well. She frequently urged women toward the internet and hacking while encouraging them to have \\"tough skin\\" in the face of harassment. At a time when the internet was dominated by men, she was an ardent advocate of the joys of hacking, cybersex and a woman's right to technology. She often said, \\"Girls need modems. Women may not be great at physical altercations, but we sure excel at rapid-fire keyboarding.\\" Milhon once noted that there was a conspicuous lack of female hardware hackers, and while working at Community Memory she worked against this exclusion and worked to get new, inexperienced users to experiment with Community Memory. She did so by writing open-ended questions in the system about available resources in the region (such as ‚ÄúWhere can I get a decent bagel in the Bay Area (Berkeley particularly)?‚Äù), which would get curious users to try out the system. She also wrote \\"The Cyberpunk Handbook\\" and coined the term \\"cypherpunk\\" for computer users dedicated to online privacy through encryption. ==References== ==External links== * Milhon, Jude.

He received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in applied mathematics from Harvard University (1975) and a Master's degree (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in computer science (1977, 1980). He then worked as an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a compiler implementer at Tartan Laboratories. Then he joined the supercomputer company Thinking Machines, where he helped define and promote a parallel computing version of the Lisp programming language named *Lisp (Star Lisp) and a parallel version of the language C named C*. In 1994, Steele joined Sun Microsystems and was invited by Bill Joy to become a member of the Java team after the language had been designed, since he had a track record of writing good specifications for extant languages. He was named a Sun Fellow in 2003. Steele joined Oracle in 2010 when Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems. ==Works== While at MIT, Steele published more than two dozen papers with Gerald Jay Sussman on the subject of the language Lisp and its implementation (the Lambda Papers). One of their most notable contributions was the design of the language Scheme. Steele also designed the original command set of Emacs and was the first to port TeX (from WAITS to ITS). He has published papers on other subjects, including compilers, parallel processing, and constraint languages. One song he composed has been published in the official journal of the Association for Computing Machinery Communications of the ACM (CACM) (\\"The Telnet Song\\", April 1984, a parody of the behavior of a series of PDP-10 TELNET implementations written by Mark Crispin). Steele has served on accredited technical standards committees, including: Ecma International (formerly European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)) TC39 (for the language ECMAScript, for which he was editor of the first edition), X3J11 (for C), and X3J3 (for Fortran) and is, , chairman of X3J13 (for Common Lisp). He was also a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) working group that produced the IEEE Standard for the language Scheme, IEEE Std 1178-1990. He represented Sun Microsystems in the High Performance Fortran Forum, which produced the High Performance Fortran specification in May, 1993. In addition to specifications of the language Java, Steele's work at Sun Microsystems has included research in parallel algorithms, implementation strategies, and architecture and software support. In 2005, Steele began leading a team of researchers at Sun developing a new language named Fortress, a high-performance language designed to obsolete Fortran. ===Books=== In 1982, Steele edited The Hacker's Dictionary (Harper & Row, 1983; ), which was a print version of the Jargon File. Steele and Samuel P. Harbison wrote C: A Reference Manual, (Prentice- Hall, 1984; ), to provide a precise description of the language C, which Tartan Laboratories was trying to implement on a wide range of systems. Both authors participated in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C standardization process; several revisions of the book were issued to reflect the new standard. On 16 March 1984, Steele published Common Lisp the Language (Digital Press; ; 465 pages). This first edition was the original specification of Common Lisp (CLtL1) and served as the basis for the ANSI standard. Steele released a greatly expanded second edition in 1990, (1029 pages) which documented a near-final version of the ANSI standard. Steele, along with Charles H. Koelbel, David B. Loveman, Robert S. Schreiber, and Mary E. Zosel wrote The High Performance Fortran Handbook (MIT Press, 1994; ). Steele also coauthored all three editions of The Java Language Specification (Addison-Wesley, third ed. 2005; ) with James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Gilad Bracha. ==Awards== Steele received the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1988. He was named an ACM Fellow in 1994, a member of the National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America in 2001 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. He received the Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming Award in 2005. ==Other activities== Steele is a modern western square dancer and caller from Mainstream up through C3A, a member of Tech Squares, and a member of Callerlab. Under the pseudonym Great Quux, which was an old student nickname at the Boston Latin School and MIT, he has published light verse and \\"Crunchly\\" cartoons; a few of the latter appeared in The New Hacker's Dictionary. He has also used the initialism GLS . In 1998, Steele solved the game Teeko via computer, showing what must occur if both players play wisely; he found that neither player can force a win. Steele also showed that the Advanced Teeko variant is a win for Black (again, assuming perfect play), as is one other variant, but the other fourteen variants are draws. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * *Sun/Oracle biographical page for Steele *Telnet Song *Poems (mostly parodies) from Guy Steele's student days *A podcast interview with Guy Steele on Software Engineering Radio *\\"Growing a Language\\", Keynote at the 1998 ACM OOPSLA Conference (text) *Guy Steele: Dan Friedman--Cool Ideas (Dan Friedman's 60th Birthday) Category:1954 births Category:American computer scientists Category:American technology writers Category:Lisp (programming language) people Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty Category:Emacs Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Grace Murray Hopper Award laureates Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Programming language designers Category:Programming language researchers Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences alumni ","title":"Guy L.

Special methods are normally required for the laboratory synthesis of small-ring lactones as well as those that contain rings larger than six-membered. ==Nomenclature== Lactone nomenclature: Œ±-acetolactone, Œ≤-propiolactone, Œ≥-butyrolactone, and Œ¥-valerolactone Lactones are usually named according to the precursor acid molecule (aceto = 2 carbon atoms, propio = 3, butyro = 4, valero = 5, capro = 6, etc.), with a -lactone suffix and a Greek letter prefix that specifies the number of carbon atoms in the heterocycle ‚Äî that is, the distance between the relevant -OH and the -COOH groups along said backbone. The first carbon atom after the carbon in the -COOH group on the parent compound is labelled Œ±, the second will be labeled Œ≤, and so forth. Therefore, the prefixes also indicate the size of the lactone ring: Œ±-lactone = 3-membered ring, Œ≤-lactone = 4-membered, Œ≥-lactone = 5-membered, etc. Macrocyclic lactones are known as macrolactones. The other suffix used to denote a lactone is -olide, used in substance class names like butenolide, macrolide, cardenolide or bufadienolide. To obtain the preferred IUPAC names, lactones are named as heterocyclic pseudoketones by adding the suffix ‚Äòone‚Äô, ‚Äòdione‚Äô, ‚Äòthione‚Äô, etc. and the appropriate multiplicative prefixes to the name of the heterocyclic parent hydride. ==Etymology== The name \\"lactone\\" was coined in 1844 by the French chemist Th√©ophile-Jules Pelouze, who first obtained it as a derivative of lactic acid. From p. 1223: \\"Ind√©pendamment de la lactide dont je viens de rappeler l'existence dans les produits de la distllation de l'acide lactique, celui-ci donne encore, par sa d√©composition, une autre substance, que je propose d'appeler lactone, parce qu'elle me para√Æt √™tre √† l'acide lactique ce que l'ac√©tone est √† l'acide ac√©tique.\\" (Independently of the lactide of which I have just recalled the existence in the products of the distillation of lactic acid, this [i.e., lactic acid] gives further, by its decomposition, another substance, which I propose to call lactone, because it seems to me to be to lactic acid what acetone is to acetic acid.) * Reprinted: ; see p. 262. * English translation: ; see p. 31. * The name lactone derives from the ring compound called lactide, which is formed from the dehydration of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Lactic acid, in turn, derives its name from its original isolation from soured milk (Latin: lac, lactis). An internal dehydration within the same molecule of lactic acid would have produced alpha-propiolactone, a lactone with a 3-membered ring. In 1880 the German chemist Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig extended the name \\"lactone\\" to all intramolecular carboxylic esters. From p. 62: \\"Es ist w√ºnschenswerth, f√ºr diese Gruppe von Verbindungen, deren bis jetzt einfachster Repr√§sentant der im Vorstehenden beschriebene K√∂rper ist, eine allgemeine Bezeichnungsweise zu haben, und da der Name \\"Lactide\\" nicht anwendbar ist, weil dann das Lactid Œ∫Œ±œÑ ŒµŒæŒøœáŒ∑ŒΩ kein Lactid sein wurde, so schlagen wir als Gruppenbezeichnung den Namen \\"Lactone\\" vor.\\" (It's desirable for this group of compounds ‚Äî whose simplest representative until now has been the substance that's described in the preceding ‚Äî to have a general designation, and since the name \\"lactide\\" isn't applicable because then the archetypal lactide would not be a lactide, we therefore suggest the name \\"lactone\\" as the designation of this group [of compounds].) == Natural sources == Naturally occurring lactones are mainly saturated and unsaturated Œ≥- and Œ¥-lactones, and to a lesser extent macrocyclic lactones. The Œ≥- and Œ¥-lactones are intramolecular esters of the corresponding hydroxy fatty acids. They contribute to the aroma of fruits, butter, cheese, and other foods. Cyclopentadecanolide is responsible for the musklike odor of angelica root oil. Of the naturally occurring bicyclic lactones, phthalides are responsible for the odors of celery and lovage oils, and coumarin for woodruff. Lactones are present in oak wood, and they contribute to the flavour profile of Barrel-aged beers.Craft Beer and Brewing. Barrel-aging. Lactone rings occur widely as building blocks in nature, such as in ascorbic acid, kavain, nepetalactone, gluconolactone, hormones (spironolactone, mevalonolactone), enzymes (lactonase), neurotransmitters (butyrolactone, avermectins), antibiotics (macrolides like erythromycin; amphotericin B), anticancer drugs (vernolepin, epothilones), phytoestrogens (resorcylic acid lactones, cardiac glycosides). ==Synthesis== Oxandrolone synthesis Many methods in ester synthesis can also be applied to that of lactones. In one industrial synthesis of oxandrolone the key lactone-forming step is an organic reaction - esterification.Development of a Commercial Process to Produce Oxandrolone John E. Cabaj, David Kairys, and Thomas R. Benson Org. Process Res. Dev.; 2007; 11(3) pp 378 - 388; (Article) The complete reaction sequence is bromination to a haloketone (not displayed), elimination reaction with lithium chloride to an enone, organic oxidation by osmium tetroxide and lead tetraacetate with ring-opening and finally reduction of the aldehyde to the alcohol with sodium borohydride and intramolecular lactone formation iodolactonization In halolactonization, an alkene is attacked by a halogen via electrophilic addition with the cationic intermediate captured intramolecularly by an adjacent carboxylic acid (See also iodolactamization).Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 7, p.164 (1990); Vol. 64, p.175 (1986) Article link Specific methods include Yamaguchi esterification, Shiina macrolactonization, Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation and nucleophilic abstraction. Œ≥-Lactone synthesis from fatty alcohols and acrylic acid The Œ≥-lactones Œ≥-octalactone, Œ≥-nonalactone, Œ≥-decalactone, Œ≥-undecalactone can be prepared in good yield in a one-step process by radical addition of primary fatty alcohols to acrylic acid, using di-tert-butyl peroxide as a catalyst. ==Reactions== The most stable structure for lactones are the 5-membered Œ≥-lactones and 6-membered Œ¥-lactones because, as in all organic cycles, 5 and 6 membered rings minimize the strain of bond angles. Œ≥-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids (R-CH(OH)-(CH2)2-COOH) immediately undergo spontaneous esterification and cyclisation to the lactone. Œ≤-lactones do exist, but can only be made by special methods. Œ±-lactones can be detected as transient species in mass spectrometry experiments.Detlef Schr√∂der, Norman Goldberg, Waltraud Zummack, Helmut Schwarz, John C. Poutsma and Robert R. Squires (1997), Generation of Œ±-acetolactone and the acetoxyl diradical ‚Ä¢CH2COO‚Ä¢ in the gas phase. International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes, Volumes 165-166, November issue, Pages 71-82. The reactions of lactones are similar to those of esters, as exemplified by gamma-lactone in the following sections: ===Hydrolysis=== Heating a lactone with a base (sodium hydroxide) will hydrolyse the lactone to its parent compound, the straight chained bifunctional compound. Like straight-chained esters, the hydrolysis- condensation reaction of lactones is a reversible reaction, with an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis reaction of the lactone is lower than that of the straight-chained ester i.e. the products (hydroxyacids) are less favored in the case of the lactones. This is because although the enthalpies of the hydrolysis of esters and lactones are about the same, the entropy of the hydrolysis of lactones is less than the entropy of straight-chained esters. Straight-chained esters give two products upon hydrolysis, making the entropy change more favorable than in the case of lactones which gives only a single product. ===Reduction=== Lactones can be reduced to diols using lithium aluminium hydride in dry ether. The reduction reaction will first break the ester bond of the lactone, and then reduce the aldehyde group (-CHO) to the alcohol group (-OH). For instance, gamma-lactones will be reduced to butane-1,4-diol, (CH2(OH)-(CH2)2-CH2(OH). ===Aminolysis=== Lactones also react with ethanolic ammonia, which will first break the ester bond and then react with the acidic -COOH group, because of the basic properties of ammonia, to form a difunctional group, i.e. alcohol and amide. Gamma-lactones will react to yield CH2(OH)-(CH2)2-CO-NH2. === Polymerization === Lactones readily form polyesters according to the formula: 300px ===Michael reaction=== Sesquiterpene lactones, found in many plants, can react with other molecules via a Michael reaction. == Uses == === Flavors and fragrances === Lactones contribute significantly to the flavor of fruit, and of unfermented and fermented dairy products, and are therefore used as flavors and fragrances. Some examples are Œ≥-decalactone (4-decanolide), which has a characteristic peach flavor; Œ¥-decalactone (5-decanolide), which has a creamy coconut/peach flavour; Œ≥-dodecalactone (4-dodecanolide), which also has a coconut/fruity flavor, a description which also fits Œ≥-octalactone (4-octanolide), although it also has a herbaceous character; Œ≥-nonalactone, which has an intense coconut flavor of this series, despite not occurring in coconut, and Œ≥-undecalactone. Macrocyclic lactones (cyclopentadecanolide, 15-pentadec-11/12-enolide) have odors similar to macrocyclic ketones of animal origin (muscone, civetone), but they can be prepared more easily, for example, by depolymerization of the corresponding linear polyesters. Replacement of a methylene unit by oxygen barely affects the odor of these compounds, and oxalactones with 15 ‚Äì 17-membered rings are produced in addition to cyclopentadecanolide (e. g., 12-oxa-16-hexadecanolide). === Plastics === Polycaprolactone is an important plastic. == Examples == File:Propiolactone.pngŒ≤-propiolactone File:GBL_chemical_structure.pngŒ≥-butyrolactone (GBL) File:Glucono-delta- lactone-2D-skeletal.pngD-glucono-Œ¥-lactone (E575) File:Caprolactone.pngŒµ-caprolactone *Macrolides *Kavalactones === dilactones === *Ellagic acid (Hexahydroxydiphenic acid dilactone) *Flavogallonic acid dilactone can be found in Rhynchosia volubilis seeds and in Shorea laeviforia *Lactide *Tergallic acid dilactone can be found in Rhynchosia volubilis seeds *Valoneic acid dilactone can be isolated from the heartwood of Shorea laeviforia *Ethylene brassylate (Musk T), a widely used synthetic musk == See also == * Lactam, a cyclic amide * Lactim, a cyclic imide * Lactide, a cyclic diester * Halolactonization * Phthalein ==References & notes== Category:Functional groups ","title":"Lactone"},{"id":"299676","text":"Antonio Yapsutco Fortich (August 11, 1913 ‚Äì July 2, 2003) was a Catholic bishop and social activist who lived in Bacolod in Negros Occidental in the Philippines.

He attended elementary and high school in Dumaguete, going on to the Ateneo de Manila for college and theological studies (San Jose Minor and San Jose Major seminaries). His parents, Ignacio and Rosalia Yapsutco Fortich, were well-to- do farmers and he was the elder and only son in their family of two. ==Career== On March 4, 1944, at the height of the World War II, Fortich was ordained by Michael J. O'Doherty, Archbishop of Manila. His first assigned in Bacolod and was active in work that empowered the poor. Bishop Fortich was known to his followers as \\"Commander Tony\\". Like his superior, Jaime Sin, the Cardinal Archbishop of Manila, he was an ardent opponent of Ferdinand Marcos. Bishop Fortich spoke against the hanging judges of Manila known as the Guillotine Club. He was one of the first people to alert the government to the illegal activities of timber poachers, who had stripped hundreds of acres of forest in Negros. He supported the election of Joseph Estrada as president of the Philippines, and when it became clear that Estrada was using his position to accumulate personal wealth, the bishop withdrew his support. Bishop Fortich set up co-operatives composed of small landowners and sugar workers, in order to break the debt cycle suffered by Filipino sugar workers. In doing so, the bishop antagonised large landowners, including congressman Armando Gustilo, who at one stage tried to intimidate him by lobbing a hand grenade into his house. ==Death== Bishop Fortich died on July 2, 2003, aged 89. ==Awards== Honored as Domestic Prelate in 1958 Awarded by the University of Negros Occidental ‚Äì Recoletos the Honoris Causa: doctor of Philosophy for Humanitarian service in 1969 ==References== Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Roman Catholic bishops in the Philippines Category:Ateneo de Manila University alumni Category:People from Negros Oriental Category:Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos Category:Political repression in the Philippines Category:Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos Category:1913 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Bacolod Category:Place of death missing Category:Individuals honored at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Category:Religious workers honored at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani ","title":"Antonio Fortich"},{"id":"299681","text":"Moritz Hermann (Boris Semyonovich) von Jacobi () (21 September 1801 ‚Äì 10 March 1874) was a German and Russian engineer and physicist. Jacobi worked mainly in Russia. He furthered progress in galvanoplastics, electric motors, and wire telegraphy. ==Motors== Born into an Ashkenazi Jewish family, Jacobi began to study magnetic motors in 1834. In 1835 moved to Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) to lecture at Dorpat University. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1837 to research usage of electromagnetic forces for moving machines for Russian Academy of Sciences. He investigated the power of an electromagnet in motors and generators. While studying the transfer of power from a battery to an electric motor, he deduced the maximum power theorem. Jacobi tested motors output by determining the amount of zinc consumed by the battery. With financial assistance of Czar Nicholas, Jacobi constructed in 1839 a 28-foot electric motor boat powered by battery cells. The boat carried 14 passengers on the Neva river against the current. The boat travelled at three miles per hour. ==Jacobi's law== Circuit Diagram Circuit Diagram Power is being transferred from the source, with voltage V and resistance RS, to a load with resistance RL, resulting in a current I. I is simply the source voltage divided by the total circuit resistance The law known as the maximum power theorem states: : \\"Maximum power is transferred when the internal resistance of the source equals the resistance of the load, when the external resistance can be varied, and the internal resistance is constant.\\" The transfer of maximum power from a source with a fixed internal resistance to a load, the resistance of the load must be the same as that of the source. This law is of use when driving a load such as an electric motor from a battery. ==Electrotyping and telegraphy== In 1838, he discovered galvanoplastics, or electrotyping, a method of making printing plates by electroplating. The way in which this works is analogous to a battery acting in reverse. The stereotype was an impression taken from a form of movable lead type and used for printing instead of the original type. This technique is used in relief printing. He also worked on the development of the electric telegraph. In 1842-1845 he built a telegraph line between Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo using an underground cable. In 1867 he was a Russian delegate to the Commission on measurement units at the Paris World's Fair. He was a strong proponent of the metric system. ==Naval mine== In 1853, Jacobi developed the Jacobi naval mine. The mine was tied to the sea bottom by an anchor, a cable connected it to a galvanic cell which powered it from the shore, the power of its explosive charge was equal to of black powder. Its production was approved by the Committee for Mines of the Ministry of War of the Russian Empire and in 1854 60 Jacobi mines were laid in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and Alexander (Kronstadt). ==Family== His family was Jewish.Pieper, H.

The group had members of both sexes, unlike most pop groups at the time. Aguirre's son, daughter, and niece formed the band; later, 2 boys were added. Their first album, Villancicos, was released in late 1970. La Pandilla had initially a big impact in their home country of Spain. After a personnel change as some of the original members grew up, they experienced some backlash in the country for their song \\"El Alacr√°n\\" (\\"The Scorpion\\"), an innocent pop tune that made a coincidental reference to a clandestine group that was one of Francisco Franco's staunchest opponents. Franco's censors objected to the group, so they started touring Latin America more frequently. Their appeal to youth in some Latin American countries bordered in collective hysteria, a reaction that evoked that of Beatlemania in the mid-1960s. During the 1970s, it was common to see La Pandilla-related items such as notebooks, posters, magazines, notebook covers, rulers, and dolls at department stores all over the Spanish-speaking countries. La Pandilla was chiefly instrumental in the later success and development of one of history's most legendary boy bands: Menudo. In 1973, the future founder of Menudo, Edgardo Diaz, who was a medical student in Spain and lived next door to the Aguirreses, joined the band's entourage as a sound expert. Diaz turned out to be the bridge between La Pandilla and Puerto Rico, the country where La Pandilla's success was longest- lived. Thanks in part to him, Alfred D. Herger‚Äîwho became known as the biggest pandillero in Puerto Rico‚Äîand Felix Santiesteban, the group became a teen favorite in the Caribbean island. Diaz became manager in 1974. In 1975, the band was received by a huge crowd of Puerto Rican fans at the Iberia Airlines terminal at Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport at San Juan. Similar receptions took place in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela and other countries. The definitive lineup of close-knit group La Pandilla literally grew up together, along with their fans. This eventually became a liability, as the youngest members' voices matured which made their original sound difficult to produce. Another liability, at least in Diaz's view, was that of having a female singer, Mari Blanca, for whom separate lodging, security, and chaperone arrangements were always necessary. This prompted D√≠az to leave the management of the group and set up yet another, this time in his native Puerto Rico, in which only young males under age 15 would be used, to be replaced as they aged. After Diaz left and formed Menudo, La Pandilla's popularity slowly declined. ==Discography== *1970 Villancicos [Original Members: Santi and Nieves Martinez, Blanca Ruiz, and Carlos and Javier Martinez] *1970 Capitan de Madera (Single)[Original Members] *1970 La Pandilla va al Teatro [Original Members] *1970 A-Chi-Li-Pu [Original Members] *1971 ¬°Oh Mam√°!

It appeared in 1999, in the context of the boom of DSL as the solution for tunneling packets over the DSL connection to the ISP's IP network, and from there to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book noted that \\"Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and compression.\\" Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP. On the customer-premises equipment, PPPoE may be implemented either in a unified residential gateway device that handles both DSL modem and IP routing functions or in the case of a simple DSL modem (without routing support), PPPoE may be handled behind it on a separate Ethernet-only router or even directly on a user's computer. (Support for PPPoE is present in most operating systems, ranging from Windows XP,http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283070 Linux to Mac OS X.) More recently, some GPON-based (instead of DSL-based) residential gateways also use PPPoE, although the status of PPPoE in the GPON standards is marginal. PPPoE was developed by UUNET, Redback Networks (now Ericsson) and RouterWare (now Wind River Systems) Wind River Systems Acquires RouterWare, Inc.. Findarticles.com (1999-07-05). Retrieved on 2011-09-27. and is available as an informational RFC 2516. In the world of DSL, PPPoE was commonly understood to be running on top of ATM (or DSL) as the underlying transport, although no such limitation exists in the PPPoE protocol itself. Other usage scenarios are sometimes distinguished by tacking as a suffix another underlying transport. For example, PPPoEoE, when the transport is Ethernet itself, as in the case of Metro Ethernet networks. (In this notation, the original use of PPPoE would be labeled PPPoEoA, although it should not be confused with PPPoA, which is a different encapsulation protocol.) PPPoE has been described in some books as a \\"layer 2.5\\" protocol, in some rudimentary sense similar to MPLS because it can be used to distinguish different IP flows sharing an Ethernet infrastructure, although the lack of PPPoE switches making routing decision based on PPPoE headers limits applicability in that respect. ==Original rationale== In late 1998, the DSL service model had yet to reach the large scale that would bring prices down to household levels. ADSL technology had been proposed a decade earlier. Potential equipment vendors and carriers alike recognized that broadband such as cable modem or DSL would eventually replace dialup service, but the hardware (both customer premises and LEC) faced a significant low- quantity cost barrier. Initial estimates for low-quantity deployment of DSL showed costs in the $300‚Äì$500 range for a DSL modem and $300/month access fee from the telco, which was well beyond what a home user would pay. Thus the initial focus was on small and home business customers for whom a ~1.5 megabit T1 line (at the time $800‚Äì$1500 per month) was not economical, but who needed more than dialup or ISDN could deliver. If enough of these customers paved the way, quantities would drive the prices down to where the home-use dialup user might be interested: more like $50 for the modem and $50/month for the access. ===Different usage profile=== The problem was that small business customers had a different usage profile than a home-use dialup user, including: * Connecting an entire LAN to the Internet; * Providing services on a local LAN accessible from the far side of the connection; * Simultaneous access to multiple external data sources, such as a company VPN and a general purpose ISP; * Continuous usage throughout the workday, or even around the clock. These requirements didn't lend themselves to the connection establishment lag of a dial-up process nor its one-computer-to-one-ISP model, nor even the many- to-one that NAT plus dial-up provided. A new model was required. PPPoE is used mainly either: * with PPPoE-speaking Internet DSL services where a PPPoE- speaking modem-router (residential gateway) connects to the DSL service. Here both ISP and modem-router need to speak PPPoE. (Note that in this case, the PPPoE-over-DSL side of things is occasionally referred to as PPPoEoA, for ‚ÄòPPPoE over ATM‚Äô.) * or when a PPPoE-speaking DSL modem is connected to a PPPoE-speaking Ethernet-only router using an Ethernet cable. ===Time to market: simpler is better=== One problem with creating a completely new protocol to fill these needs was time. The equipment was available immediately, as was the service, and a whole new protocol stack (Microsoft at the time was advocating fiber-based atm-cells-to-the-desktop, and L2TP was brewing as well, but was not near completion) would take so long to implement that the window of opportunity might slip by. Several decisions were made to simplify implementation and standardization in an effort to deliver a complete solution quickly. ====Reuse existing software stacks==== PPPoE hoped to merge the widespread Ethernet infrastructure with the ubiquitous PPP, allowing vendors to reuse their existing software and deliver products in the very near term. Essentially all operating systems at the time had a PPP stack, and the design of PPPoE allowed for a simple shim at the line-encoding stage to convert from PPP to PPPoE. ====Simplify hardware requirements==== Competing WAN technologies (T1, ISDN) required a router on the customer premises. PPPoE used a different Ethernet frame type, which allowed the DSL hardware to function as simply a bridge, passing some frames to the WAN and ignoring the others. Implementation of such a bridge is multiple orders of magnitude simpler than a router. ====Informational RFC==== RFC 2516 was initially released as an informational (rather than standards-track) RFC for the same reason: the adoption period for a standards-track RFC was prohibitively long. ===Success=== PPPoE was initially designed to provide a small LAN with individual independent connections to the Internet at large, but also such that the protocol itself would be lightweight enough that it wouldn't impinge on the hoped-for home usage market when it finally arrived. While success on the second matter may be debated (some complain that 8 bytes per packet is too much) PPPoE clearly succeeded in bringing sufficient volume to drive the price for service down to what a home user would pay. ==Stages== The PPPoE has two distinct stages: ===PPPoE discovery=== Since traditional PPP connections are established between two end points over a serial link or over an ATM virtual circuit that has already been established during dial-up, all PPP frames sent on the wire are sure to reach the other end. But Ethernet networks are multi- access where each node in the network can access every other node. An Ethernet frame contains the hardware address of the destination node (MAC address). This helps the frame reach the intended destination. Hence before exchanging PPP control packets to establish the connection over Ethernet, the MAC addresses of the two end points should be known to each other so that they can be encoded in these control packets. The PPPoE Discovery stage does exactly this. It also helps establish a Session ID that can be used for further exchange of packets. ===PPP session=== Once the MAC address of the peer is known and a session has been established, the session stage will start. ==PPPoE discovery (PPPoED) == Although traditional PPP is a peer-to-peer protocol, PPPoE is inherently a client-server relationship since multiple hosts can connect to a service provider over a single physical connection. The discovery process consists of four steps between the host computer which acts as the client and the access concentrator at the Internet service provider's end acts as the server. They are outlined below. The fifth and last step is the way to close an existing session. ===Client to server: Initiation (PADI)=== PADI stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation. If a user wants to \\"dial up\\" to the Internet using DSL, then their computer first must find the DSL access concentrator (DSL-AC) at the user's Internet service provider's point of presence (POP). Communication over Ethernet is only possible via MAC addresses. As the computer does not know the MAC address of the DSL-AC, it sends out a PADI packet via an Ethernet broadcast (MAC: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). This PADI packet contains the MAC address of the computer sending it. Example of a PADI-packet: Frame 1 (44 bytes on wire, 44 bytes captured) Ethernet II, Src: 00:50:da:42:d7:df, Dst: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff PPP-over-Ethernet Discovery Version: 1 Type 1 Code Active Discovery Initiation (PADI) Session ID: 0000 Payload Length: 24 PPPoE Tags Tag: Service-Name Tag: Host-Uniq Binary Data: (16 bytes) Src. (=source) holds the MAC address of the computer sending the PADI. Dst. (=destination) is the Ethernet broadcast address. The PADI packet can be received by more than one DSL-AC. Only DSL-AC equipment that can serve the \\"Service-Name\\" tag should reply. ===Server to client: Offer (PADO)=== PADO stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Offer. Once the user's computer has sent the PADI packet, the DSL-AC replies with a PADO packet, using the MAC address supplied in the PADI. The PADO packet contains the MAC address of the DSL-AC, its name (e.g. LEIX11-erx for the T-Com DSL-AC in Leipzig) and the name of the service. If more than one POP's DSL-AC replies with a PADO packet, the user's computer selects the DSL-AC for a particular POP using the supplied name or service. Here is an example of a PADO packet: Frame 2 (60 bytes on wire, 60 bytes captured) Ethernet II, Src: 00:0e:40:7b:f3:8a, Dst: 00:50:da:42:d7:df PPP-over-Ethernet Discovery Version: 1 Type 1 Code Active Discovery Offer (PADO) Session ID: 0000 Payload Length: 36 PPPoE Tags Tag: AC-Name String Data: IpzbrOOl Tag: Host-Uniq Binary Data: (16 bytes) AC-Name -> String data holds the AC name, in this case ‚ÄúIpzbr001‚Äù (the Arcor DSL-AC in Leipzig) Src. holds the MAC address of the DSL-AC. The MAC address of the DSL-AC also reveals the manufacturer of the DSL-AC (in this case Nortel Networks). ===Client to server: request (PADR)=== PADR stands for PPPoE active discovery request. A PADR packet is sent by the user's computer to the DSL-AC following receipt of an acceptable PADO packet from the DSL-AC. It confirms acceptance of the offer of a PPPoE connection made by the DSL-AC issuing the PADO packet. ===Server to client: session-confirmation (PADS)=== PADS stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation. The PADR packet above is confirmed by the DSL-AC with a PADS packet, and a Session ID is given out with it. The connection with the DSL-AC for that POP has now been fully established. ===Either end to other end: termination (PADT)=== PADT stands for PPPoE Active Discovery Termination. This packet terminates the connection to the POP. It may be sent either from the user's computer or from the DSL-AC. ==Protocol overhead== PPPoE is used to connect a PC or a router to a modem via an Ethernet link and it can also be used in Internet access over DSL on a telephone line in the PPPoE over ATM (PPPoEoA) over ADSL protocol stack. PPPoE over ATM has the highest overhead of the popular DSL delivery methods, when compared with for example PPPoA (RFC 2364).Dirk Van Aken, Sascha Peckelbeen Encapsulation Overhead(s) in ADSL Access Networks, June 2003 ===Use with DSL ‚Äì PPPoE over ATM (PPPoEoA)=== The amount of overhead added by PPPoEoA on a DSL link depends on the packet size because of (i) the absorbing effect of ATM cell-padding (discussed below), which completely cancels out additional overhead of PPPoEoA in some cases, (ii) PPPoEoA + AAL5 overhead which can cause an entire additional 53-byte ATM cell to be required, and (iii) in the case of IP packets, PPPoE overhead added to packets that are near maximum length (‚ÄòMRU‚Äô) may cause IP fragmentation, which also involves the first two considerations for both of the resulting IP fragments.Encapsulation Overhead(s) in ADSL Access Networks. However ignoring ATM and IP fragmentation for the moment, the protocol header overheads for ATM payload due to choosing PPP + PPPoEoA can be as high as 44 bytes = 2 bytes (for PPP) + 6 (for PPPoE) + 18 (Ethernet MAC, variable) + 10 (RFC 2684 LLC, variable) + 8 (AAL5 CPCS). This overhead is that obtained when using the LLC header option described in RFC 2684 for PPPoEoA. Compare this with a vastly more header-efficient protocol, PPP + PPPoA RFC 2364 VC-MUX over ATM+DSL, which has a mere 10-byte overhead within the ATM payload. (In fact, just simply 10 bytes = 2 bytes for PPP + zero for RFC 2364 + 8 (AAL5 CPCS).) This figure of 44 bytes AAL5 payload overhead can be reduced in two ways: (i) by choosing the RFC 2684 option of discarding the 4-byte Ethernet MAC FCS, which reduces the figure of 18 bytes above to 14, and (ii) by using the RFC 2684 VC-MUX option, whose overhead contribution is a mere 2 bytes compared with the 10 byte overhead of the LLC alternative. It turns out that this overhead reduction can be a valuable efficiency improvement. Using VC-MUX instead of LLC, the ATM payload overhead is either 32 bytes (without Ethernet FCS) or 36 bytes (with FCS). ATM AAL5 requires that an 8-byte-long ‚ÄòCPCS‚Äô trailer must always be present at the very end of the final cell (‚Äòright justified‚Äô) of the run of ATM cells that make up the AAL5 payload packet. In the LLC case, the total ATM payload overhead is 2 + 6 + 18 + 10 + 8 = 44 bytes if the Ethernet MAC FCS is present, or 2 + 6 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 40 bytes with no FCS. In the more efficient VC-MUX case the ATM payload overhead is 2 + 6 + 18 + 2 + 8 = 36 bytes (with FCS), or 2 + 6 + 14 + 2 + 8 = 32 bytes (no FCS). However, the true overhead in terms of the total amount of ATM payload data sent is not simply a fixed additional value ‚Äì it can only be either zero or 48 bytes (leaving aside scenario (iii) mentioned earlier, IP fragmentation). This is because ATM cells are fixed length with a payload capacity of 48 bytes, and adding a greater extra amount of AAL5 payload due to additional headers may require one more whole ATM cell to be sent containing the excess. The last one or two ATM cells contain padding bytes as required to ensure that each cell's payload is 48 bytes long. An example: In the case of a 1500-byte IP packet sent over AAL5/ATM with PPPoEoA and RFC2684-LLC, neglecting final cell padding for the moment, one starts with 1500 + 2 + 6 + 18 + 10 + 8 (AAL5 CPCS trailer) = 1544 bytes if the ethernet FCS is present, or else + 2 + 6 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 40 bytes with no FCS. To send 1544 bytes over ATM requires 33 48-byte ATM cells, since the available payload capacity of 32 cells √ó 48 bytes per cell = 1536 bytes is not quite enough. Compare this to the case of PPP + PPPoA which at 1500 + 2 (PPP) + 0 (PPPoA: RFC 2364 VC-MUX) + 8 (CPCS trailer) = 1510 bytes fits in 32 cells. So the real cost of choosing PPPoEoA plus RFC2684-LLC for 1500-byte IP packets is one additional ATM cell per IP packet, a ratio of 33:32. So for 1500 byte packets, PPPoEoA with LLC is ~3.125% slower than PPPoA or optimal choices of PPPoEoA header options. For some packet lengths the true additional effective DSL overhead due to choosing PPPoEoA compared with PPPoA will be zero if the extra header overhead is not enough to need an additional ATM cell at that particular packet length. For example, a 1492 byte long packet sent with PPP + PPPoEoA using RFC2684-LLC plus FCS gives us a total ATM payload of 1492 + 44 = 1536 bytes = 32 cells exactly, and the overhead in this special case is no greater than if we were using the header-efficient PPPoA protocol, which would require 1492 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 1502 bytes ATM payload = 32 cells also. The case where the packet length is 1492 represents the optimum efficiency for PPPoEoA with RFC2684-LLC in ratio terms, unless even longer packets are allowed. Using PPPoEoA with the RFC2684 VC-MUX header option is always much more efficient than the LLC option, since the ATM overhead, as mentioned earlier, is only 32 or 36 bytes (depending on whether this is without or with the ethernet FCS option in PPPoEoA) so that a 1500 byte long packet including all overheads of PPP + PPPoEoA using VC-MUX equates to a total 1500 + 36 = 1536 bytes ATM payload if the FCS is present = 32 ATM cells exactly, thus saving an entire ATM cell. With short packets, the longer the header overheads the greater the likelihood of generating an additional ATM cell. A worst case might be sending 3 ATM cells instead of two because of a 44 byte header overhead compared with a 10 byte header overhead, so 50% more time taken to transmit the data. For example, a TCP ACK packet over IPv6 is 60 bytes long, and with overhead of 40 or 44 bytes for PPPoEoA + LLC this requires three 48 byte ATM cells‚Äô payloads. As a comparison, PPPoA with overheads of 10 bytes so 70 bytes total fits into two cells. So the extra cost of choosing PPPoE/LLC over PPPoA is 50% extra data sent. PPPoEoA + VC-MUX would be fine though: with 32 or 36 byte overhead, our IP packet still fits in two cells. In all cases the most efficient option for ATM-based ADSL internet access is to choose PPPoA (RFC2364) VC-MUX. However, if PPPoEoA is required, then the best choice is always to use VC-MUX (as opposed to LLC) with no Ethernet FCS, giving an ATM payload overhead of 32 bytes = 2 bytes (for PPP) + 6 (for PPPoE) + 14 (Ethernet MAC, no FCS) + 2 (RFC 2684 VC-MUX) + 8 (AAL5 CPCS trailer). Unfortunately some DSL services require the use of wasteful LLC headers with PPPoE and do not allow the more efficient VC-MUX option. In that case, using a reduced packet length, such as enforcing a maximum MTU of 1492 regains efficiency with long packets even with LLC headers and, as mentioned earlier, in that case no extra wasteful ATM cell is generated. ===Overhead on Ethernet=== On an Ethernet LAN, the overhead for PPP + PPPoE is a fixed 2 + 6 = 8 bytes, unless IP fragmentation is produced. ==MTU/MRU== When a PPPoE-speaking DSL modem sends or receives Ethernet frames containing PPP + PPPoE payload across the Ethernet link to a router (or PPPoE- speaking single PC), PPP + PPPoE contributes an additional overhead of 8 bytes = 2 (PPP) + 6 (PPPoE) included within the payload of each Ethernet frame. This added overhead can mean that a reduced maximum length limit (so-called ‚ÄòMTU‚Äô or ‚ÄòMRU‚Äô) of 1500 ‚àí 8 = 1492 bytes is imposed on (for example) IP packets sent or received, as opposed to the usual 1500-byte Ethernet frame payload length limit which applies to standard Ethernet networks. Some devices support RFC 4638, which allows negotiation for the use of non-standard Ethernet frames with a 1508-byte Ethernet payload, sometimes called ‚Äòbaby jumbo frames‚Äô, so allowing a full 1500-byte PPPoE payload. This capability is advantageous for many users in cases where companies receiving IP packets have (incorrectly) chosen to block all ICMP responses from exiting their network, a bad practice which prevents path MTU discovery from working correctly and which can cause problems for users accessing such networks if they have an MTU of less than 1500 bytes. ==PPPoE-to-PPPoA converting modem== The following diagram shows a scenario where a modem acts as a PPPoE-to-PPPoA protocol converter and the service provider offers a PPPoA service and does not understand PPPoE. There is no PPPoEoA in this protocol chain. This is an optimally efficient design for a separate modem connected to a router by ethernet. In this alternative technology, PPPoE is merely a means of connecting DSL-modems to an Ethernet- only router (again, or to a single host PC). Here it is not concerned with the mechanism employed by an ISP to offer broadband services. The Draytek Vigor 110, 120 and 130 modems work in this way. When transmitting packets bound for the Internet, the PPPoE-speaking Ethernet router sends Ethernet frames to the (also PPPoE-speaking) DSL modem. The modem extracts PPP frames from within the received PPPoE frames, and sends the PPP frames onwards to the DSLAM by encapsulating them according to RFC 2364 (PPPoA), thus converting PPPoE into PPPoA. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" style=\\"float:center;padding-left:15px\\" + DSL Internet access architecture - style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text- align:center; background:#fc9;\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" Router  colspan=\\"2\\" DSL modem  colspan=\\"2\\" DSLAM  colspan=\\"2\\" Remote access server  (ISP) -  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" (IP)         style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" (IP) -  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" Ethernet  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" PPP      style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" PPP  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" PPP  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" PPP -   style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#99f;\\" PPPoE  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#99f;\\" PPPoE  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#99f;\\" PPPoA    style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text- align:center; background:#99f;\\" PPPoA  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text- align:center; background:#eef;\\" backbone  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" backbone -   style=\\"vertical- align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" Ethernet  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" Ethernet  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" AAL5  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" AAL5  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" backbone  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" backbone  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" IP  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" IP -     style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" ATM  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" ATM -     style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" DSL  style=\\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; background:#eef;\\" DSL } On the diagram, the area shown as ‚Äòbackbone‚Äô could also be ATM on older networks, however its architecture is service provider-dependent. On a more detailed, more service-provider specific diagram there would be additional columns in this area. ==Quirks== Since the point-to-point connection established has a MTU lower than that of standard Ethernet (typically 1492 vs Ethernet's 1500), it can sometimes cause problems when Path MTU Discovery is defeated by poorly configured firewalls. Although higher MTUs are becoming more common in providers' networks, usually the workaround is to use TCP MSS (Maximum Segment Size) \\"clamping\\" or \\"rewrite\\", whereby the access concentrator rewrites the MSS to ensure TCP peers send smaller datagrams. Although TCP MSS clamping solves the MTU issue for TCP, other protocols such as ICMP and UDP may still be affected. RFC 4638 allows PPPoE devices to negotiate an MTU of greater than 1492 if the underlying Ethernet layer is capable of jumbo frames. Some vendors (Ciscohttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/bbdsl/configuration/guide/bba_understanding.pdf and Juniper, for example) distinguish PPPoE[oA] from PPPoEoE (PPPoE over Ethernet), which is PPPoE running directly over Ethernet or other IEEE 802 networks or over Ethernet bridged over ATM, in order to distinguish it from PPPoEoA (PPPoE over ATM), which is PPPoE running over an ATM virtual circuit using RFC 2684 and SNAP encapsulation of PPPoE. (PPPoEoA is not the same as Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA), which doesn't use SNAP). According to a Cisco document \\"PPPoEoE is a variant of PPPoE where the Layer 2 transport protocol is now Ethernet or 802.1q VLAN instead of ATM. This encapsulation method is generally found in Metro Ethernet or Ethernet digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) environments. The common deployment model is that this encapsulation method is typically found in multi-tenant buildings or hotels. By delivering Ethernet to the subscriber, the available bandwidth is much more abundant and the ease of further service delivery is increased.\\" It is possible to find DSL modems, such as the Draytek Vigor 120, where PPPoE is confined to the Ethernet link between a DSL modem and a partnering router, and the ISP does not speak PPPoE at all (but rather PPPoA). == Post-DSL uses and some alternatives in these contexts == A certain method of using PPPoE in conjunction with GPON (which involves creating a VLAN via OMCI) has been patented by ZTE. PPPoE over GPON is reportedly used by retail service providers such as Internode of Australia's National Broadband Network, Romania's RCS & RDS (for their \\"Fiberlink\\" customers ‚Äî GPON is sold as Ethernet ports in MDUs)., Orange France and Philippines' Globe Telecom. RFC 6934, \\"Applicability of Access Node Control Mechanism to PON based Broadband Networks\\", which argues for the use of Access Node Control Protocol in PONs for‚Äîamong other things‚Äîauthenticating subscriber access and managing their IP addresses, and the first author of which is a Verizon employee, excludes PPPoE as an acceptable encapsulation for GPON: \\"The protocol encapsulation on BPON is based on multi-protocol encapsulation over ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5), defined in [RFC2684]. This covers PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE, defined in [RFC2516]) or IP over Ethernet (IPoE). The protocol encapsulation on GPON is always IPoE.\\" The 10G-PON (XG-PON) standard (G.987) provides for 802.1X mutual authentication of the ONU and OLT, besides the OMCI method carried forward from G.984. G.987 also adds support for authenticating other customer-premises equipment beyond the ONU (e.g. in a MDU), although this is limited to Ethernet ports, also handled via 802.1X. (The ONU is supposed snoop EAP-encapsulated RADIUS messages in this scenario and determine if the authentication was successful or not.) There is some modicum support for PPPoE specified in the OMCI standards, but only in terms of the ONU being able to filter and add VLAN tags for traffic based on its encapsulation (and other parameters), which includes PPPoE among the protocols that ONU must be able to discern. The Broadband Forum's TR-200 \\"Using EPON in the Context of TR-101\\" (2011), which also pertains to 10G-EPON, says \\"The OLT and the multiple-subscriber ONU MUST be able to perform the PPPoE Intermediate Agent function, as specified in Section 3.9.2/TR-101.\\"http://www.broadband- forum.org/technical/download/TR-200.pdf A book on Ethernet in the first mile notes that DHCP can obviously be used instead of PPPoE to configure a host for an IP session, although it points out that DHCP is not a complete replacement for PPPoE if some encapsulation is also desired (although VLAN bridges can fulfill this function) and that furthermore DHCP does not provide (subscriber) authentication, suggesting that IEEE 802.1X is also needed for a \\"complete solution\\" without PPPoE. (This book assumes that PPPoE is leveraged for other features of PPP besides encapsulation, including IPCP for host configuration, and PAP or CHAP for authentication.) There are security reasons to use PPPoE in a (non-DSL/ATM) shared-medium environment, such as power line communication networks, in order to create separate tunnels for each customer. ==See also== * Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM * Point-to-Point Protocol daemon * Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol * Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) * Point-to-Point Protocol over X (PPPoX) ==References== ==External links== * RFC 2516 - A Method for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE) * RFC 3817 - Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) Active Discovery Relay for PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) * RFC 4638 - Accommodating a Maximum Transit Unit/Maximum Receive Unit (MTU/MRU) Greater Than 1492 in the Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) * RFC 4938 - PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE) Extensions for Credit Flow and Link Metrics * US Patent 6891825 - Method and system of providing multi-user access to a packet switched network * TR-043 - Protocols at the U Interface for Accessing Data Networks using ATM/DSL, Issue 1.0, August 2001 Category:1999 in technology Category:Tunneling protocols Category:Logical link control ","title":"Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet"},{"id":"299689","text":"Paul Yaw Boateng, Baron Boateng (born 14 June 1951) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brent South from 1987 to 2005, becoming the UK's first Black Cabinet Minister in May 2002, when he was appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Following his departure from the House of Commons, he served as the British High Commissioner to South Africa from March 2005 to May 2009. He was introduced as a member of the House of Lords on 1 July 2010. ==Background and early life== Boateng was born in Hackney, London, of mixed Ghanaian and Scottish heritage; his family later moved to Ghana when Boateng was four years old.Ian Thomas, \\"Paul Yaw Boateng\\" , Black History Month 365, 19 August 2015. His father, Kwaku Boateng, was a lawyer and Cabinet Minister during Kwame Nkrumah's regime. Boateng attended Ghana International School and the Accra Academy, a high school in Ghana. Boateng's life in Ghana came to an abrupt end after his father went to jail in 1966 following a military coup, which toppled the Ghanaian government. His father was imprisoned without trial for four years. Boateng, then aged 15, and his sister, Rosemary, fled to the UK with their mother. They settled in Hemel Hempstead, where he attended Apsley Grammar School. He later read law at the University of Bristol and began his career in civil rights, originally as a solicitor, though he later retrained as a barrister. He worked primarily on social and community cases, starting under renowned civil rights advocate Benedict Birnberg, involving women's rights, housing and police complaints, including a period from 1977 to 1981 as the legal advisor for the Scrap Sus Campaign. Boateng was also an executive member of the National Council for Civil Liberties. He represented Cherry Groce, a mother of six who was shot and paralysed by a police officer during a raid on her home, in search for her son. He became a partner at the firm B. M. Birnberg & Co., and as a barrister, he practised at Eight King's Bench Walk. ==Political career== In 1981, Boateng was elected to represent Walthamstow on Greater London Council, of which Ken Livingstone became leader shortly after the election. As chair of the GLC's police committee and vice-chair of its ethnic minorities committee, he advocated greater accountability in the Metropolitan Police and spoke out against racism in relation to their dealings with the African Caribbean and Asian communities. ===Member of Parliament=== He unsuccessfully stood as a parliamentary candidate for Hertfordshire West (which included his former home town of Hemel Hempstead) at the 1983 general election. He was elected at the general election of 1987, when he became the MP for Brent South in succession to Laurence Pavitt, being one of the first four Black British MPs, elected alongside fellow Labour Party Black Sections members Bernie Grant, Diane Abbott and Keith Vaz. During his victory speech he said: \\"We can never be free in Brent until South Africa is free too.\\" He then declared, \\"Today Brent South, tomorrow Soweto!\\" Like many other members of Labour's left-wing in the 1980s, he became more moderate under the leadership of Neil Kinnock. For instance, he refused to join the Parliamentary Black Caucus founded by Diane Abbott, Bernie Grant, Keith Vaz and Lord David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead in 1988, which eventually collapsed. Kinnock rewarded Boateng by making him a junior Treasury spokesman in 1989, and then the first Black person to join the front bench as a party spokesperson. His portfolio included economics, industrial strategies and corporate responsibility. In 1992, he became shadow minister for the Lord Chancellor's Department, a post he held until the 1997 general election, where he was a strong advocate for increasing pro bono legal services among UK law firms. ===Ministerial career=== With Labour's landslide victory in 1997, Boateng became the UK's first black government minister as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health, where he was responsible for social services, mental health and disabled people. In that position, he published guidelines to end the denial of adoptions purely on the basis of race. In 1998, Boateng became a Minister of State at the Home Office and subsequently became Number 2 Minister there. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1999. He earned a reputation for being tough on crime, particularly with regard to aggressive begging on the streets. He also worked with Eric Holder, then United States Deputy Attorney-General, and Louis Freeh, then Director of the FBI, on issues related to international drug trafficking and interdiction. His portfolio was expanded in 2000, and he became the first Minister for Young People, where his priority was to listen to and be a voice for Britain's youth. He launched the Youth, Citizenship and Social Change programme, then the UK's largest research project designed to examine social exclusion and promoting citizenship among young people. He also played a leading role in establishing and launching the ¬£450,000,000 Children's Fund designed to tackle child poverty. Boateng's ministerial colleagues encouraged him to stand as the Labour candidate to be the Mayor of London; however, he ruled himself out and strongly criticised his former GLC colleague Ken Livingstone. Boateng supported the candidacy of Frank Dobson, with whom he had served in the Department of Health. ===Cabinet history=== In 2001, he was made Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted to the position of Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2002, becoming Britain's first black cabinet minister. He was quoted as saying \\"My colour is part of me but I do not choose to be defined by my colour.\\" His appointment was greeted with praise by civil rights activists who said that his appointment gave hope to young black youths, and would inspire them to become involved in politics. To commemorate this historic achievement, Parliament commissioned a painting of Boateng by Jonathan Yeo, which is displayed in the collection of 21st Century Parliamentarians. In his role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he was responsible for finalising the Spending Review of 2002 and leading the Spending Review of 2004. Boateng, coordinating with Sir Peter Gershon's report, announced in 2004 the government's efficiency programme to save over ¬£20,000,000,000 in the public sector. Boateng played a leading role in coordinating the Every Child Matters policy paper, which called for the reform of children's services, including greater accountability and coordination among government agencies. He was also a passionate advocate for increasing development aid to Africa and the developing nations. Foreshadowing his future role, he made numerous trips to Africa, meeting with business and government leaders in an effort to highlight the fact that international aid and the Millennium Development Goals were key priorities for the government. Boateng also assisted Gordon Brown in drafting the Africa Commission report, which called for increasing aid to Africa from Western nations to $50 billion a year. In March 2005, Boateng announced that he would not stand for re-election as an MP at the general election. Dawn Butler was selected by the Constituency Labour Party to replace him and was elected in Brent South. ===High Commissioner to South Africa=== Due to Boateng's passion and enthusiasm for the government's Africa Commission Report and his associations with African leaders Tony Blair named him to be the next High Commissioner to South Africa for a term of four years, making him the first black ambassador in British history.Boateng Moved to Africa Post Many Africans praised the appointment, stating that it was an important symbolic break from Britain's colonial past and saw it as a symbol of Tony Blair's commitment to the continent. Boateng is credited with building a close relationship with the African National Congress government in South Africa, and it was reported that he privately worked to bring together bitter rivals in the crisis in Zimbabwe, although he publicly condemned the Zimbabwean government's illegal occupation of land from white farmers and the resulting turmoil, which Boateng labelled a \\"human rights crisis.\\" He has also addressed the World Economic Forum on issues concerning Africa.http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20News%20Releases/PRESSRELEASES124 In 2008, he participated in a number of talks with political leaders in the United States to encourage them to support the Doha Development Round trade negotiations that would open Western markets to goods from Africa and other developing countries. ===Appointment to the House of Lords=== On 28 May 2010, it was announced in the 2010 Dissolution Honours that Boateng would become a member of the House of Lords. On 27 June 2010 he was created Baron Boateng, of Akyem in the Republic of Ghana and of Wembley in the London Borough of Brent and was introduced to the Lords on 1 July 2010; he was supported by Lord Ouseley and Lord Janner. His maiden speech to the House of Lords highlighted the needs of poor and disadvantaged children, both in rural and urban areas. He called on the Government to examine the impact that the Budget and forthcoming Spending Review would have on children at risk. In December 2011, he initiated a debate in the House of Lords to discuss cuts in funding to the Citizens Advice Bureau centres, which Lord Boateng vehemently opposed. He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel. ==Roles outside politics== Boateng is an active Methodist and is a lay preacher; he served as a Methodist delegate to the World Council of Churches and as Vice-Moderator of its program to combat racism.

In 2003, Khodorkovsky was believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia, with a fortune estimated to be worth $15 billion, and was ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires.List of Billionaires Swells From 17 to 25 He had worked his way up the Komsomol apparatus, during the Soviet years, and started several businesses during the period of glasnost and perestroika in the late 1980s. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the mid-1990s, he accumulated considerable wealth by obtaining control of a number of Siberian oil fields unified under the name Yukos, one of the major companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets during the 1990s (a scheme known as \\"Loans for Shares\\"). In October 2003, he was arrested by Russian authorities and charged with fraud. The government under Russian president Vladimir Putin then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. Putin's government took further actions against Yukos, leading to a collapse of the company's share price and the evaporation of much of Khodorkovsky's wealth. In May 2005, he was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison. In December 2010, while he was still serving his sentence, Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged with and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering; Khodorkovsky's prison sentence was extended to 2014. After Hans-Dietrich Genscher lobbied for his release, President Vladimir Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky, releasing him from jail on 20 December 2013.Erkl√§rung von Chodorkowski: \\"Mein besonderer Dank gilt Hans-Dietrich Genscher\\", Der Spiegel. There was widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated. The trial was criticized abroad for the lack of due process. Khodorkovsky lodged several applications with the European Court of Human Rights, seeking redress for alleged violations by Russia of his human rights. In response to his first application, which concerned events from 2003 to 2005, the court found that several violations were committed by the Russian authorities in their treatment of Khodorkovsky.European Court Rules That Khodorkovsky's Rights Were Violated, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 31 May 2011. Despite these findings, the court ultimately ruled that the trial was not politically motivated, but rather \\"that the charges against him were grounded in 'reasonable suspicion'\\". He was considered to be a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Upon being pardoned by Putin and released from prison at the end of 2013, Khodorkovsky immediately left Russia and was granted residency in Switzerland.

In 2014, Khodorkovsky re-launched Open Russia to promote several reforms to Russian civil society, including free and fair elections, political education, protection of journalists and activists, endorsing the rule of law, and ensuring media independence. He has been described by The Economist as \\"the Kremlin's leading critic-in-exile\\". ==Early years and entrepreneurship in Soviet Union== ===Early life and education=== Khodorkovsky's parents, Boris and Marina Khodorkovsky, were engineers at a factory making measuring instruments in Moscow. Khodorkovsky's father was Jewish, and his mother was Russian Orthodox Christian. They were both opponents of Communism, though they kept this from their son, who was born in 1963. Having experienced a rise in state anti-Semitism and the death of Stalin, the Khodorkovskys were part of a generation of well-educated Soviets who were silently supportive of dissidents. The family were moderately well off, living in a two-room flat in a concrete block in the suburbs of Moscow. Masha Gessen wrote that they faced a dilemma raising Mikhail: ‚ÄúSpeak your mind about the Soviet Union and risk making your child miserable, with the constant need for doublethink and doublespeak, or try to raise a contented conformist. They chose the second path, with results that far exceeded their expectations. Mikhail became a fervent Communist and Soviet patriot, a member of a species that had seemed all but extinct.\\"Gessen, Masha, \\"The Wrath of Putin\\", Vanity Fair, April 2012. Retrieved 2 March 2012. The young Khodorkovsky was ambitious and received excellent grades. He became deputy head of Komsomol (the Communist Youth League) at his university, the D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, from which he graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1986. While in college, Khodorkovsky married a fellow student, Yelena. They had a son, Pavel. In 1986, he met an 18-year-old, Inna, a student at the Mendeleev Institute who was a colleague of Khodorkovsky's at the Komsomol organization. He courted her and slept in his car until she took him in. They had a daughter and twin sons. He and his first wife remained on good terms, and she would later take an active part in the campaign for his release from prison. ===First business activities=== After his graduation in 1986, Khodorkovsky began to work full-time for the Komsomol, which was a typical way of entering upon a Soviet political career. \\"After several years of working mostly to collect Komsomol dues from fellow students\\", noted Gessen, \\"he could expect to be appointed to a junior position in city management someplace far from the capital.\\" But instead of following this path, he exploited \\"quasi-official and often extra-legal business opportunities\\" and began to make a business career for himself. With partners from Komsomol, and technically operating under its authority, Khodorkovsky opened his first business in 1986, a private caf√©. The enterprise was made possible by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's programme of perestroika and glasnost. The introduction of perestroika enabled Khodorkovsky to use his connections within the communist structures to gain a foothold in the developing free market. With the help of some powerful people, he started his business activities under the cover of Komsomol. Friendship with another Komsomol leader, Alexey Golubovich, had a significant impact on his growing success, since Golubovich's parents held top positions in Gosbank, the State Bank of the USSR. Among the businesses in which Khodorkovsky \\"tried his hand\\" were \\"importing personal computers and, according to some sources, counterfeit alcohol.\\" In addition, he \\"ventured into finance, devising ways to squeeze cash out of the Soviet planned-economy behemoth.\\" ===Menatep=== In 1987, Khodorkovsky and his partners opened a Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity of the Youth. In addition to importing and reselling computers, the \\"scientific\\" center was involved in trading a wide range of other products. The opening of the center eventually made possible the founding of Bank Menatep. He and his partners obtained a banking license, supposedly from money made from selling secondhand computers, to create Bank Menatep in 1989. As one of Russia's first privately owned banks, Menatep expanded quickly, by using most of the deposits raised to finance Khodorkovsky's import-export operations, which is a questionable practice in itself . Moreover, the government granted Bank Menatep the right to manage funds allocated for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Khodorkovsky said: > Many years later I talked with people and asked them, why didn't you start > doing the same thing? Why didn't you go into it? Because any head of an > institute had more possibilities than I had, by an order of magnitude. They > explained that they had all gone through the period when the same system was > allowed. And then, at best, people were unable to succeed in their career > and, at worst, found themselves in jail. They were all sure that would be > the case this time, and that is why they did not go into it. And I...I did > not remember this! I was too young! And I went for it.\\" His bank Menatep, along with other Russian banks, would hold on to government funds for months at a time in order to speculate on exchange rates and other investments, enriching the bank's owners at the expense of the designated recipients of the government funds. Investment tenders were followed by a disposal of Russian state assets to select business elites‚Äîthe loans-for- shares program, which introduced the term \\"oligarch\\" to describe the handful of beneficiaries. In the loans-for-shares auctions, the auctioneers were often the same as the bidders‚Äîthe auctions were rigged and the state knew it., clearly criminal practices by people that made the bulk of their money from denying or at best delaying the payment of financial aids to victims of a nuclear disaster. It was during this period that Khodorkovsky acquired the Yukos oil company for about $300 million through a rigged auction. Khodorkovsky subsequently went on a campaign to raise investment funds abroad, borrowing hundreds of millions. When the 1998 financial crisis struck Russia, Khodorkovsky defaulted on some of his foreign debt and took his Yukos shares offshore to protect them from creditors. ===Yeltsin adviser=== Khodorkovsky also served as an economic adviser to the first government of Boris Yeltsin. \\"During the failed 1991 coup by Communist hard-liners\\", Gessen wrote, \\"he was on the barricades in front of Moscow's White House, helping to defend the government.\\" Shortly thereafter, having lost his faith in Communism, he and his business associate Leonid Nevzlin wrote a \\"capitalist manifesto\\" entitled The Man with the Ruble, which stated in part: \\"It is time to stop living according to Lenin! ... Our guiding light is Profit, acquired in a strictly legal way. Our Lord is His Majesty, Money, for it is only He who can lead us to wealth as the norm in life.\\" ===Yukos acquisition=== In 1992, Khodorkovsky was appointed chairman of the Investment Promotion Fund of the fuel and power industry. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Fuel and Energy of Russia in March 1993. In 1996, Menatep acquired a major Russian oil producer, Yukos, which had debts exceeding $3.5 billion, for $309 million.Timeline: The rise and fall of Yukos BBC News 31 May 2005. In the 1990s, noted Gessen, \\"Khodorkovsky made millions in currency trading. He also bought up privatization vouchers‚Äîdocuments distributed to every Russian citizen and entitling them to a share of the national wealth‚Äîwhich many Russians were happy to unload at a discount for ready cash. Khodorkovsky eventually acquired controlling stakes in some 30 companies. When Russia staged its greatest property giveaway ever, in 1995, Khodorkovsky was poised to take advantage of that too.\\" As Gessen explained, the Russian government, after the fall of Communism, \\"still nominally controlled Russia's largest companies, though they had been variously re-structured, abandoned, or looted by their own executives.\\" A dozen men, the \\"new oligarchs\\", including Khodorkovsky, hit upon the stratagem of lending the government money against collateral consisting of blocks of stock that amounted to controlling interests in those companies. The oligarchs and government both knew that the government would eventually default and that the firms would thus pass into the oligarchs' hands. \\"By this maneuver\\", wrote Gessen, \\"the Yeltsin administration privatized oil, gas, minerals, and other enterprises without parliamentary approval.\\" This was how Khodorkovsky came to own Yukos. When he came into possession of Yukos, a conglomerate consisting of over 20 firms, most of them were \\"in terrible condition\\", and he enjoyed the job of turning them into well-functioning units. According to Gellin, Khodorkovsky was \\"the most reticent among the oligarchs\\", choosing not to \\"buy yachts or villas on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur\\" or to become a fixture of \\"the Moscow playboy scene\\". To be sure, he did buy \\"a gated compound of seven houses on 50 forested acres about half an hour outside Moscow\\" in the late 1990s, calling it Apple Orchard and housing Yukos's leading executives, who lived together as \\"one large happy family\\". His social life consisted mostly of \\"Barbecuing for fellow Yukos managers\\". At nights he would stay up and \\"read until two\\". He later wrote that during this period \\"I saw business as a game. ... It was a game in which you wanted to win but losing was also an option. It was a game in which hundreds of thousands of people came to work in the morning to play with me.\\" Nevzlin told Gessen about a time when Khodorkovsky was in Poland on business and the Soviet economic-crimes unit began harassing Nevzlin, who feared arrest under Soviet-era laws. He found the situation \\"terrifying\\", but when Khodorkovsky returned from Poland he said, \\"Let me go home, take a shower, get some sleep, and we'll talk about it tomorrow morning.\\" Nevzlin told Gessen: \\"There was just no way to shake him, ever.\\" Nevzlin described Khodorkovsky as a \\"data addict\\", a man with \\"an iron will,\\" and \\"someone dependent on human stimulus for information and ideas.\\" Although Khodorkovsky \\"has strong emotions,\\" Nevzlin said, he is capable of turning them off. ===Bank failure and philanthropic activities=== By 1998, Khodorkovsky had built an import- export business with an annual turnover of 80 million rubles (about $10 million USD). In the 1998 Russian crash, however, his bank went under and Yukos had serious problems owing to a drop in the price of oil. Realizing that \\"business could no longer be just a game\\" and that \\"capitalism could make people not only rich and happy but also poor and powerless\\", he \\"swore off his absolute faith in wealth just as he had sworn off his absolute faith in Communism.\\" After the price of oil began to rise again, he established a foundation, Open Russia, in 2001. It was based at Somerset House in London with Henry Kissinger as its trustee. The Foundation's mission statement declared: \\"The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation is the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between the people of Russia and the rest of the world.\\" The following year it had its United States launch in Washington, D.C.\\"A vision for Russia\\", www.khodorkovsky.com. Retrieved 13 January 2014. In addition to founding Open Russia, Khodorkovsky \\"funded Internet caf√©s in the provinces, to get people to talk to one another. He funded training sessions for journalists all over the country. [In 1994] He established a boarding school for disadvantaged children and pulled his own parents out of retirement to run it. By some estimates, he was supporting half of all non-governmental organizations in Russia; by others, he was funding 80 percent of them. In 2003, Yukos pledged $100 million over 10 years to the Russian State Humanities University, the best liberal- arts school in the country‚Äîthe first time a private company had contributed a significant amount of money to a Russian educational institution.\\" He also founded internet-training centres for teachers, a forum for the discussion by journalists of reform and democracy, and foundations which finance archaeological digs, cultural exchanges, summer camps for children and a boarding school for orphans. ==Merger with Sibneft== In April 2003, Khodorkovsky announced that Yukos would merge with Sibneft, creating an oil company with reserves equal to those of Western petroleum multinationals. Khodorkovsky had been reported to be involved in negotiations with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco to sell one or the other of them a large stake in Yukos. Sibneft was created in 1995, at the suggestion of Boris Berezovsky, comprising some of the most valuable assets of a state-owned oil company. In a controversial auction process, Berezovsky acquired 50% of the company at what most agree was a very low price. When Berezovsky had a confrontation with Putin, and felt compelled to leave Russia for London (where he was granted asylum), he assigned his shares in Sibneft to Roman Abramovich. Abramovich subsequently agreed to the merger. With 19.5 billion barrels (3 km¬≥) of oil and gas, the merged entity would have owned the second-largest oil and gas reserves in the world after ExxonMobil and would have been the fourth largest in the world in terms of production, pumping 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m¬≥) of crude a day. The combination of the companies closed in October 2003, just prior to the arrest of Khodorkovsky, but through a series of questionable legal maneuvers, the former Sibneft shareholders were able to get the transaction negated. ===Richest man in Russia=== Khodorkovsky also hired McKinsey & Company to reform Yukos's management structure, and Pricewaterhouse to establish an accounting system. Thanks partly to the rising oil prices, partly to modernized operations, and partly to its \\"new transparency\\", Yukos thrived. \\"By 2003, Khodorkovsky was the richest man in Russia, and potentially on his way to becoming the richest man in the world. In 2004, Forbes placed him 16th on its list of the world's wealthiest people, with a fortune estimated at $16 billion.\\" ==Politics== Khodorkovsky is openly critical of what he refers to as \\"managed democracy\\" within Russia. Careful normally not to criticise the current leadership, he says the military and security services exercise too much authority. He told The Times: > \\"It is the Singapore model, it is a term that people understand in Russia > these days. It means that theoretically you have a free press, but in > practice there is self-censorship. Theoretically you have courts; in > practice the courts adopt decisions dictated from above. Theoretically there > are civil rights enshrined in the constitution; in practice you are not able > to exercise some of these rights.\\" Khodorkovsky promoted social programs through Yukos in regions where the company operated, one example being \\"New Civilization\\", in Angarsk, which promoted student government to young adults. The scout program incorporated aspects of student government. Participants from throughout the country spent their holidays organizing student-governed bodies at summer camps. Masha Gessen, writing in 2012, recalled meeting Khodorkovsky in 2002, \\"when he met with a group of young authors to try out what would become his stump speech as he traveled the country, urging the creation of a new kind of economy in Russia, one based on intellectual rather than mineral resources.\\" ==Relationship with Vladimir Putin== President Putin with Khodorkovsky (right), Sergei Pugachev (behind center) and Mikhail Fridman (centre), May 2001 \\"At the root of the conflict between Putin and Khodorkovsky\\", stated writer and activist Masha Gessen in April 2012, \\"lies a basic difference in character. Putin rarely says what he means and even less frequently trusts that others are saying what they mean. Khodorkovsky, in contrast, seems to have always taken himself and others at face value‚Äîhe has constructed his identity in accordance with his convictions and his life in accordance with his identity. That is what landed him in prison and what has kept him there.\\" In February 2003, at a televised meeting at the Kremlin, Khodorkovsky argued with Putin about corruption. He implied that major government officials were accepting millions in bribes. In early 2012, prior to the Russian presidential election, Khodorkovsky and Putin were said to have both underestimated each other. After being convicted for tax evasion, money-laundering, and embezzlement, Khodorkovsky maintained his innocence and said that his conviction was \\"retribution for financing political parties that opposed Putin\\". On 20 December 2013, Putin signed a pardon freeing Khodorkovsky. Following his release, Khodorkovsky addressed the media at a news conference in Berlin, Germany. He referred to himself as a \\"political prisoner\\", and stated he would not re-enter business or politics. Khodorkovsky stated in a December 2014 interview that he was not violating his promise to Putin to avoid politics, but was only engaged in \\"civil society work... politics is in essence a battle to get yourself elected, personally. I'm not interested in this. But to the question, are you ready to go through to the very end: yes, I am. I see this as my civic duty.\\" He said he was \\"offering myself as a crisis manager. Because that's what I am.\\" ==Criminal charges and incarceration== ===2003 arrest=== In early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994. The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft. On the morning of 25 October 2003, Khodorkovsky was arrested at Novosibirsk airport. He was taken to Moscow and charged with fraud, tax evasion, and other economic crimes. Gessen describes the trial as a \\"travesty\\" and \\"a Kafka-esque procedure\\", with the government spending months \\"on an incoherent account of alleged violations that were criminalized after they were committed, or that were in fact legal activities.\\" In preparing the case, the government called in Yukos employees for questioning. Pavel Ivlev, a tax lawyer who went along as their attorney, later explained that officials had illegally interrogated him and threatened to arrest him. After leaving the prosecutor's office, he immediately flew out of the country. He and his family ended up settling in the U.S. ===Reactions in Russia and abroad=== Initially news of Khodorkovsky's arrest had a significant effect on the share price of Yukos. The Moscow stock market was closed for the first time ever for an hour to ensure stable trading as prices collapsed. Russia's currency, the ruble, was also hit as some foreign investors questioned the stability of the Russian market. Media reaction in Moscow was almost universally negative in blanket coverage, some of the more enthusiastic pro-business press discussed the end of capitalism, while even the government-owned press criticised the \\"absurd\\" method of Khodorkovsky's arrest. Yukos moved quickly to replace Khodorkovsky with a Russian-born U.S. citizen, Simon Kukes. Kukes, who became the CEO of Yukos, was already an experienced oil executive. The U.S. State Department said Khodorkovsky's arrest \\"raised a number of concerns over the arbitrary use of the judicial system\\" and was likely to be very damaging to foreign investment in Russia, as it appeared there were \\"selective\\" prosecutions occurring against Yukos officials but not against others. A week after the arrest, the Prosecutor-General froze Khodorkovsky's shares in Yukos to prevent Khodorkovsky from selling his shares although he retained all the shares' voting rights and received dividends. In 2003, Khodorkovsky's shares in Yukos passed to Jacob Rothschild under a deal that they had concluded prior to Khodorkovsky's arrest.Russian tycoon 'names successor', BBC News, 14 July 2003. Retrieved 6 June 2008. ===The first trial, 2004‚Äì2005=== The charges against Khodorkovsky and his associates were that, in 1994, while chairman of Menatep, he \\"created an organized group of individuals with the intention of taking control of the shares in Russian companies during the privatisation process through deceit.\\" This was with particular reference to supposedly \\"illegal actions\\" he had taken in the privatisation of the State-owned mining and fertiliser company Apatit. Khodorkovsky's longtime business partner, Platon Lebedev, was arrested on 2 July 2003, and they were put on trial together. A few weeks later, Yukos's security head Alexei Pichugin was arrested and became the subject of a separate prosecution. Leonid Nevzlin of Menatep reportedly suggested at this moment that he and Khodorkovsky should > \\"leave the country and try to bargain from a position of freedom. We should > take our money out and start a new business and a new life.\\" Nevzlin did just that and moved to Israel. Khodorkovsky remained in Russia. \\"In his value system, fleeing the country once Lebedev was in jail would have been immoral\\", Gessen wrote, \\"regardless of whether he could do anything to help his friend.\\" Instead, Khodorkovsky began to give speeches arguing that Russia must modernize socially and espouse an open and transparent economy, promoting technology over purely natural resources. Khodorkovsky was defended in court by an experienced team led by Yury Schmidt and including Karinna Moskalenko. The prosecutors claimed they were operating independently of the presidential administration. The Prosecutor-General, Vladimir Ustinov, was appointed by the former President Boris Yeltsin. He was not seen as particularly close to Putin, who had once tried to remove him. However, he was politically ambitious and prosecuting Russia's most prominent and successful tycoon was perceived as a boost to his political career and intended candidacy for the Duma. The first Khodorkovsky-Lebedev trial lasted 10 months. There were few defense witnesses, noted Gessen, \\"not only because the court turned down most of its motions but also because the prosecution's case seemed so flimsy.\\" Also, it was perceived as risky to testify for the defense. \\"Ten people affiliated with Yukos, including two lawyers, had already been arrested. Nine more had evaded arrest only by fleeing the country.\\" Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were both declared guilty and sentenced to nine years in penal colonies. The verdict of the trial, repeating the prosecutors' indictments almost verbatim, was 662 pages long. As is customary in Russian trials, the judges read the verdict aloud, beginning on 16 May 2005 and finishing on 31 May. Khodorkovsky's lawyers alleged that it was read as slowly as possible to minimize public attention.Levin, Josh. \\"Why Are Russian Verdicts So Long? They can take two weeks to read\\", Slate Magazine, 16 May 2006.. Retrieved 6 June 2008. ===Third-party support=== Khodorkovsky received a support from independent third parties who believed that he was a victim of a politicized judicial system.Supporters around the World ‚Äì Khodorkovsky Center On 29 November 2004, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights published a report, which concluded, \\"the circumstances of the arrest and prosecution of leading Yukos executives suggest that the interest of the State's action in these cases goes beyond the mere pursuit of criminal justice, to include such elements as to weaken an outspoken political opponent, to intimidate other wealthy individuals and to regain control of strategic economic assets.\\" In addition, Khodorkovsky has received admiration and support from members of the UK parliament who have noted the decline of human rights in Russia. In June 2009, the Council of Europe published a report which criticized the Russian government's handling of the Yukos case, entitled \\"Allegations of Politically Motivated Abuses of the Criminal Justice System in Council of Europe Member States\\": > \\"The Yukos affair epitomises this authoritarian abuse of the system.

In November 2010, Amnesty International Germany began a petition campaign demanding that President Medvedev get an independent review of all criminal charges against Khodorkovsky, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights.Amnesty International document (in German) , 2011. On 24 May 2011, Amnesty International criticized Lebedev and Khodorkovsky's second trial, named them prisoners of conscience, and called for their release on the expiry of their initial sentences. A two-hour documentary about his plight was released in 2011. Yelena Bonner, the widow of Andrei Sakharov, never stopped defending Khodorkhovsky: \\"I think that any person becomes a political prisoner if the law is applied to him selectively, and this is an absolutely clear case. This is a glaringly lawless action.\\" In May 2014, Khodorkovsky was praised by former Polish president Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and received an award for his efforts to reform Russian civil society. A cartoonist present at the trial created a cartoon series depicting the events. These cartoons compared Khodorkovsky's trial to the trial of Franz Kafka's The Trial. As of August 2015, these cartoons are on display at the Dox Gallery of Prague. ===In prison=== On 30 May 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in a medium security prison. At the time, he was detained at Matrosskaya Tishina, a prison in Moscow. On 1 August 2005, a political essay written by Khodorkovsky in his prison cell, titled \\"Left Turn\\", was published in Vedomosti, calling for a turn to a more socially responsible state. He stated: > \\"The next Russian administration will have to include the Communist Party of > the Russian Federation and the Motherland Party, or the historical > successors to these parties. The left-wing liberals, including Yabloko, and > right-wing Ryzhkov, Khakamada and others should decide whether to join the > broad social-democratic coalition or to remain grumpy and without relevance > on the political sidelines. In my opinion, they have to join because only > the broadest composition of a coalition in which liberal-socialist (social- > democratic) views will play the key role can save us from the emergence, in > the process of this turn to the left turn, from a new ultra-authoritarian > regime.

This will mean > in the first instance the problems of legalizing privatization and restoring > paternalistic programs and approaches in several areas.\\"\\"Left Turn\\" , > Vedomosti, 1 August 2005. On 19 August 2005, Khodorkovsky announced that he was on a hunger strike in protest against his friend and associate Platon Lebedev's placement in the punishment cell of the jail. According to Khodorkovsky, Lebedev had diabetes mellitus and heart problems, and keeping him in the punishment cell would be equivalent to murder. On 31 August 2005, he announced that he would run for parliament.Khodorkovsky to stand for Dumas, CNN, 31 August 2005. Retrieved 6 June 2008. This initiative was made possible by the legal loophole: a convicted felon cannot vote or stand for a parliament, but if his case is lodged with the Court of Appeal he still enjoys all electoral rights. Usually it takes around a year for an appeal to make its way through the Appeal Court, so there should have been enough time for Khodorkovsky to be elected. For a member of Russian parliament to be imprisoned, the parliament needs to vote to lift his or her immunity. Thus he had a hope of avoiding prosecution. But the Court of Appeal, unusually, took only a couple of weeks to process Khodorkovsky's appeal, reducing his sentence by one year and invalidating any electoral plans on his part until the end of his sentence. As reported on 20 October 2005, Khodorkovsky was delivered to the labor camp YaG-14/10 (–ò—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–±—â–µ–≥–æ —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º–∞ –Ø–ì-14/10) in the town of Krasnokamensk near Chita. The labor camp is attached to a uranium mining and processing plant and during Soviet times had a reputation as a place from which nobody returned alive. According to news reports, prisoners at the camp no longer work in uranium mining and have much better chances of survival than in the past. Khodorkovsky was put to work in the colony's mitten factory. He slept in a barracks and often spent his days in a cold solitary cell in retribution for his supposed violating of various rules. The second part of Khodorkovsky's essay \\"Left Turn\\" was published in Kommersant on 11 November 2005, in which he expressed social democratic views.\\"Left Turn ‚Äì 2\\", Khodorkovsky Center, 11 November 2005. On 13 April 2006, Khodorkovsky was attacked by prison inmate Alexander Kuchma while he was asleep after a heated conversation. Kuchma cut Khodorkovsky's face with a knife and said that it was a response to sexual advances by the businessman. Western media accused the Russian authorities of trying to play down the incident. In January 2009, the same prisoner filed a lawsuit for 500,000 rubles (about $15,000) against Khodorkovsky, accusing him of homosexual harassment. Kuchma said in an interview that he was compelled to attack Khodorkovsky by two officers, beaten and threatened with death to commit the attack. In 2011, Kuchma admitted that he had been told to attack Khodorkovsky \\"by unknown persons who had come to the prison colony and beaten and threatened him.\\" On 5 February 2007, new charges of embezzlement and money laundering were brought against both Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev.New fraud charges in Yukos case, BBC News, 5 February 2007. Retrieved 6 June 2008. Khodorkovsky's supporters pointed out that the charges came just months before Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were to become eligible for parole, as well as a year before the next Russian presidential election. On 28 January 2008, Khodorkovsky began a hunger strike to help his associate Vasily Aleksanyan, who is ill and was held in jail and who was denied the medical treatment he needed. Aleksanyan was transferred from a pre-trial prison to an oncological hospital on 8 February 2008,Echo of Moscow, –ë—ã–≤—à–∏–π –≤–∏—Ü–µ-–ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç \\"–Æ–ö–û–°–∞\\" –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω—è–Ω –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω –∏–∑ –°–ò–ó–û –≤ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é –∫–ª–∏–Ω–∏–∫—É (Former Yukos vice-president transferred from pre- trial prison to hospital), 8.02.08 after which Khodorkovsky called off his strike. \\"No single cause has done more than Khodorkovsky's to inspire Russian speakers everywhere\\", Gessen wrote in 2012. \\"Three of Russia's best-selling writers have published their correspondence with Khodorkovsky; composers have dedicated symphonies to him; a dozen artists attended his trial and put together an exhibition of courtroom drawings.\\" Gessen noted that \\"a group of Soviet-born classical musicians traveled to Strasbourg to mount a concert in honor of Khodorkovsky.\\" While Khodorkovsky was imprisoned, Arvo P√§rt, the Estonian composer, wrote his Symphony no. 4, and dedicated it to him. The symphony had its premiere on 10 January 2009 in Los Angeles at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen. Khodorkovsky spent more than half of his prison time in the Matrosskaya Tishina Detention Facility in Moscow, where, according to Gessen, \\"living conditions are far more punishing than those in a distant penal colony.\\" Yet, Gessen noted, he \\"declined to describe\\" in any detail the conditions under which he was imprisoned, \\"arguing that he is no different from other inmates.\\" In prison, Khodorkovsky announced that he would research and write a PhD dissertation on the topic of Russian oil policy. The third part of Khodorkovsky's essay/thesis \\"Left Turn\\" with the subheading \\"Global Perestroika\\" was published in Vedomosti on 7 November 2008. In it he stated:\\"A Turn to the Left ‚Äì 3: Global Perestroika\\", Khodorkovsky Center, 7 November 2008 (English translation) > \\"Barack Obama's victory in the US presidential elections is not simply the > latest change of power in one individual country, albeit a superpower.

Unconditionally including > myself in that part of society that has liberal views, I see: ahead ‚Äì is a > Turn to the Left.\\" In May 2010, Khodorkovsky went on a two-day hunger-strike to protest what he said was a violation of the recent law against imprisonment of persons accused of financial crimes. The law was pushed by President Medvedev after the death of Sergei Magnitsky who died in pre-trial detention in a Moscow prison in 2009. On appeal, Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev's sentences were reduced from 11 years to 10 years and 10 months meaning they could be released in August 2014 and May 2014, respectively. Khodorkovsky's appeal read: \\"In this case, the usual mantra that everything is legal and well-grounded just won't do.\\" He wrote a book, My Fellow Prisoners, detailing his time incarcerated. ===Political transformation=== The Economist asserted in April 2010 that after six years in prison, Khodorkovsky had politically transformed from an oligarch into a political prisoner and freedom fighter: \\"He speaks with the authority of a chief executive of what was once Russia's largest oil company. He explains how Yukos and Russia's oil industry functioned, but he goes beyond business matters. What he is defending is not his long-lost business, but his human rights. The transformation of Mr. Khodorkovsky from a ruthless oligarch, operating in a virtually lawless climate, into a political prisoner and freedom fighter is one of the more intriguing tales in post-communist Russia.\\" Khodorkovsky asserts his political transformation in many of his own writings from prison. On 26 October 2009, he published a response to Dmitri Medvedev's \\"Forward, Russia!\\" article in Vedomosti, arguing that \\"authoritarianism in its current Russian form does not meet many key humanitarian requirements customary for any country that wishes to consider itself modern and European.\\"Khodorkovsky's Opinion Editorial in Vedomosti: Generation M , Khodorkovsky Center In a 28 January 2010, op-ed for the New York Times and International Herald Tribune, Khodorkovsky argued that \\"Russia must make a historic choice. Either we turn back from the dead end toward which we have been heading in recent years ‚Äì and we do it soon ‚Äì or else we continue in this direction and Russia in its current form simply ceases to exist.\\" On 3 March 2010, Khodorkovsky published an article in Nezavisimaya Gazeta about the \\"conveyor belt\\" of Russian justice. In this article, he states that the \\"siloviki conveyor belt, which has undermined justice is truly the gravedigger of modern Russian statehood. Because it turns many thousands of the country's most active, sensible and independent citizens against this statehood ‚Äì with enviable regularity.\\"Khodorkovsky: Conveyor Belt of Russian Justice Legalizes Abuse ‚Äì Khodorkovsky Center In conclusion, The Economist opined, \\"any talk by the Kremlin of the rule of law or about modernisation will be puffery so long as Mr Khodorkovsky remains in jail.\\" ===Second trial, 2009‚Äì2010=== ====Charges==== Khodorkovsky became eligible for parole after having served half of his original sentence, however, in February 2007, state prosecutors began to prepare new charges of embezzlement, leading up to a second trial which began in March 2009. Prosecutors filed new charges against Khodorkovsky, alleging that he stole 350 million tons of oil, charges which Kommersant described as \\"Compared with the previous version, only stylistic inaccuracy has been improved, and some of the paragraphs have been swapped.\\" Others pointed out that the new charges were impossible given that he was previously convicted on tax evasion of the same allegedly stolen oil. According to Khodorkovsky's lawyer Karinna Moskalenko, \\"The position of the prosecutors is also self-contradictory. ... Khodorkovsky is now serving a sentence for tax evasion, and if they are asserting that he stole all the oil his company produced, what did he go to prison for the first time if there was nothing to be taxed?\\" \\"If the first set of charges was thin, the second was absurd\\", Gessen later wrote. \\"Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were now accused of having stolen all the oil that Yukos had produced in the years 1998 to 2003.\\" At the end of the trial, in December 2010, both defendants were sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. Gessen cited leading Russian lawyers as saying that Russian laws had been \\"passed specifically to enable [Khodorkovsky's] persecution, or adjusted retroactively to sustain it.\\" Many former Yukos employees were arrested and imprisoned and were therefore unemployable after their release, and Khodorkovsky \\"tried to provide financial support to those who have not found a way to make a living.\\" Khodorkovsky delivered his own summation at his second trial. He spoke of his countrymen's hopes \\"that Russia will finally become a land of freedom and the law, and the law will be more important than the bureaucrats\\", a country where \\"human rights will no longer be contingent on the whim of the czar, whether he be kind or mean. Where the government will be accountable to the people and the courts will be accountable only to God and the law.\\" He said, \\"I am not an ideal man, far from it. But I am a man of ideas. Like anyone, I have a hard time living in prison and I do not want to die here. But I will, if I need to, without a second thought.\\" During a visit to Moscow in July 2009, President Barack Obama said: \\"it does seem odd to me that these new charges, which appear to be a repackaging of the old charges, should be surfacing now, years after these two individuals have been in prison and as they become eligible for parole.\\" The verdict was originally scheduled for 15 December, but was delayed without explanation until 27 December. Just a few days before the verdict was read by the judge before the court, Vladimir Putin made public comments with regard to his opinion of Khodorkovsky's guilt, saying \\"a thief should sit in jail\\". On 27 December 2010, Judge Viktor Danilkin handed down a guilty verdict, convicting Khodorkovsky and Lebedev of stealing the full 350 million tons of oil, instead of the reduced 218 million tons as requested by the prosecutors. The judge sentenced them to 13.5 years in prison, later reduced to 12 years, one year less than the maximum sentence, which, when combined with time already served, will keep them in jail until 2017. ====Judicial controversy==== On 14 February 2011, Natalya Vasilyeva, an assistant to Judge Viktor Danilkin, said that the judge did not write the verdict, and had read it against his will.Broken Justice: how Khodorkovsky judge was pressured into verdict, Open Democracy Essentially, Natalya Vasilyeva said the judge's verdict was \\"brought from the Moscow City Court\\". In her statement she also noted that \\"everyone in the judicial community understands perfectly that this is a rigged case, a fixed trial\\". On 24 February Vasilyeva underwent a polygraph test, which indicated that she likely believes that Danilkin acted under pressure. Judge Danilkin responded that \\"the assertion by Natalya Vasilyeva was nothing more than slander\\". ===Appeal and Amnesty International statement=== On 24 May 2011, Khodorkovsky's appeal hearing was held, and Judge Danilkin rejected the challenge. Following the rejection of the appeal, the human rights group Amnesty International declared Khodorkovsky and Lebedev as \\"prisoners of conscience\\", remarking in a statement that \\"Whatever the rights and wrongs of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev's first convictions there can no longer be any doubt that their second trial was deeply flawed and politically motivated.\\" On 25 October 2013, the Berlin International Literature Festival held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev and all political prisoners in Russia. In June 2011, Khodorkovsky was sent to prison colony No. 7 of Segezha, in the northern region of Karelia near the Finnish border. ===Release=== Presidential Decree No.922 granting pardon to Mikhail Khodorkovsky on 20 December 2013 According to his official site, Khodorkovsky would have been eligible for early release, but an alleged conspiracy involving jail guards and a cellmate resulted in a statement that he had violated one of the prison rules. This was sufficient for him to forfeit his rights, once the statement was logged in his file.Statements: 'I'm constantly reminded that I'm in jail until further notice' ‚Äì Press Centre for Defence Attorneys of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, 18 May 2008. It was predicted that he might be released by the middle of 2011, although Khodorkovsky was found guilty on 27 December 2010 of fresh charges of embezzlement and money laundering, which had the potential of leading to a new sentence of up to 22.5 years. \\"The second as well as the first case were organized by Igor Sechin\\", he said in an interview with The Sunday Times from a remand prison in the Siberian city of Chita, east of Moscow. On 22 August 2008, he was denied parole by Judge Igor Faliliyev, at the Ingodinsky district court in Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai. The basis for this was in part because Khodorkovsky \\"refused to attend jail sewing classes\\". In the second trial, the prosecutors asked the judge for a 14-year sentence, which was just one year less than the maximum. The judge, Danilkin, handed down the verdict on 30 December 2010 in which he upheld the prosecutors' statements. Taking into account the time already served, Khodorkovsky was to be released in 2017. U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned or expressed concern over Khodorkovsky's extended sentence. The White House said it brought Russia's legal system into question.\\" U.S., Europe condemn Russia for tough Mikhail Khodorkovsky sentence\\", Dmitry Zaks. The Vancouver Sun. 31 December 2010.

On 15 February 2011, Vyacheslav Lebedev, chairman of Russia's Supreme Court, suggested reviving an old Soviet practice under which a maximum sentence for a person charged with different crimes should not exceed the sentence attached to the most serious charge: in Khodorkovsky's case, nine years. Since he has been in jail since October 2003, this would have meant releasing him in October 2012, which did not happen. On 5 March 2012, the day after Putin won his third term as president of Russia, President Medvedev ordered a review of Khodorkovsky's sentence. An anti-Putin protest was being planned for the same day in Moscow, with 12,000 police and troops prepared for duty () In December 2012, a Moscow court reduced Khodorkovsky's prison sentence by two years, so that he was due to be released in 2014. In the same court case Khodorkovsky's business partner Platon Lebedev had his prison sentence reduced by two years. The 2010 case would have had them released 13 years after the day of their arrests in 2003.bbc news website 20 December 2012 11:36 ====Upon release from prison (2013)==== 300px On 19 December 2013, president Vladimir Putin said he intended to pardon Khodorkovsky in the near future.Steven Lee Myers (19 December 2013) Putin Says Tycoon Could Be Freed From Prison Soon The New York Times. Retrieved 19 December 2013. He did so on the following day, stating that Khodorkovsky's mother was ill and Khodorkovsky had asked for clemency. Putin also felt that ten years in jail was still \\"a significant punishment\\". Some opposition leaders suggested that the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi might have played a role in the granting of the pardon. His guards told him to pack his things and he was flown at once to St. Petersburg, where he was given \\"a parka and a passport\\" and, switching planes on the tarmac, put on a flight to Berlin. The Guardian reported in December 2014 that Khodorkovsky had \\"promised Putin three things in a handwritten letter\\" in which he asked to be freed: \\"that he would leave Russia to spend time with his family, would stay away from politics, and would not attempt to win back his shares in Yukos ... or get involved in any court cases.\\" However Khodorkovsky maintains that he had made no such promise. After gaining his freedom, Khodorkovsky released a written statement in which he thanked former German foreign minister Hans- Dietrich Genscher, who had played a critical role in diplomatic negotiations, for securing his release. On 22 December 2013, two days after his release, he appeared at a news conference at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin. Reporting on his comments, the Associated Press stated that \\"The 50-year-old appeared composed at his first public appearance since his release, saying he shouldn't be viewed as a symbol that there are no more political prisoners in Russia. He added that he would do 'all I can do' to ensure the release of others.\\" He again thanked Genscher, as well as the media, and German chancellor Angela Merkel, for their roles in securing his release. On 24 December, Khodorkovsky was interviewed in his Berlin hotel room on the BBC television program Hardtalk. After his release Khodorkovsky acknowledged the support he had received from the Swiss Federal Court which ruled in 2008 against the release of documents to the Russian authorities, that tied him and Yukos, the largest Russian oil company at the time, to prominent banks and financial institutions. The Swiss court argued that handing over the documents would endanger his chance for a fair trial.Khodorkovsky grateful for Swiss advocacy swissinfo.ch International Service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation. 23 December 2013. Retrieved 29 December 2013. Khodorkovsky also has personal ties to Switzerland where his wife Inna and two of his children reside. Soon after his step to freedom, he applied for a Swiss visa, which would allow him to travel to most European countries.Nick Cumming-Bruce (2013).Freed Russian Applies for Swiss Visa Allowing Travel in 26 Nations The New York Times. 24 December 2013. Retrieved 29 December 2013. This visa was approved by Swiss authorities, and Khodorkovsky arrived in Basel, Switzerland, on 5 January 2014. Yukos shareholders were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration Court in The Hague in July 2014, however Khodorkovsky was not a party to the legal action. 2015 he moved to London. On 23 December 2015, a Russian court issued an international arrest warrant for Khodorkovsky whom the Investigative Committee of Russia charged with ordering the murder of Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, who was murdered in June 1998. Speaking on the same day on BBC, which claimed Khodorkovsky \\"spent much of his time in London\\", he said he was \\"definitely considering\\" applying for political asylum in the UK and felt safe in London.

Khodorkovsky's mother died in the summer of 2014. In July 2014, a The Hague court ruled the Russian government deliberately bankrupted Yukos to seize its assets and ordered it to repay Yukos shareholders a sum of roughly $50 billion. Roughly 30,000 former Yukos employees were to receive a large pension from the government. However, as of January 2015 the Russian government has yet to make any payments to Yukos shareholders or employees. On 20 April 2016 the District Court of The Hague quashed the decisions of the PCA, ruling that it had no jurisdiction as provisional application of the ECT arbitration clause violated Russian law. On 20 September 2014, Khodorkovsky officially relaunched the Open Russia movement, with a live teleconference broadcast featuring groups of civil society activists and pro-democracy opposition in Kaliningrad, St Petersburg, Voronezh and Ekaterinburg, among others. According to media around the time of the launch event, Open Russia was intended to unite pro-European Russians in a bid to challenge Putin's grip on power.Le Monde.

This is why, when we speak of strategic tasks, I speak of a constitutional conference that will redistribute power from the president\\" to other branches of government. On 2 December 2014, Khodorkovsky addressed the European Parliament. In December 2014, The Guardian reported that Khodorkovsky, living in Zurich, was \\"plotting the downfall of the man who put him behind bars for a decade.\\" The newspaper cited him as claiming that Russian intelligence services were monitoring his communications. In early 2015, he told CNN that he held no desire to run for the presidency, or had any political ambition, although he still held ambitions of social changes; he called his efforts \\"civic activity\\" and not politics. In March 2015, Khodorkovsky, along with other opposition figures, was a subject of attacks by a shadow organization known as Glavplakat. The attacks included anonymous posters and banners flown across Russian cities likening opposition figures to unsavoury characters from history or labeling them as traitors to Russia. It has yet to be determined who is behind the organization, and opposition figures are concerned over the attacks. In August 2015, the Kremlin summoned Khodorkovsky's father for questioning. On 7 December 2015 Khodorkovsky received an official summons from the Russian Investigative Committee. ==See also== *Alex Gibney's 2019 film Citizen K *Leonid Nevzlin (one of the key figures in the Yukos oil firm headed by Mikhail Khodorkovsky) *Russian oligarchs *Semibankirschina ==References== ==External links== * ‚Äì official Russian website *Khodorkovsky & Lebedev Communications Center (English) *Mikhail Khodorkovsky collected news and commentary at The Economist * * * ;Articles *Guilty of Being Right, City Journal online, 28 December 2010 *Independent Institute Ivan Eland discusses the international fallout from Khodorkovsky's arrest *Council on Foreign Relations Interview with Marshall I.

Created by Catherine de' Medici as the garden of the Tuileries Palace in 1564, it was eventually opened to the public in 1667 and became a public park after the French Revolution. In the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, it was a place where Parisians celebrated, met, strolled and relaxed.Emmanuel Jacquin, Les Tuileries Du Louvre √† la Concorde. ==History and development== === Garden of Catherine de' Medici === Floor plan by Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau. The engraving also includes a plan for the expansion of the palace which was never executed. In July 1559, after the accidental death of her husband, Henry II, Queen Catherine de Medici decided to leave her residence of the H√¥tel des Tournelles, at the eastern part of Paris, near the Bastille. Together with her son, the new king of France Fran√ßois II, her other children and the royal court, she moved to the Louvre Palace. Five years later, in 1564, she commissioned the construction of a new palace just beyond the wall of Charles V, not far from the Louvre, from which it would be separated by a neighborhood of private hotels, churches, convents, and the Hospice des Quinze-Vingts near the Porte Saint-Honor√©. For that purpose, Catherine had bought land west of Paris, on the other side of the portion of the wall of Charles V situated between the Tour du Bois and the 14th century Porte Saint-Honor√©. It was bordered on the south by the Seine, and on the north by the faubourg Saint-Honor√©, a road in the countryside continuing the Rue Saint-Honor√©. Since the 13th century this area had been occupied by tile-making factories called tuileries (from the French tuile, meaning \\"tile\\"). Catherine further commissioned a landscape architect from Florence, Bernard de Carnesse, to create an Italian Renaissance garden, with fountains, a labyrinth, a grotto, and decorated with faience images of plants and animals, made by Bernard Palissy, whom Catherine had tasked to discover the secret of Chinese porcelain. The Tuileries Garden in 1615, where the Grand Basin is now located. The covered promenade can be seen, and the riding school established by Catherine. The garden of Catherine de' Medici was an enclosed space five hundred metres long and three hundred metres wide, separated from the new palace by a lane. It was divided into rectangular compartments by six alleys, and the sections were planted with lawns, flower beds, and small clusters of five trees, called quinconces; and, more practically, with kitchen gardens and vineyards.Jacquin, Les Tuileries ‚Äî Du Louvre √† la Concorde, p. 4. The Tuileries garden was the largest and most beautiful garden in Paris at the time. Catherine used it for lavish royal festivities honoring ambassadors from Queen Elizabeth I of England, and the marriage of her daughter, Marguerite de Valois, to Henri III of Navarre, better known as Henry IV, King of France and of Navarre.Jacquin, p. 6 === Garden of Henry IV === King Henry III was forced to flee Paris in 1588, and the gardens fell into disrepair. His successor, Henry IV (1589‚Äì1610), and his gardener, Claude Mollet, restored the gardens, built a covered promenade the length of the garden, and a parallel alley planted with mulberry trees where he hoped to cultivate silkworms and start a silk industry in France. He also built a rectangular ornamental lake of 65 metres by 45 metres with a fountain supplied with water by the new pump called La Samaritaine, which had been built in 1608 on the Pont Neuf. The area between the palace and the former moat of Charles V was turned into the \\"New Garden\\" (Jardin Neuf) with a large fountain in the center. Though Henry IV never lived in the Tuilieries Palace, which was continually under reconstruction, he did use the gardens for relaxation and exercise. === Garden of Louis XIII === The Tuileries Garden in 1652 with the Parterre de Mademoiselle east of the Palace In 1610, at the death of his father, Louis XIII became the new owner of the Tuileries Gardens at the age of nine. It became his enormous playground - he used it for hunting, and he kept a menagerie of animals. On the north side of the gardens, Marie de' Medici established a riding school, stables, and a covered manege for exercising horses. When the king and court were absent from Paris, the gardens were turned into a pleasure spot for the nobility. In 1630 a former rabbit warren and kennel at the west rampart of the garden were made into a flower-lined promenade and cabaret. The daughter of Gaston d'Orl√©ans and the niece of Louis XIII, known as La Grande Mademoiselle, held a sort of court in the cabaret, and the \\"New Garden\\" of Henry IV (the present-day Carousel) became known as the \\"Parterre de Mademoiselle.\\" In 1652, \\"La Grande Mademoiselle\\" was expelled from the chateau and garden for having supported an uprising, the Fronde, against her cousin, the young Louis XIV.Jacquin, p. 10 === Garden of Louis XIV and Le N√¥tre === Tuileries Garden of Le N√¥tre in the 17th century, looking west toward the future Champs √âlys√©es, engraving by Perelle Le N√¥tre's Tuileries Garden plan, engraving by Isra√´l Silvestre (1671) The statue of Renomm√©e, or the fame of the king, riding the horse Pegasus, (1699) by Antoine Coysevox (1640‚Äì1720) at the west entrance of the Garden. Originally located on Louis XIV's estate at Marly, it was moved to the Tuileries in 1719 The new king quickly imposed his own sense of order on the Tuileries Gardens. His architects, Louis Le Vau and Fran√ßois d'Orbay, finally finished the Tuileries Palace, making a proper royal residence. In 1662, to celebrate the birth of his first child, Louis XIV held a vast pageant of mounted courtiers in the New Garden, which had been enlarged by filling in Charles V's moat and had been turned into a parade ground. Thereafter the square was known as the Place du Carrousel.Jacquin p. 15 In 1664, Colbert, the king's superintendent of buildings, commissioned the landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre, to redesign the entire garden. Le N√¥tre was the grandson of Pierre Le N√¥tre, one of Catherine de' Medici's gardeners, and his father Jean had also been a gardener at the Tuileries. He immediately began transforming the Tuileries into a formal jardin √† la fran√ßaise, a style he had first developed at Vaux-le- Vicomte and perfected at Versailles, based on symmetry, order and long perspectives. Le N√¥tre's gardens were designed to be seen from above, from a building or terrace. He eliminated the street which separated the palace and the garden, and replaced it with a terrace looking down upon flowerbeds bordered by low boxwood hedges and filled with designs of flowers. In the centre of the flowerbeds he placed three ornamental lakes with fountains. In front of the centre of the first fountain he laid out the Grande All√©e, which extended 350 metres. He built two other alleys, lined with chestnut trees, on either side. He crossed these three main alleys with small lanes, to create compartments planted with diverse trees, shrubs and flowers. On the south side of the park, next to the Seine, he built a long terrace called the Terrasse du bord-de-l'eau, planted with trees, with a view of the river He built a second terrace on the north side, overlooking the garden, called the Terrasse des Feuillants. On the west side of the garden, beside the present-day Place de la Concorde, he built two ramps in a horseshoe shape Fer √° Cheval and two terraces overlooking an octagonal lake Bassin Octogonal in diameter, respectively from corner to corner, with one fountain in the centre with a waterjet of height, additional powerful waterjets from each corner to the center. The terraces frame the western entrance of the garden, and provide another viewpoint to see the garden from above. The garden with Bassin Octogonal and ramps Fer √† Cheval in a view from Louvre to the Luxor Obelisk Le N√¥tre wanted his grand perspective from the palace to the western end of the garden to continue outside the garden. In 1667, he made plans for an avenue with two rows of trees on either side, which would have continued west to the present Rond-Point des Champs √âlys√©es.Jarrass√©, Grammaire des Jardins Parisiens, p. 51. Le N√¥tre and his hundreds of masons, gardeners and earth- movers worked on the gardens from 1666 to 1672. In 1682, however, the king, furious with the Parisians for resisting his authority, abandoned Paris and moved to Versailles. In 1667, at the request of the famous author of Sleeping Beauty and other fairy tales, Charles Perrault, the Tuileries Garden was opened to the public, with the exception of beggars, \\"lackeys\\" and soldiers.Jarrass√©, p. 47 It was the first royal garden to be open to the public. === In the 18th century === After the death of Louis XIV, the five- year-old Louis XV became owner of the Tuileries Garden. The garden, abandoned for nearly forty years, was put back in order. In 1719, two large equestrian statuary groups, La Renomm√©e and Mercure, by the sculptor Antoine Coysevox, were brought from the king's residence at Marly and placed at the west entrance of the garden. Other statues by Nicolas and Guillaume Coustou, Corneille an Cl√®ve, Sebastien Slodz, Thomas Regnaudin and Coysevox were placed along the Grande All√©e.The statues in the park now are copies; the originals are in the Louvre. A swing bridge was placed at the west end over the moat, to make access to the garden easier. The creation of the place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde) created a grand vestibule to the garden. Certain holidays, such as August 25, the feast day of Saint Louis, were celebrated with concerts and fireworks in the park. A famous early balloon ascent was made from the garden on December 1, 1783 by Jacques Alexandre C√©sar Charles and Nicolas Louis Robert. Small food stands were placed in the park, and chairs could be rented for a small fee.Chairs were still being rented for a small sum until 1970. Public toilets were added in 1780.Jacquin, p. 24. ==== During the French Revolution ==== The Tuileries, renamed the \\"Jardin National\\" during the French Revolution- the Festival of the Supreme Being (1794) On October 6, 1789, as the French Revolution began, King Louis XVI was brought against his will to the Tuileries Palace. The garden was closed to the public except in the afternoon. Queen Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin were given a part of the garden for her private use, first at the west end of the Promenade Bord d'eaux, then at the edge of the Place Louis XV. After the king's failed attempt to escape France, the surveillance of the family was increased. The royal family was allowed to walk in the park on the evening of September 18, 1791, during the festival organized to celebrate the new French Constitution, when the alleys of the park were illuminated with pyramids and rows of lanterns.Jacquin, p. 25 On August 10, 1792, a mob stormed the Palace, and the king's Swiss guards were chased through the gardens and massacred. After the king's removal from power and execution, the Tuileries became the National Garden (Jardin National) of the new French Republic. In 1794 the new government assigned the renewal of the gardens to the painter Jacques-Louis David, and to his brother in law, the architect August Cheval de Saint-Hubert. They conceived a garden decorated with Roman porticos, monumental porches, columns, and other classical decoration. The project of David and Saint-Hubert was never completed. All that remains today are the two exedres, semicircular low walls crowned with statues by the two ponds in the centre of the garden.The two exedres have been restored, with plaster copies of the original statues. While David's project was not finished, large numbers of statues from royal residences were brought to the gardens for display. The garden was also used for revolutionary holidays and festivals. On June 8, 1794, a ceremony in honor of the Cult of the Supreme Being was organized in the Tuileries by Robespierre, with sets and costumes designed by Jacques-Louis David. After a hymn written for the occasion, Robespierre set fire to mannequins representing Atheism, Ambition, Egoism and False Simplicity, revealing a statue of Wisdom.Jacquin, p. 26‚Äì27. ===In the 19th century=== √âdouard Manet, La Musique aux Tuileries, 1862 Camille Pissarro, The Garden of the Tuileries on a Spring Morning, 1899 Around 1900 In the 19th century, the Tuileries Garden was the place where ordinary Parisians went to relax, meet, stroll, enjoy the fresh air and greenery, and be entertained. Napoleon Bonaparte, about to become Emperor, moved into the Tuileries Palace on February 19, 1800, and began making improvements to suit an imperial residence. A new street was created between the Louvre and the Place du Carrousel, a fence closed the courtyard, and he built a small triumphal arch, modeled after the arch of Septimius Severus in Rome, in the middle of the Place du Carrousel, as the ceremonial entrance to his palace. In 1801 Napoleon ordered the construction of a new street along the northern edge of the Tuileries, through space that had been occupied by the riding school and stables built by Marie de' Medici, and the private gardens of aristocrats and convents and religious orders that had been closed during the Revolution. This new street also took part of the Terrasse des Feuillants, which had been occupied by caf√©s and restaurants. The new street, lined with arcades on the north side, was named the rue de Rivoli, after Napoleon's victory in 1797. Napoleon made few changes to the interior of the garden. He continued to use the garden for military parades and to celebrate special events, including the passage of his own wedding procession on April 2, 1810, when he married the Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria. After the fall of Napoleon, the garden briefly became the encampment of the occupying Austrian and Russian soldiers. The monarchy was restored, and the new King, Charles X, renewed an old tradition and celebrated the feast day of Saint Charles in the garden. In 1830, after a brief revolution, the new king, Louis-Philippe, became owner of the Tuileries. He wanted a private garden within the Tuileries, so a section of the garden in front of the palace was separated by a fence from the rest of the Tuileries. A small moat, flower beds and eight new statues by sculptors of the period decorated the new private garden. In 1852, following another revolution and the short-lived Second Republic, a new Emperor, Louis Napoleon, became owner of the garden. He enlarged his private reserve within the garden further to the west as far as the north‚Äìsouth alley that crossed the large round basin, so that included the two small round basins. He decorated his new garden with beds of exotic plants and flowers, and new statues. In 1859, he made the Terrasse du bord-de-l'eau into a playground for his son, the Prince Imperial. He also constructed twin pavilions, the Jeu de paume and the Orangerie, at the west end of the garden, and built a new stone balustrade at the west entrance. When The Emperor was not in Paris, usually from May to November, the entire garden, including his private garden and the playground, were open to the public. In 1870, Emperor Louis Napoleon was defeated and captured by the Prussians, and Paris was the scene of the uprising of the Paris Commune. A red flag flew over the Palace, and it could be visited for fifty centimes. When the army arrived and fought to recapture the city, the Communards deliberately burned the Tuileries Palace, and tried to burn the Louvre as well. The ruins were not torn down until 1883. The empty site of the palace, between the two pavilions of the Louvre, became part of the garden. === In the 20th century === Jardin des Tuileries in winter, December 2007 At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the Tuilieries garden was filled with entertainments for the public; acrobats, puppet theatres, lemonade stands, small boats on the lakes, donkey rides, and stands selling toys. At the 1900 Summer Olympics, the Gardens hosted the fencing events.1900 Summer Olympics official report. p. 16. Accessed 14 November 2010. The peace in the garden was interrupted by the First World War in 1914; the statues were surrounded by sandbags, and in 1918 two German long-range artillery shells landed in the garden. In the years between the two World Wars, the Jeu de paume tennis court was turned into a gallery, and its western part was used to display the Water Lilies series of paintings by Claude Monet. The Orangerie became an art gallery for contemporary western art. During World War II, the Jeu de paume was used by the Germans as a warehouse for art they had stolen or confiscated. The liberation of Paris in 1944 saw considerable fighting in the garden. Monet's paintings Water Lilies were seriously damaged during the battle.Jacquin, p. 41 Until the 1960s, almost all the sculpture in the garden dated from the 18th or 19th century. In 1964‚Äì65, Andr√© Malraux, the Minister of Culture for President Charles de Gaulle, removed the 19th century statues which surrounded the Place du Carrousel and replaced them with contemporary sculptures by Aristide Maillol. In 1994, as part of the Grand Louvre project launched by President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the Belgian landscape architect Jacques Wirtz remade the garden of the Carrousel, adding labyrinths and a fan of low hedges radiating from the triumphal arch in the square. In 1998, under President Jacques Chirac, works of modern sculpture by Jean Dubuffet, Henri Laurens, √âtienne Martin, Henry Moore, Germaine Richier, Auguste Rodin and David Smith were placed in the garden. In 2000, the works of living artists were added; these included works by Magdalena Abakanowicz, Louise Bourgeois, Tony Cragg, Roy Lichtenstein, Fran√ßois Morrellet, Giuseppe Penone, Anne Rochette and Lawrence Weiner. Another ensemble of three works by Daniel Dezeuze, Erik Dietman and Eug√®ne Dodeigne, called Pri√®re Toucher (Eng: Please Touch), was added at the same time.Jacquin, p. 42‚Äì43 === In the 21st century === Caf√© de Pomone, Jardin des Tuileries, in springtime, March 2007 At the beginning of the 21st century, French landscape architects Pascal Cribier and Louis Benech have been working to restore some of the early features of the Andr√© Le N√¥tre garden.Jarrass√©, p. 49 ==Areas of special interest== ===Jardin du Carrousel=== Arc de triomphe du Carrousel Also known as the Place du Carrousel, this part of the garden used to be enclosed by the two wings of the Louvre and by the Tuileries Palace. In the 18th century it was used as a parade ground for cavalry and other festivities. The central feature is the Arc de triomphe du Carrousel, built to celebrate the victories of Napoleon, with bas-relief sculptures of his battles by Jean Joseph Espercieux. The garden was remade in 1995 to showcase a collection of 21 statues by Aristide Maillol, which had been put in the Tuileries in 1964. ===Terrasse=== The elevated terrace between the Carrousel and the rest of the garden used to be at the front of the Tuileries Palace. After the Palace was burned in 1870, it was made into a road, which was put underground in 1877. The terrace is decorated by two large vases which used to be in the gardens of Versailles, and two statues by Aristide Maillol; the Monument to C√©zanne on the north and the Monument aux morts de Port Vendres on the south. ===Moat of Charles V=== Two stairways descend from the Terrasse to the moat (fr:foss√©s) named for Charles V of France, who rebuilt the Louvre in the 14th century. It was part of the old fortifications which originally surrounded the palace. On the west side are traces left by the fighting during the unsuccessful siege of Paris by Henry IV of France in 1590 during the French Wars of Religion. Since 1994 the moat has been decorated with statues from the facade of the old Tuileries Palace and with bas-reliefs made in the 19th century during the Restoration of the French monarchy which were meant to replace the Napoleonic bas-reliefs on the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, but were never put in place.Jacquin, p. 46 ===Grand Carr√© of the Tuileries=== Tuileries Garden panorama The Grand Carr√© (Large Square) is the eastern, open part of the Tuilieries garden, which still follows the formal plan of the Garden √† la fran√ßaise created by Andr√© Le N√¥tre in the 17th century. The eastern part of the Grand Carr√©, surrounding the round pond, was the private garden of the king under Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, separated from the rest of the Tuileries by a fence. Most of the statues in the Grand Carr√© were put in place in the 19th century. *Nymphe (1866) and Diane Chasseresse (Diana the Huntress) (1869) by Louis Auguste L√©v√™que, which mark the beginning of the central all√©e which runs east-west through the park. *Tigre terrassant un crocodile (Tiger overwhelming a crocodile) (1873) and Tigresse portant un paon √† ses petits (Tigress bringing a peacock to her young) (1873), both by Auguste Cain, by the two small round ponds. The large round pond is surrounded by statues on themes from antiquity, allegory, and ancient mythology. Statues in violent poses alternate with those in serene poses. On the south side, starting from the east entrance of the large round pond, they are: *La Mis√®re (Misery) by Jean-Baptiste Hugues (1905) *P√©ricl√®s distribuant les couronnes aux artistes (Pericles Giving Crowns to Artists) by Jean-Baptiste Debay Pƒóre (1835) * Le Bon Samaritain (The Good Samaritan) by Fran√ßois Sicard (1896) * \\"Alexandre Combattant\\" (Alexander Fighting) by Charles Nanteuil (1836) *Cincinnatus by Denis Foyatier (1834) *M√©d√©e by Paul Jean Baptiste Gasq (1896) On the north side, starting at the west entrance to the pond, they are: *Le Serment de Spartacus (The Oath of Spartacus) by Louis Ernest Barrias (1869) *La Com√©die by Julien Toussaint Roux (1874) *Le Centaur Nessus enlevant Dƒójanire (The Centaur Nessus Carrying Off Dejanire) by Laurent Honor√© Marqueste (1892) *Th√©s√©e combattant le Minotaure (Theseus Fighting the Minotaur) by √âtienne-Jules Ramey (1821) *Cassandre se met sous la protection de Pallas by Aim√© Miller (1877) *Ca√Øn venant de tuer son fr√®re Abel (Cain After Killing His Brother Abel) by Henri Vidal (1896) Plan of the Jardin des Tuileries ===Le Grand Couvert of the Tuileries=== The Grand Couvert is the part of the garden covered with trees. The two cafes in the Grand Couvert are named after two famous cafes once located in the garden; the caf√© Very, which had been on the terrace des Feuiillants in the 18th‚Äì19th century; and the caf√© Renard, which in the 18th century had been a popular meeting place on the western terrace. The Grand Couvert also contains the two exedres, low curving walls built to display statues, which survived from the French Revolution. They were built in 1799 by Jean Charles Moreau, part of a larger unfinished project designed by painter Jacques-Louis David in 1794. They are now decorated with plaster casts of moldings on mythological themes from the park of Louis XIV at Marly. The Grand Couvert contains a number of important works of the 20th century and contemporary sculpture, including: *L'√âchiquier, Grand,(1959) by Germaine Richier *La Grande Musicienne, (1937) by Henri Laurens *Personnages III (1967) by √âtienne Martin *Primo Piano II (1962) by David Smith *Confidence (2000) by Daniel Dezeuze *Force et Tendresse (1996) by Eug√®ne Dodeigne *L'Ami de personne, (1999) by Erik Dietman *Manus Ultimus, (1997) by Magdalena Abakanowicz *Arbre des voyelles, (2000) by Giuseppe Penone *Brushstroke Nude (1993) by Roy Lichtenstein *Un, deux, tros, nous (2000) by Anne Rochette *Jeanette, (about 1933), Paul Belmondo *Apollon, (about 1933), Paul Belmondo ===Orangerie, Jeu de Paume, and West Terrace of the Tuileries=== Westernmost portion of the Tuileries Garden Claude Monet, Les Nymph√©as (Water Lilies) 1920‚Äì1926, oil on canvas, 86.2 √ó 237 in. (219 √ó 602 cm) in the Orangerie The Orangerie (Mus√©e de l'Orangerie), at the west end of the garden close to the Seine, was built in 1852 by the architect Firmin Bourgeois. Since 1927 it has displayed many large examples of Claude Monet's Water Lilies series. It also displays the Walter-Guillaume collection of Impressionist painting On the terrace of the Orangerie are four works of sculpture by Auguste Rodin: Le Baiser (1881‚Äì1898); Eve (1881) and La Grande Ombre (1880) and La Meditation avc bras (1881‚Äì1905). It also has a modern work, Grand Commandement blanc (1986) by Alain Kirili. The Jeu de Paume (Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume) was built in 1861 was the architect Viraut, and enlarged in 1878. In 1927 it became an annex of the Luxembourg Palace Museum for the display of contemporary art from outside France. During the German Occupation of World War II, from 1940 to 1944, it was used by the Germans as a depot for storing art they stole or expropriated from Jewish families. From 1947 until 1986, it served as the Mus√©e du Jeu de Paume, which held many important Impressionist works now housed in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. Today, the Jeu de Paume is used for exhibits of modern and contemporary art. On the terrace in front of the Jeu de Paume is a work of sculpture, Le Bel Costum√© (1973) by Jean Dubuffet. == Sculptures == File:Mercury riding Pegasus Coysevox Louvre MR1822.jpgMercury riding Pegasus, (1701‚Äì02) by Antoine Coysevox (1640‚Äì1720).

Consisting of a phenyl group attached to an amino group, aniline is the simplest aromatic amine. It is an industrially significant commodity chemical, as well as a versatile starting material for fine chemical synthesis. Its main use is in the manufacture of precursors to polyurethane, dyes, and other industrial chemicals. Like most volatile amines, it has the odor of rotten fish. It ignites readily, burning with a smoky flame characteristic of aromatic compounds. Chemically, it is considered an electron-rich benzene derivative, and as a consequence, reacts rapidly in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Likewise, it is also prone to oxidation: while freshly purified aniline is an almost colorless oil, exposure to air results in gradual darkening of the sample (to yellow or red) due to the formation of strongly colored, oxidized impurities. Aniline can be diazotized to give a diazonium salt, which can then undergo various nucleophilic substitution reactions. Like other amines, aniline is a base (pKaH = 4.6) and nucleophile, although it is a weaker base and poorer nucleophile than structurally similar aliphatic amines. ==Structure== Aniline is a slightly pyramidalized molecule, with hybridization of the nitrogen somewhere between sp3 and sp2. As a result, the nitrogen lone pair is in an spx hybrid orbital with high p character. The amino group in aniline is flatter (i.e., it is a \\"shallower pyramid\\") than that in an aliphatic amine, owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent. The observed geometry reflects a compromise between two competing factors: 1) stabilization of the N lone pair in an orbital with significant s character favors pyramidalization (orbitals with s character are lower in energy), while 2) delocalization of the N lone pair into the aryl ring favors planarity (a lone pair in a pure p orbital gives the best overlap with the orbitals of the benzene ring œÄ system). Consistent with these factors, substituted anilines with electron donating groups are more pyramidalized, while those with electron withdrawing groups are more planar. In the parent aniline, the lone pair is approximately 12% s character, corresponding to sp7.3 hybridization. (For comparison, alkylamines generally have lone pairs in orbitals that are close to sp3.) The pyramidalization angle between the C‚ÄìN bond and the bisector of the H‚ÄìN‚ÄìH angle is 142.5¬∞. (For comparison, in more strongly pyramidal methylamine, this value is ~125¬∞, while a planar nitrogen like that of formamide has an angle of 180¬∞.) The C‚àíN distance is also correspondingly shorter. In aniline, the C‚àíN bond length is 1.41 √Ö, compared to 1.47 √Ö for cyclohexylamine, indicating that there is partial œÄ-bonding between N and C.G. M. W√≥jcik \\"Structural Chemistry of Anilines\\" in Anilines (Patai's Chemistry of Functional Groups), S. Patai, Ed. 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . ==Production== Industrial aniline production involves two steps. First, benzene is nitrated with a concentrated mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid at 50 to 60 ¬∞C to yield nitrobenzene. The nitrobenzene is then hydrogenated (typically at 200‚Äì300 ¬∞C) in the presence of metal catalysts: :400px The reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline was first performed by Nikolay Zinin in 1842, using inorganic sulfide as a reductant (Zinin reaction). The reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline was also performed as part of reductions by Antoine B√©champ in 1854, using iron as the reductant (Bechamp reduction). Aniline can alternatively be prepared from ammonia and phenol derived from the cumene process. In commerce, three brands of aniline are distinguished: aniline oil for blue, which is pure aniline; aniline oil for red, a mixture of equimolecular quantities of aniline and ortho- and para-toluidines; and aniline oil for safranine, which contains aniline and ortho-toluidine and is obtained from the distillate (√©chapp√©s) of the fuchsine fusion. ===Related aniline derivatives=== Many analogues of aniline are known where the phenyl group is further substituted. These include toluidines, xylidines, chloroanilines, aminobenzoic acids, nitroanilines, and many others. They often are prepared by nitration of the substituted aromatic compounds followed by reduction. For example, this approach is used to convert toluene into toluidines and chlorobenzene into 4-chloroaniline. Alternatively, using Buchwald-Hartwig coupling or Ullmann reaction approaches, aryl halides can be animated with aqueous or gaseous ammonia. https://www.organic- chemistry.org/synthesis/C1N/amines/anilines.shtm ==Reactions== The chemistry of aniline is rich because the compound has been cheaply available for many years. Below are some classes of its reactions. ===Oxidation=== The oxidation of aniline has been heavily investigated, and can result in reactions localized at nitrogen or more commonly results in the formation of new C-N bonds. In alkaline solution, azobenzene results, whereas arsenic acid produces the violet-coloring matter violaniline. Chromic acid converts it into quinone, whereas chlorates, in the presence of certain metallic salts (especially of vanadium), give aniline black. Hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate give chloranil. Potassium permanganate in neutral solution oxidizes it to nitrobenzene; in alkaline solution to azobenzene, ammonia, and oxalic acid; in acid solution to aniline black. Hypochlorous acid gives 4-aminophenol and para-amino diphenylamine. Oxidation with persulfate affords a variety of polyanilines. These polymers exhibit rich redox and acid-base properties. Polyanilines can form upon oxidation of aniline. ===Electrophilic reactions at carbon=== Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly susceptible to electrophilic substitution reactions. Its high reactivity reflects that it is an enamine, which enhances the electron- donating ability of the ring. For example, reaction of aniline with sulfuric acid at 180 ¬∞C produces sulfanilic acid, H2NC6H4SO3H. If bromine water is added to aniline, the bromine water is decolourised and a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline is formed. To generate the mono-substituted product, a protection with acetyl chloride is required: Aniline can react with bromine even in room temperatures in water. Acetyl chloride is added to prevent tribromination. The reaction to form 4-bromoaniline is to protect the amine with acetyl chloride, then hydrolyse back to reform aniline. The largest scale industrial reaction of aniline involves its alkylation with formaldehyde. An idealized equation is shown: :2 C6H5NH2 \\\\+ CH2O ‚Üí CH2(C6H4NH2)2 \\\\+ H2O The resulting diamine is the precursor to 4,4'-MDI and related diisocyanates. ===Reactions at nitrogen=== ====Basicity==== Aniline is a weak base. Aromatic amines such as aniline are, in general, much weaker bases than aliphatic amines. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+). Traditionally, the weak basicity of aniline is attributed to a combination of inductive effect from the more electronegative sp2 carbon and resonance effects, as the lone pair on the nitrogen is partially delocalized into the pi system of the benzene ring. (see the picture below): The nitrogen's electron was delocalized to the ring. This is why that aniline is less basic than most amines. Missing in such an analysis is consideration of solvation. Aniline is, for example, more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution. ====Acylation==== Aniline reacts with acyl chlorides such as acetyl chloride to give amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide. At high temperatures aniline and carboxylic acids react to give the anilides. ====N-Alkylation==== N-Methylation of aniline with methanol at elevated temperatures over acid catalysts gives N-methylaniline and dimethylaniline: :C6H5NH2 \\\\+ 2 CH3OH ‚Üí C6H5N(CH3)2 \\\\+ 2H2O N-Methylaniline and dimethylaniline are colorless liquids with boiling points of 193‚Äì195 ¬∞C and 192 ¬∞C, respectively. These derivatives are of importance in the color industry. Aniline combines directly with alkyl iodides to form secondary and tertiary amines. ====Carbon disulfide derivatives==== Boiled with carbon disulfide, it gives sulfocarbanilide (diphenylthiourea) (CS(NHC6H5)2), which may be decomposed into phenyl isothiocyanate (C6H5CNS), and triphenyl guanidine (C6H5N=C(NHC6H5)2). ====Diazotization==== Aniline and its ring-substituted derivatives react with nitrous acid to form diazonium salts. Through these intermediates, aniline can be conveniently converted to -OH, -CN, or a halide via Sandmeyer reactions. This diazonium salt can also be reacted with NaNO2 and phenol to produce a dye known as benzeneazophenol, in a process called coupling. The reaction of converting primary aromatic amine into diazonium salt is called diazotisation. In this reaction primary aromatic amine reacts with sodium nitrile and with 2 moles of HCl which is known as Ice cold mixture because the temperature use to be 0.5¬∞C and it forms benzene diazonium salt as major product and water and sodium chloride. ===Other reactions=== It reacts with nitrobenzene to produce phenazine in the Wohl-Aue reaction. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexylamine. Being a standard reagent in laboratories, aniline is used for many niche reactions. Its acetate is used in the aniline acetate test for carbohydrates, identifying pentoses by conversion to furfural. It is used to stain neural RNA blue in the Nissl stain. ==Uses== The largest application of aniline is for the preparation of methylenedianiline and related compounds by condensation with formaldehyde. The diamines are condensed with phosgene to give methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, a precursor to urethane polymers.Thomas Kahl, Kai- Wilfrid Schr√∂der, F. R. Lawrence, W. J. Marshall, Hartmut H√∂ke, Rudolf J√§ckh \\"Aniline\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007. John Wiley & Sons: New York. :Most aniline is consumed in the production of methylenedianiline, a precursor to polyurethanes. Other uses include rubber processing chemicals (9%), herbicides (2%), and dyes and pigments (2%). As additives to rubber, aniline derivatives such as phenylenediamines and diphenylamine, are antioxidants. Illustrative of the drugs prepared from aniline is paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol). The principal use of aniline in the dye industry is as a precursor to indigo, the blue of blue jeans. Cake of indigo dye, which is prepared from aniline. Aniline is also used at a smaller scale in the production of the intrinsically conducting polymer polyaniline. Some early American rockets, such as the Aerobee and WAC Corporal, used a mixture of aniline and furfuryl alcohol as a fuel, with nitric acid as an oxidizer. The combination is hypergolic, igniting on contact between fuel and oxidizer. It is also dense, and can be stored for extended periods. ==History== Aniline was first isolated in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben by destructive distillation of indigo. He called it Crystallin. In 1834, Friedlieb Runge isolated a substance from coal tar that turned a beautiful blue color when treated with chloride of lime. He named it kyanol or cyanol.F. F. Runge (1834) \\"Ueber einige Produkte der Steinkohlendestillation\\" (On some products of coal distillation), Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 31: 65‚Äì77 (see page 65), 513‚Äì524; and 32: 308‚Äì332 (see page 331). In 1840, Carl Julius Fritzsche (1808‚Äì1871) treated indigo with caustic potash and obtained an oil that he named aniline, after an indigo-yielding plant, anil (Indigofera suffruticosa).J. Fritzsche (1840) \\"Ueber das Anilin, ein neues Zersetzungsproduct des Indigo\\" (On aniline, a new decomposition product of indigo), Bulletin Scientifique [publi√© par l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-Petersbourg], 7 (12): 161‚Äì165.

In a postscript to this article, Erdmann (one of the journal's editors) argues that aniline and the \\"cristallin\\", which was found by Unverdorben in 1826, are the same substance; see pages 457‚Äì459.synonym I anil, ultimately from Sanskrit \\"nƒ´la\\", dark-blue. In 1842, Nikolay Nikolaevich Zinin reduced nitrobenzene and obtained a base that he named benzidam.N. Zinin (1842). \\"Beschreibung einiger neuer organischer Basen, dargestellt durch die Einwirkung des Schwefelwasserstoffes auf Verbindungen der Kohlenwasserstoffe mit Untersalpeters√§ure\\" (Description of some new organic bases, produced by the action of hydrogen sulfide on compounds of hydrocarbons and hyponitric acid [H2N2O3]), Bulletin Scientifique [publi√© par l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-Petersbourg], 10 (18): 272‚Äì285.

In 1843, August Wilhelm von Hofmann showed that these were all the same substance, known thereafter as phenylamine or aniline.August Wilhelm Hofmann (1843) \\"Chemische Untersuchung der organischen Basen im Steinkohlen-Theer√∂l\\" (Chemical investigation of organic bases in coal tar oil), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 47: 37‚Äì87. On page 48, Hofmann argues that krystallin, kyanol, benzidam, and aniline are identical. ===Synthetic dye industry=== In 1856, while trying to synthesise quinine, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine and went into industry producing the first commercial synthetic dye. Other aniline dyes followed, such as fuchsin, safranin, and induline. At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive. Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine B√©champ,A. B√©champ (1854) \\"De l'action des protosels de fer sur la nitronaphtaline et la nitrobenzine.

Retrieved on 2007-09-24. The B√©champ reduction enabled the evolution of a massive dye industry in Germany. Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (English: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory), now the largest chemical supplier, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via aniline dyes and extended via the related azo dyes. The first azo dye was aniline yellow.Auerbach G, \\"Azo and naphthol dyes\\", Textile Colorist, 1880 May;2(17):137-9, p 138. ===Developments in medicine=== In the late 19th century, derivatives of aniline such as acetanilide and phenacetin emerged as analgesic drugs, with their cardiac-suppressive side effects often countered with caffeine.Wilcox RW, \\"The treatment of influenza in adults\\", Medical News, 1900 Dec 15;77():931-2, p 932. During the first decade of the 20th century, while trying to modify synthetic dyes to treat African sleeping sickness, Paul Ehrlich ‚Äì who had coined the term chemotherapy for his magic bullet approach to medicine ‚Äì failed and switched to modifying B√©champ's atoxyl, the first organic arsenical drug, and serendipitously obtained a treatment for syphilis ‚Äì salvarsan ‚Äì the first successful chemotherapy agent. Salvarsan's targeted microorganism, not yet recognized as a bacterium, was still thought to be a parasite, and medical bacteriologists, believing that bacteria were not susceptible to the chemotherapeutic approach, overlooked Alexander Fleming's report in 1928 on the effects of penicillin.D J Th Wagener, The History of Oncology (Houten: Springer, 2009), pp 150‚Äì1. In 1932, Bayer sought medical applications of its dyes. Gerhard Domagk identified as an antibacterial a red azo dye, introduced in 1935 as the first antibacterial drug, prontosil, soon found at Pasteur Institute to be a prodrug degraded in vivo into sulfanilamide ‚Äì a colorless intermediate for many, highly colorfast azo dyes ‚Äì already with an expired patent, synthesized in 1908 in Vienna by the researcher Paul Gelmo for his doctoral research. By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939‚Äì45), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American pharmaceutics industry.John E Lesch, The First Miracle Drugs: How the Sulfa Drugs Transformed Medicine (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), pp 202‚Äì3. In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by Ren√© Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) After World War II, Cornelius P. Rhoads introduced the chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment.\\"Medicine: Spoils of war\\", Time, 15 May 1950. ===Rocket fuel=== In the 1940s and early 1950s, aniline was used with nitric acid or dinitrogen tetroxide as rocket fuel for small missiles and the Aerobee rocket. The two fuel components are hypergolic, producing a violent reaction on contact. Aniline was later replaced by hydrazine.Brian Burnell. 2016. http://www.nuclear- weapons.info/cde.htm#Corporal SSM ==Toxicology and testing== Aniline is toxic by inhalation of the vapour, ingestion, or percutaneous absorption.Muir, GD (ed.) 1971, Hazards in the Chemical Laboratory, The Royal Institute of Chemistry, London.The Merck Index. 10th ed. (1983), p.96, Rahway: Merck & Co. The IARC lists it in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) due to the limited and contradictory data available. The early manufacture of aniline resulted in increased incidents of bladder cancer, but these effects are now attributed to naphthylamines, not anilines. Aniline has been implicated as one possible cause of forest dieback.Krahl-Urban, B., Papke, H.E., Peters, K.

Zhou profited from Shanghai's real estate boom in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and was once described as the 11th richest man in China, with personal assets totalling US$320 million. In November 2007, Zhou was sentenced to sixteen years in prison for stock manipulation and fraud. He is on the \\"Most Wanted\\" list of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in Hong Kong. ==Biography== Born in a family of seven children in Yangpu District of Shanghai, Zhou started working at 17 without completing high school. He opened up his own wonton restaurant in Yangpu in 1978. In 1989, he opened up Meitong Restaurant (ÁæéÈÄöÈ•≠Â∫ó) in Shanghai, and a karaoke bar. He opened up the grand Ah Mao Boiled Food (ÈòøÊØõÁáâÂìÅ) in 1994, and trading building materials in Shanghai. Zhou's involvement in China's newly re-established stock markets and his trading in copper futures brought about his wealth, that enabled him to move into and capitalise upon the volatile Shanghai real estate boom. ===Financial irregularities=== Zhou owns an unlisted holding company in Hong Kong, called New Nongkai Global Investments, and 75% of a Hong Kong-listed investment company called Shanghai Land Holdings. Zhou was detained in June 2003 and placed under investigation for illegally acquiring state land and bank loans. On June 1, 2004, he was sentenced to three years in prison for stock market fraud. This relatively light sentence has given rise to speculation that he is cooperating with authorities in other investigations, especially Chen Liangyu, and then- Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju.Chinese magnate given jail term, BBC News, June 1, 2004 Speculation on Zhou's arrest is centred upon high-level corruption in Shanghai, which may involve prot√©g√©s of Communist Party's former general secretary, Jiang Zemin. China's new leadership team of general secretary Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao may have decided to make an example of Zhou to embarrass Jiang Zemin's associates.Scandal in Shanghai, The Economist, August 14, 2003 On October 23, 2006, the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong obtained approval from a Hong Kong court to arrest Zhou for allegedly providing false information to the city's stock market regulators in relation to his acquisition of a listed company in 2002. In January 2006, Zhou's wife, Sandy Mo Yuk-ping, was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in Hong Kong for manipulating the price of Shanghai Land shares with the aim of defrauding investors.Alfred Liu, Black Friday looms for Chau in court , The Standard, November 28, 2007 Zhou was arrested again by Shanghai authorities on January 21, 2007, on charges of offering bribes and forging value-added tax invoices. He has also been charged with two other counts of bribery and embezzlement. In November 2007, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison by the Shanghai Municipal No. 2 People's Intermediate Court. ==See also== *Shanghai pension scandal ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Shanghai Category:Hong Kong financial businesspeople Category:Chinese expatriates in Hong Kong Category:Chinese white-collar criminals ","title":"Zhou Zhengyi"},{"id":"299727","text":"ISDN Digital Subscriber Line (IDSL) uses ISDN-based digital subscriber line technology to provide a data communication channel across existing copper telephone lines at a rate of 144 kbit/s, slightly higher than a bonded dual channel ISDN connection at 128kbit/s. The digital transmission bypasses the telephone company's central office equipment that handles analogue signals. IDSL uses the ISDN grade loop without Basic Rate Interface in ISDN transmission mode. The benefits of IDSL over ISDN are that IDSL provides always-on connections and transmits data via a data network rather than the carrier's voice network. IDSL also avoids per-call fees by being generally billed at a flat-rate. IDSL is not available in all countries. ISDN digital subscriber line (IDSL) is a cross between ISDN and xDSL. It is like ISDN in that it uses a single-wire pair to transmit full-duplex data at 128 kbit/s and at distances of up to RRD range. Like ISDN, IDSL uses a 2B1Q line code to enable transparent operation through the ISDN U interface. Finally, the user continues to use existing CPE (ISDN BRI terminal adapters, bridges, and routers) to make the CO connections. The big difference is from the carrier's point of view. Unlike ISDN, IDSL does not connect through the voice switch. A new piece of data communications equipment terminates the IDSL connection and shunts it off to a router or data switch. This is a key feature because the overloading of central office voice switches by data users is a growing problem for telcos. The limitation of IDSL is that the customer no longer has access to ISDN signaling or voice services. But for Internet service providers, who do not provide a public voice service, IDSL is an alternative way of using POTS dial service to offer higher-speed Internet access, targeting the embedded base of more than five million ISDN users as an initial market. ==References== Category:Digital subscriber line Category:Integrated Services Digital Network Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 2000 ","title":"ISDN digital subscriber line"},{"id":"299786","text":"There are a number of places named after famous people.

Their work takes account mainly of safety, technical, economic, and environmental concerns, but they may also consider aesthetic and social factors. Structural engineering is usually considered a specialty discipline within civil engineering, but it can also be studied in its own right. In the United States, most practicing structural engineers are currently licensed as civil engineers, but the situation varies from state to state. Some states have a separate license for structural engineers which is required to design special or high-risk structures such as schools, hospitals, or skyscrapers. In the United Kingdom, most structural engineers in the building industry are members of the Institution of Structural Engineers or the Institution of Civil Engineers. Typical structures designed by a structural engineer include buildings, towers, stadia and bridges. Other structures such as oil rigs, space satellites, aircraft and ships may also be designed by a structural engineer.Institution of Structural Engineer, What do they do? , viewed on 22 May 2007 Most structural engineers are employed in the construction industry, however there are also structural engineers in the aerospace, automobile and shipbuilding industries. In the construction industry, they work closely with architects, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, quantity surveyors, and construction managers. Structural engineers ensure that buildings and bridges are built to be strong enough and stable enough to resist all appropriate structural loads (e.g., gravity, wind, snow, rain, seismic (earthquake), earth pressure, temperature, and traffic) to prevent or reduce the loss of life or injury. They also design structures to be stiff enough to not deflect or vibrate beyond acceptable limits. Human comfort is an issue that is regularly considered in the limits. Fatigue is also an important consideration for bridges and aircraft design or for other structures that experience many stress cycles over their lifetimes. Consideration is also given to the durability of materials against possible deterioration which may impair performance over the design lifetime. ==Education== The education of structural engineers is usually through a civil engineering bachelor's degree, and often a master's degree specializing in structural engineering. The fundamental core subjects for structural engineering are strength of materials or solid mechanics, Structural Analysis -Static & Dynamic, material science and numerical analysis. Reinforced concrete, composite structure, timber, masonry and structural steel designs are the general structural design courses that will be introduced in the next level of the education of structural engineering. The structural analysis courses which include structural mechanics, structural dynamics and structural failure analysis are designed to build up the fundamental analysis skills and theories for structural engineering students. At the senior year level or in graduate programs, prestressed concrete design, space frame design for building and aircraft, bridge engineering, civil and aerospace structure rehabilitation and other advanced structural engineering specializations are usually introduced. Recently in the United States, there have been discussions in the structural engineering community about the knowledge base of structural engineering graduates. Some have called for a master's degree to be the minimum standard for professional licensing as a civil engineer. There are separate structural engineering undergraduate degrees at the University of California, San Diego and the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Geodesy, Sofia, Bulgaria. Many students who later become structural engineers major in civil, mechanical, or aerospace engineering degree programs, with an emphasis on structural engineering. Architectural engineering programs do offer structural emphases and are often in combined academic departments with civil engineering. ==Licensing or chartered status== In the United States, persons practicing structural engineering must be licensed in each state in which they practice. Licensure may usually be obtained by the same qualifications as for a Civil Engineer, but some states require licensure specifically for structural engineering, with experience specific and non-concurrent with experience claimed for another engineering profession. The qualifications for licensure typically include a specified minimum level of practicing experience, as well as the successful completion of a nationally administered exam, and possibly a state-specific exam. For instance, California requires that candidates pass a national exam, written by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES),National Council of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors as well as a state-specific exam which includes a seismic portion and a surveying portion. Most states do not have a separate structural engineering license. In Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, there is an additional license or authority for Structural Engineering, obtained after the engineer has obtained a Civil Engineering license and practiced an additional amount of time with the Civil Engineering license. The scope of what may be designed by a Structural Engineer but not by a Civil Engineer without the S.E. license is very limited in Alaska, California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington and is reserved entirely to S.E. licensees in Hawaii and Illinois. The United Kingdom has one of the oldest professional institutions for structural engineers, the Institution of Structural Engineers. Founded as the Concrete Institute in 1908, it was renamed the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE) in 1922. It now has 22,000 members with branches in 32 countries. The IStructE is one of several UK professional bodies empowered to grant the title of Chartered Engineer; its members are granted the title of Chartered Structural Engineer. The overall process to become chartered begins after graduation from a UK MEng degree, or a BEng with an MSc degree. To qualify as a chartered structural engineer, a graduate needs to go through four years of Initial Professional Development followed by a professional review interview. After passing the interview, the candidate sits an eight-hour professional review examination. The election to chartered membership (MIStructE) depends on the examination result. The candidate can register at the Engineering Council UK as a Chartered Structural Engineer once he or she has been elected as a Chartered Member. Legally it is not necessary to be a member of the IStructE when working on structures in the UK, however, industry practice, insurance, and liabilities dictate that an appropriately qualified engineer be responsible for such work. In the United States, application for license exam is allowed four years after the candidate graduated from an ABET-accredited university and passing the fundamentals of Engineering exam, three years after receiving a master's degree, or two years after receiving a Ph.D. degree.Structural Engineering in Texas ==Career and Remuneration== A 2010 survey of professionals occupying jobs in the construction industry showed that structural engineers in the UK earn an average wage of ¬£35,009. The salary of structural engineers varies from sector to sector within the construction and built environment industry worldwide, depending on the project. For example, structural engineers working in public sector projects earn on average ¬£37,083 per annum compared to the ¬£43,947 average earned by those in commercial projects. Certain regions also represent higher average salaries, with structural engineers in the Middle East in all sectors, and of every level of experience, earning ¬£45,083, compared to UK and EU countries where the average is ¬£35,164. ==See also== *Architects *Architectural engineering *Building officials *Civil engineering *Earthquake engineering *List of structural engineers *List of structural engineering companies *Structural engineering *Structural failure ==References== National Council of Structural Engineers Associations (www.ncsea.com) American Society for Civil Engineers About Structural Engineering ==External links== *A day in the life of a structural engineer *IABSE (International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering) * Category:Building engineering Category:Engineering occupations ","title":"Structural engineer"},{"id":"299794","text":"Caviidae, the cavy family, is composed of rodents native to South America and includes the domestic guinea pig, wild cavies, and the largest living rodent, the capybara. They are found across South America in open areas from moist savanna to thorn forests or scrub desert. This family of rodents has fewer members than most other rodent families, with 19 species in 6 genera in 3 subfamilies. ==Characteristics== Guinea pig skull on top of a capybara skull With the exception of the maras, which have a more rabbit-like appearance, caviids have short, heavy bodies and large heads. Most have no visible tails. They range in size from the smaller cavies at 22 cm in body length, and 300 grams in weight, up to the capybara, the largest of all rodents at 106 to 134 cm in length, and body weights of 35 to 66 kilograms. Even larger forms existed in the Pliocene, such as Phugatherium, which was about the size of a tapir. They are herbivores, eating tough grasses or softer leaves, depending on species. The dental formula is similar to that of various other rodents: . Females give birth to two or three furred and active young after a gestation period of 50 to 90 days in most species, or 150 days in the capybara. In most species, they are sexually mature within a few months of birth, although in capybaras, maturity is not reached until around 18 months. Social organisation varies widely among the group. Many cavies are promiscuous, forming no long- lasting social groups, although, in some species, males maintain harems of two or more females. In contrast, maras are monogamous, and form temporary colonial creches to care for the young of multiple mothers. Capybaras live in groups of around 10 individuals, and sometimes many more, each with a single dominant male, and a number of females, subordinate males, and juveniles. ==Classification== The family Caviidae is a sister group to the family Dasyproctidae, both of which are members of the superfamily Cavioidea. Fossils caviids first appeared during the middle of the Miocene epoch in South America.

This family is restricted to southern and western South America, mostly living in mountainous regions of the Andes but one species living on plains. They are medium to large-sized rodents, weighing from to , with strong hind legs and large ears and a bushy tail. All species have thick, soft fur, which is considered valuable in some cultures. ==Characteristics== Members of the family Chinchillidae are somewhat rabbit or squirrel-like rodents varying in weight from . They have large eyes, medium-sized ears, soft dense fur and short bushy tails. The forelegs are shorter than the hind legs. The forefeet have four toes while the hind feet have four small-clawed toes in Lagidium and Chinchilla but three large-clawed toes in Lagostomus, a digging species. Their dental formula is and their incisors grow continually throughout their lives. Chinchillids are generally brownish-grey or grey on the dorsal (upper) surface and pale on the ventral (under) surface. Plains viscachas have distinctive black and white markings on their faces. ==Distribution== The Chinchillidae are native to South America. Chinchillas and mountain viscachas live in remote mountainous regions of Chile and Peru, on rocky surfaces and among boulders. Plains viscachas are found in the plains of Argentina, from the Gran Chaco area southwards to Patagonia. ==Behaviour== Members of this family are herbivorous and live in colonies of up to several hundred individuals. Plains viscachas live in extensive networks of burrows on plains where it is said that ten viscachas can eat as much as does one sheep. Mountain viscachas and chinchillas live in craggy upland regions where they inhabit crevices among rocks and are skilled climbers. Although they can jump, they mostly move about by walking or running. They use vocalizations to communicate with each other, especially the plains viscachas. ==Status== Both species of chinchillas are listed by the IUCN as being \\"critically endangered\\" and may be extinct in the wild. They were at one time relatively common but have been overexploited by hunters catching them for the fur trade. The plains viscacha is rated as being of \\"least concern\\" as it seems tolerant of habitat disturbance and although some populations have been eliminated locally through pest control measures and hunting, others have expanded into newly cleared areas.

It may be driven by a voltage or current source and these will produce different responses. A first order RC circuit is composed of one resistor and one capacitor and is the simplest type of RC circuit. RC circuits can be used to filter a signal by blocking certain frequencies and passing others. The two most common RC filters are the high-pass filters and low-pass filters; band-pass filters and band-stop filters usually require RLC filters, though crude ones can be made with RC filters. ==Introduction== There are three basic, linear passive lumped analog circuit components: the resistor (R), the capacitor (C), and the inductor (L). These may be combined in the RC circuit, the RL circuit, the LC circuit, and the RLC circuit, with the acronyms indicating which components are used. These circuits, among them, exhibit a large number of important types of behaviour that are fundamental to much of analog electronics. In particular, they are able to act as passive filters. This article considers the RC circuit, in both series and parallel forms, as shown in the diagrams below. == Natural response == RC circuit The simplest RC circuit consists of a resistor and a charged capacitor connected to one another in a single loop, without an external voltage source. Once the circuit is closed, the capacitor begins to discharge its stored energy through the resistor. The voltage across the capacitor, which is time-dependent, can be found by using Kirchhoff's current law. The current through the resistor must be equal in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to the time derivative of the accumulated charge on the capacitor. This results in the linear differential equation :C\\\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\\\frac{V}{R}=0 \\\\,, where is the capacitance of the capacitor. Solving this equation for yields the formula for exponential decay: :V(t)=V_0 e^{-\\\\frac{t}{RC}} \\\\,, where is the capacitor voltage at time . The time required for the voltage to fall to is called the RC time constant and is given by,Horowitz & Hill, p. 1.13 :\\\\tau = RC \\\\,. In this formula, œÑ is measured in seconds, R in ohms and C in farads. == Complex impedance == The complex impedance, (in ohms) of a capacitor with capacitance (in farads) is :Z_C = \\\\frac{1}{sC} The complex frequency is, in general, a complex number, :s = \\\\sigma + j \\\\omega \\\\,, where * represents the imaginary unit: , * is the exponential decay constant (in nepers per second), and * is the sinusoidal angular frequency (in radians per second). ===Sinusoidal steady state=== Sinusoidal steady state is a special case in which the input voltage consists of a pure sinusoid (with no exponential decay). As a result, \\\\sigma = 0 and the impedance becomes :Z_C = - \\\\frac{j}{\\\\omega C} \\\\,. ==Series circuit== Series RC circuit By viewing the circuit as a voltage divider, the voltage across the capacitor is: :V_C(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{Cs}}{R + \\\\frac{1}{Cs}}V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + RCs}V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s) and the voltage across the resistor is: :V_R(s) = \\\\frac{R}{R + \\\\frac{1}{Cs}}V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s) = \\\\frac{RCs}{1 + RCs}V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s)\\\\,. ===Transfer functions=== The transfer function from the input voltage to the voltage across the capacitor is :H_C(s) = \\\\frac{ V_C(s) }{ V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s) } = \\\\frac{ 1 }{ 1 + RCs } \\\\,. Similarly, the transfer function from the input to the voltage across the resistor is :H_R(s) = \\\\frac{ V_R(s) }{ V_{\\\\rm in}(s) } = \\\\frac{ RCs }{ 1 + RCs } \\\\,. ====Poles and zeros==== Both transfer functions have a single pole located at :s = -\\\\frac{1}{RC} \\\\,. In addition, the transfer function for the voltage across the resistor has a zero located at the origin. ===Gain and phase=== The magnitude of the gains across the two components are :G_C = \\\\big H_C(j \\\\omega) \\\\big = \\\\left\\\\frac{V_C(j \\\\omega)}{V_\\\\mathrm{in}(j \\\\omega)}\\\\right = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left(\\\\omega RC\\\\right)^2}} and :G_R = \\\\big H_R(j \\\\omega) \\\\big = \\\\left\\\\frac{V_R(j \\\\omega)}{V_\\\\mathrm{in}(j \\\\omega)}\\\\right = \\\\frac{\\\\omega RC}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left(\\\\omega RC\\\\right)^2}}\\\\,, and the phase angles are :\\\\phi_C = \\\\angle H_C(j \\\\omega) = \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(-\\\\omega RC\\\\right) and :\\\\phi_R = \\\\angle H_R(j \\\\omega) = \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega RC}\\\\right)\\\\,. These expressions together may be substituted into the usual expression for the phasor representing the output: :\\\\begin{align} V_C &= G_C V_\\\\mathrm{in} e^{j\\\\phi_C} \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_R &= G_R V_\\\\mathrm{in} e^{j\\\\phi_R}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} ===Current=== The current in the circuit is the same everywhere since the circuit is in series: :I(s) = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s) }{R + \\\\frac{1}{Cs}} = \\\\frac{ Cs }{ 1 + RCs } V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s)\\\\,. ===Impulse response=== The impulse response for each voltage is the inverse Laplace transform of the corresponding transfer function. It represents the response of the circuit to an input voltage consisting of an impulse or Dirac delta function. The impulse response for the capacitor voltage is :h_C(t) = \\\\frac{1}{RC} e^{-\\\\frac{t}{RC}} u(t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} e^{-\\\\frac{t}{\\\\tau}} u(t)\\\\,, where is the Heaviside step function and is the time constant. Similarly, the impulse response for the resistor voltage is :h_R(t) = \\\\delta (t) - \\\\frac{1}{RC} e^{-\\\\frac{t}{RC}} u(t) = \\\\delta (t) - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} e^{-\\\\frac{t}{\\\\tau}} u(t)\\\\,, where is the Dirac delta function ===Frequency- domain considerations=== These are frequency domain expressions. Analysis of them will show which frequencies the circuits (or filters) pass and reject. This analysis rests on a consideration of what happens to these gains as the frequency becomes very large and very small. As : :G_C \\\\to 0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad G_R \\\\to 1 \\\\,. As : :G_C \\\\to 1 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad G_R \\\\to 0 \\\\,. This shows that, if the output is taken across the capacitor, high frequencies are attenuated (shorted to ground) and low frequencies are passed. Thus, the circuit behaves as a low-pass filter. If, though, the output is taken across the resistor, high frequencies are passed and low frequencies are attenuated (since the capacitor blocks the signal as its frequency approaches 0). In this configuration, the circuit behaves as a high-pass filter. The range of frequencies that the filter passes is called its bandwidth. The point at which the filter attenuates the signal to half its unfiltered power is termed its cutoff frequency. This requires that the gain of the circuit be reduced to :G_C = G_R = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt 2}. Solving the above equation yields :\\\\omega_\\\\mathrm{c} = \\\\frac{1}{RC} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{or} \\\\quad f_\\\\mathrm{c} = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi RC} which is the frequency that the filter will attenuate to half its original power. Clearly, the phases also depend on frequency, although this effect is less interesting generally than the gain variations. As : :\\\\phi_C \\\\to 0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad \\\\phi_R \\\\to 90^{\\\\circ} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\mbox{ radians}\\\\,. As : :\\\\phi_C \\\\to -90^{\\\\circ} = -\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\mbox{ radians} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad \\\\phi_R \\\\to 0\\\\,. So at DC (0 Hz), the capacitor voltage is in phase with the signal voltage while the resistor voltage leads it by 90¬∞. As frequency increases, the capacitor voltage comes to have a 90¬∞ lag relative to the signal and the resistor voltage comes to be in-phase with the signal. ===Time-domain considerations=== :This section relies on knowledge of , the natural logarithmic constant. The most straightforward way to derive the time domain behaviour is to use the Laplace transforms of the expressions for and given above. This effectively transforms . Assuming a step input (i.e. before and then afterwards): :\\\\begin{align} V_\\\\mathrm{in}(s) &= V\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_C(s) &= V\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{1 + sRC}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_R(s) &= V\\\\cdot\\\\frac{sRC}{1 + sRC}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\,. \\\\end{align} Capacitor voltage step-response. Resistor voltage step-response. Partial fractions expansions and the inverse Laplace transform yield: :\\\\begin{align} V_C(t) &= V\\\\left(1 - e^{-\\\\frac{t}{RC}}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_R(t) &= Ve^{-\\\\frac{t}{RC}}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} These equations are for calculating the voltage across the capacitor and resistor respectively while the capacitor is charging; for discharging, the equations are vice versa. These equations can be rewritten in terms of charge and current using the relationships and (see Ohm's law). Thus, the voltage across the capacitor tends towards as time passes, while the voltage across the resistor tends towards 0, as shown in the figures. This is in keeping with the intuitive point that the capacitor will be charging from the supply voltage as time passes, and will eventually be fully charged. These equations show that a series RC circuit has a time constant, usually denoted being the time it takes the voltage across the component to either rise (across the capacitor) or fall (across the resistor) to within of its final value. That is, is the time it takes to reach and to reach . The rate of change is a fractional per . Thus, in going from to , the voltage will have moved about 63.2% of the way from its level at toward its final value. So the capacitor will be charged to about 63.2% after , and essentially fully charged (99.3%) after about . When the voltage source is replaced with a short circuit, with the capacitor fully charged, the voltage across the capacitor drops exponentially with from towards 0. The capacitor will be discharged to about 36.8% after , and essentially fully discharged (0.7%) after about . Note that the current, , in the circuit behaves as the voltage across the resistor does, via Ohm's Law. These results may also be derived by solving the differential equations describing the circuit: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in} - V_C}{R} &= C\\\\frac{dV_C}{dt} \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_R &= V_\\\\mathrm{in} - V_C \\\\,. \\\\end{align} The first equation is solved by using an integrating factor and the second follows easily; the solutions are exactly the same as those obtained via Laplace transforms. ====Integrator==== Consider the output across the capacitor at high frequency, i.e. :\\\\omega \\\\gg \\\\frac{1}{RC}\\\\,. This means that the capacitor has insufficient time to charge up and so its voltage is very small. Thus the input voltage approximately equals the voltage across the resistor. To see this, consider the expression for I given above: :I = \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}}{R+\\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C}}\\\\,, but note that the frequency condition described means that :\\\\omega C \\\\gg \\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\,, so :I \\\\approx \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}}{R} which is just Ohm's Law. Now, :V_C = \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int_{0}^{t}I\\\\,dt\\\\,, so :V_C \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{RC}\\\\int_{0}^{t}V_\\\\mathrm{in}\\\\,dt\\\\,, which is an integrator across the capacitor. ====Differentiator==== Consider the output across the resistor at low frequency i.e., :\\\\omega \\\\ll \\\\frac{1}{RC}\\\\,. This means that the capacitor has time to charge up until its voltage is almost equal to the source's voltage. Considering the expression for again, when :R \\\\ll \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}\\\\,, so :\\\\begin{align} I &\\\\approx \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}}\\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C} \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_\\\\mathrm{in} &\\\\approx \\\\frac{I}{j\\\\omega C} = V_C \\\\,.\\\\end{align} Now, :\\\\begin{align} V_R &= IR = C\\\\frac{dV_C}{dt}R \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_R &\\\\approx RC\\\\frac{dV_{in}}{dt}\\\\,, \\\\end{align} which is a differentiator across the resistor. More accurate integration and differentiation can be achieved by placing resistors and capacitors as appropriate on the input and feedback loop of operational amplifiers (see operational amplifier integrator and operational amplifier differentiator). ==Parallel circuit== Parallel RC circuit The parallel RC circuit is generally of less interest than the series circuit. This is largely because the output voltage is equal to the input voltage ‚Äî as a result, this circuit does not act as a filter on the input signal unless fed by a current source. With complex impedances: :\\\\begin{align} I_R &= \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}}{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_C &= j\\\\omega C V_\\\\mathrm{in}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} This shows that the capacitor current is 90¬∞ out of phase with the resistor (and source) current. Alternatively, the governing differential equations may be used: :\\\\begin{align} I_R &= \\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}}{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_C &= C\\\\frac{dV_\\\\mathrm{in}}{dt}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} When fed by a current source, the transfer function of a parallel RC circuit is: :\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{out}}{I_\\\\mathrm{in}} = \\\\frac{R}{1+sRC}\\\\,. == Synthesis == It is sometimes required to synthesise an RC circuit from a given rational function in s. For synthesis to be possible in passive elements, the function must be a positive-real function. To synthesise as an RC circuit, all the critical frequencies (poles and zeroes) must be on the negative real axis and alternate between poles and zeroes with an equal number of each. Further, the critical frequency nearest the origin must be a pole, assuming the rational function represents an impedance rather than an admittance. The synthesis can be achieved with a modification of the Foster synthesis or Cauer synthesis used to synthesise LC circuits. In the case of Cauer synthesis, a ladder network of resistors and capacitors will result.Bakshi & Bakshi, pp. 3-30‚Äì3-37 == See also == *RL circuit *LC circuit *RLC circuit *Electrical network *List of electronics topics *Step response ==References== ==Bibliography== * Bakshi, U.A.; Bakshi, A.V., Circuit Analysis - II, Technical Publications, 2009 . * Horowitz, Paul; Hill, Winfield, The Art of Electronics (3rd edition), Cambridge University Press, 2015 .

This family includes over 50 species among the 16 genera. They include the jerboas, jumping mice, and birch mice. Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of saltation (jumping while in a bipedal stance), a feature that is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling jerboas. == Characteristics == Dipodids are small to medium-sized rodents, ranging from in body length, excluding the tail. They are all adapted for jumping, although to varying degrees. The jerboas have very long hind legs which, in most species, include cannon bones. They move either by jumping, or by walking on their hind legs. The jumping mice have long feet, but lack the extreme adaptations of the jerboas, so that they move by crawling or making short hops, rather than long leaps. Both jerboas and jumping mice have long tails to aid their balance. Birch mice have shorter tails and feet, but they, too, move by jumping. Most dipodids are omnivorous, with a diet consisting of seeds and insects. Some species of jerboa, however, such as Allactaga sibirica, are almost entirely insectivorous. Like other rodents, they have gnawing incisors separated from the grinding cheek teeth by a gap, or diastema. The dental formula for dipodids is: Jerboas and birch mice make their nests in burrows, which, in the case of jerboas, may be complex, with side-chambers for storage of food. In contrast, while jumping mice sometimes co-opt the burrows of other species, they do not dig their own, and generally nest in thick vegetation. Most species hibernate for at least half the year, surviving on fat that they build up in the weeks prior to going to sleep. Dipodids give birth to litters of between two and seven young after a gestation period of between 17 and 42 days. They breed once or twice a year, depending on the species. == Classification == Northern birch mouse (Sicista betulina), Sicistinae Family Dipodidae *Subfamily Sicistinae, birch mice **Genus Sicista ***Armenian birch mouse, Sicista armenica ***Northern birch mouse, Sicista betulina ***Caucasian birch mouse, Sicista caucasica ***Long- tailed birch mouse, Sicista caudata ***Chinese birch mouse, Sicista concolor ***Kazbeg birch mouse, Sicista kazbegica ***Kluchor birch mouse, Sicista kluchorica ***Altai birch mouse, Sicista napaea ***Gray birch mouse, Sicista pseudonapaea ***Severtzov's birch mouse, Sicista severtzovi ***Strand's birch mouse, Sicista strandi ***Southern birch mouse, Sicista subtilis ***Tien Shan birch mouse, Sicista tianshanica *Subfamily Zapodinae, jumping mice Woodland jumping mouse (Napaeozapus insignis), Zapodinae **Genus Eozapus ***Chinese jumping mouse, Eozapus setchuanus **Genus Napaeozapus ***Woodland jumping mouse, Napaeozapus insignis **Genus Zapus ***Meadow jumping mouse, Zapus hudsonius ***Western jumping mouse, Zapus princeps ***Pacific jumping mouse, Zapus trinotatus *Subfamily Allactaginae **Genus Allactaga ***Subgenus Allactaga ****Small five-toed jerboa, Allactaga elater ****Iranian jerboa, Allactaga firouzi ****Hotson's jerboa, Allactaga hotsoni ****Great jerboa, Allactaga major ****Severtzov's jerboa, Allactaga severtzovi ****Vinogradov's jerboa, Allactaga vinogradovi ***Subgenus Orientallactaga ****Balikun jerboa, Allactaga balikunica ****Gobi jerboa, Allactaga bullata ****Mongolian five- toed jerboa, Allactaga sibirica ***Subgenus Paralactaga ****Euphrates jerboa, Allactaga euphratica ****Williams' jerboa, Allactaga williamsi ***Subgenus Scarturus ****Four-toed jerboa, Allactaga tetradactyla ***incertae sedis ****Allactaga toussi **Genus Allactodipus ***Bobrinski's jerboa, Allactodipus bobrinskii **Genus Pygeretmus, fat-tailed jerboas ***Lesser fat-tailed jerboa, Pygeretmus platyurus ***Dwarf fat-tailed jerboa, Pygeretmus pumilio ***Greater fat-tailed jerboa, Pygeretmus shitkovi *Subfamily Cardiocraniinae **Genus Cardiocranius ***Five-toed pygmy jerboa, Cardiocranius paradoxus **Genus Salpingotulus ***Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, Salpingotulus michaelis **Genus Salpingotus, pygmy jerboas ***Subgenus Anguistodontus ****Thick-tailed pygmy jerboa, Salpingotus crassicauda ***Subgenus Prosalpingotus ****Heptner's pygmy jerboa, Salpingotus heptneri ****Pale pygmy jerboa, Salpingotus pallidus ****Thomas's pygmy jerboa, Salpingotus thomasi ***Subgenus Salpingotus **** Kozlov's pygmy jerboa, Salpingotus kozlovi *Subfamily Dipodinae **Tribe Dipodini ***Genus Dipus ****Northern three-toed jerboa, Dipus sagitta ***Genus Eremodipus ****Lichtenstein's jerboa, Eremodipus lichtensteini ***Genus Jaculus ****Blanford's jerboa, Jaculus blanfordi ****Lesser Egyptian jerboa, Jaculus jaculus ****Greater Egyptian jerboa, Jaculus orientalis ****Thaler's jerboa, Jaculus thaleri ***Genus Stylodipus, three-toed jerboas ****Andrews's three-toed jerboa, Stylodipus andrewsi ****Mongolian three-toed jerboa, Stylodipus sungorus ****Thick-tailed three-toed jerboa, Stylodipus telum **Tribe Paradipodini ***Genus Paradipus ****Comb-toed jerboa, Paradipus ctenodactylus *Subfamily Euchoreutinae **Genus Euchoreutes, long-eared jerboa ***Long-eared jerboa, Euchoreutes naso == References == * Category:Rodent families Category:Extant Eocene first appearances Category:Taxa named by Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim ","title":"Dipodidae"},{"id":"299808","text":"The 1957 Governor General's Awards for Literary Merit were the twenty-first such awards in Canada.

Astor died in the sinking of RMS Titanic during the early hours of April 15, 1912. Astor was the richest passenger aboard the RMS Titanic and was thought to be among the richest people in the world at that time with a net worth of roughly $87 million when he died (equivalent to $ billion in ). ==Early life, education, and family== John Jacob Astor IV in 1909. John Jacob Astor as Henry IV of France John Jacob Astor IV was born on July 13, 1864, at his parents' country estate of Ferncliff in Rhinebeck, New York. He was the youngest of five children and only son of William Backhouse Astor Jr., a businessman, collector, and racehorse breeder/owner, and Caroline Webster \\"Lina\\" Schermerhorn, a socialite. His four elder sisters were Emily, Helen, Charlotte, and Caroline (\\"Carrie\\"). He was a great-grandson of German‚ÄìAmerican fur-trader John Jacob Astor and Sarah Cox Todd, whose fortune made the Astor family one of the wealthiest in the United States. Astor's paternal grandfather William Backhouse Astor Sr. was a prominent real estate businessman. Through his paternal grandmother, Margaret Alida Rebecca Armstrong, Astor was also a great-grandson of Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida Livingston of the Livingston family. His maternal grandparents were Abraham Schermerhorn, a wealthy merchant, and socialite Helen Van Courtlandt White. His sister Helen's husband was diplomat James Roosevelt \\"Rosey\\" Roosevelt, half-brother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the Roosevelt family. Another sister, named Carrie, was a noted philanthropist and the wife of Marshall Orme Wilson (brother of banker Richard Thornton Wilson Jr. and socialite Grace (n√©e Wilson) Vanderbilt). Astor was also a first cousin of William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor, with whom his mother had a notorious feud resulting in William's removal to England. Astor attended St Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and later attended Harvard College. He went by the name \\"Jack\\". His ungainly appearance and the perception that he was an aimless dilettante led one newspaper to give him the name \\"Jack Ass- tor\\".William Alan Morrison, Waldorf Astoria, Arcadia Publishing - 2014, page 29 ==Career== Among Astor's accomplishments was A Journey in Other Worlds (1894), a science-fiction novel about life in the year 2000 on the planets Saturn and Jupiter. He also patented several inventions, including a bicycle brake in 1898, a \\"vibratory disintegrator\\" used to produce gas from peat moss, and a pneumatic road-improver, and he helped develop a turbine engine. Like generations of Astors before him, he also made millions in real estate. In 1897, Astor built the Astoria Hotel, \\"the world's most luxurious hotel\\", in New York City, adjoining the Waldorf Hotel owned by Astor's cousin and rival, William. The complex became known as the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The Waldorf- Astoria would later be the host location to the U.S. inquiries into the sinking of the RMS Titanic, on which Astor died. ===Military service=== Astor Battery on parade, January 1899 From 1894 to 1896, he was a colonel on the military staff of New York Governor Levi P. Morton. Shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Astor personally financed a volunteer artillery unit known as the \\"Astor Battery\\", which served in the Philippines. In May 1898, Astor was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Volunteers and served as an officer on the staff of Major General William Shafter in Cuba, during the Santiago Campaign. He was later given a brevet (war/temporary promotion) to colonel in recognition of his services.\\"Col. John Jacob Astor\\". The New York Times (April 16, 1912). He was mustered out of the Volunteer Army in November 1898. During the war, he allowed his yacht Nourmahal to be used by the U.S. government. He appeared in the films President McKinley's Inspection of Camp Wikoff (1898) and Col. John Jacob Astor, Staff and Veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1899). As a result of his military service, Astor was entitled to the Spanish Campaign Medal. After the war, Astor was often referred to as \\"Colonel Astor.\\" Astor was a member of several military and hereditary societies. He was an early member of the New York Society of Colonial Wars and was assigned membership number 138. He was also a member of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, Society of the Army of Santiago de Cuba, and the Society of the American Wars of the United States. ==Personal life== Madeleine Talmage Force. On February 17, 1891, Astor married socialite Ava Lowle Willing, a daughter of Edward Shippen Willing and Alice Barton. The couple had two children: * William Vincent Astor (November 15, 1891 ‚Äì February 3, 1959), businessman and philanthropist * Ava Alice Muriel Astor (July 7, 1902 ‚Äì July 19, 1956) Astor and Willing divorced in November 1909. Compounding the scandal of their divorce was Astor's announcement that he would remarry. At the age of 47, Astor married 18-year-old socialite Madeleine Talmage Force, the sister of real estate businesswoman and socialite Katherine Emmons Force. Their parents were William Hurlbut Force and Katherine Arvilla Talmage. Astor and Force were married in his mother's ballroom at Beechwood, the family's Newport, Rhode Island, mansion. There was also much controversy over their 29-year age difference. His son Vincent despised Force, yet he served as best man at his father's wedding. The couple took an extended honeymoon in Europe and Egypt to wait for the gossip to calm down. Among the few Americans who did not spurn him at this time was Margaret Brown, later fictionalized as The Unsinkable Molly Brown. She accompanied the Astors to Egypt and France. After receiving a call to return to the United States, Brown accompanied the couple back home aboard . ===Residence=== Ferncliff, the Astor family's country estate in Rhinebeck, New York Astor's country estate, Ferncliff, was north of the town center in Rhinebeck, New York, with a mile and a half of Hudson River frontage in the picturesque Lower Hudson River Valley. The land had been purchased piecemeal by his father during the mid 19th century. Astor was born there. His father's Italianate mansion of 1864 was partly rebuilt in 1904 to designs by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White. The house retained its conservative exterior, and a separate sports pavilion in the Louis XVI style was built. This was Stanford White's last project before he died. The \\"Ferncliff Casino\\" sports pavilion (later called \\"Astor Courts\\") reportedly housed the first residential indoor swimming pool in the U.S., an indoor tennis court with vaulting of Guastavino tile, two squash courts, and guest bedrooms. On the lower level, there was a bowling alley and a shooting range. The estate, reduced to and renamed \\"Astor Courts\\", eventually became a wedding venue. Chelsea Clinton had her wedding there on July 31, 2010. ==Titanic== The New York Herald report of the sinking of Titanic. Most reports featured the Astors in the headlines. Astor with his wife, Madeleine Force Astor, and their Airedale, Kitty. While traveling, Madeleine Force Astor became pregnant. Wanting the child born in the U.S., the Astors boarded Titanic on her maiden voyage to New York. They embarked in Cherbourg, France, in first class and were the wealthiest passengers aboard. Accompanying the Astors were Astor's valet, Victor Robbins; Force's maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Louise Endres. They also took their pet Airedale, Kitty. The Astors were deeply fond of their dog and had come close to losing her on a previous trip when she went missing in Egypt. Kitty did not survive the sinking. A short while after Titanic hit the iceberg that caused her to sink, Astor informed his wife of the collision but told her the damage did not appear to be serious. Some time later, as the ship's lifeboats for first class were being manned, Astor remained unperturbed; he and his family played with the mechanical horses in the gymnasium. At some point Astor is thought to have sliced the lining of an extra lifebelt with a pen knife to show his wife its contents, either to prove they were not of use or to reassure her that they were. He even declared: \\"We are safer here than in that little boat.\\" When Second Officer Charles Lightoller later arrived on A Deck to finish loading Lifeboat 4, Astor helped his wife, with her maid and nurse, into it. He then asked if he might join his wife because she was in \\"a delicate condition;\\" however, Lightoller told him men were not to be allowed to board until all the women and children had been loaded. According to Titanic passenger Archibald Gracie IV, \\"She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, \\"No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.\\" Mr. Astor then said (something to the effect of) \\"Well, tell me the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards\\" and was told \\"Number 4.\\" A news article posted in the Chicago Record Herald tells of Astor placing his wife into the final lifeboat then ordering Ida Sophia Hippach and her 17-year-old daughter Jean Gertrude to take the final two places before the boat set sail. After Lifeboat 4 was lowered at 1:55 am, Astor is said to have stood alone while others tried to free the remaining collapsible boats; he was last seen alive on the starboard bridge wing, smoking a cigarette with Jacques Futrelle. A mere half hour later, the ship disappeared beneath the ocean. Madeleine Force Astor, her nurse, and her maid survived. Colonel Astor, his valet, Victor Robbins, and Futrelle did not. In the aftermath, ships were sent out to retrieve the bodies from the site of the sinking; of the 1,517 passengers and crew who perished in the sinking, only 333 bodies were ever recovered. Astor's body was recovered on April 22 by the cable ship . Astor was identified by the initials sewn on the label of his jacket. Among the items found on him was a gold pocket watch, which his son Vincent claimed and wore the rest of his life. In his memoir, Gracie claims that Astor's body was recovered in a crushed condition. This led to popular belief that Astor was killed by the first funnel falling from the ship.National Geographic, December 1985, Vol. 168, No.6 page 712 However, two crew-members on the Mackay Bennett, and Captain Richard Roberts, the commander of Astor's yacht, said that apart from some slight discolouration by water, Astor's body was pristine. Survivor Philip Mock was quoted as claiming to have seen Astor in the water clinging to a raft with William Thomas Stead. \\"Their feet became frozen,\\" said Mock, \\"and they were forced to release their hold. Both were drowned.\\" Astor was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan, New York City. Four months after Titanic sank, Madeleine Astor gave birth to his second son, John Jacob \\"Jakey\\" Astor VI. ==Estate== 840 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan Beechwood, the Astors' summer home in Newport, Rhode Island Astor left $69 million of his $85 million estate (equivalent to approximately $1.75 billion in 2017 dollars) to Vincent. This value included his Ferncliff country estate in Rhinebeck, New York, and his yacht, the Noma. To Madeleine Force Astor, he left $100,000 as an outright bequest, as well as a $5 million trust fund from which she was provided an income. Additionally, she was given the use of his New York City mansion (840 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan) and all its furnishings, his Newport mansion (Beechwood) and all its furnishings, the pick of whichever luxury limousine she wanted from his collection, and five of his prized horses‚Äîas long as she did not remarry. His daughter Ava (who lived with her mother, also named Ava) received a $10 million trust fund. Upon turning 21, John Jacob VI inherited the $3 million trust fund Astor had set aside for him. ==Legacy== According to Walter Lord, \\"After [the Titanic] sank, the New York American broke the news on April 16 with a lead devoted almost entirely to John Jacob Astor; at the end it mentioned that 1800 others were also lost.\\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ice-so-funny/ Astor's prominence led to the creation of many exaggerated and unsubstantiated accounts about his actions during the sinking of the Titanic. One story alleges that he opened the ship's kennel and released the dogs, including his own beloved Airedale, Kitty; in another, he placed a woman's hat on a boy to make sure the child was able to get into a lifeboat. Another legend claims that after the ship hit the iceberg, he quipped, \\"I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous.\\" These stories appeared in newspapers, magazines, and even books about the sinking. In reality, none of the claims about Astor's actions were substantiated, as nobody who recognized him survived other than the women who boarded lifeboats relatively early on. Wade wrote that the ice joke is almost certainly apocryphal, as Astor was not known for making jokes, and that the story about the hat (like many other \\"survivor stories\\" published shortly after the sinking) may have been invented by the reporter. ==In popular culture== Astor's fame has made him a frequent character in media, literary, and stage works, especially in stories about the Titanic. German actor Karl Sch√∂nb√∂ck played Astor in the 1943 Nazi propaganda film Titanic. William Johnstone played Astor in the 1953 film Titanic, and in the 1997 version of Titanic he was played by Eric Braeden. In the 1996 miniseries, he was played by Canadian- born actor Scott Hylands. Astor was also portrayed by David Janssen in the 1979 film S.O.S. Titanic. Perennially, in the town of Astoria, Oregon (so named for Astor's patrilineal great-grandfather), he is portrayed by a local amateur actor in street corner vignettes. He was played by Miles Richardson in the 2012 Titanic miniseries. Astor was portrayed by his great-grandson Gregory Todd Astor in an April 2012 production of Titanic: The Musical. Astor also makes a brief character appearance in a late episode of The Alienist, a limited TNT/Netflix series (2018) based on the novel by Caleb Carr. The scene shows a pre-Titanic 'Jack Astor' greeting a principal character at an 1896 staging of Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. There is also a chain of restaurants throughout Canada called \\"Jack Astor's\\" named after his nickname Jack Astor. ==References* * * Funeral of Col.

Wood first came to prominence as a 20-year-old rookie when he recorded 20 strikeouts in a one-hit shutout against the Houston Astros, which some have argued may be the greatest single-game pitching performance in MLB history. The game also made Wood the co-holder of the MLB record for strikeouts in a single game (20), and earned Wood the nickname Kid K. He was later named the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year. Wood would go on to record over 200 strikeouts in four out of his first five seasons, with a high of 266 in 2003, and holds several MLB strikeout records. Though he struggled with injuries throughout his career, Wood was twice named an All-Star. Wood transitioned to a relief pitcher in 2007 due to continued struggles with injuries, ultimately reviving his career as a closer. During his career Wood was placed on the disabled list 14 times in 14 major league seasons, which included missing the entire 1999 season due to Tommy John surgery. After a slow start to the 2012 season, Wood retired on May 18, 2012. ==Early life== Wood attended MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, for his first three seasons of high school baseball. He continued his education at Grand Prairie High School for his final season as a high school player. Wood was high school teammates with Kevin Walker. He initially committed to play college baseball at McLennan Community College in Waco. ==Professional career==  ====1995‚Äì1997==== The Chicago Cubs drafted Wood as the fourth overall selection in the 1995 Amateur Draft. He spent three years playing in the minor leagues. His best season in the minors came in 1996, when he posted a 10‚Äì2 record for the Daytona Cubs. He also played for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. In 1997, he led all minor league pitchers in walks, with 131. ====1998==== Wood made his first appearance in the major leagues on April 12, 1998. In his fifth career start, on May 6, he threw a one-hit, no-walk, 20-strikeout shutout against the Houston Astros in Wrigley Field, tying Roger Clemens' record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and breaking Bill Gullickson's single-game rookie record of 18 strikeouts in 1980. Wood allowed only two baserunners: Ricky Guti√©rrez on an infield single and Craig Biggio who was hit by a pitch with a count of one ball and two strikes. (Biggio had led the league in that category each of the previous three years.) Only seven balls reached fair territory. The Astros went on to lead the league in on- base-percentage, and all of the regulars were in the lineup, including the four who finished the season batting over .300. The performance garnered a game score of 105 ‚Äì the highest number ever calculated for a pitcher in a nine-inning game. Wood finished the 1998 season with a 13‚Äì6 record; despite missing the last month of the season with elbow soreness, he easily won the National League Rookie of the Year award. He pitched one game in the playoffs, losing against the Atlanta Braves. ====1999‚Äì2003==== During spring training of 1999, he tore his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL). Wood underwent successful Tommy John surgery to repair damage to the UCL in his right elbow, and missed the entire 1999 season. Wood returned in 2000 and had an 8‚Äì7 record, but the following season, he returned to form. In 2001, Wood went 12‚Äì6 with a 3.36 ERA. He recorded a one-hit, 14-strikeout complete game shutout on May 25, 2001. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN200105250.shtml On Aug. 3, 2001, he struck out nine batters and gave up only one run over eight innings to defeat Chan Ho Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1 https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN200108030.shtml to extend the Cubs' lead in National League Central to 3.5 games. The following season, Wood finished 12‚Äì11 with a 3.67 ERA, and did not miss a start all year long, setting career highs with 213.6 innings pitched and 33 starts. He had 217 strikeouts in both seasons. In 2003, Wood set career highs with 266 strikeouts, 14 wins (as part of a 14‚Äì11 record), a 3.20 ERA, and two shutouts. He threw the fastest fastball in the majors among starters, averaging 95.4 miles per hour. He also walked 100 batters and surrendered 24 home runs, also career highs, but was selected as a National League All-Star and helped lead the Cubs to the playoffs as one half of \\"Chicago Heat\\" along with fellow pitcher Mark Prior. Wood earned two wins in the Divisional Series against the Atlanta Braves and was the starter in Game 3 of the 2003 National League Championship Series, which the Cubs won in extra innings. However, the Cubs lost in seven games to the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. In the decisive Game 7, Wood hit the first home run by a pitcher in an NLCS game since another Cub, Rick Sutcliffe, did so in Game 1 in 1984. However, the Marlins won the game 9-6. Wood was the losing pitcher and the Cubs were eliminated. ====2004‚Äì2006==== Wood went 8-9 during the 2004 season and was sidelined for nearly two months with a strained triceps. In 2005, Wood continued to struggle. On August 31, 2005, Wood underwent surgery and missed the remainder of the season. During Spring training in 2006, Wood suffered several injuries which required an additional surgery (on his knee). On May 18, 2006, Wood returned to the Cubs' pitching rotation when he started and lost a home game against the Washington Nationals. In June, Wood returned to the DL with a sore shoulder. The following month, the Cubs announced that Wood had sustained a partially torn rotator cuff which was likely to keep him from pitching again for the rest of the year. At the end of the 2006 season, the Cubs exercised their option on Wood's contract and bought out the remaining $13M. ====2007‚Äì2008==== With his long history of injuries and inability to stay in the starting rotation, Wood accepted the Cubs' offer to return as a relief pitcher in 2007. Wood attempted to sustain a regular throwing schedule and appearances during Spring training games. However, Wood was placed on the 15-day DL with soreness in his elbow and was then moved to the 60-day DL. Wood considered retiring if he continued to have pain in his throwing arm. He began playing catch on May 21. In his first rehab assignment in Cubs Rookie Ball, he struck out all three batters he faced. On July 24, he pitched 1 inning with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs, throwing 9 pitches. He made back-to-back appearances on July 26 and July 27, throwing his fastball between 92-94 mph with no discomfort. The Cubs activated Wood from the 60-Day Disabled List on August 3, causing many to believe that he would make his actual return on that day. In the seventh inning, however, Lou Piniella opted to send Bob Howry to the mound, and most fans, eager to see Kerry back on the hill, mistakenly gave Howry a standing ovation, only to realize moments later it was actually not Wood. Piniella later stated he wanted Wood to receive a \\"softer landing\\", or in other words, make his return in a game where the Cubs have a comfortable lead over their opponents. Wood made his return on August 5, with the Cubs trailing the New York Mets by four runs. He pitched a single inning, during which he allowed one hit, and struck out another batter. Piniella praised Wood's performance, stating \\"He threw the ball real good\\", and \\"His breaking ball had some bite to it, and he threw it up there about 93-94, about what we expected\\". He remained healthy appearing in 22 games and posting a 1-1 record with a solid 3.33 ERA. He was generally limited to one inning per outing, not appearing in games on back to back days, though he did pitch in both halves of a double header on September 15. Wood was a major contributor to the Cubs' NL Central Division Championship down the stretch in late September, earning a win and 8 holds. Wood filed for free-agency on November 11, 2007, though he suggested that he wanted to remain in pinstripes for the 2008 season. Despite multi-year offers from other teams, Wood agreed to a one-year, $4.2 million deal with the Cubs. Wood, along with Bob Howry and Carlos M√°rmol, competed for the role as the Cubs' closer after Ryan Dempster was moved to the starting rotation. After posting a 2.84 ERA in the spring, Wood won the job. He recorded his first career save April 3, 2008 with a win over the Brewers. Wood recorded 34 saves in 39 opportunities, 82 strike-outs and a 1.12 WHIP. He was selected to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game as a relief pitcher on July 6, 2008 along with six other teammates. Wood was placed on the 15-day DL on July 24, 2008 with a blister on his right index finger. On November 13, 2008, after acquiring closer Kevin Gregg from the Florida Marlins, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry announced that the organization did not plan to re-sign Wood. He had previously requested a multi-year contract with the team, but was deferred due to financial reasons. Wood stated he wished to remain with the Cubs, but also wanted to continue playing baseball. ===Cleveland Indians=== Wood pitching for the Cleveland Indians in 2010. On December 13, 2008, Wood signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. Cubs fans showed their appreciation for him by giving him a standing ovation when the Cleveland Indians played at Wrigley Field on June 19, 2009. During the 2010 season, Wood was placed on the disabled list until May 8 due to an upper back muscle strain. On July 17, 2010, Wood was placed on the disabled list for the 14th time in his major league career, this time due to a blister on his right index finger. ===New York Yankees=== Wood was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the New York Yankees on July 31, 2010 for Andrew Shive, Matt Cusick, and cash. With the Yankees, he went 2-0 with a 0.69 ERA in 24 games, including 21 straight scoreless appearances, and served as the bridge to Mariano Rivera in the 2010 postseason. During the 2010 postseason, Wood had a 2.25 ERA appearing in 7 games overall. The Yankees won the 2010 ALDS against the Minnesota Twins in 3 games but lost to the Texas Rangers in 6 games of the 2010 ALCS. The Yankees announced on October 27 that the club had declined to exercise their option for Wood for 2011. ===Second stint with the Chicago Cubs=== On December 16, 2010, Wood agreed to a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Cubs. Wood reportedly turned down offers for long-term deals from several other teams worth more money due to his desire to keep his family in Chicago. Wood re-signed with the Cubs on January 13, 2012 for a 1-year, $3 million deal with a team option for 2013. On May 18, 2012, Wood retired, striking out the only (and therefore final) batter he faced, Day√°n Viciedo of the Chicago White Sox. The fans at Wrigley Field gave Wood a long standing ovation as his son, Justin, ran out to greet him as he exited the field. On his baseball career: \\"I had fun, I had a blast\\", Wood said. \\"I wouldn't trade anything in.\\" ===MLB records=== *Fastest to reach 1,000 strikeouts in MLB history (in appearances): 134 games *Fastest to reach 1,000 strikeouts in MLB history (in innings pitched): 853 IP *Strikeouts in a 9-inning game: 20 on May 6, 1998 (tied record held by Roger Clemens. Max Scherzer tied the record in 2016.) ==Personal life== On February 13, 1999, Wood and former high school teammate Kevin Walker were ticketed for urinating in a parking lot at 1:10 a.m. in Scottsdale, Arizona. Wood missed his initial court appearance and an arrest warrant was issued. He later pleaded guilty and paid a fine of $90. Wood is married to Sarah Pates of Waukegan, Illinois. The couple has one son, Justin, and two daughters, Katie and Charlotte. Until 2008, the family resided in the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago. While playing for the Cubs, the Woods hosted a celebrity bowling tournament called Kerry Wood's Strike Zone, which also featured a silent auction that raised over $2 million. On June 24, 2013, while paddleboarding in waters in Chicago, Wood happened upon a corpse floating in Belmont Harbor. He immediately reported the grisly discovery to local authorities, who determined the deceased to be a 40-year-old man who had been reported missing by a North Side nursing home days earlier. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball single-game strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball single- inning strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball pitchers who have hit home runs in the postseason ==References== ==External links== : Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:National League All-Stars Category:National League strikeout champions Category:People from Irving, Texas Category:Grand Prairie High School alumni Category:Gulf Coast Cubs players Category:Williamsport Cubs players Category:Daytona Cubs players Category:Orlando Rays players Category:Iowa Cubs players Category:Peoria Chiefs players Category:Arizona League Cubs players Category:Tennessee Smokies players Category:Akron Aeros players ","title":"Kerry Wood"},{"id":"299813","text":"Acoustical engineering (also known as acoustic engineering) is the branch of engineering dealing with sound and vibration. It includes the application of acoustics, the science of sound and vibration, in technology. Acoustical engineers are typically concerned with the design, analysis and control of sound. One goal of acoustical engineering can be the reduction of unwanted noise, which is referred to as noise control. Unwanted noise can have significant impacts on animal and human health and well-being, reduce attainment by students in schools, and cause hearing loss. Noise control principles are implemented into technology and design in a variety of ways, including control by redesigning sound sources, the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers, suppressors, and buffer zones, and the use of hearing protection (earmuffs or earplugs). baffles inside this auditorium were installed to optimise sound projection and reproduction, key factors in acoustical engineering. But acoustical engineering is not just about noise control; it also covers positive uses of sound, from the use of ultrasound in medicine to the programming of digital sound synthesizers, and from designing a concert hall to enhance the sound of an orchestra to specifying a railway station's sound system so announcements are intelligible. == Acoustic engineer (professional) == Acoustic engineers usually possess a bachelor's degree or higher qualification in acoustics, physics or another engineering discipline. Practicing as an acoustic engineer usually requires a bachelor's degree with significant scientific and mathematical content. Acoustic engineers might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in particular fields, such as architectural acoustics, environmental noise or vibration control. In other industries, acoustic engineers might: design automobile sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design loudspeakers and microphones for mobile phones. Acousticians are also involved in researching and understanding sound scientifically. Some positions, such as faculty require a Doctor of Philosophy. In most countries, a degree in acoustics can represent the first step towards professional certification and the degree program may be certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of Chartered Engineer (in most Commonwealth countries). ==Subdisciplines== The listed subdisciplines are loosely based on the PACS (Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme) coding used by the Acoustical Society of America. ===Aeroacoustics=== Aeroacoustics is concerned with how noise is generated by the movement of air, for instance via turbulence, and how sound propagates through the fluid air. Aeroacoustics plays an important role in understanding how noise is generated by aircraft and wind turbines, as well as exploring how wind musical instruments work. ===Audio signal processing=== Audio signal processing is the electronic manipulation of audio signals using analog and digital signal processing. Audio signal processing is done for a variety of reasons such as: * to enhance a sound, for instance by applying an audio effect such as reverberation; * to remove unwanted noises from a signal, for instance echo cancellation on Skype; * to compress an audio signal to allow efficient transmission, e.g. perceptual coding in MP3 and Opus, and * to understand the content of the signal, e.g. music information retrieval to allow the identification of music tracks via Shazam (service). Audio engineers develop and use audio signal processing algorithms. ===Architectural acoustics=== Disney's Concert Hall was meticulously designed for superior acoustical qualities. Ceiling of Culture Palace (Tel Aviv) concert hall is covered with perforated metal panels Architectural acoustics (also known as building acoustics) is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building. Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live. Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.. ===Bioacoustics=== Bioacoustics usually concerns the scientific study of sound production and hearing in animals. It can include: acoustic communication and associated animal behaviour and evolution of species; how sound is produced by animals; the auditory mechanisms and neurophysiology of animals; the use of sound to monitor animal populations, and the effect of man-made noise on animals. ===Electroacoustics=== This branch of acoustic engineering deals with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, sound reproduction and recording. There has been a rapid increase in the use of portable electronic devices which can reproduce sound and rely on electroacoustic engineering, e.g. mobile phones, portable media players, and tablet computers. This term is also used for a set of electrokinetic effects that occur in heterogeneous liquids under influence of ultrasound.Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. \\"Characterization of liquids, nano- and micro- particulates and porous bodies using Ultrasound\\", Elsevier, 2017 There is International Standard that describes such electroacoustic effects in details.ISO International Standard 13099, Parts 1,2 and 3, \\"Colloidal systems ‚Äì Methods for Zeta potential determination\\", (2012) ===Environmental noise=== Woodstock, acoustic analysis is critical to creating the best experience for the audience and the performers. Environmental acoustics is concerned with the control of noise and vibrations caused by traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment, recreational activities and anything else that might be considered a nuisance. Acoustical engineers concerned with environmental acoustics face the challenge of measuring or predicting likely noise levels, determining an acceptable level for that noise, and determining how the noise can be controlled. Environmental acoustics work is usually done by acoustic consultants or those working in environmental health. Recent research work has put a strong emphasis on soundscapes, the positive use of sound (e.g. fountains, bird song), and the preservation of tranquility. ===Musical acoustics=== Musical acoustics is concerned with researching and describing the physics of music and its perception ‚Äì how sounds employed as music work. This includes: the function and design of musical instruments including electronic synthesizers; the human voice (the physics and neurophysiology of singing); computer analysis of music and composition; the clinical use of music in music therapy, and the perception and cognition of music. ===Noise control=== Noise control is a set of strategies to reduce noise pollution by reducing noise at its source, by inhibiting sound propagation using noise barriers or similar, or by the use of ear protection (earmuffs or earplugs). Control at the source is the most cost-effective way of providing noise control. Noise control engineering applied to cars and trucks is known as noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). Other techniques to reduce product noise include vibration isolation, application of acoustic absorbent and acoustic enclosures. Acoustical engineering can go beyond noise control to look at what is the best sound for a product, for instance, manipulating the sound of door closures on automobiles. ===Psychoacoustics=== Psychoacoustics tries to explain how humans respond to what they hear, whether that is an annoying noise or beautiful music. In many branches of acoustic engineering, a human listener is a final arbitrator as to whether a design is successful, for instance, whether sound localisation works in a surround sound system. \\"Psychoacoustics seeks to reconcile acoustical stimuli and all the scientific, objective, and physical properties that surround them, with the physiological and psychological responses evoked by them.\\" ===Speech=== Speech is a major area of study for acoustical engineering, including the production, processing and perception of speech. This can include physics, physiology, psychology, audio signal processing and linguistics. Speech recognition and speech synthesis are two important aspects of the machine processing of speech. Ensuring speech is transmitted intelligibly, efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through telephone systems are other important areas of study. ===Ultrasonics=== Ultrasound image of a fetus in the womb, viewed at 12 weeks of pregnancy (bidimensional- scan)Ultrasonics deals with sound waves in solids, liquids and gases at frequencies too high to be heard by the average person. Specialists areas include medical ultrasonics (including medical ultrasonography), sonochemistry, nondestructive testing, material characterisation and underwater acoustics (sonar). ===Underwater acoustics=== Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of sound in water. It is concerned with both natural and man-made sound and its generation underwater; how it propagates, and the perception of the sound by animals. Applications include sonar to locate submerged objects such as submarines, underwater communication by animals, observation of sea temperatures for climate change monitoring, and marine biology. ===Vibration and dynamics=== Acoustic engineers working on vibration study the motions and interactions of mechanical systems with their environments, including measurement, analysis and control. This might include: ground vibrations from railways and construction; vibration isolation to reduce noise getting into recording studios; studying the effects of vibration on humans (vibration white finger); vibration control to protect a bridge from earthquakes, or modelling the propagation of structure-borne sound through buildings. ==Fundamental science== Although the way in which sound interacts with its surroundings is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound wave behaviours that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design. Complex sound wave behaviors include absorption, reverberation, diffraction, and refraction. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy. Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material.Barron, 2002, ch. 7.1. Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces. In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces in the path of the waves. This bending is known as diffraction. Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending. This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave. Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves.Hemond, 1983, pp. 24‚Äì44. Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications. == Associations == *Acoustical Society of America Technical Committee on Engineering Acoustics *Audio Engineering Society *Australian Acoustical Society *Canadian Acoustical Association * Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences * Institute of Acoustics (United Kingdom) == See also == *Audio Engineering *:Category:Acoustical engineers *:Category:Audio engineers ==References== *Barron, R.

detachable chairlift grip (note, the chair is on a storage rail). This type of grip is a \\"Doppelmayr Spring grip\\", and can be seen on Doppelmayr detachable quads built between 1985 and 1995. Boarding, riding and maintenance of various detachable chairlifts from Doppelmayr in Vorarlberg, Austria A detachable chairlift or high-speed chairlift is a type of passenger aerial lift, which, like a fixed-grip chairlift, consists of numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire rope (called a haul rope) that is strung between two (or more) terminals over intermediate towers. They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts. Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation. The significance of detachable chairlift technology is primarily the speed and capacity. Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren, averaging 1,000 feet per minute (11.3 mph, 18 km/h, 5.08 m/s) versus a typical fixed-grip speed of 500 ft/min (5.6 mph, 9 km/h, 2.54 m/s). Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load, each chair is connected to the cable by a powerful spring-loaded cable grip which detaches at terminals, allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min (2 mph, 4 km/h, 1 m/s), a speed slower even than fixed- grip bunny chairlifts. Another advantage of detaching chairs is the ability to remove chairs during severe weather in order to reduce stress on the rope and towers. Furthermore, operating the unladen rope during extreme weather is effective at preventing‚Äîor greatly reducing‚Äîice and snow accumulation on the sheaves and rope. This saves considerable time, expense and hazard when opening the chair for operation, which would otherwise require workers to climb each tower and chip away ice and shovel snow. Chairlifts are made in a variety of sizes, carrying from 1 to 8 passengers. All chairs on a given chairlift usually have the same capacity. Slang terms for the different sizes include \\"single\\", \\"double\\", \\"triple\\", \\"quad\\", \\"six pack\\", and \\"eight\\". Detachable chairlifts may also be described as \\"high speed\\" or \\"express\\", which results in terms such as \\"high speed six pack\\" and \\"express quad\\". Some detachable chairlifts have so-called bubble chairs, which add a retractable acrylic glass dome to protect passengers from weather. An alternative system for reconciling slow boarding speeds with fast rope speeds is the carpet lift: the chairs move at full speed even through the terminal. Boarding passengers are progressively accelerated on a system of conveyor belts of carpet-like material until nearly matching the chair speed. On Sunday, 26 December 2004, Lech am Arlberg and Schr√∂cken in the Bregenzerwald, became the first chairlifts to have heated seats when five Doppelmayr detachable chairlifts offer skiers the added luxury of a warm seat on the uphill trip. ==History== Doppelmayr (North America) built the first detachable quad chair in the world, the Quicksilver SuperChair, in 1981 at Breckenridge, CO. This chair was later replaced by the Quicksilver Super6, a detachable six person chairlift, by Poma in 1999. Von Roll Habegger installed the \\"Adirondack Express\\", a high-speed triple, the only lift of its kind in the Eastern US, at Gore Mountain, NY in 1984. Then Poma built the first chairlift that went 1,100 feet per minute, the Green Mountain Express, at Sugarbush Resort, VT in 1990. ===Doppelmayr=== The detachable chairlift didn't start with a chairlift, rather, it started with the Platter lift in 1908, as the sticks left the cable and attached when someone loaded onto the stick. A detachable two person chairlift called White Lady was installed in Cairngorm Mountain, Scotland in 1961. In 1981, the first ever high speed detachable quad in the world was installed, the Doppelmayr- built Quicksilver SuperChair at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado. This lift was relocated in 1999 to the Owl's Head Ski area in Quebec. This lift lasted for 38 total winter seasons in two countries and was removed in 2019. This first detachable chairlift was followed by a Doppelmayr detachable triple chair at Mt Bachelor in Oregon in 1983 and two detachable quads at Mt Buller, Victoria, Australia in 1984.From Australian Ski Lift Directory, Mt Buller section. https://www.australianmountains.com/australianskilifts/#9 Until 1985, Quicksilver was also the only detachable quad in Colorado when Vail Ski Resort installed four Doppelmayr high speed quads. In 1988, Vail Ski Resort opened up Orient Express Lift #21, which was the first Doppelmayr chairlift in the U.S. to have rectangular tower heads. The Orient Express was also the first Doppelmayr chairlift in the U.S. to have 800 horsepower. The original grip was slightly modified later before the Vail quads were built. Known as the Spring Series, these grips were known as DS-104 grips on high speed quads and DS-108s on eight passenger gondolas. In 1995, a newer grip was introduced called the Torsion series. Torsion grips were called DT-104 if on a high speed quad, DT-106 on a high speed six pack, or DT-108 on an eight-passenger gondola. The Torsion grip is still made today as Doppelmayr (North America)'s primary grip option. Unlike Poma's grips, Doppelmayr grips are double position grips. When the chair enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed down by a metal strip, which opens a grip jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. Grip clamping force is measured just prior to the double position grips reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal. The original terminals on the Quicksilver Quad were all completely enclosed, but in 1985, in time for the Vail Ski Resort high speed quads, the terminal design changed to what is now classified as a CLD-260 terminal. These and the older terminals were the only types of terminals to use chains instead of tires for contours. In 1989, the old design was officially retired with the addition of the Avanti high speed quad at Vail, and a new design, called the UNI, was introduced. This design was utilized from 1989 to the last year of the DS-104 grip in 1994. In 1992, the design was changed slightly mainly in the entry funnels area. With the introduction of the Torsion series came the UNI-M terminal, which underwent a number of minor cosmetic changes between 1995 and 2002. Currently, two options are offered, the UNI-G terminal, and the UNI-GS terminal, which can be distinguished through the appearance of the end windows. The first UNI-GS chairlift, Panorama, debuted in 2003 at Gunstock Mountain Resort. ===Poma=== Poma entered this market within two to three years of the (Quicksilver Superchair's) installation. Although hard to prove, the earliest known Poma quads are from circa 1985, such as the (Coney Glade) at Snowmass, the (Liberator Express) at Mission Ridge (installed in 2005, formally known as (Summit Express), ran at Winter Park Resort from 1985 to 2005), and others. Many of the original high speed quads they built were known as Alpha Evolution lifts, because they utilized a Performance terminal with an Alpha drive unit at the far end. These early chairlifts also had vault drives which were located under the Performance terminal. The old (Colorado Superchair) at Breckenridge Ski Resort, and the (American Flyer) at Copper Mountain are two great examples of Performance terminals with vault drives. Very few lifts exist with this style to this day. Later on, the Performance drive terminal was modified to house the bullwheel machinery inside the main terminal structure itself, eliminating the need to run the cable through the terminal. Poma was also slower at introducing tire contours over chains, and it wasn't until 1992 that tire contours were used by the company with the introduction of the Challenger terminal. This terminal would undergo changes with the windows before officially retired in 1998. At that time, the new Omega T-Grip came out and a new terminal known as the Phatboy (homophone and pronounced Fat-Boy) was introduced for it. It was replaced by a newer variant that mainly modified the windows on the ends in 2003. Unlike Doppelmayr, the Poma grips are single position. In such method, they are pressed down, which opens the jaws to detach the chair, and then the jaws close and the spring is released. The process is reversed for attachment. This design allows grip force to be measured as the grip travels through the contour, and for the lift to come to a stop before the grip is reattached to the haul rope if insufficient grip force is detected. Unlike Doppelmayr lifts that check grip force while a grip and carrier are leaving the terminal, most Poma detachable lifts are not built to operate in reverse because a grip force failed grip can be brought to a halt within the terminal. Poma is also known for building some very unusual lifts, mostly at Breckenridge Ski Resort, which include North America's only double loading chairlift (Quicksilver Super6), the first high speed lift in Colorado with a midway load (Peak 8 SuperConnect), and the highest lift in North America (Imperial Express SuperChair) at 12,840 feet and highest high speed six pack in North America (Kensho SuperChair) at . ===CTEC/Garaventa CTEC=== Eagle express at Solitude Mountain Resort. CTEC built their first Detachable in 1989 at Solitude Mountain Resort (named the Eagle express). In building this lift they did a rare partnership with Von Roll for their detachable technology. This also happened to be the first detachable quad in Utah. From 1990 on they partnered with Garaventa for their detachable technology before they merged in 1992. They have built detachable lifts at many resorts, such as Grand Targhee, Stevens Pass, Deer Valley, Park City, Snowbird, Alta, Squaw Valley, Stratton, and Attitash. They constructed lifts until 2002 when they merged with Doppelmayr. Some Garaventa designs are used to this day.Doppelmayr CTEC Identification sheet Retrieved 12 June 2018. ==Present== ===Leitner-Poma=== Leitner-Poma is the present day version of Poma, as joint venture in the United States. In Europe, Poma and Leitner operate as separate ventures. They discontinue to make these types of detachable products such as their Arceaux Carrier, Arceaux version 2 Carrier, Performance Terminal, Challenger Terminal, Competition Terminal, Leitner Grip, Omega Terminal, and Omega grip. Now, Leitner-Poma has created an improved omega carrier, along with the new LPA grip, and new version of the omega terminal. Leitner-Poma has good relationships with Breckenridge Ski Resort, Vail Ski Resort, Winter Park Resort, Snowmass (ski area), Aspen Mountain, Buttermilk, Aspen Highlands, Okemo, Mount Snow, Sugarbush Resort and many other ski resorts. ===Doppelmayr=== Doppelmayr (North America), formally known as Doppelmayr CTEC is the merger of CTEC, Garaventa, and Doppelmayr globally, continue to make Garaventa and Dopplemayr Carriers, their UNI-GS/UNI-G (Europe) terminals, and the Torsion grip today. Doppelmayr in the U.S. is starting to fade out the Garaventa carriers, and replacing them with Doppelmayr EJ carriers. Doppelmayr is known for building the first high speed quad, building the first 8-passenger gondola at Steamboat Ski Resort and having a good relationship with Big Sky Resort, Vail Ski Resort, Beaver Creek Resort, Steamboat Ski Resort, and many other ski resorts. ==See also== *List of aerial lift manufacturers *Skiing ==References== ==External links== *Explanation of how a detachable chairlift works *Collection of information on ski lifts around the world *Skilifts.org - A website devoted to aerial and surface lifts in North America *A list of all the components that Leitner and Poma made.

His father, who had been a balloon pilot in World War I, was a mechanical engineer who specialized in rotational dynamics. In 1932 the family moved to Worcester, Massachusetts when his father became employed at the Norton company. As a child Whitcomb was fascinated by airplanes; he built models and flew them in competitions, always striving to improve their performance. He graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1943 with a BS in aeronautical engineering. He was employed at the Langley Research Center operated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and its successor, NASA. ==Career== April 1955: Whitcomb examines a model aircraft designed in accordance with his area rule. ===Area rule=== After World War II, NACA research began to focus on near-sonic and low-supersonic airflow. After considering the sudden drag increase which a wing-fuselage combination experiences at somewhere around , Whitcomb concluded that \\"the disturbances and shock waves are simply a function of the longitudinal variation of the cross-sectional area\\" ‚Äì that is, the effect of the wings could be visualized as equivalent to a fuselage with a sort of midriff bulge whose frontal area was the same as that of the wings. Since the wings could not be dispensed with in the actual case, the alternate to removing the \\"bulge\\" would be to decrease the fuselage's cross-section near the wings. This became known as the area rule, which allowed a significant reduction in the drag felt by airplanes near the speed of sound. Its impact on aircraft design was immediate: the prototype Convair YF-102, for example, was found not to be capable of exceeding the speed of sound in level flight. This was rectified by re-sculpting the fuselage. For his insight, Whitcomb won the Collier Trophy in 1954.The Collier Trophy citation reads \\" ... for the greatest achievement in aviation in America.\\" In 1958 Whitcomb was named head of Langley's transonic aerodynamics branch, and he began working on a possible SST design. He built proposed models, but by 1962 he abandoned the project because of the intractable drag problem. Casting about for other research, he returned to the question of transonic drag, especially on wings. ===Supercritical airfoil=== To achieve reduced drag in the transonic phase, Whitcomb realized that the wing's pressure distribution must be modified to delay and weaken the shock wave created on the upper surface where the high- velocity flow decelerated to subsonic. Using intuition rather than mathematics, he built a chord wing section and tested it repeatedly in the Langley high-speed wind tunnel, adding (with auto body putty) or removing (with a file and sandpaper) material until the desired flows were achieved. Although a low-drag airfoil (in the transonic range) was thus produced, Whitcomb's superiors observed that not every aircraft manufacturer could be expected to use file and sandpaper to design the needed shapes. Therefore, NASA signed a contract with the Courant Institute at New York University, whose mathematician Paul Garabedian and aerodynamicist Anthony Jameson worked with Whitcomb to develop a practical computational method for designing supercriticalThe term was coined by Whitcomb. airfoils - those that were most efficient in the transonic range. Using this method, supercritical wings were fabricated and proven on full-scale aircraft; in 1971 a Vought F-8 Crusader, and in 1973 a General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, were flown at the NASA Flight Research Center in California. For his contribution, NASA awarded Whitcomb a $25,000 prize, and he received the 1974 Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association. The unusual airfoil unexpectedly aided general aviation as well; its rather blunt leading edge allowed it to generate high lift coefficients before stalling, and Whitcomb published a low-speed airfoil which he called GA(W)-1;General Aviation - Whitcomb it is now routinely used in light aircraft and gliders. Following his research on wings, Whitcomb again turned to a possible complete supercritical aircraft, and in 1971 he published preliminary details of a near-sonic transport (NST), which he predicted could attain a relatively efficient cruise at 0.98 Mach. As with his supercritical wing efforts, he had largely developed the design in the wind tunnel, shaping his proposed model with putty and knife until the various secondary shocks created by wing-body intersections were muted as much as possible. Whitcomb's NST proposal was not advanced beyond his concept stage. ===Winglets=== Aerodynamicists had known for decades that some sort of wingtip barrier could reduce wingtip vortices, and thus the drag. However, Whitcomb was apparently the first to conclude that such a barrier would be most efficient if it took the form of a supplementary vertical (or near-vertical) wing. He proposed his results, showing improvements on the order of 5 percent, but industry was slow to adopt. It took nearly three decades for his proposals to become commonplace; they now are routinely used on aircraft from airliners to gliders. ==Later life== Following his groundbreaking research on transonic airflow, Whitcomb spent several years moving in an entirely different field - the possible extraction of usable energy from the environment by employing possible avenues of quantum physics. However, these investigations bore no result, and in 1980 he suddenly announced his decision to retire from Langley. Whitcomb continued to serve as a consultant to the aviation industry when asked. He continued to live in an apartment building in Hampton, Virginia, his residence since 1943. He had never married, but for 25 years was close to a NASA mathematician, Barbara Durling. She died in 2001. Whitcomb died in Newport News, Virginia in 2009. ==Awards and honors== * Collier Trophy of the National Aeronautic Association (1954) * USAF Exceptional Service Medal (1955) * NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1956) * ASA Exceptional Scientific Service Medal (1959) * National Medal of Science in engineering (1973) * Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy of the National Aeronautic Association (1974) * Member National Academy of Engineering (1976) * Howard N.

It has been applied to a wide range of research topics,Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. & van der Helm, P. A. (2013). Structural information theory: The simplicity of visual form. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, data visualization, and music perception. SIT began as a quantitative model of visual pattern classification. Nowadays, it includes quantitative models of symmetry perception and amodal completion, and is theoretically sustained by a perceptually adequate formalization of visual regularity, a quantitative account of viewpoint dependencies, and a powerful form of neurocomputation.van der Helm, P. A. (2014). Simplicity in vision: A multidisciplinary account of perceptual organization. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. SIT has been argued to be the best defined and most successful extension of Gestalt ideas.Palmer, S. E. (1999). Vision science: Photons to phenomenology. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. It is the only Gestalt approach providing a formal calculus that generates plausible perceptual interpretations. == The simplicity principle == Although visual stimuli are fundamentally multi-interpretable, the human visual system usually has a clear preference for only one interpretation. To explain this preference, SIT introduced a formal coding model starting from the assumption that the perceptually preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one with the simplest code. A simplest code is a code with minimum information load, that is, a code that enables a reconstruction of the stimulus using a minimum number of descriptive parameters. Such a code is obtained by capturing a maximum amount of visual regularity and yields a hierarchical organization of the stimulus in terms of wholes and parts. The assumption that the visual system prefers simplest interpretations is called the simplicity principle.Hochberg, J. E., & McAlister, E. (1953). A quantitative approach to figural \\"goodness\\". Journal of Experimental Psychology, 46, 361‚Äî364. Historically, the simplicity principle is an information-theoretical translation of the Gestalt law of Pr√§gnanz,Koffka, K. (1935). Principles of gestalt psychology. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. which was inspired by the natural tendency of physical systems to settle into relatively stable states defined by a minimum of free-energy. Furthermore, just as the later-proposed minimum description length principle in algorithmic information theory (AIT), a.k.a. the theory of Kolmogorov complexity, it can be seen as a formalization of Occam's Razor, according to which the simplest interpretation of data is the best one. == Structural versus algorithmic information theory == Since the 1960s, SIT (in psychology) and AIT (in computer science) evolved independently as viable alternatives for Shannon's classical information theory which had been developed in communication theory.Shannon, C. E. (1948). A mathematical theory of communication. Bell System Technical Journal, 27, 379-423, 623‚Äî656. In Shannon's approach, things are assigned codes with lengths based on their probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence (as, e.g., in the Morse code). However, in many domains, including perception, such probabilities are hardly quantifiable, if at all. Both SIT and AIT circumvent this problem by turning to descriptive complexities of individual things. Although SIT and AIT share many starting points and objectives, there are also several relevant differences: * SIT makes the perceptually relevant distinction between structural and metrical information, whereas AIT does not. * SIT encodes for a restricted set of perceptually relevant kinds of regularities, whereas AIT encodes for any imaginable regularity. * In SIT, the relevant outcome of an encoding is a hierarchical organization, whereas in AIT, it is only a complexity value. == Simplicity versus likelihood == In visual perception research, the simplicity principle contrasts with the Helmholtzian likelihood principle,von Helmholtz, H. L. F. (1962). Treatise on Physiological Optics (J. P. C. Southall, Trans.). New York: Dover. (Original work published 1909) which assumes that the preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one most likely to be true in this world. As shown within a Bayesian framework and using AIT findings, the simplicity principle would imply that perceptual interpretations are fairly veridical (i.e., truthful) in many worlds rather than, as assumed by the likelihood principle, highly veridical in only one world.van der Helm, P. A. (2000). Simplicity versus likelihood in visual perception: From surprisals to precisals. Psychological Bulletin, 126, 770‚Äî800. doi:10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770. In other words, whereas the likelihood principle suggests that the visual system is a special-purpose system (i.e., adapted to one specific world), the simplicity principle suggests that it is a general-purpose system (i.e., adaptive to many different worlds). Crucial to the latter finding is the distinction between, and integration of, viewpoint- independent and viewpoint-dependent factors in vision, as proposed in SIT's empirically successful model of amodal completion.van Lier, R. J., van der Helm, P. A., & Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1994). Integrating global and local aspects of visual occlusion. Perception, 23, 883‚Äî903. doi:10.1068/p230883. In the Bayesian framework, these factors correspond to prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, respectively. In SIT's model, however, both factors are quantified in terms of complexities, that is, complexities of objects and of their spatial relationships, respectively. This approach is consistent with neuroscientific ideas about the distinction and interaction between the ventral (\\"what\\") and dorsal (\\"where\\") streams in the brain.Ungerleider, L. G., & Mishkin, M. (1982). Two cortical visual systems. In D. J. Ingle, M. A. Goodale, & R. J. W. Mansfield (Eds.), Analysis of Visual Behavior (pp. 549‚Äî586). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. == Versus connectionism and dynamic systems theory == A representational theory like SIT seems opposite to dynamic systems theory (DST), while connectionism can be seen as something in between. That is, connectionism flirts with DST when it comes to the usage of differential equations and flirts with theories like SIT when it comes to the representation of information. In fact, the different operating bases of SIT, connectionism, and DST, correspond to what Marr called the computational, the algorithmic, and the implementational levels of description, respectively. According to Marr, these levels of description are complementary rather than opposite, thus reflecting epistemological pluralism. What SIT, connectionism, and DST have in common is that they describe nonlinear system behavior, that is, a minor change in the input may yield a major change in the output. Their complementarity expresses itself in that they focus on different aspects: * Whereas DST focuses primarily on how the state of a physical system as a whole (in this case, the brain) develops over time, both SIT and connectionism focus primarily on what a system does in terms of information processing (which, in this case, can be said to constitute cognition) and both assume that this information processing relies on interactions between pieces of information in distributed representations, that is, in networks of connected pieces of information. * Whereas connectionism focuses on concrete interaction mechanisms (i.c., activation spreading) in a prefixed network that is assumed to be suited for many inputs, SIT focuses on the nature of the outcome of interactions that are assumed to take place in transient, input-dependent, networks. == Modeling principles == In SIT's formal coding model, candidate interpretations of a stimulus are represented by symbol strings, in which identical symbols refer to identical perceptual primitives (e.g., blobs or edges). Every substring of such a string represents a spatially contiguous part of an interpretation, so that the entire string can be read as a reconstruction recipe for the interpretation and, thereby, for the stimulus. These strings then are encoded (i.e., they are searched for visual regularities) to find the interpretation with the simplest code. This encoding is performed by way of symbol manipulation, which, in psychology, has led to critical statements of the sort of \\"SIT assumes that the brain performs symbol manipulation\\". Such statements, however, fall in the same category as statements such as \\"physics assumes that nature applies formulas such as Einstein's E=mc2 or Newton's F=ma\\" and \\"DST models assume that dynamic systems apply differential equations\\". That is, these statements ignore that the very concept of formalization means that potentially relevant things are represented by symbols‚Äînot as a goal in itself but as a means to capture potentially relevant relationships between these things. == Visual regularity == To obtain simplest codes, SIT applies coding rules that capture the kinds of regularity called iteration, symmetry, and alternation. These have been shown to be the only regularities that satisfy the formal criteria of (a) being holographic regularities that (b) allow for hierarchically transparent codes.van der Helm, P. A., & Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1991). Accessibility, a criterion for regularity and hierarchy in visual pattern codes. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 35, 151‚Äî213. doi:10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O. A crucial difference with respect to the traditionally considered transformational formalization of visual regularity is that, holographically, mirror symmetry is composed of many relationships between symmetry pairs rather than one relationship between symmetry halves. Whereas the transformational characterization may be suited better for object recognition, the holographic characterization seems more consistent with the buildup of mental representations in object perception. The perceptual relevance of the criteria of holography and transparency has been verified in the holographic approach to visual regularity.van der Helm, P. A., & Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1996). Goodness of visual regularities: A nontransformational approach. Psychological Review, 103, 429‚Äî456. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429. This approach provides an empirically successful model of the detectability of single and combined visual regularities, whether or not perturbed by noise. For instance, it explains that mirror symmetries and Glass pattens are about equally detectable and usually better detectable than repetitions. It also explains that the detectability of mirror symmetries and Glass pattens in the presence of noise follows a psychophysical law that improves on Weber's law.van der Helm, P. A. (2010).

It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust. A baguette has a diameter of about and a usual length of about , although a baguette can be up to long. ==History== Much of the history of the baguette is speculation; however, some facts can be established. Long, stick-like breads in France became more popular during the 18th century, French bakers started using \\"gruau\\", a highly refined Hungarian high-milled flour in the early 19th century, Viennese steam oven baking was introduced to Paris in 1839 by August Zang, and the Austrian 's compact yeast in 1867 at the Universal Exposition. Finally, the word \\"baguette\\" appears, to define a particular type of bread, in a regulation of the department of the Seine in August 1920: \\"The baguette, having a minimum weight of and a maximum length of , may not be sold for a price higher than 0.35 francs apiece\\" No one of these events constitutes \\"the invention of the baguette\\", but together they define the modern \\"baguette\\". In summary, \\"the bread which became known as the baguette first appeared in its most primitive form in the eighteenth century, then experienced a number of refinements and variations before being (officially) given that name in 1920.\\" The word baguette simply means \\"wand\\", \\"baton\\" or \\"stick\\", as in baguette magique (magic wand), baguettes chinoises (chopsticks), or baguette de direction (conductor's baton). It is first recorded as a kind of bread in 1920. Outside France, the baguette is often considered a symbol of French culture, but the association of France with long loaves long predates it. Long, wide, loaves had been made since the time of King Louis XIV, long thin ones since the mid-18th century, and by the 19th century, some were far longer than today's baguette: \\"... loaves of bread long that look like crowbars!\\" \\"Housemaids were hurrying homewards with their purchases for various Gallic breakfasts, and the long sticks of bread, a yard or two [ to ] in length, carried under their arms, made an odd impression upon me.\\" A less direct link can be made with deck or steam ovens. These combine of a gas-fired traditional oven and a brick oven, a thick \\"deck\\" of stone or firebrick heated by natural gas instead of wood. The first steam oven was brought to Paris in the early 19th century by August Zang, who also introduced Vienna bread (pain viennois) and the croissant, and whom some French sources thus credit with originating the baguette. Deck ovens heated to over use steam injection to allow the crust to expand before setting, thus creating a lighter, airier loaf, and to melt the dextrose on the bread's surface, giving a slightly glazed effect. In April 1944, a competition called Le Grand Prix de la Baguette began in France to determine who made the best baguettes. Nearly 200 bakers compete each year in front of a 14-judge panel following strict guidelines. They are judged based on baking, appearance, smell, taste, and crumb. The winner receives 4000‚Ç¨ and supplies France's president their daily bread for the duration of that year, until a new winner is chosen. Following the World Wars, French bakers began baking a whiter, softer baguette that contrasted with the darker loaves produced because of rationing during the wars. These doughs took less time to ferment and used more additives, but had significantly less taste. They also began using pre-made dough and molds. The average consumption of bread fell from 600 grams/day in the early 1900s to 170 grams/day in 1986. In 1993, France passed Le D√©cret Pain (The Bread Decree). Le D√©cret Pain states that breads under the name of pain maison (homemade bread) must be \\"fully kneeded, shaped, and baked at their place of sale.\\" This Decree also placed strict guidelines on what pain traditionnel fran√ßais (traditional French bread) is allowed to be made of, banning pre-made dough from being used for traditional French baguettes. === Origin Myths === Because the history of the French baguette isn't completely known, several myths have spread about the origins of this type of bread. Some say Napoleon Bonaparte in essence created the French baguette in order to allow soldiers to more easily be able to carry bread with them. Since the round shape of other breads took up a lot of space, Bonaparte requested they be made into the skinny stick shape with specific measurements to be able to slide into the soldiers' uniform. Other stories credit baguettes as being an invention to stop French metro workers from having to carry knives that they used to cut their bread. The workers often fought, so the management did not want them to be carrying knives and requested for bread to be easily ripped apart, ending the need for knives. The skinny, easily-rippable shape of a baguette would have been the response to this. Some believe baguettes were the \\"Bread of Equality\\" following a decree post-French Revolution requiring a type of bread to be made accessible to both the rich and poor. Another account states that in October 1920 a law prevented bakers from working before 4 am, making it impossible to make traditional round loaves in time for customers' breakfasts. Switching from the round loaf to the previously less-common, slender shape of the baguette solved the problem, because it could be prepared and baked much more quickly. The law in question appears to be one from March 1919, though some say it took effect in October 1920: > It is forbidden to employ workers at bread and pastry making between ten in > the evening and four in the morning.Bulletin des Lois de la R√©publique > Fran√ßaise ‚Äì Nouvelle S√©rie ‚Äì Ann√©e 1919 T.XI:241‚Äì264 B. No. 246 (p. 769) ‚Äì > No. 13950 ==Manufacture and styles== A \\"baguette de tradition fran√ßaise\\" The \\"baguette de tradition fran√ßaise\\" is made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and common salt. It may contain up to 2% broad bean flour, up to 0.5% soya flour, and up to 0.3% wheat malt flour. Standard baguettes, baguettes ordinaires, are made with baker's yeast, artisan-style loaves are usually made with a pre-ferment (poolish) to increase flavor complexity and other characteristics, and may include whole-wheat flour, or other grains such as rye. ears of wheat or wheat stalks prior to baking. Baguettes are closely connected to France, though they are made around the world. In France, not all long loaves are baguettes; for example, a short, almost rugby ball-shaped loaf is a b√¢tard (literally, bastard), or a \\"torpedo loaf\\" in English; its origin is variously explained, but undocumented. Another tubular shaped loaf is known as a fl√ªte, also known in the United States as a parisienne. Fl√ªtes closely resemble baguettes but are about twice the size. A thinner loaf is called a ficelle (string). A short baguette is sometimes known as a baton (stick), or in the UK referred to using the English translation French stick. None of these are officially defined, either legally or, for instance, in major dictionaries, any more than the baguette. French breads are also made in forms such as a miche, which is a large pan loaf, and a boule, literally ball in French, a large round loaf. Sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as demi-baguettes or tiers. Italian baguettes, or baguette italienne, involves more spices and a denser texture, giving the baguette a slightly different, more Italian, taste. Un pain vennois is much sweeter and softer than the standard baguette. A baker prepares baguettes for baking In France, a baguette typically weighs around , a b√¢tard and a ficelle ; no legal text actually establishes any of these weights, which can vary throughout the country. Baguettes, either relatively short single- serving size or cut from a longer loaf, are very often used for sandwiches, usually of the submarine sandwich type, but also a panini. They are often sliced and served with p√¢t√© or cheese. As part of the traditional continental breakfast in France, slices of baguette are spread with butter and jam and dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate, known as tartines. Baguettes are generally made as partially free-form loaves, with the loaf formed with a series of folding and rolling motions, raised in cloth-lined baskets or in rows on a flour-impregnated towel, called a couche, and baked either directly on the hearth of a deck oven or in special perforated pans designed to hold the shape of the baguette while allowing heat through the perforations. American-style \\"French bread\\" is generally much fatter and is not baked in deck ovens, but in convection ovens. Outside France, baguettes are also made with other doughs. For example, the Vietnamese b√°nh m√¨ uses a high proportion of rice flour, while many North American bakeries make whole wheat, multigrain, and sourdough baguettes alongside French-style loaves. In addition, even classical French-style recipes vary from place to place, with some recipes adding small amounts of milk, butter, sugar, or malt extract, depending on the desired flavor and properties in the final loaf. ==See also== * B√°nh m√¨ * Breakfast roll * Ciabatta * Croissant * Cuban bread * Faluche (bread) * Hoagie roll * Marraqueta * Mitraillette * Submarine sandwich * Zapiekanka ==References== ==Further reading== * Child, Julia.

Not considering Hawaii, which has no independent municipalities, the Midwest and Upper South have the highest concentration of large consolidated city-county governments in the United States, including Indianapolis, Indiana; Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Kansas City, Kansas; and Lexington, Kentucky. Currently, the largest consolidated city-county in the United States by population is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the largest by land area is Sitka, Alaska. ==Overview== Consolidated city-counties are typically formed to address particular government challenges. Among the benefits of having a unified jurisdiction include potential cost savings, more efficiency, increased legal powers and revenue sources, and a more streamlined planning system. Most consolidated city-counties have a single chief executive that acts as both the city mayor and as the head of the county government, and a multi-district elected body that serves as both the city council and as the county legislative body. In many states, consolidated city-counties must be approved by voters. According to information compiled by former Albuquerque mayor David Rusk, 105 referenda were held in the United States between 1902 and 2010 to consider proposals to consolidate cities and counties. Only 27 of these proposals were approved by voters.Kate Linebaugh, Threats to Town Halls Stir Voter Backlash, The Wall Street Journal, June 8, 2011 Wyandotte County, Kansas, uses the term \\"unified government\\" to refer to its consolidation with Kansas City, Kansas, and most of the towns within the county boundaries in which some cities and towns remain separate jurisdictions within the county. Individual sections of a metropolitan or regional municipality may retain some autonomous jurisdiction apart from the citywide government. Often, in place of another level of government, local governments form councils of governments ‚Äì essentially governmental organizations which are not empowered with any law- making or law enforcement powers. This is the case in the Atlanta metropolitan area, where the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) studies and makes recommendations on the impact of all major construction and development projects on the region, but generally cannot stop them. The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) is a true government agency of the state of Georgia, and does control some state transportation funding to the cities and counties, but otherwise has very little authority beyond this small power of the purse. The case of New York City is unique, in that the city consists of five boroughs, each of which is co-extensive with a county. Each borough, being coterminous with a county, has its own district attorney; however, county-level government is essentially non-existent as all executive and legislative power is exercised by the city government throughout the five boroughs. The city, as currently constituted, was created in 1898 when the city of New York (then comprising what would become the boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx) annexed Kings County, Queens County, and Richmond County as the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, respectively. Similar arrangements also exist in other countries. England has six \\"metropolitan counties\\" created in 1974: Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. From 1986, these metropolitan counties do not have county councils but rather joint boards for certain functions. Modern unitary authorities are similar, and are known as county boroughs in Wales. In Scotland, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are functionally \\"independent cities\\", though the term is not used. London is unique however, being a ceremonial county (officially known as Greater London) containing the 32 London boroughs. Enclaved within Greater London, the ancient City of London forms a distinct county, which today forms only a tiny part of what most consider to be London as a capital city, which takes up 607 square miles. In the Canadian province of Ontario, there exist several single-tier municipalities which serve the same sort of functions as American consolidated city-counties. One example of this is the City of Toronto, which was created in 1998 from the amalgamation of the central government and the six constituent municipalities of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (a type of regional municipality) which was originally created in 1954. In Germany, Berlin and Hamburg are both cities and states (the state of Bremen consists of the cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven). Nearly every larger city in Germany is a consolidated city-county, like Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich or Dresden; Austria, where the capital of Vienna is both a city and state; France, where the capital city of Paris has been coterminous with the d√©partement of Paris since 1968; and South Korea, where Seoul is a special city, while six other cities (Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, Incheon, and Ulsan) are metropolitan cities. Additionally, the Australian Capital Territory government in Australia performs all municipal functions of the city of Canberra, and thus functions as an integrated city-territory. Similarly, the City of Tokyo merged with the prefecture to form Tokyo metropolis in 1943. ==Balances== In nine consolidated city-county governments in the United States, the formerly independent incorporated places maintain some governmental powers. In these cities, which the United States Census Bureau calls \\"consolidated cities\\", statistics are recorded both for the entire consolidated government and for the component municipalities. A part of the consolidated government is called the \\"balance\\", which the Census Bureau defines as \\"the consolidated city minus the semi- independent incorporated places located within the consolidated city\\".Population Estimates Geography , United States Census Bureau, 2006-06-19. Retrieved 2007-09-07. These consolidated cities are: * Athens- Clarke County, Georgia * Augusta‚ÄìRichmond County, Georgia * Butte-Silver Bow County, Montana * Indianapolis-Marion County, Indiana * Jacksonville-Duval County, Florida * Kansas City-Wyandotte County, Kansas * Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky * Nashville-Davidson County, Tennessee * Macon-Bibb County, Georgia ==List of consolidated city-counties== ===Consolidated since their creation=== * Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska (City and Borough are consolidated forming a unified government) * City and County of Broomfield, Colorado (Town of Broomfield incorporated June 1, 1961. Consolidated City and County of Broomfield created November 15, 2001, from the incorporated City of Broomfield in portions of Boulder, Adams, Jefferson, and Weld Counties.) * City and County of Denver, Colorado (Denver City, Colorado Territory, incorporated November 7, 1861. Denver served as the Arapahoe County seat until November 15, 1902, when Arapahoe County was split into the new Adams County and the renamed South Arapahoe County. Denver was split from the two new counties on December 1, 1902.\\"[T]he city and county of Denver ... did not come into being until the day of the issuing of the Governor's proclamation, on December 1, 1902\\". ) * City and County of Honolulu, HawaiiIndividual State Descriptions: 2012, United States Census of Governments * City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska * Los Alamos County, New Mexico (Note that the townsite known as Los Alamos is not an incorporated place.) * Menominee, Wisconsin, a town coterminous with Menominee County, Wisconsin * Town and County of Nantucket, Massachusetts (one and the same since it was separated from Dukes County, New York to join the colony of Massachusetts). In New England a town serves the same municipal functions as a city. Contrary to city‚Äìcounty consolidation, eight of Massachusetts' 14 county governments have been abolished. * City of New Orleans and Orleans Parish, Louisiana (The City of New Orleans has always served as Orleans Parish's government, though they initially were not coterminous. The city and parish have also annexed parts of neighboring Jefferson Parish.) * City and County of San Francisco, California (The City of San Francisco was the seat of San Francisco County until 1856, when the county was split into the consolidated City and County of San Francisco in the north, with the remainder of old San Francisco County becoming the new County of San Mateo.) * City and Borough of Sitka, Alaska * City and Borough of Yakutat, Alaska ===Merged=== * Anaconda and Deer Lodge County, MontanaWebsite of the Community of Anaconda * Butte and Silver Bow County, Montana * Columbus and Muscogee County, Georgia * Cusseta and Chattahoochee County, Georgia * Dahlonega and Lumpkin County, Georgia * Georgetown and Quitman County, Georgia * Hartsville and Trousdale County, Tennessee (Despite the consolidated city- county government, Hartsville is not coterminous with Trousdale County; Hartsville remains a geographically distinct municipality within the county.) * Houma and Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana (Despite the consolidated city-county government, Houma is not coterminous with Terrebonne Parish; Houma remains a geographically distinct municipality within the parish.) * Lexington and Fayette County, KentuckyWebsite of Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government * Lynchburg and Moore County, Tennessee * Macon (and Payne) with Bibb County, GeorgiaConsolidation pass for Macon and Bibb county in the 2012 vote.Consolidation of City and County Governments: Attempts in Five Cities .

The county still exists as a separate entity within Pennsylvania, but the functions of the county are generally administered by the city. * Preston and Webster County, Georgia * Statenville and Echols County, Georgia ===Other=== * New York City is coextensive with an amalgamation of five counties. Each county is coextensive with a borough of New York City: ** New York County (Borough of Manhattan) ** Bronx County (Borough of the Bronx) ** Kings County (Borough of Brooklyn) ** Richmond County (Borough of Staten Island) ** Queens County (Borough of Queens) * Washington, D.C. ‚Äì While the District of Columbia is a federal district and not a county, the city has had a consolidated municipal government since 1871. Prior to then, Washington, Georgetown, and the unincorporated County of Washington were separate jurisdictions within the District of Columbia. Prior to 1846, when it was retroceded to Virginia, the south bank of the District of Columbia was the County of Alexandria (now the independent City of Alexandria and the County of Arlington). ===Merged with some independent municipalities=== * Athens and Clarke County, Georgia (the cities of Winterville, which is entirely within Clarke County, and Bogart, which is partially within the county, retain separate governments) * Augusta and Richmond County, Georgia (two communities within Richmond County retain separate governments) * Baton Rouge and East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana (three communities within East Baton Rouge Parish ‚Äì Baker, Central and Zachary ‚Äì retain separate governments. In addition, the City of Baton Rouge retains separate city limits, and its official census population only includes this area) * Camden County, North Carolina (county with no incorporated municipalities, apart from a small portion of Elizabeth City, re-organizing into a single unified government)Camden County Government - Board of Commissioners - February 10, 2006 * Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana (four communities within Marion County retain separate governments: see Unigov) * Jacksonville and Duval County, Florida (four incorporated places within Duval County - the cities of Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach and the town of Baldwin - retain separate governments; all other rural land is incorporated by Jacksonville and so the entire county is incorporated) * Kansas City and Wyandotte County, Kansas (this \\"Unified Government\\" contains Kansas City, Edwardsville, most of Bonner Springs, and roughly half of Lake Quivira; a county relationship is maintained with the rest of the communities within the county) as of 1997. * Lafayette, Louisiana and Lafayette Parish (In December 2018 voters amended the city-parish charter to split what was a single consolidated city-parish council into two councils ‚Äî one to represent only the city of Lafayette and the other to represent the parish. The impetus for the change was the desire of city voters to take more control of city-related matters and general unease with the consequences of consolidation). * Louisville and Jefferson County, Kentucky (all cities in pre-merger Jefferson County, other than Louisville, retain separate identities and some governmental functions, but all participate fully in the county-wide governing body, Louisville Metro Council) * Miami and Dade County, Florida merged in 1957, and since then operate under a federated two-tier government similar to consolidated city-county relationship where the county government operates as a superseding entity of county affairs and lower-tier incorporated municipalities operate civil and community services. The city-county changed its name to Miami-Dade County in 1997. * Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee (six communities within Davidson County retain separate governments, although all participate in the metropolitan government in a two-tier system) * Petersburg Borough, Alaska (When the borough was created in 2013, the city of Petersburg was dissolved. However, the city of Kupreanof remains a separate entity within the borough.) * Tribune, Kansas and Greeley County, Kansas (Horace retaining a separate government) Five cities in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia were formed by the consolidation of a city with a county: Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach (from Norfolk, Elizabeth City, Warwick, Nansemond, and Princess Anne counties, respectively). However, in each case an independent city was created and as such they are not consolidated city-counties. Instead, the Code of Virginia uses the term \\"consolidated city.\\" Similarly, Carson City was consolidated with Ormsby County, Nevada in 1969, but the county was simultaneously dissolved. The city is now a municipality independent of any county. ==Potentially consolidated== * Aurora, Colorado, split between three counties, explored the creation of a new consolidated city-county in 1996; the effort subsequently failed in a referendum. However, five years later nearby Broomfield was successful in creating a new city-county from portions of the four counties it had been a part of. Encouraged by Broomfield's experience, an Aurora city councilman has proposed consolidation again in 2006.City and County of Aurora? by J.C. O'Connell. The Aurora Daily Sun & Sentinel, January 30, 2006. This was not accomplished in 2006 or 2007, and no bills to accomplish consolidation were introduced in the 2008 session of the Colorado legislature. * A proposal has been made to merge Johnson County, Kansas and Wyandotte County, Kansas and the cities located in those two into a single consolidated city-county, name to be determined.Johnson-Wyandotte merger? by Jesse Truesdale.

This plan has been endorsed by the mayor of Pittsburgh and the Chief Executive of Allegheny County, but needs approval by the City and County councils and from the state legislature before a referendum can be put forth for the voters to approve such a merger. * The independent City of St. Louis, Missouri and that of St. Louis County. The city of St. Louis seceded from St. Louis County in the 1870s and is not part of any county in the state of Missouri. Regional leaders have since proposed several plans to reunify the City and County, each one rejected by voters.St. Louis Five-Year Consolidated Plan Strategy 2006-2010 ===Considered consolidation=== * Albuquerque and Bernalillo County, New Mexico (1959, 2003) * Aurora and Arapahoe County, Colorado * Baltimore and Baltimore County, Maryland: Baltimore is established in the Constitution of Maryland as an independent city. A proposed constitutional amendment to dissolve the city and merge it into Baltimore County was introduced in 1999 but was withdrawn less than a month after the first reading. * Birmingham and Jefferson County, Alabama (1948) *Brunswick and Glynn County, Georgia (1969, 1987) * Buffalo and Erie County, New York * Charleston/North Charleston/Mount Pleasant and Charleston County, South Carolina (1974) * Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (1971) * Des Moines and Polk County, Iowa (1994, 2004) * Durham and Durham County, North Carolina (1961, 1974) * El Paso and El Paso County, Texas * Evansville and Vanderburgh County, Indiana ** Voted four times on consolidation‚Äîin 1959, 1974, 2002, and 2012.

The 2006 proposal was approved by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners, but unanimously rejected by the Omaha City Council. The 2011 proposal was introduced by a state legislator in The Unicameral, as LB344; it was tabled in committee. * Orlando and Orange County, Florida * Paducah and McCracken County, Kentucky ** Rejected a proposed consolidation in 2012 by a more than 2-to-1 margin. * Pensacola and Escambia County, Florida (1970) * Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania ** passed referendums in 1925, 1929 and 1939 that were blocked by technicalities by the state assembly.

Both times, city voters approved consolidation while county voters were opposed. The independent city of Salem, Virginia, which would have been surrounded by the consolidated entity, did not participate in the referendums. Vinton, Virginia would have retained its status as a town in the 1990 referendum. The consolidation issue has been dormant since 1990. * Sacramento and Sacramento County, California (1974, 1990) * Savannah and Chatham County, Georgia ** Prior consolidation referendum held in 1973 failed. The Georgia General Assembly is conducting a feasibility study towards consolidating the city of Savannah with Chatham County. * St. Louis (independent city) with St. Louis County, Missouri (1926, 1962, In consideration in 2017) * Sioux Falls and Minnehaha/Lincoln counties, South Dakota (2005) * Spokane and Spokane County, Washington (1995) * Tallahassee and Leon County, Florida (1971, 1973, 1976, 1992) * Tampa and Hillsborough County, Florida (1967, 1970, 1972) * Toledo and Lucas County, Ohio * Topeka and Shawnee County, Kansas (2005) * Wilmington and New Hanover County, North Carolina (1933) ==Formerly consolidated== * The City of Boston and Suffolk County, Massachusetts operated with a consolidated government for most of the twentieth century with Boston providing office space, auditors, budget, personnel and financial oversight for Suffolk County. This was not a true consolidation because three municipalities ‚Äì Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop ‚Äì were never annexed into Boston and remained separate jurisdictions within Suffolk County; however, the City of Boston held complete control of the county by law. The special relationship between Boston and Suffolk County ended in 1999 as part of the gradual abolition of county governments through much of the state with all county employees and powers transferred to Commonwealth of Massachusetts control. The only remaining powers and duties for the City of Boston in regards to the county is ceremonial in which the Suffolk County Register of Deeds is issued the oath of office at the start of a term as well as calls for a meeting to hold a special election to fill the office should there be a failure to elect someone to the office or should a vacancy occur. *From the 17th century to 1898, New York City was coterminous with New York County and was often referred to as the \\"City and County of New York\\". Both were coterminous with Manhattan until 1874 when the City and County annexed parts of Westchester County that would later become the West Bronx, later annexing the remainder of the future Bronx. Upon consolidation in 1898, New York County was coterminous and consolidated with the boroughs of the Bronx and Manhattan while the other boroughs were consolidated with their own respective counties. The Bronx was separated from New York County in 1914 to form its own Bronx County, and since then all five boroughs of New York City are coterminous and consolidated with a county of New York state. ==See also== * Combined Statistical Area * Conurbation * City with powiat rights * City of regional significance * City‚Äìstate * Direct-controlled municipality * Ekistics * Independent city (United States) * Megalopolis (term) * Megacity * Merger (politics) * Metropolitan area * Metropolis ==References== ==External links== * Comparative of all city/county consolidations and the issues and advantages each model presents (from the Pittsburgh/Allegheny task force on consolidation) Category:County government in the United States Category:Local government in the United States Category:Counties ","title":"Consolidated city-county"},{"id":"299858","text":"Engraving of the Prodigal Son as a swineherd by Hans Sebald Beham, 1538.

Actors also avoid even quoting the lines from Macbeth before performances, particularly the Witches' incantations. Outside a theatre and after a performance, the play can be spoken of openly. Saying the names of the characters, including Macbeth, seems to be fine. If an actor speaks the word \\"Macbeth\\" (when referring to the scottish tragedy, not the character) in a theatre prior to one of the performances, they are required to perform a ritual to remove the curse. The ritual may vary according to local custom: one is to leave the theatre building, or at least the room occupied when the name was mentioned, spin around three times, spit, curse, and then knock to be allowed back in. This particular iteration of the ritual is documented in the play The Dresser and its film adaptations. Another example is in the song 'Take a Break' from the hit broadway musical Hamilton. Alexander refers to 'the Scottish tragedy' in a letter to Angelica Schuyler, comparing himself and his enemies to the characters in the Shakesperian tragedy. One version of this legend claims that it was the actor who played Lady Macbeth who died during the play's first production run and that Shakespeare himself had to assume the role. There is no evidence that this legend is factual.Kerr, Euan. \\"Mystery surrounds roots of the Macbeth curse\\", MPR News, Minnesota Public Radio website, published 2010-02-05, retrieved 2012-06-14. ==\\"Break a leg\\" vs. \\"Good luck\\"== Generally, it is considered bad luck to wish someone \\"good luck\\" in a theatre. Prior to performances, it is traditional for the cast to gather together to avert the bad luck by wishing each other bad luck or cursing ‚Äì in English-speaking countries, the expression \\"break a leg\\" replaces the phrase \\"good luck\\". The exact origin of this expression is unknown, but some of the most popular theories are the Leg Line Theory (also known as the Curtain Theory), the Shakespearean Theory (also sometimes referred to as the Traditional Theory), and the Bowing Theory. In Australian theatrical circles saying \\"good luck\\" is also avoided, but the replacement is often \\"chookas!\\" This may be due to the belief among some dancers that saying \\"break a leg\\" may actually result in broken bones. According to one oral tradition, one of the company would check audience numbers. If there were not many in the seats, the performers would have bread to eat following the performance. If the theatre was full they could then have \\"chook\\" ‚ÄîAustralian slang for chicken‚Äî for dinner. Therefore, if it was a full house, the performer would call out \\"Chook it is!\\", which became abbreviated to \\"Chookas!\\" It is now used by performers prior to a show regardless of the number of patrons; and may be a wish for a successful turnout. Professional dancers do not wish each other good luck by saying \\"break a leg\\"; instead they say \\"Merde!\\", the French word for \\"shit\\". In turn, theater people have picked up this usage and may wish each other \\"merde\\", alone or in combination with \\"break a leg\\". In Spanish, the phrase is \\"mucha mierda\\", or \\"lots of shit\\". This term refers to the times when carriages would take the audience to the theatre. A quick look to the street in front of the venue would tell if the play was successful: a lot of horse dung would mean many carriages had stopped to leave spectators.The QI Elves. \\"No Such Thing As The Ugly Panda\\". No Such Thing as a Fish (62). Quite Interesting Ltd. Retrieved 7 June 2015. Opera singers use \\"Toi toi toi\\", an idiom used to ward off a spell or hex, often accompanied by knocking on wood. One explanation sees \\"toi toi toi\\" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times. Saliva traditionally was supposed to have demon-banishing powers and, in various cultural traditions, spitting three times over someone's head or shoulder is a gesture to ward off evil spirits. A similar-sounding expression for verbal spitting occurs in modern Hebrew as \\"Tfu, tfu\\" (here, only twice), which some say that Hebrew- speakers borrowed from Russian. An alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from Italy, is the phrase \\"in bocca al lupo!\\" (\\"In the mouth of the wolf\\") with the response \\"Crepi il lupo!\\" (\\"May the wolf die\\") (see Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Myth & Legend). ==Ghost light== One should always leave a light burning in an empty theatre.The History of the Ghost Light Though it is a superstition, it does have practical value as well: the backstage area of a theatre tends to be cluttered with props and other objects, so someone who enters a completely darkened space is liable to be injured while hunting for a light switch. ===Ghosts in Broadway Theatres=== In 2005, Playbill ran an article about Broadway theatres that were believed to be haunted.Viagas, Robert. \\"The Ghosts of Broadway\\" , Playbill website, published 2005-06-10, retrieved 2012-06-14. The following is a list of hauntings from that article: * Radio City Music Hall: The Hall's builder, Samuel Roxy Rothafel, is said to appear on opening nights accompanied by a glamorous woman spirit. * New Amsterdam Theatre: Silent film star and former Ziegfeld Follies girl Olive Thomas is said to have appeared several times since her death in 1920. Thomas may be the most sighted ghost on Broadway, although to date she has only appeared to men. Disney, which restored the theatre in the 1990s, actively promotes the idea that Thomas haunts the theatre and makes accommodations for her presence. A large photograph of her hangs in the lobby of the New Amsterdam next to equally large photos of more famous Follies stars. * Belasco Theatre: The top floor of the theatre is said to be haunted by its namesake David Belasco, who lived in an apartment located there. * Palace Theatre: The former premiere vaudeville theatre is said to be haunted by more than 100 ghosts. According to the article, actress Andrea McArdle saw the ghost of a pit cellist during her 1999‚Äì2000 run as Belle in Beauty and the Beast. * Lyric Theatre: On December 21, 1909, the ghost of playwright Clyde Fitch allegedly appeared onstage during the final curtain call on opening night for his last play, The City. He strode to center stage, took a bow, then vanished before the eyes of the startled cast and audience. (Fitch had died on September 4 of that year.) The Lyric was one of two theatres demolished in 1996 to make way for what is now called the Foxwoods Theatre. * Al Hirschfeld Theatre: Formerly the Martin Beck Theatre, it is believed that Beck's ghost is annoyed with the 2003 name change. During that year's revival of Wonderful Town, there were several reports of props and other items that were mysteriously moved or went missing. ==Whistling== Related to a similar rule for sailing ships, it is considered bad luck for an actor to whistle on or off stage. As original stage crews were hired from ships in port (theatrical rigging has its origins in sailing rigging), sailors, and by extension theatrical riggers, used coded whistles to cue scene changes. Actors who whistled could confuse them into changing the set or scenery at the wrong time and this could result in injury or death, especially if they were flying set or backdrops in or out. In today's theatres, the stage crew normally uses an intercom or cue light system. ==Shoes on a table== It is considered bad luck to place one's shoes on a table.David Pickering, Cassell's Dictionary of Superstitions (Sterling Publishing, 2002) p. 425 ==Miscellaneous== * Bringing a pet (dog, cat...) on a theatrical or film set is considered to bring Bad Luck to any production. ‚ÄúA pet on set is bad luck‚Äù. * Some words and phrases are used during pre-stage warm-up sessions by actors. One of these is the Western Shoshone term \\"poo-wa-bah\\" (possibly meaning \\"doctor-water\\"). This term is used notably by director Francis Ford Coppola (who talked about it in Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, a documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now) and his daughter Sofia Coppola (who is seen performing this ritual, along with her cast, in \\"Lost on Location\\", a making-of documentary included as a special feature on the Lost in Translation DVD). It is thought that he began this pre-show ritual at his undergraduate alma mater Hofstra University where the tradition continues in Hofstra Drama Department productions. * Specific theatres ** Some Broadway producers have also complained about the Foxwoods Theatre (formerly known as the \\"Hilton Theatre\\" and \\"Ford Center for the Performing Arts\\"). Completed in 1998, the main complaint is that the 1829-seat theatre's cavernous auditorium has poor sight lines and acoustics, making it difficult for audience members in distant seats to see or hear the actors. Mel Brooks (whose Young Frankenstein ran for 14 months there) made a different complaint about the theatre's acoustics, stating that its size also makes it difficult for performers to hear the laughter of the audience. The theatre opened with the two-year, 834 performance run of the original production of the musical Ragtime.

The Carson Range, along with its parent the Sierra Nevada, together cast a rain shadow over the Greater Reno Area and Carson City. Unlike the main crest of the Sierra Nevada to the west of Lake Tahoe, the Carson Range loses its snow much earlier (April), and gains it much later (December). In fact, it receives about half the snowfall as mountains west of the lake.http://www.summitpost.org/carson-range/712600 Meltwater from the range feeds into the Truckee River and West Fork Carson River, as well as Lake Tahoe and Marlette Lake. ;Principal Mountains * Freel Peak (10,881 ft/3,316 m) * Mount Rose (10,776 ft/3,284 m) * Jobs Peak (10,633 ft/3,240 m) * Slide Mountain (9,698 ft/2,955 m) * East Peak (9,593 ft/2,924 m) * Snow Valley Peak (9,214 ft/2,808 m) ==Transportation== US 50 traverses the western slopes of the Carson Range.

He is described as hailing from Baghdad during the early Abbasid Caliphate (8th and 9th centuries A.D.). In the course of seven voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures in magical realms, encountering monsters and witnessing supernatural phenomena. ==Origins and sources== The tales of Sinbad are a relatively late addition to the One Thousand and One Nights ‚Äì they do not feature in the earliest 14th-century manuscript, and they appear as an independent cycle in 17th- and 18th-century collections. Traceable influences include the Homeric epics (long familiar in the Arabic-speaking world, having been translated into that language as early as the 8th century A.D., at the court of the Caliph al-Mahdi), Pseudo- Callisthenes's \\"Life of Alexander\\" from the late 3rd/early 4th century A.D. via the 9th century \\"Book of Animals\\" of al-Jahiz, and, even earlier, in the ancient Egyptian \\"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor\\". Later sources include Abbasid works such the \\"Wonders of the Created World\\", reflecting the experiences of 13th century Arab mariners who braved the Indian Ocean. The Sinbad cycle is set in the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786‚Äì809). The Sinbad tales are included in the first European translation of the Nights, Galland's Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en fran√ßais, an English edition of which appeared in 1711 as The new Arabian winter nights entertainments. and went through numerous editions throughout the 18th century. The earliest separate publication of the Sinbad tales in English found in the British Library is an adaptation as The Adventures of Houran Banow, etc. (Taken from the Arabian Nights, being the third and fourth voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.),. around 1770. An early US edition, The seven voyages of Sinbad the sailor. And The story of Aladdin; or, The wonderful lamp, was published in Philadelphia in 1794. Numerous popular editions followed in the early 19th century, including a chapbook edition by Thomas Tegg. Its best known full translation was perhaps as tale 120 in Volume 6 of Sir Richard Burton's 1885 translation of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights... ==Tales== ===Sinbad the Porter and Sinbad the Sailor=== Like the 1001 Nights the Sinbad story-cycle has a frame story which goes as follows: in the days of Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad, a poor porter (one who carries goods for others in the market and throughout the city) pauses to rest on a bench outside the gate of a rich merchant's house, where he complains to Allah about the injustice of a world which allows the rich to live in ease while he must toil and yet remain poor. The owner of the house hears and sends for the porter, finding that they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy \\"by Fortune and Fate\\" in the course of seven wondrous voyages, which he then proceeds to relate. ===First Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== After dissipating the wealth left to him by his father, Sinbad goes to sea to repair his fortune. He sets ashore on what appears to be an island, but this island proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale on which trees have taken root ever since the whale was young. Awakened by a fire kindled by the sailors, the whale dives into the depths, the ship departs without Sinbad, and Sinbad is saved by the chance of a passing wooden trough sent by the grace of Allah. He is washed ashore on a densely wooded island. While exploring the deserted island he comes across one of the king's grooms. When Sinbad helps save the King's mare from being drowned by a sea horse (not a seahorse as we know it, but a supernatural horse that lives underwater), the groom brings Sinbad to the king. The king befriends Sinbad and so he rises in the king's favour and becomes a trusted courtier. One day, the very ship on which Sinbad set sail docks at the island, and he reclaims his goods (still in the ship's hold). Sinbad gives the king his goods and in return the king gives him rich presents. Sinbad sells these presents for a great profit. Sinbad returns to Baghdad where he resumes a life of ease and pleasure. With the ending of the tale, Sinbad the sailor makes Sinbad the porter a gift of a hundred gold pieces, and bids him return the next day to hear more about his adventures. ===Second Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== Sindbad the Sailor and the Valley of the Diamonds. On the second day of Sinbad's tale-telling (but the 549th night of Scheherazade's), Sinbad the sailor tells how he grew restless of his life of leisure, and set to sea again, \\"possessed with the thought of traveling about the world of men and seeing their cities and islands.\\" Accidentally abandoned by his shipmates again, he finds himself stranded in an island which contains roc eggs. He attaches himself with the help of his turban to a roc and is transported to a valley of giant snakes which can swallow elephants (like the Bashe); these serve as the rocs' natural prey. The floor of the valley is carpeted with diamonds, and merchants harvest these by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley: the birds carry the meat back to their nests, and the men drive the birds away and collect the diamonds stuck to the meat. The wily Sinbad straps one of the pieces of meat to his back and is carried back to the nest along with a large sack full of precious gems. Rescued from the nest by the merchants, he returns to Baghdad with a fortune in diamonds, seeing many marvels along the way. ===Third Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== Sinbad's third voyage. Encounter with a man-eating giant. Sinbad sets sail again from Basra. But by ill chance he and his companions are cast up on an island where they are captured by \\"A huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of colour, ...with eyes like coals of fire and large canine teeth like boar's tusks and a vast big gape like the mouth of a well. Moreover, he had long loose lips like camel's, hanging down upon his breast, and ears like two Jarms falling over his shoulder-blades, and the nails of his hands were like the claws of a lion.\\" This monster begins eating the crew, beginning with the Reis (captain), who is the fattest. (Burton notes that the giant \\"is distinctly Polyphemus\\".) Sinbad hatches a plan to blind the beast with the two red-hot iron spits with which the monster has been kebabbing and roasting the ship's company. He and the remaining men escape on a raft they constructed the day before. However, the Giant's mate hits most of the escaping men with rocks and they are killed. After further adventures (including a gigantic python from which Sinbad escapes using his quick wits), he returns to Baghdad, wealthier than ever. ===Fourth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== Impelled by restlessness Sinbad takes to the seas again and, as usual, is shipwrecked. The naked savages amongst whom he finds himself feed his companions a herb which robs them of their reason (Burton theorises that this might be bhang), prior to fattening them for the table. Sinbad realises what is happening, and refuses to eat the madness-inducing plant. When the cannibals have lost interest in him, he escapes. A party of itinerant pepper-gatherers transports him to their own island, where their king befriends him and gives him a beautiful and wealthy wife. Too late Sinbad learns of a peculiar custom of the land: on the death of one marriage partner, the other is buried alive with his or her spouse, both in their finest clothes and most costly jewels. Sinbad's wife falls ill and dies soon after, leaving Sinbad trapped in a cavern, a communal tomb, with a jug of water and seven pieces of bread. Just as these meagre supplies are almost exhausted, another couple‚Äîthe husband dead, the wife alive‚Äîare dropped into the cavern. Sinbad bludgeons the wife to death and takes her rations. Such episodes continue; soon he has a sizable store of bread and water, as well as the gold and gems from the corpses, but is still unable to escape, until one day a wild animal shows him a passage to the outside, high above the sea. From here a passing ship rescues him and carries him back to Baghdad, where he gives alms to the poor and resumes his life of pleasure. (Burton's footnote comments: \\"This tale is evidently taken from the escape of Aristomenes the Messenian from the pit into which he had been thrown, a fox being his guide. The Arabs in an early day were eager students of Greek literature.\\") Similarly, the first half of the voyage resembles the Circe episode in The Odyssey, with certain differences: while a plant robbed Sinbad's men of their reason in the Arab tales, it was only Circe's magic which \\"fattened\\" Odysseus' men in The Odyssey. It is in an earlier episode, featuring the 'Lotus Eaters', that Odysseus' men are fed a similar magical fruit which robs them of their senses. ===Fifth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== Sindbad's fifth voyage \\"When I had been a while on shore after my fourth voyage; and when, in my comfort and pleasures and merry-makings and in my rejoicing over my large gains and profits, I had forgotten all I had endured of perils and sufferings, the carnal man was again seized with the longing to travel and to see foreign countries and islands.\\" Soon at sea once more, while passing a desert island Sinbad's crew spots a gigantic egg that Sinbad recognizes as belonging to a roc. Out of curiosity the ship's passengers disembark to view the egg, only to end up breaking it and having the chick inside as a meal. Sinbad immediately recognizes the folly of their behaviour and orders all back aboard ship. However, the infuriated parent rocs soon catch up with the vessel and destroy it by dropping giant boulders they have carried in their talons.JPG image. stefanmart.de Shipwrecked yet again, Sinbad is enslaved by the Old Man of the Sea, who rides on his shoulders with his legs twisted round Sinbad's neck and will not let go, riding him both day and night until Sinbad would welcome death. (Burton's footnote discusses possible origins for the old man‚Äîthe orang-utan, the Greek god Triton‚Äîand favours the African custom of riding on slaves in this way.JPG image. stefanmart.de) Eventually, Sinbad makes wine and tricks the Old Man into drinking some. Sinbad kills him after he has fallen off, and then he escapes. A ship carries him to the City of the Apes, a place whose inhabitants spend each night in boats off-shore, while their town is abandoned to man-eating apes. Yet through the apes Sinbad recoups his fortune, and so eventually finds a ship which takes him home once more to Baghdad. ===Sixth Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== Sinbad during sixth voyage \\"My soul yearned for travel and traffic\\". Sinbad is shipwrecked yet again, this time quite violently as his ship is dashed to pieces on tall cliffs. There is no food to be had anywhere, and Sinbad's companions die of starvation until only he is left. He builds a raft and discovers a river running out of a cavern beneath the cliffs. The stream proves to be filled with precious stones and it becomes apparent that the island's streams flow with ambergris. He falls asleep as he journeys through the darkness and awakens in the city of the king of Serendib (Ceylon, Sri Lanka), \\"diamonds are in its rivers and pearls are in its valleys\\". The king marvels at what Sinbad tells him of the great Haroun al-Rashid, and asks that he take a present back to Baghdad on his behalf, a cup carved from a single ruby, with other gifts including a bed made from the skin of the serpent that swallowed the elephant (\\"And whoso sitteth upon it never sickeneth\\"), and \\"A hundred thousand miskals of Sindh lign-aloesa.\\", and a slave-girl \\"Like a shining moon\\". And so Sinbad returns to Baghdad, where the Caliph wonders greatly at the reports Sinbad gives of the land of Ceylon. ===Seventh and Last Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor=== \\"The Caravan\\" from \\"Sinbad's Seventh and Last Voyage.\\" The ever-restless Sinbad sets sail once more, with the usual result. Cast up on a desolate shore, he constructs a raft and floats down a nearby river to a great city. Here the chief of the merchants weds Sinbad to his daughter, names him his heir, and conveniently dies. The inhabitants of this city are transformed once a month into birds, and Sinbad has one of the bird-people carry him to the uppermost reaches of the sky, where he hears the angels glorifying God, \\"whereat I wondered and exclaimed, 'Praised be God! Extolled be the perfection of God!'\\" But no sooner are the words out than there comes fire from heaven which all but consumes the bird-men. The bird-people are angry with Sinbad and set him down on a mountain-top, where he meets two youths who are the servants of God and who give him a golden staff; returning to the city, Sinbad learns from his wife that the bird-men are devils, although she and her father are not of their number. And so, at his wife's suggestion, Sinbad sells all his possessions and returns with her to Baghdad, where at last he resolves to live quietly in the enjoyment of his wealth, and to seek no more adventures. Burton includes a variant of the seventh tale, in which Haroun al-Rashid asks Sinbad to carry a return gift to the king of Serendib. Sinbad replies, \\"By Allah the Omnipotent, Oh my lord, I have taken a loathing to wayfare, and when I hear the words 'Voyage' or 'Travel,' my limbs tremble\\". He then tells the Caliph of his misfortune-filled voyages; Haroun agrees that with such a history \\"thou dost only right never even to talk of travel\\". Nevertheless, a command of the Caliph is not to be negated, and Sinbad sets forth on this, his uniquely diplomatic voyage. The king of Serendib is well pleased with the Caliph's gifts (which include, among other things, the food tray of King Solomon) and showers Sinbad with his favour. On the return voyage the usual catastrophe strikes: Sinbad is captured and sold into slavery. His master sets him to shooting elephants with a bow and arrow, which he does until the king of the elephants carries him off to the elephants' graveyard. Sinbad's master is so pleased with the huge quantities of ivory in the graveyard that he sets Sinbad free, and Sinbad returns to Baghdad, rich with ivory and gold. \\"Here I went in to the Caliph and, after saluting him and kissing hands, informed him of all that had befallen me; whereupon he rejoiced in my safety and thanked Almighty Allah; and he made my story be written in letters of gold. I then entered my house and met my family and brethren: and such is the end of the history that happened to me during my seven voyages. Praise be to Allah, the One, the Creator, the Maker of all things in Heaven and Earth!\\". In some versions we return to the frame story, in which Sinbad the Porter may receive a final generous gift from Sinbad the Sailor. In other versions the story cycle ends here, and there is no further mention of Sinbad the Porter. ==Sinbad in popular culture== Sinbad's quasi-iconic status in Western culture has led to his name being recycled for a wide range of uses in both serious and not-so- serious contexts, frequently with only a tenuous connection to the original tales. ===Films, TV, animation=== Sinbad the Sailor animated short film (1935) Many films, television series, animated cartoons, novels, and video games have been made, featuring Sinbad not as a merchant who happens to stumble into adventures, but as a dashing dare-devil adventure-seeker. * Sinbad the Sailor (1920) artwork by Paul Klee (Swiss-German artist, 1879-1940) * Sinbad the Sailor (1935) Directed by Ub Iwerks * Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor (1936) * Arabian Nights (1942) * Sinbad the Sailor (1947) * Son of Sinbad (1955) * The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) * Arabian naito: Shindobaddo no b√¥ken (Arabian Nights: Adventures of Sinbad) (1962) (animated Japanese film) * Captain Sindbad (1963) * Sinbad contro i sette saraceni (Sinbad against the Seven Saracens).

Various components of the story have identifiable themes in the work, including Rocs and the angry sea. In the climactic final movement, Sinbad's ship (6th voyage) is depicted as rushing rapidly toward cliffs and only the fortuitous discovery of the cavernous stream allows him to escape and make the passage to Serindib. * In The Count of Monte Cristo, \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\" is but one of many pseudonyms used by Edmond Dant√®s. * In his Ulysses, James Joyce uses \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\" as an alias for the character of W.B.

He graduated first in his class from the Chorillos Military Academy in 1915. He joined the army and as a Lieutenant Colonel was a war hero in the 1941 Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War. He soon achieved the rank of Major General. In 1945, Jos√© Bustamante had attained the presidency with the help of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). Soon, major disagreements arose between V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre, the founder of APRA, and President Bustamante. The President disbanded his Aprista cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. Odr√≠a, a fierce opponent of APRA, was appointed Minister of Government and Police. In 1948, Odr√≠a and other right-wing elements urged Bustamante to ban APRA. When the President refused, Odr√≠a resigned his post. On October 27, 1948, he led a successful military coup against the government and took over as president. After two years, he resigned and had one of his colleagues, Zen√≥n Noriega, take office as a puppet president so he could run for president as a civilian. He was duly elected a month later as the only candidate. Odr√≠a came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right. Like Juan Per√≥n, he followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, civil rights in the nation were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his r√©gime. People feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely; they were surprised when Odr√≠a legalized opposition parties in 1956 and called fresh elections. He did not run for office. He was succeeded by a former president, Manuel Prado. When national elections were held again in 1962, Odr√≠a ran as a right-wing candidate for the Uni√≥n Nacional Odriista party. None of the three major candidates - Odr√≠a, Haya de la Torre and Fernando Bela√∫nde - received the required one third of the vote to win with a plurality. It appeared that Odr√≠a would win the Presidency in Congress, after having made a deal with Haya de la Torre, but a military coup removed President Prado from office a few days before his term ended. Elections were held again in 1963, with the same three major candidates. This time Bela√∫nde won with 39% of the vote.\\"Peru, Revolution Within the Law,\\" TIME Magazine: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940508,00.html During the Bela√∫nde administration, Odr√≠a made an alliance with Haya de la Torre to create a single opposition block in Parliament, which became known as the APRA-UNO Coalition. As a political force, they managed to create strong parliamentary opposition to President Bela√∫nde, who was forced to make important concessions to the Coalition in order to get most of his party- sponsored legislation enacted. The Coalition suffered a setback after losing the elections for mayor in the capital, Lima. After the military coup that overthrew Bela√∫nde in 1968, Odr√≠a kept a low profile in Peruvian politics until his death in 1974. == Descendants Currently Active in Peruvian Politics == Enrique Odr√≠a Sotomayor == Notes == Category:1897 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Peruvian generals Category:Presidents of Peru Category:Odriist National Union politicians Category:Peruvian people of Basque descent Category:Grand Crosses Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Manuel A.

They scored over a dozen hit singles, including \\"Come and Get These Memories\\", \\"Nowhere to Run\\", \\"Heat Wave\\", \\"Jimmy Mack\\", and their signature \\"Dancing In The Street\\". From 2005 until 2009, Reeves served as an elected council woman for the city of Detroit, Michigan. ==History== ===Early life and career=== Martha Rose Reeves was born in Eufaula, Alabama, the first daughter of Elijah Joshua Reeves and Ruby Lee Gilmore Reeves, and the third of the couple's 11 children. She was a baby when the family moved from Eufaula to Detroit, Michigan, where her grandfather, Reverend Elijah Reeves, was a minister at Detroit's Metropolitan Church. The family was very active in the church and its choir. Elijah played guitar and Ruby liked to sing; the children acquired their love of music from their parents. At Detroit's Northeastern High School, her vocal coach was Abraham Silver, who also worked with Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson (of the Supremes) and Bobby Rogers (of the Miracles). Raised on gospel, and inspired by singers like Lena Horne and Della Reese, Reeves became a fan of R&B; and doo-wop music. She joined the Fascinations in 1959, but left the group before they became a recording act. 1957 was her first association with Rosalind Ashford, Gloria Williams and Annette Beard in a group then known as The Del- Phis, formed after a man named Edward \\"Pops\\" Larkins was starting a sister singing group to complement a male vocal group of his. The Del-Phis were popular local performers. Reeves was reportedly an admirer of the group and was a friend of Gloria Williams, who hired Reeves to join the group in 1960. Through 1960 and 1961, Reeves made ends meet working several jobs by day and worked as a singer in nighttime hours singing jazz and blues standards at some of Detroit's respected nightclubs. Singing at the 20 Grand, Reeves was spotted by Motown A&R; director Mickey Stevenson, who recognized her talent, gave her his business card and invited her to audition. Reeves, who used the stage name Martha Lavaille showed up at Motown's Hitsville USA studios the next morning, not knowing that she was to call to schedule an audition. Stevenson asked her to answer phones while he took care of other business. Using the skills she had learned in commercial courses in high school, Reeves answered phones, took notes, administered payroll for Motown's famed Funk Brothers, and made herself invaluable. (Stevenson and Reeves give a different account of this in the 2019 documentary Hitsville: The Making of Motown. Directly quoting Stevenson: ‚ÄúShe came to audition a few times. I would find nice ways of saying, ‚ÄòMartha, you know, come back later.‚Äô‚Äù Reeves added, ‚ÄúAnd I must have looked like I was gonna cry or something, cos he said, ‚ÄòAnswer this phone. I'll be right back.‚Äô This \\"right back\\" was four hours.‚Äù As for the missed session by Mary Wells referenced in the following paragraph, according to Berry Gordy, Motown routinely recorded without a singer present, in violation of union rules: ‚ÄúWe were recording sometimes tracks without the singer, and according to the Union, you had to have a singer singing it live. You couldn't do tracks in those days.‚Äù A Union representative made a surprise visit, and Berry said, Everybody went crazy, saying, ‚ÄúWell, you're doing a session in there and the Union guy is coming. We told Mickey, ‚ÄúMan,we've got to put somebody on the mic.‚Äô His secretary overheard it‚Ä¶.Then she grabbed the mic and started singing it, and she was Martha.‚Äù) Before long, Reeves was working several hours at Hitsville as Stevenson's right hand. (She also did A&R; work in addition to secretarial work for Motown.) By 1961, the Del-Phis had changed their name to The Vels and recorded singles for Checker and Checkmate Records. One day, when Mary Wells couldn't make a session, Reeves stepped up to the mic, and called in the Del-Phis. With \\"I'll Have to Let Him Go\\", Martha and the Vandellas was born. Then, when the Andantes couldn't make a session to back the Miracles' drummer on songs he was recording, Martha called her groupmates. The ladies (a trio after Williams' departure) provided backup vocals for Marvin Gaye's \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\". The single became a hit. Martha and the Vandellas backed Gaye on his first three singles, his first album, and on stage‚Äîeven after they had their own hits. ===Martha and the Vandellas=== Lois, Martha and Delphine With her brassy and gospel-reared vocals, Martha Reeves helped Martha and the Vandellas ascend from background singers with early songs such as \\"Come and Get These Memories\\" and \\"Heat Wave\\", distinguishing the group from contemporaries and labelmates the Marvelettes, who preceded them, and the Supremes, who followed them. After \\"Heat Wave\\" became the group's first million-seller, Martha and the Vandellas quickly rose to become one of the label's top draws both as recording stars and as a successful live act. Martha was the one consistent member of the group staying throughout all the group's incarnations and lineups. After the exits of original members Annette Beard and Rosalind Ashford, members replacing them included Betty Kelly, Sandra Tilley (both formerly of the Velvelettes) and one of Martha's sisters Lois Reeves. Among the singles released that became signature hits for the group are \\"Quicksand\\", \\"In My Lonely Room\\", \\"Live Wire\\", \\"Nowhere to Run\\", \\"A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)\\", \\"I'm Ready for Love\\", \\"Jimmy Mack\\", \\"Honey Chile\\" and the group's most popular single, \\"Dancing in the Street\\". Their legendary television appearances included The Mike Douglas Show, The Joey Bishop Show, American Bandstand, Where the Action Is, Shindig, Swingin' Time, Soul Train, The Ed Sullivan Show, and with Brit soul singer Dusty Springfield, on the UK show Ready Steady Go! The group was also featured in major magazine articles in Johnson Publishing Corp. publications including HEP, Ebony and JET, and in SOUL newspaper and SOUL Illustrated magazine. Reeves was also an early contributing writer for SOUL. With major success came challenges. They faced standard girl group struggles, struggling to have personal lives while maintaining relentless recording and touring schedules. When original member Rosalind Ashford left in 1968, Martha recruited Sandra Tilley and the lineup of Martha and Lois Reeves and Tilley continued until 1972 when the group disbanded shortly after issuing the Black Magic album. In 1972, after Motown moved from Detroit to Los Angeles, Reeves negotiated out of her contract, ending her tenure with the label. In 1989, Martha, Rosalind Ashford, and Annette Beard filed a lawsuit against Motown Records for royalties on the group's records not received since 1972. The company reached a settlement with the women in 1991. Berry Gordy, Jr. apologized to Reeves for the length of time in reaching the agreement and the terms of the settlement were not made public. Despite media reports to the contrary, Reeves and Gordy remain close to this day. While on Detroit's City Council, Reeves had the name West Grand Blvd (where Motown studios are located) changed to Berry Gordy Blvd. ===Solo career=== After leaving Motown and moving to Los Angeles herself, Martha was signed by MCA by late 1973. Her first project, released in January 1974, was the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Willie Dynamite, with legendary jazz trombonist J. J. Johnson. In the summer of the year, MCA released her self-titled album, produced by Richard Perry. It was reportedly the most expensive album of that time, costing $250,000, and featuring other star musicians including Billy Preston, Joe Sample and James Taylor. Despite positive reviews, it failed to generate commercial success as did Reeves' subsequent follow-ups on other labels including Arista and Fantasy. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said, \\"This attempted masterpiece doesn't make it because Richard Perry has failed the fundamental test of the interpretive producer‚Äîmatching performer and material. To an extent, this is Reeves's fault--her gorgeous voice has trouble gripping complicated ideas.\\" Having moved to Los Angeles, Reeves took acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Institute, and appeared in the movie Fairy Tales, and on the television series Quincy, ME. Reeves also appeared on game shows such as Hollywood Squares. In 1977, with the help of former Motown producer Frank Wilson, Reeves became a born-again Christian, joining the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church, pastored by Rev. EV Hill. She released one album on Arista, working with Clive Davis, the Chairmen of the Board's General Johnson and others, and two albums on the Fantasy label, working with other former Motown colleagues Hank Cosby and Holland, Dozier and Holland. In 1983, she performed solo on the famed Motown 25 special. She then performed in a Broadway production of Ain't Misbehavin' and reunited with original members of the Vandellas in 1989 both on record (recording for the London-based Motorcity Records that year issuing the single \\"Step into My Shoes\\") and on tour. In 1995, Reeves and the Vandellas were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003. Martha performed as part of the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, with her sisters, and current Vandellas, Lois and Delphine Reeves. In 2004, Reeves released her first album in 24 years, Home to You, with songs she wrote and produced herself except for a Billie Holiday cover and an updated version of her big hit, \\"Jimmy Mack\\". Between leaving the Vandellas and her solo career, Martha served as an early contributor to the music newspaper, Soul, for which she was honored for by the Black Women in Publishing organization. She was also honored for her best-selling 1995 autobiography, Dancing in the Street. \\"Wild Night\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Thelma & Louise; the song can be heard during one of the several crucial moments in the lead characters' lives. Martha sometimes opens her live performances with this number. \\"Nowhere to Run\\" is the first record played by Robin Williams as manic DJ Adrian Cronauer in the movie Good Morning, Vietnam.Reeves in 2011Her solo television appearances include The Midnight Special (1974), Soul Train (1971 and 1974), Don Kirschner's Rock Concert (1972), The Dennis Miller Show (1987) (singing \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" with James Brown), VH-1's Divas Celebrate Soul, singing her 1965 hit \\"Nowhere To Run\\" backed by singers Marsha Ambrosius and Sharon Jones of the Dap-Kings; on Jimmy Kimmel Live! with the Crystal Method and a stellar group of rockers including Brain from Nine Inch Nails, Rob Fortus from Guns N' Roses and Darryl Jones from the Rolling Stones, and on Dancing With the Stars with the Temptations and Smokey Robinson. That same week she was back on the music charts with a recording entitled \\"I'm Not Leaving\\" with the Crystal Method. She appeared as a musical guest on the first season of Saturday Night Live (hosted by Candice Bergen) in December 1975, performing \\"Silver Bells\\" and \\"Higher and Higher\\". In January 2012, Martha held court at London's Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with a sold out six-show stand that drew celebrity friends like Phil Collins and Boy George. Other recent appearances include Carnegie Hall, the Blue Note (Milan, Italy), the Howard Theater (Washington, DC), the Dakota Jazz Club (Minneapolis), BB King Blues Club (NYC), the Cheltenhem Jazz Festival and the Mouth of the Tyne Festival. In November 2015, just weeks after the terrorist bombings in Brussels and Paris, Reeves and her co-horts embarked on a sold-out tour of clubs and theatres in the city of lights and throughout Belgium. Reeves received an honorary PhD in Humanities on November 25, 2012, in Detroit. She was inducted as a solo artists into the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame on Oct 4, 2015. Reeves received the Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award at the Artists Music Guild's 2015 AMG Heritage Awards on November 14, 2015, in Monroe, North Carolina. She is featured in Alabama's 2016 Black History calendar, sponsored by AT&T.; In August 2016, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were presented in concert at London's Hippodrome, where various Motown artists recorded live albums in the 1960s and 1970s. ===Current work=== After serving on the Detroit City Council from 2005 to 2009, Reeves returned to full-time performing with nearly 50 shows annually, including a major tour of Australia in 2010. She regularly appears at festivals in the UK during the summer, and for her performances was nominated for two UK Festival Awards, as \\"Best Headliner\\" and \\"Feel Good Act of the Summer.\\" Reeves is a board member of SAG-AFTRA Detroit chapter. In 2007, she testified before Congress on behalf of musicians, session singers and recording artists for better wages and royalties. She was honored for her hard work and courage in 2007 by delegates and members of AFTRA. She is also on the board of SoundExchange, a non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on behalf of sound recording copyright owners and featured artists for non-interactive digital transmissions, including satellite and internet radio. She made a cameo appearance in the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, as a passer-by listening to the duo on the boardwalk. This information was revealed in the film's DVD audio commentary by Kyle Gass. Martha continues to perform concerts and club dates both solo and with her Vandellas - sisters Lois (Motown-era Vandella since 1967) and Delphine (since mid-1980s). On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Martha Reeves among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. In September 2019, Martha was one of the celebrity contestants taking part on the BBC One show Celebrity MasterChef in the UK. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *1973: Willie Dynamite Soundtrack (MCA Records) *1974: Martha Reeves (MCA) - AUS #94 *1975: Rainbow (Phonarama) *1977: The Rest of My Life (Arista) *1978: We Meet Again (Fantasy) *1980: Gotta Keep Moving (Fantasy) *2004: Home To You (Itch/True Life Entertainment) ===Singles=== #\\"Power of Love\\" (1974) - USA #76 #\\"Wild Night\\" (1974) - AUS #95 #\\"Love Blind\\" (1975) #\\"I'm Not Leaving\\" with Crystal Method (2012) ==References* *Motown star Martha Reeves holding 8th spot in Detroit council race *Motown's Reeves advances to Detroit City Council general election Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:African-American female singers Category:American pop singers Category:American soul singers Category:American contraltos Category:MCA Records artists Category:People from Eufaula, Alabama Category:Martha and the Vandellas members Category:Detroit City Council members Category:Women in Michigan politics Category:Motown artists Category:Women city councillors in the United States Category:Singers from Detroit ","title":"Martha Reeves"},{"id":"299901","text":"Optical tweezers (originally called single-beam gradient force trap) are scientific instruments that use a highly focused laser beam to hold and move microscopic objects like atoms, nanoparticles and droplets, in a manner similar to tweezers. If the object is held in air or vacuum without additional support, it can be called optical levitation. The laser light provides an attractive or repulsive force (typically on the order of piconewtons), depending on the relative refractive index between particle and surrounding medium. Levitation is possible if the force of the light counters the force of gravity. The trapped particles are usually micron-sized, or smaller. Dielectric and absorbing particles can be trapped, too. Optical tweezers are used in biology and medicine (for example to grab and hold a single bacterium or cell like a sperm cell, blood cell or DNA), nanoengineering and nanochemistry (to study and build materials from single molecules), quantum optics and quantum optomechanics (to study the interaction of single particles with light). The development of optical tweezing by Arthur Ashkin was lauded with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. ==History and development== The detection of optical scattering and gradient forces on micron sized particles was first reported in 1970 by Arthur Ashkin, a scientist working at Bell Labs. Years later, Ashkin and colleagues reported the first observation of what is now commonly referred to as an optical tweezer: a tightly focused beam of light capable of holding microscopic particles stable in three dimensions. In 2018, Ashkin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this development. One of the authors of this seminal 1986 paper, Steven Chu, would go on to use optical tweezing in his work on cooling and trapping neutral atoms. This research earned Chu the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Claude Cohen- Tannoudji and William D. Phillips.Hill, Murray (November 1987). \\"He wrote the book on atom trapping\\". Retrieved June 25, 2005. Interview conducted for internal newsletter at Bell Labs. Contains confirmation of Ashkin as the inventor of optical trapping and provides information on the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics. In an interview, Steven Chu described how Ashkin had first envisioned optical tweezing as a method for trapping atoms.\\"Conversations with History: An Interview with Steven Chu\\" (2004), Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley. Last accessed on September 2, 2006. Ashkin was able to trap larger particles (10 to 10,000 nanometers in diameter) but it fell to Chu to extend these techniques to the trapping of neutral atoms (0.1 nanometers in diameter) utilizing resonant laser light and a magnetic gradient trap (cf. Magneto-optical trap). In the late 1980s, Arthur Ashkin and Joseph M. Dziedzic demonstrated the first application of the technology to the biological sciences, using it to trap an individual tobacco mosaic virus and Escherichia coli bacterium. Throughout the 1990s and afterwards, researchers like Carlos Bustamante, James Spudich, and Steven Block pioneered the use of optical trap force spectroscopy to characterize molecular-scale biological motors. These molecular motors are ubiquitous in biology, and are responsible for locomotion and mechanical action within the cell. Optical traps allowed these biophysicists to observe the forces and dynamics of nanoscale motors at the single-molecule level; optical trap force-spectroscopy has since led to greater understanding of the stochastic nature of these force-generating molecules. Optical tweezers have proven useful in other areas of biology as well. They are used in synthetic biology to construct tissue-like networks of artificial cells, and to fuse synthetic membranes together to initiate biochemical reactions. They are also widely employed in genetic studies and research on chromosome structure and dynamics. In 2003 the techniques of optical tweezers were applied in the field of cell sorting; by creating a large optical intensity pattern over the sample area, cells can be sorted by their intrinsic optical characteristics.Koss BA, Grier DG, \\"Optical Peristalsis\\" Optical tweezers have also been used to probe the cytoskeleton, measure the visco-elastic properties of biopolymers, and study cell motility. A bio-molecular assay in which clusters of ligand coated nano-particles are both optically trapped and optically detected after target molecule induced clustering was proposed in 2011 and experimentally demonstrated in 2013. The Kapitsa‚ÄìDirac effect effectively demonstrated during 2001 uses standing waves of light to affect a beam of particles. Researchers have also worked to convert optical tweezers from large, complex instruments to smaller, simpler ones, for use by those with smaller research budgets. ==Physics== Dielectric objects are attracted to the center of the beam, slightly above the beam waist, as described in the text. The force applied on the object depends linearly on its displacement from the trap center just as with a simple spring system. It is a restoring force and thus equal to -k_\\\\mathrm{trap} x. ===General description=== Optical tweezers are capable of manipulating nanometer and micron-sized dielectric particles by exerting extremely small forces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by sending it through a microscope objective. The narrowest point of the focused beam, known as the beam waist, contains a very strong electric field gradient. Dielectric particles are attracted along the gradient to the region of strongest electric field, which is the center of the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles in the beam along the direction of beam propagation. This is due to conservation of momentum: photons that are absorbed or scattered by the tiny dielectric particle impart momentum to the dielectric particle. This is known as the scattering force and results in the particle being displaced slightly downstream from the exact position of the beam waist, as seen in the figure. Optical traps are very sensitive instruments and are capable of the manipulation and detection of sub-nanometer displacements for sub-micron dielectric particles. For this reason, they are often used to manipulate and study single molecules by interacting with a bead that has been attached to that molecule. DNA and the proteins and enzymes that interact with it are commonly studied in this way. For quantitative scientific measurements, most optical traps are operated in such a way that the dielectric particle rarely moves far from the trap center. The reason for this is that the force applied to the particle is linear with respect to its displacement from the center of the trap as long as the displacement is small. In this way, an optical trap can be compared to a simple spring, which follows Hooke's law. ===Detailed view=== Proper explanation of optical trapping behavior depends upon the size of the trapped particle relative to the wavelength of light used to trap it. In cases where the dimensions of the particle are much greater than the wavelength, a simple ray optics treatment is sufficient. If the wavelength of light far exceeds the particle dimensions, the particles can be treated as electric dipoles in an electric field. For optical trapping of dielectric objects of dimensions within an order of magnitude of the trapping beam wavelength, the only accurate models involve the treatment of either time dependent or time harmonic Maxwell equations using appropriate boundary conditions. ====Ray optics==== Ray optics explanation (unfocused laser). When the bead is displaced from the beam center (right image), the larger momentum change of the more intense rays cause a net force to be applied back toward the center of the laser. When the bead is laterally centered on the beam (left image), the resulting lateral force is zero. But an unfocused laser still causes a force pointing away from the laser. Ray optics explanation (focused laser). In addition to keeping the bead in the center of the laser, a focused laser also keeps the bead in a fixed axial position: The momentum change of the focused rays causes a force towards the laser focus, both when the bead is in front (left image) or behind (right image) the laser focus. So, the bead will stay slightly behind the focus, where this force compensates the scattering force. In cases where the diameter of a trapped particle is significantly greater than the wavelength of light, the trapping phenomenon can be explained using ray optics. As shown in the figure, individual rays of light emitted from the laser will be refracted as it enters and exits the dielectric bead. As a result, the ray will exit in a direction different from which it originated. Since light has a momentum associated with it, this change in direction indicates that its momentum has changed. Due to Newton's third law, there should be an equal and opposite momentum change on the particle. Most optical traps operate with a Gaussian beam (TEM00 mode) profile intensity. In this case, if the particle is displaced from the center of the beam, as in the right part of the figure, the particle has a net force returning it to the center of the trap because more intense beams impart a larger momentum change towards the center of the trap than less intense beams, which impart a smaller momentum change away from the trap center. The net momentum change, or force, returns the particle to the trap center. If the particle is located at the center of the beam, then individual rays of light are refracting through the particle symmetrically, resulting in no net lateral force. The net force in this case is along the axial direction of the trap, which cancels out the scattering force of the laser light. The cancellation of this axial gradient force with the scattering force is what causes the bead to be stably trapped slightly downstream of the beam waist. The standard tweezers works with the trapping laser propagated in the direction of gravityLynn Paterson \\"Novel micromanipulation techniques in optical tweezers\\", (2003) and the inverted tweezers works against gravity. ====Electric dipole approximation==== In cases where the diameter of a trapped particle is significantly smaller than the wavelength of light, the conditions for Rayleigh scattering are satisfied and the particle can be treated as a point dipole in an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field. The force applied on a single charge in an electromagnetic field is known as the Lorentz force, :: \\\\mathbf{F_1}=q\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E_1}+\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x_1}}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right). The force on the dipole can be calculated by substituting two terms for the electric field in the equation above, one for each charge. The polarization of a dipole is \\\\mathbf{p}=q\\\\mathbf{d}, where \\\\mathbf{d} is the distance between the two charges. For a point dipole, the distance is infinitesimal, \\\\mathbf{x}_1-\\\\mathbf{x}_2. Taking into account that the two charges have opposite signs, the force takes the form :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{F} & = q\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E_1}\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right)-\\\\mathbf{E_2}\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right)+\\\\frac{d(\\\\mathbf{x}_1-\\\\mathbf{x}_2)}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = q\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E_1}\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right)+\\\\left((\\\\mathbf{x}_1-\\\\mathbf{x}_2)\\\\cdot abla\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{E}-\\\\mathbf{E_1}\\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right)+\\\\frac{d(\\\\mathbf{x}_1-\\\\mathbf{x}_2)}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right). \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Notice that the \\\\mathbf{E_1} cancel out. Multiplying through by the charge, q , converts position, \\\\mathbf{x} , into polarization, \\\\mathbf{p} , :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{F} & = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot abla\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{E}+\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{p}}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\alpha\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\cdot abla\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{E}+\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{E}}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right], \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where in the second equality, it has been assumed that the dielectric particle is linear (i.e. \\\\mathbf{p}=\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{E} ). In the final steps, two equalities will be used: (1) A Vector Analysis Equality, (2) Faraday's law of induction. :# \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\cdot abla\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{E}= abla\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}E^2\\\\right)-\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\left( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\right) :# abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E}=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{B}}{\\\\partial t} First, the vector equality will be inserted for the first term in the force equation above. Maxwell's equation will be substituted in for the second term in the vector equality. Then the two terms which contain time derivatives can be combined into a single term. :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{F} & = \\\\alpha\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{2} abla E^2-\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\left( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{E}}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\alpha\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{2} abla E^2-\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\left(-\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{B}}{dt}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{E}}{dt}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\alpha\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{2} abla E^2+\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right)\\\\right]. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The second term in the last equality is the time derivative of a quantity that is related through a multiplicative constant to the Poynting vector, which describes the power per unit area passing through a surface. Since the power of the laser is constant when sampling over frequencies much longer than the frequency of the laser's light ~1014 Hz, the derivative of this term averages to zero and the force can be written as :: \\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\alpha abla E^2 = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n_0 a^3}{c}\\\\left(\\\\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\\\\right) abla I(\\\\mathbf{r}), where in the second part we have included the induced dipole moment (in MKS units) of a spherical dielectric particle: \\\\alpha = 4 \\\\pi n_0^2 \\\\epsilon_0 a^3 (m^2 - 1)/(m^2 + 2) \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r},t), where a is the particle radius, n_0 is the index of refraction of the particle and m = n_0/n_1 is the relative refractive index between the particle and the medium. The square of the magnitude of the electric field is equal to the intensity of the beam as a function of position. Therefore, the result indicates that the force on the dielectric particle, when treated as a point dipole, is proportional to the gradient along the intensity of the beam. In other words, the gradient force described here tends to attract the particle to the region of highest intensity. In reality, the scattering force of the light works against the gradient force in the axial direction of the trap, resulting in an equilibrium position that is displaced slightly downstream of the intensity maximum. Under the Rayleigh approximation, we can also write the scattering force as :: \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{scat}}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{k^4 \\\\alpha^2}{6 \\\\pi c n_0^3\\\\epsilon_0^2} I(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\hat{z} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi n_0 k^4 a^6}{3 c} \\\\left(\\\\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\\\\right)^2 I(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\hat{z}. Since the scattering is isotropic, the net momentum is transferred in the forward direction. On the quantum level, we picture the gradient force as forward Rayleigh scattering in which identical photons are created and annihilated concurrently, while in the scattering (radiation) force the incident photons travel in the same direction and ‚Äòscatter‚Äô isotropically. By conservation of momentum, the particle must accumulate the photons' original momenta, causing a forward force in the latter. ====Harmonic potential approximation==== A useful way to study the interaction of an atom in a Gaussian beam is to look at the harmonic potential approximation of the intensity profile the atom experiences. In the case of the two-level atom, the potential experienced is related to its AC Stark Shift, :: \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta E}_{\\\\text{AC Stark}} = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pi c^2 \\\\Gamma \\\\mu}{2 \\\\omega_0^3 \\\\delta} \\\\mathbf{I(r,z)} where \\\\Gamma is the natural line width of the excited state, \\\\mu is the electric dipole coupling, \\\\omega_o is the frequency of the transition, and \\\\delta is the detuning or difference between the laser frequency and the transition frequency. The intensity of a gaussian beam profile is characterized by the wavelength (\\\\lambda), minimum waist (w_o), and power of the beam (P_o). The following formulas define the beam profile: :: I(r,z)=I_0 \\\\left (\\\\frac{w_0}{w(z)}\\\\right ) ^2 e^{-\\\\frac{2 r^2}{w^2(z)}} :: w(z)=w_0 \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{z_R}\\\\right)^2} :: z_R = \\\\frac{\\\\pi w_0^2}{\\\\lambda} ::P_0 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\pi I_0 w_0^2 To approximate this Gaussian potential in both the radial and axial directions of the beam, the intensity profile must be expanded to second order in z and r for r=0 and z=0 respectively and equated to the harmonic potential \\\\frac{1}{2}m(\\\\omega_z^2 z^2 + \\\\omega_r^2 r^2) . These expansions are evaluated assuming fixed power. ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 I}{\\\\partial z^2} \\\\Biggr_{r=0}=\\\\frac{2 P_0 \\\\lambda^2}{\\\\pi^3 w_0^6} z^2=\\\\frac12 m \\\\omega_z^2 z^2 ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 I}{\\\\partial r^2} \\\\Biggr_{z=0}=\\\\frac{4 P_0}{\\\\pi w_0^4} r^2=\\\\frac12 m \\\\omega_r^2 r^2 This means that when solving for the harmonic frequencies (or trap frequencies when considering optical traps for atoms), the frequencies are given as: ::\\\\omega_r = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{8 P_0}{\\\\pi m w_0^4}} ::\\\\omega_z = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4 P_0\\\\lambda^2}{m \\\\pi^3 w_0^6}} so that the relative trap frequencies for the radial and axial directions as a function of only beam waist scale as: ::\\\\frac{\\\\omega_r}{\\\\omega_z}=\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\frac{w_0 \\\\pi}{\\\\lambda} ===Optical levitation=== In order to levitate the particle in air, the downward force of gravity must be countered by the forces stemming from photon momentum transfer. Typically photon radiation pressure of a focused laser beam of enough intensity counters the downward force of gravity while also preventing lateral (side to side) and vertical instabilities to allow for a stable optical trap capable of holding small particles in suspension. Micrometer sized (from several to 50 micrometers in diameter) transparent dielectric spheres such as fused silica spheres, oil or water droplets, are used in this type of experiment. The laser radiation can be fixed in wavelength such as that of an argon ion laser or that of a tunable dye laser. Laser power required is of the order of 1 Watt focused to a spot size of several tens of micrometers. Phenomena related to morphology-dependent resonances in a spherical optical cavity have been studied by several research groups. For a shiny object, such as a metallic micro-sphere, stable optical levitation has not been achieved. Optical levitation of a macroscopic object is also theoretically possible, and can be enhanced with nano-structuring. Materials that have been successfully levitated include Black liquor, aluminum oxide, tungsten, and nickel. ==Setups== A generic optical tweezer diagram with only the most basic components. The most basic optical tweezer setup will likely include the following components: a laser (usually Nd:YAG), a beam expander, some optics used to steer the beam location in the sample plane, a microscope objective and condenser to create the trap in the sample plane, a position detector (e.g. quadrant photodiode) to measure beam displacements and a microscope illumination source coupled to a CCD camera. An Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm wavelength) is a common choice of laser for working with biological specimens. This is because such specimens (being mostly water) have a low absorption coefficient at this wavelength. A low absorption is advisable so as to minimise damage to the biological material, sometimes referred to as opticution. Perhaps the most important consideration in optical tweezer design is the choice of the objective. A stable trap requires that the gradient force, which is dependent upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically have an NA between 1.2 and 1.4. While alternatives are available, perhaps the simplest method for position detection involves imaging the trapping laser exiting the sample chamber onto a quadrant photodiode. Lateral deflections of the beam are measured similarly to how it is done using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Expanding the beam emitted from the laser to fill the aperture of the objective will result in a tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the microscope slide, most tweezer setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as \\"Beam Steering\\" in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the lateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap, can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the end result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.Shaevitz JW, \\"A Practical Guide to Optical Trapping\\" (August 22, 2006). Last accessed on September 12, 2006. Visualization of the sample plane is usually accomplished through illumination via a separate light source coupled into the optical path in the opposite direction using dichroic mirrors. This light is incident on a CCD camera and can be viewed on an external monitor or used for tracking the trapped particle position via video tracking. ===Alternative laser beam modes=== The majority of optical tweezers make use of conventional TEM00 Gaussian beams. However a number of other beam types have been used to trap particles, including high order laser beams i.e. Hermite-Gaussian beams (TEMxy), Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams (TEMpl) and Bessel beams. Optical tweezers based on Laguerre-Gaussian beams have the unique capability of trapping particles that are optically reflective and absorptive. Laguerre-Gaussian beams also possess a well-defined orbital angular momentum that can rotate particles.Curtis JE, Grier DG, \\"Structure of Optical Vortices\\" (2003). Last accessed on September 3, 2006.Padgett M, \\"Optical Spanners\\". Last accessed on September 3, 2006. This is accomplished without external mechanical or electrical steering of the beam. Both zero and higher order Bessel Beams also possess a unique tweezing ability. They can trap and rotate multiple particles that are millimeters apart and even around obstacles.McGloin D, Garces-Chavez V, Paterson L, Carruthers T, Melvil H, Dholakia K, \\"Bessel Beams\\". Last accessed on September 3, 2006. Micromachines can be driven by these unique optical beams due to their intrinsic rotating mechanism due to the spin and orbital angular momentum of light. ===Multiplexed optical tweezers=== A typical setup uses one laser to create one or two traps. Commonly, two traps are generated by splitting the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized beams. Optical tweezing operations with more than two traps can be realized either by time-sharing a single laser beam among several optical tweezers, or by diffractively splitting the beam into multiple traps. With acousto-optic deflectors or galvanometer-driven mirrors, a single laser beam can be shared among hundreds of optical tweezers in the focal plane, or else spread into an extended one-dimensional trap. Specially designed diffractive optical elements can divide a single input beam into hundreds of continuously illuminated traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations. The trap-forming hologram also can specify the mode structure of each trap individually, thereby creating arrays of optical vortices, optical tweezers, and holographic line traps, for example. When implemented with a spatial light modulator, such holographic optical traps also can move objects in three dimensions. Advanced forms of holographic optical traps with arbitrary spatial profiles, where smoothness of the intensity and the phase are controlled, find applications in many areas of science, from micromanipulation to ultracold atoms. ===Single mode optical fibers=== The standard fiber optical trap relies on the same principle as the optical trapping, but with the Gaussian laser beam delivered through an optical fiber. If one end of the optical fiber is molded into a lens-like facet, the nearly gaussian beam carried by a single mode standard fiber will be focused at some distance from the fiber tip. The effective Numerical Aperture of such assembly is usually not enough to allow for a full 3D optical trap but only for a 2D trap (optical trapping and manipulation of objects will be possible only when, e.g., they are in contact with a surface ). A true 3D optical trapping based on a single fiber, with a trapping point which is not in nearly contact with the fiber tip, has been realized based on a not-standard annular-core fiber arrangement and a total-internal-reflection geometry. On the other hand, if the ends of the fiber are not moulded, the laser exiting the fiber will be diverging and thus a stable optical trap can only be realised by balancing the gradient and the scattering force from two opposing ends of the fiber. The gradient force will trap the particles in the transverse direction, while the axial optical force comes from the scattering force of the two counter propagating beams emerging from the two fibers. The equilibrium z-position of such a trapped bead is where the two scattering forces equal each other. This work was pioneered by A. Constable et al., Opt. Lett. 18,1867 (1993), and followed by J.Guck et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5451 (2000), who made use of this technique to stretch microparticles. By manipulating the input power into the two ends of the fiber, there will be an increase of an \\"optical stretching\\" that can be used to measure viscoelastic properties of cells, with sensitivity sufficient to distinguish between different individual cytoskeletal phenotypes. i.e. human erythrocytes and mouse fibroblasts. A recent test has seen great success in differentiating cancerous cells from non-cancerous ones from the two opposed, non-focused laser beams. ===Multimode fiber-based traps=== The Optical Cell Rotator is a fiber based laser trap that can hold and precisely orient living cells for tomographic microscopy. While earlier version of fiber-based laser traps exclusively used single mode beams, M. Kreysing and colleagues recently showed that the careful excitation of further optical modes in a short piece of optical fiber allows the realization of non-trivial trapping geometries. By this the researchers were able to orient various human cell types (individual cells and clusters) on a microscope. The main advantage of the so-called \\"optical cell rotator\\" technology over standard optical tweezers is the decoupling of trapping from imaging optics. This, its modular design, and the high compatibility of divergent laser traps with biological material indicates the great potential of this new generation of laser traps in medical research and life science. Recently, the optical cell rotator technology was implemented on the basis of adaptive optics, allowing to dynamically reconfigure the optical trap during operation and adapt it to the sample. ===Cell sorting=== One of the more common cell-sorting systems makes use of flow cytometry through fluorescence imaging. In this method, a suspension of biologic cells is sorted into two or more containers, based upon specific fluorescent characteristics of each cell during an assisted flow. By using an electrical charge that the cell is \\"trapped\\" in, the cells are then sorted based on the fluorescence intensity measurements. The sorting process is undertaken by an electrostatic deflection system that diverts cells into containers based upon their charge. In the optically actuated sorting process, the cells are flowed through into an optical landscape i.e. 2D or 3D optical lattices. Without any induced electrical charge, the cells would sort based on their intrinsic refractive index properties and can be re-configurability for dynamic sorting. An optical lattice can be created using diffractive optics and optical elements. On the other hand, K. Ladavac et al. used a spatial light modulator to project an intensity pattern to enable the optical sorting process. K. Xiao and D. G. Grier applied holographic video microscopy to demonstrate that this technique can sort colloidal spheres with part-per-thousand resolution for size and refractive index. The main mechanism for sorting is the arrangement of the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By shifting the arrangement of the optical lattice point, there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency. Competition of the forces in the sorting environment need fine tuning to succeed in high efficient optical sorting. The need is mainly with regards to the balance of the forces; drag force due to fluid flow and optical gradient force due to arrangement of intensity spot. Scientists at the University of St. Andrews have received considerable funding from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for an optical sorting machine. This new technology could rival the conventional fluorescence-activated cell sorting.\\"Optical fractionation and sorting.\\", IRC Scotland. Last accessed on September 3, 2006. ===Evanescent fields=== An evanescent field is a residue optical field that \\"leaks\\" during total internal reflection. This \\"leaking\\" of light fades off at an exponential rate. The evanescent field has found a number of applications in nanometer resolution imaging (microscopy); optical micromanipulation (optical tweezers) are becoming ever more relevant in research. In optical tweezers, a continuous evanescent field can be created when light is propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple total internal reflection). The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity on the order of 100 nanometers. This direct coupling of the field is treated as a type of photon tunnelling across the gap from prism to microparticles. The result is a directional optical propelling force. A recent updated version of the evanescent field optical tweezers makes use of extended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide a large number of particles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed as Lensless Optical Trapping (\\"LOT\\"). The orderly movement of the particles is aided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical potential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are propelled by the evanescent field while being trapped by the linear bright fringes. At the moment, there are scientists working on focused evanescent fields as well. Another approach that has been recently proposed makes use of surface plasmons, which is an enhanced evanescent wave localized at a metal/dielectric interface. The enhanced force field experienced by colloidal particles exposed to surface plasmons at a flat metal/dielectric interface has been for the first time measured using a photonic force microscope, the total force magnitude being found 40 times stronger compared to a normal evanescent wave. By patterning the surface with gold microscopic islands it is possible to have selective and parallel trapping in these islands. The forces of the latter optical tweezers lie in the femtonewton range. The evanescent field can also be used to trap cold atoms and molecules near the surface of an optical waveguide or optical nanofiber. ===Indirect approach=== Ming Wu, a UC Berkeley Professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences invented the new optoelectronic tweezers. Wu transformed the optical energy from low powered light emitting diodes (LED) into electrical energy via a photoconductive surface. The idea is to allow the LED to switch on and off the photoconductive material via its fine projection. As the optical pattern can be easily transformable through optical projection, this method allows a high flexibility of switching different optical landscapes. The manipulation/tweezing process is done by the variations between the electric field actuated by the light pattern. The particles will be either attracted or repelled from the actuated point due to its induced electrical dipole. Particles suspended in a liquid will be susceptible to the electrical field gradient, this is known as dielectrophoresis. One clear advantage is that the electrical conductivity is different between different kinds of cells. Living cells have a lower conductive medium while the dead ones have minimum or no conductive medium. The system may be able to manipulate roughly 10,000 cells or particles at the same time. See comments by Professor Kishan Dholakia on this new technique, K. Dholakia, Nature Materials 4, 579‚Äì580 (01 Aug 2005) News and Views. \\"The system was able to move live E. coli bacteria and 20-micrometre-wide particles, using an optical power output of less than 10 microwatts. This is one-hundred-thousandth of the power needed for [direct] optical tweezers\\".Invention: Soldiers obeying odours, New Scientist, 8 November 2005 ===Optical binding=== When a cluster of microparticles are trapped within a monochromatic laser beam, the organization of the microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such we can say that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation. ===Fluorescence optical tweezers=== In order to simultaneously manipulate and image samples that exhibit fluorescence, optical tweezers can be built alongside a fluorescence microscope. Such instruments are particularly useful when it comes to studying single or small numbers of biological molecules that have been fluorescently labelled, or in applications in which fluorescence is used to track and visualize objects that are to be trapped. This approach has been extended for simultaneous sensing and imaging of dynamic protein complexes using long and strong tethers generated by a highly efficient multi- step enzymatic approach and applied to investigations of disaggregation machines in action. == See also == * Levitation * List of laser articles * Quantum optics * Atom optics * Quantum control ==References== ==External links== * Video: Levitating DIAMONDS with a laser beam Category:Levitation Category:Photonics Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Molecular biology Category:Cell biology Category:Biophysics Category:Optical trapping Category:1986 introductions Category:Force lasers ","title":"Optical tweezers"},{"id":"299903","text":"Bachelor of Laws (; LL.B.) is an undergraduate law degree in the United Kingdom and most common law jurisdictionsexcept the United States and Canada.Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,\\" Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996. It historically served this purpose in North America as well but was phased out in favour of the Juris Doctor degree.Historically, in Canada, Bachelor of Laws was the name of the first degree in common law, but is also the name of the first degree in Quebec civil law awarded by a number of Quebec universities. Canadian common-law LL.B. programmes were, in practice, second-entry professional degrees, meaning that the vast majority of those admitted to an LL.B. programme were already holders of one or more degrees, or, at a minimum (with very few exceptions), have completed two years of study in a first-entry, undergraduate degree in another discipline. Bachelor of Laws is also the name of the law degree awarded by universities in Ghana, Nigeria, Scotland, South Africa, Israel, Argentina, Brazil and Zambia. ==History of academic degrees== The first academic degrees were all law degrees in medieval universities, and the first law degrees were doctorates.de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde: A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages, Cambridge University Press, 1992, The foundations of the first universities were the glossators of the 11th century, which were also schools of law.Herbermann, et al. (1915). Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed 26 May 2008. The first university, that of Bologna, was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the glossator school in that city. The University of Bologna served as the model for other law schools of the medieval age.Garc√≠a y Garc√≠a, A. (1992). \\"The Faculties of Law,\\" A History of the University in Europe, London: Cambridge University Press. Accessed 26 May 2008. While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of Roman law (except for certain jurisdictions such as the Admiralty Court) and, although the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge did teach canon law until the English Reformation, its importance was always superior to civil law in those institutions.Garc√≠a y Garc√≠a (1992), 390. ==Origin of the LL.B.== \\"LL.B.\\" stands for in Latin. The \\"LL.\\" of the abbreviation for the degree is from the genitive plural (\\"of laws\\"). Creating an abbreviation for a plural, especially from Latin, is often done by doubling the first letter (e.g., \\"pp.\\" for \\"pages\\"). It is sometimes erroneously called \\"Bachelor of Legal Letters\\" to account for the double \\"L\\". The bachelor's degree originated at the University of Paris, whose system was implemented at Oxford and Cambridge. The \\"arts\\" designation of the degree traditionally signifies that the student has undertaken a certain amount of study of the classics. In continental Europe the bachelor's degree was phased out in the 18th or early 19th century but it continued at Oxford and Cambridge. The teaching of law at Oxford University was for philosophical or scholarly purposes and not meant to prepare one to practise law. Professional training for practising common law in England was undertaken at the Inns of Court, but over time the training functions of the Inns lessened considerably and apprenticeships with individual practitioners arose as the prominent medium of preparation. However, because of the lack of standardization of study and of objective standards for appraisal of these apprenticeships, the role of universities became subsequently of importance for the education of lawyers in the English speaking world. In England in 1292 when Edward I first requested that lawyers be trained, students merely sat in the courts and observed, but over time the students would hire professionals to lecture them in their residences, which led to the institution of the Inns of Court system. The original method of education at the Inns of Court was a mix of moot court-like practice and lecture, as well as court proceedings observation. By the seventeenth century, the Inns obtained a status as a kind of university akin to the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, though very specialized in purpose. With the frequent absence of parties to suits during the Crusades, the importance of the lawyer role grew tremendously, and the demand for lawyers grew. Traditionally Oxford and Cambridge did not see common law as worthy of study, and included coursework in law only in the context of canon and civil law and for the purpose of the study of philosophy or history only. The apprenticeship programme for solicitors thus emerged, structured and governed by the same rules as the apprenticeship programmes for the trades. The training of solicitors by apprenticeship was formally established by an act of parliament in 1729. William Blackstone became the first lecturer in English common law at the University of Oxford in 1753, but the university did not establish the programme for the purpose of professional study, and the lectures were very philosophical and theoretical in nature. Blackstone insisted that the study of law should be university based, where concentration on foundational principles can be had, instead of concentration on detail and procedure had through apprenticeship and the Inns of Court.Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775, 793 (2003). The Inns of Court continued but became less effective and admission to the bar still did not require any significant educational activity or examination, therefore in 1846 the Parliament examined the education and training of prospective barristers and found the system to be inferior to the legal education provided in the United States. Therefore, formal schools of law were called for, but not finally established until later in the century, and even then the bar did not consider a university degree in admission decisions. When law degrees were required by the English bar and bar associations in other common law countries, the LL.B. became the uniform degree for lawyers in common law countries. ==Structure of LL.B. programmes== Historically, law students studied both canon law and civil law. Today, this is much less common among common law countries, who now study the English-derived common law system, which includes the criminal law of most jurisdictions. However, a few institutions continue to offer alternatives to strictly English common law: for example Cardiff University's Department of Canon (Ecclesiastical) Law, or combined programmes in common and French civil law (pertinent to Canada's bijuridical system) at McGill University and University of Ottawa. ===Common law jurisdictions in general=== In most common law countries (with the exceptions of all Canadian provinces except Quebec, and the U.S.), the Bachelor of Laws programme is generally entered directly after completion of secondary school. In England and Wales it is also possible to study a programme for conversion to the legal profession following completion of a previous undergraduate degree unrelated to law (the Graduate Diploma in Law), which entitles graduates to take the vocational courses for entry into the legal profession. Master's degree courses are also offered to university graduates; those who graduate from such courses are entitled to use the initials LL.M. (Master of Laws). ===Australia=== A qualifying law degree for the purposes of admission as a lawyer in Australia is either the undergraduate LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) programmes at accredited universities recognised by the admission board of the respective state, or the graduate J.D. (Juris Doctor). Every recognised qualification of each admission board is reciprocally recognised. However, prior to degrees, there existed an alternative to a degree to become a lawyer in Australia, which was either the Barrister's Admission Board, or the Solicitor's Admission Board, whose examinations rendered one eligible to be admitted respectively, the successor of these boards that still operates this alternative is the Legal Profession Admission Board which issues the distinct Diploma in Law which is equivalent to either an LL.B. or a J.D. Law degrees typically last 4 years for undergraduate admission or 3 years for university graduates. Additionally, of the thirty-eight law schools, thirteen of those universities have also started offering the Juris Doctor (J.D.) as a graduate-entry degree. ===Bangladesh=== In Bangladesh, as in other common-law countries, obtaining a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree is a prerequisite for practising as an advocate in a court of law. Both LL.B. and LL.B. (Hons.) degrees are offered at public and private universities. Only seven public universities offer LL.B. (Hons.) degree. These universities also offer one-year LL.M. courses. Some private universities also offer four-year LL.B. (Hons.) degrees and one-year LL.M. courses. The National University of Bangladesh also offers a two-year LL.B. degree to graduates of subjects other than law. But remarkably, the department of Law, University of Rajshahi is the first institute in South Asia to offer bachelors degree in law with honors as B. Jur.(Bachelor of Jurisprudence) and M. Jur. (Masters of Jurisprudence) from 1970 (not offered in the years 1971 & 1972). https://forum.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/index.php?topic=26376.0 Later on they were replaced with LL. B (Hons.) and LL. M degree respectively. This institute is considered the leading institute to study legal science in Bangladesh having a great number of alumni and former members of the faculty around the world including former president, chief justice, ministers of several governments and many of the former and current judges of the apex courts and the courts of the lower judiciary of Bangladesh and many more formidable legal minds of the country. As per the number of participants in the admission tests, this is considered as one of the most desirable choices for the High school/college students of Bangladesh. ===Canada=== Canada has two legal systems. The Province of Quebec uses a civil law system. At the federal level, as well as in every province or territory except Quebec, a system of common law is used. Because of this, there are two types of Canadian law degrees generally in use. ==== Common law ==== The programme of study for common law has traditionally been an undergraduate LL.B. degree, which has now been re- designated as a J.D. at nearly all Canadian common law schools. Entrants to the J.D. programme generally hold an undergraduate degree before registration in the law programme and a significant number hold a graduate-level degree as well. However, admission may be granted to applicants with two years of undergraduate studies towards a degree. Unlike the United States, the J.D. is considered a bachelor's degree-level qualification, albeit a \\"second-entry\\" one. The common law programme is three years in length. Upon graduation, one holds a Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor degree, but cannot yet practise law. To practise law, the graduate must obtain a licence from the Law Society of the province where they wish to practise law, which also requires a year of articling. Those law graduates wishing to become law professors instead of lawyers often obtain a more advanced academic degree, such as the Master of Laws (LL.M.) or the Doctor of Laws (LL.D., S.J.D. or D.C.L.). ==== Civil law ==== The civil law programme in Canada is three years in length. The programme of study for the first degree in Quebec civil law (called LL.B., B.C.L. or LL.L.) is a first-entry degree programme. Like other first-entry university programmes in Quebec, it requires a college diploma for entry. Law schools that offer civil law B.C.L., LL.B., or LL.L. degrees include McGill University, Universit√© de Montr√©al, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, Universit√© de Sherbrooke, Universit√© Laval and the University of Ottawa. ==== Bijuridical ==== Because of Canada's dual system of laws, some law schools offer joint or dual degrees in common law and civil law: McGill University, Universit√© de Montr√©al, Universit√© de Sherbrooke and the University of Ottawa. The law degree offered by McGill University is a mandatory joint common law LL.B. / Quebec civil law B.C.L. degree. The programme is four years in length. Admission to that programme is a first-entry programme in the case of Quebec students (as a college diploma is required) while it is a second-entry programme in the case of students from other provinces (since two years of university studies is required‚Äîeffectively one extra year of studies more than for a college diploma). The University of Ottawa offers a civil law degree (LL.L.) on its own. A number of Canadian law schools offer students the opportunity to earn, besides their three-year first degrees in common law, programmes in common law for holders of baccalaureate degrees in Quebec civil law enabling those individuals to earn the LL.B. in common law in two or three semesters, depending on the offering university's programme. Similarly, the University of Ottawa offers, besides its three-year LL.L. programme in Quebec civil law, a one-year LL.L. programme in Quebec civil law for holders of an LL.B. or J.D. degree in common law from a Canadian law school. Additionally, some Canadian universities with common law law schools have an arrangement with a Canadian university with a Quebec civil law law school enabling students to obtain the home school's law degree in three years and the exchange school's law degree in the fourth year. ===Hong Kong=== In Hong Kong, three universities, including The University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and City University of Hong Kong, provide legal studies with both LL.B. degree or J.D. degree, where the former is for students right after secondary school, and the latter is for the degree holders. LL.B. is 4 years in length, while J.D. is 2 years. Students who had an LL.B. or J.D degree, whether conferred by local universities or the accredited universities overseas, would be eligible to apply for admission to PCLL, the legal qualification programme in Hong Kong. On top of LL.B., University of Hong Kong offers a variety of Mixed-Degree programmes that allow students to take a first degree and then have an option to take a conjunctive law degree, including Bachelor of Business Administration (Law) (abbreviated as \\"BBA(Law)&LLB;\\", or as B-Law), Bachelor of Social Science (Government & Laws) (\\"BSocSc(Govt&Laws;)&LLB;\\", or as G-Law), and Bachelor of Arts (Literary Studies) (\\"BA&LLB;\\", or as A-Law). Previous mixed-Degree programme also includes Bachelor of Engineering (Civil Engineering). ===India=== In India, legal education is traditionally offered as a three-year graduate degree conferring the title of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B./B.L.), requiring prospective students to have a bachelor's degree in any subject from a recognised institution. However, specialised universities of law known as National Law Schools solely devoted to legal education offer an undergraduate five-year law course for students that have completed Class XII from a recognised board of education in India. The five-year law course leads to an integrated honours degree combining the LL.B. degree with another bachelor's degree, such as a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Social Work. In these programs, students are taught subjects associated with the additional non-law bachelor's degree during the first two years, in addition to standard legal subjects such as torts, contracts and constitutional law, such as social sciences for the Bachelor of Arts and a combination of physical, life and applied sciences for the Bachelor of Science. In the latter three years of all these programmes, legal subjects dominate the curriculum. The first National Law School was the National Law School of India University. This was followed by others including the Nalsar University of Law and West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences were established. Today, many Indian universities offer five-year integrated BA LL.B. programmes similar to that of the National Law Schools of India while others continue to offer a traditional three-year programme. Both integrated and traditional types of three years law degrees are recognised by the Bar Council of India for to qualify for enrollment to the Bar. Though, one need to have a full time Law degree to practice as a lawyer in India. Bar Council of India considers only full time Law degrees programmes. Hence, distance or online education options are available to become a practicing lawyer in India. ===Malaysia=== Malaysia inherited a common law system from the British colonial period. However, unlike the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, Malaysia adopted the fused legal profession with legal practitioners acting both as solicitors and in a way \\"barristers\\". Hence all are lawyers eligible and can be admitted to the High Court as a legal professional is entitled to be bestowed with the title \\"Advocate & Solicitor\\". This applies to both lawyers practising in the Peninsular Malaysia (Malaya) and the States of Sabah & Sarawak. Under the Legal Profession Act 1976, a person is deemed to be a qualified person to be admitted as an Advocate & Solicitor if they completed and passed the course of Bar Vocational Course in UK & Wales from any Inns of Court, passed the Certificate in Legal Practice or completed a 4-year LL.B. (Honours) course from any of the following Universities:- *University of Malaya *National University of Malaysia *International Islamic University of Malaysia *Mara Technological Institute University *Malaysia Multimedia University *Malaysian Northern University *Sultan Zainal Abidin University ===New Zealand=== An LL.B. is required to be able to practice law in New Zealand. An LL.B. typically takes four years to complete after high school, and is often combined with another degree program, such as a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) or Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Most New Zealand universities allow graduates of other degrees to complete an LL.B. in three years. Six New Zealand universities offer LL.B. programmes: * University of Auckland * Auckland University of Technology * University of Waikato * Victoria University of Wellington * University of Canterbury * University of Otago ===Pakistan=== Pakistan is a common law country and to become a lawyer in Pakistan, one needs a law degree usually called LL.B. from a Pakistani or a foreign university from common law country recognized by the Pakistan Bar Council. Lawyers in Pakistan are called advocates. An advocate has to be member of one of the provincial Bar Councils, i.e., Punjab Bar Council, Sindh Bar Council, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, Balochistan Bar Council or the Islamabad Bar Council. The Bachelor of Laws obtained from universities in Pakistan consists of a 5-year B.A.-LL.B. qualification. This rule was laid down by the Pakistan Bar Council in 2016 requiring 5 years of education to obtain a Bachelor of Laws qualification. This change in the legal education rules led to the abolishing of 3 year LL.B. programs being offered by universities in Pakistan. This rule however does not affect the recognition of LL.B. degrees of less than 5 years obtained from foreign universities recognized by the Pakistan Bar Council for the purposes of enrolling as an advocate in Pakistan. ===Singapore=== In Singapore, the LL.B. is an undergraduate degree that is conferred by the National University of Singapore (NUS), the Singapore Management University (SMU) or the Singapore University of Social Sciences after four years of study. Three-year graduate degrees are also offered by NUS with its LL.B. (Honours) course, and SMU with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) course. To be called to the Singapore Bar, graduates are minimally required to possess a LLB with a lower second-class honours from NUS or a grade point average of 3.00 from SMU. ===South Africa=== University of Pretoria Faculty of Law In South Africa the LL.B. is offered both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. As of 1996 it is the universal and only legal qualification for legal practice, superseding the existing B.Juris and B.Proc degrees. The undergraduate programme, offered since 1998, requires four years of study. At the postgraduate level, the programme generally requires three years. Several South African universities offer B.A. and BCom degrees with a major in \\"Law\\", and these graduates then undertake a two-year postgraduate-programme. Some universities also offer a one-year programme for holders of the BProc degree. The curriculum is typically structured around preliminary, core and advanced courses, and most universities also offer elective coursework. The preliminary courses acquaint the students with both the background and the foundations of the South African legal system, and with legal thinking and analysis in general. The core subjects are those regularly required for legal practice. The advanced courses (usually) comprise further study in these core subjects, deepening and / or broadening the student's knowledge as appropriate. The electives ‚Äì often comprising these advanced courses, amongst others ‚Äì allow students to specialise in a particular area of law, to an extent, by choosing from a range of optional courses. Some universities also require that students complete an experience based course (\\"Practical Legal Studies\\" / \\"Law clinic\\"); a credit comprising independent research exclusively is often offered as an elective, and at some universities is a degree requirement. The undergraduate LL.B. may depart from this structure. Depending on university, the curriculum will comprise legal subjects exclusively, or may include humanities subjects so as to prepare graduates with a \\"broad-based\\" legal education. Some undergraduate programmes do not offer any optional coursework. Credits in English and Afrikaans are also often included. Along with Latin, these were, but are no longer, \\"subjects compelled by statute\\", and were typically entrance requirements for the LL.B., having been studied as undergraduate modules. Similarly, Roman Law was previously a preliminary course, whereas, in both the post- and undergraduate degree, it is now offered as an elective. Note that the structure of the undergraduate programme is under review. The issues noted are: graduates of these programmes are seen to be less prepared for the profession as compared to those pursuing the graduate LLB; only 20% of entrants complete the programme within four years; only about 50% of graduates here enter the legal profession at all.See for example: The declining South African LLB, finweek.com; Low-skilled lawyers prompt calls for law degree reform, University World News. Further, there are those who question the academic standard of the new degree.Scrap 4 year LLB degree ‚Äì Ngoepe, news24.com. Some universities have now discontinued the programme;University of the Witwatersrand: Changes to undergraduate LLB. , wits.ac.za in other cases undergraduate students are required to initially register as Arts, Commerce or Science students ‚Äì with first year law subjects ‚Äì and, in the second year of study, only those meeting specified criteria may choose to pursue the four-year LLB.Rhodes University: Law Degree Structure: BACHELOR OF LAWS (LLB) , ru.ac.za. ==Lawyers== Upon completion of the LL.B. degree (or its equivalent), graduates are generally qualified to apply for membership of the bar or law society. The membership eligibility bestowed may be subject to completion of professional exams. A student may have to gain a further qualification at postgraduate level, for example a traineeship and the Legal Practice Course or Bar Vocational Course in England and Wales or the Postgraduate Certificate in Laws in Hong Kong. In Australia some LL.B. graduates practice as a solicitor or barrister, while others work in academia, for the government or for a private company (i.e. not as a practicing solicitor or barrister). For LL.B. graduates who do choose to practice law, in some states of Australia (namely, Victoria and New South Wales), LL.B. graduates are required to undertake a 1-year articled clerkship or the Legal Practice Course (commonly Practical Legal Training or PLT) before applying for registration as a solicitor. In other states, (namely, South Australia) an LL.B. graduate is required to undertake a 6-week PLT course before applying to be admitted to the bar as a barrister and solicitor. Depending on the state where a lawyer is admitted to practice, membership in the Bar may be either restricted to barristers or open to both solicitors and barristers. In the states that maintain as split Bar system, barristers are a separate and distinct profession to that of a solicitor, and entry is attained through the successful completion of an exam and a 9-month reading period (in other words, tutelage) under a senior barrister. In Canada, the lawyer licensing process usually requires the law graduate to (1) take further classroom law courses taught by the Law Society itself and pass a related set of written examinations, known as bar exams, and (2) undertake an articled clerkship, commonly known as articling, under the supervision of an established lawyer called a principal. The vast majority of law graduates article (i.e. work and learn) in a law firm, a government legal department, an in-house legal department of a business corporation, a community legal clinic or some other type of non-profit organization involved in legal work. However, a small minority of law graduates (with exceptional academic records) undertake instead a judicial clerkship with a specific court and under the supervision of a judge instead of working in a more \\"lawyer-type environment\\". In either articling or clerkship, there is the expectation that the law graduate will work in a variety of legal fields and be exposed to the realities of legal practice that are absent from law school's academic atmosphere. For example, the licensing process for the Law Society of Ontario (the Province's governing law society) consists of three mandatory components: The Skills and Professional Responsibility Program with assignments and assessments, Licensing Examinations (a Barrister Licensing Examination and a Solicitor Licensing Examination), and a 10-month Articling term. At the conclusion of the licensing process, the law graduate is \\"called to the bar,\\" whereby they sign their name in the Rolls of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the Superior Court of Justice and swears lawyer-related oaths in a formal ceremony where they must appear in a complete barrister's gown and bow before judges of the local superior court and benchers of the licensing law society. After the call ceremony, they can designate themself as a \\"Barrister and Solicitor\\", and can practice law in that province. Licensed lawyers may also exercise the powers of a Commissioner of Oaths. In the Province of British Columbia, licensed lawyers are automatically qualified to practice as a notary public subject to appointment. In Ontario and other provinces, a licensed lawyer must submit a form and pay a one-time fee to the provincial attorney general before they are appointed as a notary public. Although not required by the licensing process, many first- and second-year law students work in law firms during the summer off-school season to earn extra money and to guarantee themselves an articling position (with the same law firms) upon their graduation from law school, because there is always fierce competition for articling positions, especially for those in large law firms offering attractive remuneration and prestige, and a law graduate cannot become a licensed lawyer in Canada if they have not gone through articled clerkship. ==Alternative titles and formats== ===Irish B.C.L. and LL.B.=== The four universities under the National University of Ireland (NUI) umbrella, award the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.). These are University College Cork, University College Dublin, NUI Maynooth and NUIG. Four Irish universities and two Northern Irish universities (the University of Dublin; NUIG; Queen's University Belfast; the University of Limerick; National University of Ireland, Maynooth and the University of Ulster) award an LL.B. NUIG offer the LL.B. as a 1-year postgraduate course for holders of the B.Corp. (Bachelor of Corporate Law) or B.A. Law degrees. University College Cork and the University of Limerick offer a two-year postgraduate LL.B. degree to outstanding non-law graduates. These courses are King's Inns approved. Institute of Technology, Carlow, Institute of Technology, Waterford and Institute of Technology, Letterkenny also offer an LL.B. degree programme. Two English universities (University of the West of England and Nottingham Trent University) and one Welsh university (University of Wales) award the LL.B. in Ireland as a professional degree in law (the latter three are run via local private colleges). (Independent Colleges LL.B.(Hons) in Irish Law is conferred by the University of the West of England, LL.B.(Hons) in Irish Law at Dublin Business School is jointly validated by HETAC and the University of Wales and the LL.B. in Griffith College Dublin and Griffith College Cork is jointly validated by HETAC and Nottingham Trent University.) Ireland is a common law jurisdiction (in fact there are two common law jurisdictions on the island) and the expression \\"civil law\\" is used to differentiate common law from ecclesiastical law or Canon Law in the republic. In the nineteenth century, the University of London conferred degrees of LL.B. on clerical and lay students at St. Patrick's College, Carlow from 1840 onwards. The King's Inns Barrister-at-Law degree B.L. is a postgraduate degree and is required to practice as a barrister in Ireland. ===Zimbabwe B.L. and LL.B.=== At the University of Zimbabwe, the first degree in common law is the Bachelor of Laws (B.L.), which is equivalent to the LL.B. in other common law jurisdictions. It is followed by a one-year programme at the university (analogous to post-LL.B. vocational programmes in other common law jurisdictions) at the end of which a second degree, the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), is awarded. The curriculum has since been changed and now only one four-year honours degree is offered abbreviated as LL.B. ===Variations on the LL.B.=== Some universities in the United Kingdom and New Zealand offer variations, which generally take four years to complete and include a wider range of topics as well as some degree of specialisation or the study of multiple jurisdictions, such as the LL.B. Law with French Law and Language offered by the University of East Anglia. Various universities in the United Kingdom and Australia will allow a degree that combines study with a non-law discipline. For example, some universities in the United Kingdom offer a combined study of law and history leading to a B.A. degree that is accepted by the Law Society and Inns of Court as equivalent to an LL.B. The University of London External Programme in Laws (LL.B.) has been awarding its law degree via distance learning since 1858. At various universities in the UK such as Oxford, Nottingham and Cambridge the principal law degree is often a B.A., in either Jurisprudence or Law. The B.C.L and LL.M are second-entry and postgraduate degrees. The University of Cambridge has recently replaced their LL.B. degree with an LL.M. Some universities in the U.K. including Bournemouth University have a four-year LL.B. course, which consists of a 40-week industrial work placement. Staffordshire University also offer a two-year full-time LL.B. course. A unique degree of LL.B.(Hons) Sharia and Law has been introduced by the International Islamic University, Islamabad. The distinctive feature of this course is the comparative study of both Islamic law and Common law. Similar programme can be found in Malaysia as offered by International Islamic University Malaysia and Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia. ==United States== The United States no longer offers the LL.B., though some universities have introduced Bachelor of Science degrees in legal studies featuring curricula that include courses in constitutional law, tort law, and criminal law. The Master of Science of Laws (M.S.L.) is also offered in some universities accredited by the American Bar Association. While the LL.B. was conferred until 1971 at Yale University, since that time, all universities in the United States have awarded the professional doctorate J.D.,. National Science Foundation (2006). \\"Time to Degree of U.S. Research Doctorate Recipients ,\\" ‚Äò'InfoBrief, Science Resource Statistics NSF 06-312, 2006, p. 7.

(the J.D. is listed among other doctorate degrees). which then became the generally standardized degree in most states as the compulsory prerequisite to sit for and matriculate from the bar exam prior to practice of law.Schoenfeld, Marcus, \\"J.D. or LL.B. as the Basic Law Degree,\\" Cleveland-Marshall Law Review, Vol. 4, 1963, pp. 573-579, quoted in Joanna Lombard, LL.B. to J.D. and the Professional Degree in Architecture, Proceedings of the 85th ACSA Annual Meeting, Architecture: Material and Imagined and Technology Conference, 1997. pp. 585-591. Many law schools converted their basic law degree programmes from LL.B. to J.D. in the 1960s, and permitted prior LL.B. graduates to retroactively receive the new doctorate degrees by returning their LL.B. in exchange for a J.D. degree. (Notes that by 1969 many law schools were phasing out the LL.B. in favor of the J.D.) Yale graduates who received LL.B. degrees prior to 1971 were similarly permitted to change their degree to a J.D., though many did not take the option, choosing to retain their LL.B. degrees. Before the program was phased out, notable recipients of the LL.B. include former U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, former U.S. Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy, William Rehnquist, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, current Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, American judge and jurist Richard Allen Posner, as well as the first female commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, Frieda B. Hennock. In 2014, the University of Arizona established the Bachelor of Arts in Law (B.A. in Law), in which undergraduate students take core law classes taught by law school faculty in subjects such as property, contracts, torts, administrative law, and criminal and civil procedure. The B.A. in Law also provides the opportunity for an expedited path to law school, allowing qualified students to start pursuing a J.D. at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law after their junior year, thus earning both a Bachelor of Arts in Law and a J.D. in six years. ===Eligibility of foreign graduates in the U.S.=== For the most part, foreign law graduates seeking admission to the bar in the United States will find their LL.B. law degree does not of itself fulfill the core admission requirements of most states, thereby not allowing them to take the bar exam. The major exception to this is New York, where those foreign graduates who have fulfilled the educational requirements to practice law in another common law country through study at an approved educational institution, similar in both duration and content to the equivalent teaching at an approved U.S. law school, are permitted to sit for the bar exam.\\"Foreign Legal Education\\". The New York State Board of Law Examiners. Additionally, both New York and Massachusetts permit Canadian LL.B. holders to take the bar exam.Board of Bar Examiners Rule VI Foreign Law School Graduates. The Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners. The requirements of each of the states vary, and in some states sufficient years of practice in one's home country may allow for those otherwise excluded to sit for the bar exam. Interested applicants should check the requirements of each state bar association carefully as requirements vary markedly. Most states require completion of a law degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. As a result, American law schools typically offer one-year LL.M. programmes for foreign attorneys; many such law schools may have no other LL.M. programmes. Classes included in these \\"American Law\\", \\"Comparative Law\\" inter alia LL.M. programmes are selected to introduce foreign attorneys to American-style common law practice, such as first-year J.D. courses on civil procedure, constitutional law, criminal law, legal research and analysis, and jurisprudence. ==Situation within the European Union== European Union law permits European Union citizens with LL.B. degrees from one EU Member State, e.g., Ireland, France, Germany or the Spain, who practise law and who are qualified lawyers in one of these countries for three or more years, to practise also in every other member state. The actual procedure to receive the respective national licence is regulated by the member state and therefore differs from country to country, and temporary restrictions may in certain cases exist, but every EU member has to apply the relevant EU Directives to its own national law. As a consequence of the Bologna Process, recently many universities of applied sciences and a few traditional universities in Germany have introduced LL.B. programmes, replacing the degree. The LL.B. is a three- or four-year full-time law degree. As opposed to courses of study leading to the State Examination‚Äîthe master's-level professional law degree in Germany‚Äîmost LL.B. degree programmes concentrate on private law and can feature a component of education in business administration. Graduates of LL.B. courses can continue LL.M. studies and in some cases sit for the first State Examination after one or more years of additional law studies in order to qualify for practicing law in Germany. In Malta, the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree, offered by the University of Malta, is an undergraduate degree that of itself is not sufficient for admission into any of the legal professions. In Denmark, universities now offer three-year LL.B. programmes, although this is not sufficient to practice law. Students wishing to practice law should continue with a Masters in Law programme, leading to the cand.jur degree. Alternatively, students may choose to use the LL.B. as a basis for other courses within the social sciences or humanities. ==Alternative degree route in the U.K.== There are also conversion courses available for non-law graduates, available as an alternative to the full-length LL.B. degree course. One such example of a conversion course in England and Wales is the G.D.L. (Graduate Diploma in Law), which takes one year to complete. In the U.K., as well as in other Common Law jurisdictions, the main approach is the Graduate Entry (undergraduate) LL.B. degree, where graduates from another discipline can complete the LL.B. as a second degree, although this may occasionally require taking qualifying law courses within the first degree to meet professional requirements in full. Therefore, it is not entirely correct to regard it as an 'accelerated' degree. This 'double degree' system was, at one time, an alternative route to the former B.L. degree (now obsolete) but students were required to have independent means to complete the second degree. The current Scots LL.B. degree, a direct-entry undergraduate degree, meets all professional requirements when coupled with the Diploma in Legal Practice. The Diploma was introduced circa 1980; prior to this, all professional exams were taken within the degree itself (or as part of an earlier non-law degree), limiting the scope for academic study. Therefore, the pursuit of the double degree nowadays, for school-leavers at least, is mainly to indicate that one can be adept at two disciplines. Unlike Joint Honours, a second degree is undertaken separately, within the prescribed timeframe. Rarely, the double degree principle is found in reverse; just as an arts or science degree can provide exemption from the full academic (not professional) requirements of a subsequent law degree, similarly a law degree can provide exemption from the full academic requirements of a subsequent arts or science degree. In this case, it is more likely that the second degree will be taken as a self-funding mature student, possibly on a part-time basis. ==See also== * Admission to the bar * Admission to the bar in the United States * Autonomous Law Schools in India * Call to the bar * Doctor of Juridical Science * Doctor of law * Juris Doctor * Legal education * List of law schools * Master of Laws == Sources == * * ==References== Laws, Bachelor of Category:Law degrees ","title":"Bachelor of Laws"},{"id":"299913","text":"Daniel Odier Daniel Robert Odier (born 1945 in Geneva), also known by his pseudonym Delacorta, is a Swiss author and screenwriter.

He founded the \\"Tantra/Chan centre\\" in Paris, which operated from 1995 to 2000, and has taught courses on Eastern spiritual traditions at the University of California.Daniel Odier's Official Webpage: Biography in English He has published a number of books on Tantra and related subjects, some of which have been translated into English and other languages. ==Works== Apart from his works on Tantra, Odier is best known for a series of six novels published under the pseudonym 'Delacorta.' The books center around Serge Gorodish, a classically trained pianist with depressive tendencies, and his underage proteg√©e named Alba. The two enjoy an intense romantic relationship (never actually consummated), and embark together upon various confidence schemes and other intrigues. These often result in the death or discomfiture of less sympathetic characters, although Alba and Gorodish themselves appear to be motivated more by their own profit and amusement than by any moral considerations. The series includes the novel Diva which was later used as the basis for a popular French film of the same name. Odier has also used the Delacorta pseudonym for several unrelated books (mostly detective novels or thrillers) and as a screenwriter.

In its descriptive sense, formalists believe that judges reach their decisions by applying uncontroversial principles to the facts. Although the numerous decided cases imply numerous principles, formalists believe that there is an underlying logic to these principles that is straightforward and which legal experts can readily discover. The ultimate goal of formalism would be to formalise the underlying principles in a single and determinate system that could be applied mechanically (hence the label 'mechanical jurisprudence'). Formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'. It is the thesis to which legal realism is the antithesis. As a normative theory, formalism is the view that judges should decide cases by the application of uncontroversial principles to the facts. ==Definition== Formalism remains one of the most influential and important theories of adjudication and has been called the thesis to which realism is the antithesis.Grey, T. C. (1983). Langdell's Orthodoxy. University of Pittsburgh Law Review, 45, 1. p.3 Formalism sees adjudication as the uncontroversial application of accepted principles to known facts to derive the outcome in the manner of a deductive syllogism.Posner, R. A. (2008). How Judges Think. Cambridge, Massachusetts; London: Harvard University Press. p. 41 Formalists believe that the relevant principles of law of a given area can be discerned by surveying the case law of that area.Anthony T. Kronman. (1993). The Lost Lawyer: Failing Ideals of the Legal Profession. Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p.171Leiter, B. (1997). Is There an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù Jurisprudence? Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 17(2), 367‚Äì387. p.373 Christopher Columbus Langdell believed that the only resources needed to create a science of law was a law library.Langdell, C. C. (1887). Harvard Law School. Law Quarterly Review, 3, 123.Bix, B. H. (2009). Jurisprudence: Theory and Context (5th edition). Sweet & Maxwell. p.192 Formalism has been called an 'autonomous discipline',Posner, How Judges Think, 2008, p.42 in reference to the formalist belief that judges require only the facts and the law, all normative issues such as morality or politics being irrelevant.Leiter, B. (2010). Legal Formalism and Legal Realism: What Is the Issue? Legal Theory, 16(02), 111‚Äì133. If judges are seen to be simply applying the rules in a mechanical and uncontroversial manner, this protects judges from criticism. For this reason, formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'.Posner, How Judges Think, 2008, p.41 Formalists, contrary to Realists, take the judge at face-value, assuming that the facts and principles as recorded in a judge's reasons reflect the facts that the judge considered to be relevant, and the principles that the judge arrived at to reach the judgement. They therefore place little emphasis on the means by which a judge determines the facts. As a normative theory, legal formalists argue that judges and other public officials should be constrained in their interpretation of legal texts, suggesting that investing the judiciary with the power to say what the law should be, rather than confining them to expositing what the law does say, violates the separation of powers. This argument finds its most eloquent expression in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, which provides that the judiciary \\"shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them; to the end [that Massachusetts' government] may be a government of laws, and not of men\\". Mass. Const. (1780). Formalism seeks to maintain that separation as a \\"theory that law is a set of rules and principles independent of other political and social institutions\\".Black's Law Dictionary 913 (7th ed. 1999) ==Comparison to legal realism== Legal formalism can be contrasted to legal instrumentalism, a view associated with American legal realism. Instrumentalism is the view that creativity in the interpretation of legal texts is justified in order to assure that the law serves good public policy and social interests, although legal instrumentalists could also see the end of law as the promotion of justice or the protection of human rights. Legal formalists counter that giving judges authority to change the law to serve their own ideas regarding policy undermines the rule of law. This tension is especially interesting in common law, which depends on judicial precedent. The \\"claim to fame\\" of common law systems is that the task of developing and updating law is best done incrementally by courts that keep in close touch with social, economic, and technological realities than by political organs that, every so often, will attend to legal reforms. Thus legal realism or \\"relationalism\\" has been favored in some common law jurisdictions, where the kind of legal codification associated with civil law are virtually unknown. ==Justice Scalia and formalism== The late United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was noted for his formalist views about a variety of topics, particularly his view that the United States Constitution should be interpreted in accord with its original meaning and his view that statutes should be read in accord with their plain meaning. In A Matter of Interpretation, Scalia defended textualism ‚Äì and, by extension, formalism ‚Äì saying: :Of all the criticisms leveled against textualism, the most mindless is that it is formalist. The answer to that is, of course it's formalistic! The rule of law is about form ... A murderer has been caught with blood on his hands, bending over the body of his victim; a neighbor with a video camera has filmed the crime and the murderer has confessed in writing and on videotape. We nonetheless insist that before the state can punish this miscreant, it must conduct a full-dress criminal trial that results in a verdict of guilty. Is that not formalism? Long live formalism! It is what makes us a government of laws and not of men.Antonin Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 25 (1997) (emphasis in original). Scalia's strongest claim on Formalist credentials can be found in an essay entitled The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules.Antonin Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989) ==Frederick Schauer== Frederick Schauer, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in 1988 published a law review article titled \\"Formalism\\" in The Yale Law Journal. In it he urges scholars to rethink the \\"contemporary aversion to formalism\\" and states that his goal is to \\"rescue formalism from conceptual banishment\\".Frederick Schauer, Formalism, 97 Yale L.J. 509, 511, 539 (1988) He argues formalism should be conceptually rethought, not in terms of merely whether it is a good or bad thing, but rather in terms of how language both can and should be used to restrict the power of decision-makers in the decision-making process. ==Wole≈Ñski== In his essay \\"Formal and informal in legal logic\\", Jan Wole≈Ñski contends that there are \\"rhetorical functions of metalogical concepts that are used in legal discourse\\", and hence the introduction of the informal into otherwise imperative logic. He reviews J√∏rgensen's paradox to introduce deontic logic, and acknowledges this innovation by Georg Henrik von Wright.Jan Wole≈Ñski (2011) \\"Formal and Informal in Legal Logic\\", pages 73 to 86 in Approaches to Legal Rationality, edited by D.M Gabbay, P.

The Government of Brazil posthumously awarded the Sergio Vieira de Mello Medal to honor his legacy in promoting sustainable peace, international security and better living conditions for individuals in situations of armed conflict, challenges to which Sergio Vieira de Mello had dedicated his life and career. He was killed in the Canal Hotel bombing in Iraq along with 20 other members of his staff on 19 August 2003 while working as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations Special Representative for Iraq. Before his death, he was considered a likely candidate for UN Secretary-General. ==Biography and professional career== Vieira de Mello was born in Rio de Janeiro to the diplomat Arnaldo Vieira de Mello and his wife Gilda on 15 March 1948. He had an older sister, S√¥nia, who suffered schizophrenia throughout her adult life. The family followed Arnaldo's diplomatic postings, such that S√©rgio spent his early years in Buenos Aires, Genoa, Milan, Beirut and Rome. In 1965, he was studying philosophy at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, but since classes were frequently disrupted by strikes, he opted to continue his education in Europe. He continued at the University of Paris, where he studied philosophy under Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch. While there, he stayed at an apartment at the Maison de l‚ÄôArgentine, the student housing at the Sorbonne dedicated to students with families from Latin America. He participated in the 1968 student riots in Paris against the Charles de Gaulle government, and was hit in the head by a police baton, causing a permanent disfigurement above his right eye. He also wrote a letter published in the French leftist journal Combat in support of the riots, which made his return to Brazil, at this stage a military dictatorship, potentially dangerous. Thus, after graduating from the Sorbonne in 1969, he moved to Geneva to stay with a family friend, and found his first job as an editor at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). From UNHCR, Vieira de Mello moved to the field in Bangladesh during its War of Independence in 1971, and Sudan in 1972 following the Addis Ababa agreement which ended the First Sudanese Civil War and allowed the return of some 650,000 Sudanese refugees and displaced persons, and Cyprus after the Turkish part of Cyprus in 1974. These early assignments were operational, rather than political; he was helping to organize food aid, shelter and other types of aid to refugees. Sergio remained in the field, with a posting in Mozambique to assist refugees fleeing white rule and civil war in Zimbabwe (at the time, still Rhodesia) where he was deputy head of the office. Due to the absence of his boss, he was effectively running the mission. Early in his career, he also completed an MA in moral philosophy and a PhD by correspondence from the Sorbonne. His doctorate thesis, submitted in 1974, was entitled The Role of Philosophy in Contemporary Society. In 1985, he submitted a second \\"state\\" doctorate, the highest degree in the French education system, entitled Civitas Maxima: Origins, Foundations and Philosophical and Political Significance of the Supranationality Concept. In addition to his native Portuguese, Vieira de Mello was fluent in English, Spanish, Italian and French, as well as some conversational Arabic and Tetum. Vieira de Mello spent three years in charge of UNHCR operations in Mozambique during the civil war that followed its independence from Portugal in 1975, and three more years in Peru. Vieira de Mello also served as Special Envoy for the UNHCR for Cambodia, being the first and only UN Representative to hold talks with the Khmer Rouge. He became senior political adviser to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon between 1981 and 1983. In 1985, he returned to Latin America to serve as head of the Argentina office in Buenos Aires. Sergio spent the 1990s involved in the clearing of land mines in Cambodia, and then in Yugoslavia. After working on the refugee problem in central Africa, he was made Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees in 1996 and became UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator two years later. He would hold this position simultaneously with others until January 2001. He was a special UN envoy in Kosovo after the UN took control over the Serbian province in 1999. Vieira de Mello was instrumental in dealing with the issue of boat people in Hong Kong. In mid-2000, he visited Fiji together with Don McKinnon, the Commonwealth of Nations' Secretary-General, in an attempt to assist in finding a negotiated settlement to the hostage situation, in which Fiji's Prime Minister and other members of Parliament were kidnapped and held as hostages during the 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat. Before becoming the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2002, he was the UN Transitional Administrator in East Timor from December 1999 to May 2002, guiding the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia to independence. He was also special representative in Kosovo for an initial period of two months and was the coordinator of humanitarian operations at UN Headquarters. In May 2003 Vieira de Mello was appointed as the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General to Iraq, an appointment initially intended to last for four months. According to The New York Times Magazine journalist James Traub in his book The Best Intentions, Vieira de Mello turned down the appointment three times before Kofi Annan was pressured by US President George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice. According to Samantha Power in her book Sergio: One Man's Fight to Save the World, Vieira de Mello met Bush at a meeting in March 2003, at which the two men discussed the human rights situation in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a controversial issue for the United States. In June 2003, Vieira de Mello was part of a team responsible for inspecting Abu Ghraib prison before it was rebuilt. ==Death== U.S. soldiers placing Vieira de Mello's casket into an SUV.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, claimed responsibility for the blast.Benson, Pam, \\"CIA: Zarqawi tape 'probably authentic' \\", CNN World, 7 April 2004. A communiqu√© from al- Qaida said that de Mello was assassinated because he had helped East Timor become an independent state, thereby stealing territory from the Islamic Caliphate. He had been mentioned in some circles as a suitable candidate for UN Secretary-General. His death was widely mourned, largely on account of his reputation for effectively working to promote peace. Despite his stated wishes to be buried in Rio de Janeiro, his hometown, the place he lived for 34 years, and where he was given a state funeral with full military honors that was attended by president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and other international dignitaries, his body was taken away from Brazil and he was buried at the Cimeti√®re des Rois in Geneva, Switzerland. He was survived by his two sons, Adrien and Laurent. ==Personal life== In 1973, he met and married Annie Personnaz, a French staff member at UNHCR Headquarters in Geneva, with whom he had two sons, Laurent and Adrien. They lived in the French town of Thonon-les- bains, before moving a few years later to a permanent home in the French village of Massongy, near the Geneva border. Despite still being married, the couple was separated for years prior to Sergio's death, with a divorce lawsuit in January 9, 2003. After an initial hearing in May, Sergio was bound to pay alimony to his formal spouse, but he also accepted full responsibility for, among other things, assuming the entire expenses of his sons regarding maintenance and education. Since 2000, he was in a relationship with Carolina Larriera, an Argentine economist who studied at Harvard University, whom he had met in East Timor where she worked as part of the General Service support staff of the UN mission. Sergio and Carolina had a civil union that lasted until his death. The civil union was the result of a lawsuit won by Larriera against his estranged wife, heirs and the estate, and was granted by a panel of three magistrates led by Judge Regina F√°bregas Ferreira of the Family Court of the Capital District, Judiciary, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after a process of more than ten years. Vieira de Mello presented her partner as fianc√©e to many friends and colleagues. This included King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, a friend from the period he worked in the country, after visiting him while touring through Asia, as captured on video at the time. The couple traveled to Brazil and Argentina to meet Sergio and Carolina's family and introduce them to one another, and it is suggested that Sergio wanted to marry Carolina as soon as he was officially divorced. They intended to return to Switzerland after the mission in Iraq - where he would be reinstalled as High Commissioner for Human Rights - and, from there, establish their home and family. Carolina was summoned by Sergio to work alongside him in Iraq, and therefore was at the Canal Hotel on the day of the bombing. She witnessed first responders trying to save Vieira de Mello from the wreckage of the building and even managed to establish contact with him moments before his death. Though the relationship was very familiar to colleagues at the UN, the entity fails to recognize officially the civil union between Sergio and Carolina, even after its recognition by the Judiciary branch in Brazil. Carolina claims that she was excluded from the list of survivors of the Canal Hotel bombing, and her comments were not taken into account for the report regarding the attack. After his death, she was not invited to any of the United Nations celebrations of his life, while the ex-wife Annie was indicated by the UN as Sergio's widow. Annie still lives in France, and has co-founded a Swiss charity - the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation - with his two sons and close friends and colleagues to honor his name and memory. Adrien and Laurent now have five children, Sergio's grandchildren. Carolina was received by Sergio's family back in Rio de Janeiro, where she now lives with her mother-in-law, Gilda Vieira de Mello. ==Awards and recognition== Vieira de Mello received a number of posthumous awards and honours, chief of which was the legion d'honneur, France's highest honor, given to his widown and two sons in Geneva, he was also awarded the Order of Rio Branco, the highest honor from the Government of Brazil to be given to a citizen, the Pedro Ernesto Medal, the highest honor in his hometown of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, in 2003. In April 2004, S√©rgio Vieira de Mello was posthumously awarded the 'Statesman of the Year Award' by the EastWest Institute. Following the initiative of the Villa Decius Association, the Polish Prize of Sergio Vieira de Mello was established in the year 2003 with an aim to promote human rights, democracy and tolerance and had its First Edition already in 2004. Logo of the Centro Sergio Vieira de Mello Sergio Vieira de Mello Center The Sergio Vieira de Mello Center was founded by his mother, Gilda Vieira de Mello and Sergio's surviving spouse Carolina Larriera, also a former UN diplomat and Harvard trained professional, to honor his legacy, and works with a network of supporters out of Brazil, Sergio's country of nationality and Timor-Leste, the country he helped create ‚Äì around the world. The Sergio Vieira de Mello Center works through a nationwide network of universities specialized in international relations and the future generation of world ambassadors. Specifically, the Sergio Vieira de Mello Center focuses on the use technology, entrepreneurism, and networks to mobilize mentors and disciples and build a sustainable peace model that can be easily replicated. It engages Harvard and MIT engineers and education professionals to empower local communities and schools. The Center matches ivory tower professionals with base of the pyramid and disenfranchised youth, identifying low-hanging fruit-type of opportunities. With ANAPRI, the National Association of International Relations Professionals is mobilizing Congress for more resources for the professionalization of the sector. The Center engages and actively supports a network of more than one hundred schools and institutions bearing Sergio's name in Brazil and abroad, and provides teaching tools and in-kind material It also runs the Gilda Vieira de Mello for her Son Sergio Vieira de Mello awarded annually in Geneva,Switzerland. Logo of the SVDM Foundation.Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation The Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation was created in 2007 to honor his memory, pursue his ideals and continue his unfinished mission. The Foundation was established in Geneva (Switzerland), at the initiative of his two sons and his estranged wife, with some friends and colleagues. In 2008, Mr Kofi Annan launched the first annual lecture, followed by Ms Sadako Ogata in 2009, by Mr. Bernard Kouchner in 2010, by Mr. Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso in 2011, and by Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga in 2012. Lectures take place at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, in Geneva. On 11 December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly made history when it adopted Swedish-sponsored GA Resolution A/63/L.49 on the Strengthening of the Coordination of Emergency Assistance of the United Nations, that amongst other important humanitarian decisions, decided to designate 19 August as the World Humanitarian Day (WHD). The Resolution gives for the first time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in the promotion of the humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, as well as the other International Organizations and Non- Governmental Organizations to observe it annually in an appropriate way. As a background to this landmark resolution, the family of S√©rgio Vieira de Mello resolved to work towards having 19 August recognized as a befitting tribute to all humanitarian personnel. Early April 2008 the Board of the S√©rgio Vieira de Mello Foundation prepared a draft Resolution to be sponsored and adopted by the General Assembly designating 19 August as World Humanitarian Day. France, Switzerland, Japan and Brazil, contacted with the draft Resolution, agreed to co-sponsor it. Sergio Vieira de Mello founded two Human Rights Agencies: the United Nations Housing Rights Programme and United Nations Human Rights Educational Project (UNHREP). The former, currently a part of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, aims to \\"assist States and other stakeholders with the implementation of their commitments in the Habitat Agenda\\". UNHREP aims to be \\"an educational facility for teaching Human Rights from a variety of angles. ...

The gap constitutes the southern portion of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, which is used primarily for recreational purposes, such as rafting, canoeing, swimming, fishing, hiking, and rock climbing. ==Geology== Worthington State Forest, from a campsite A water gap is a geological feature where a river cuts through a mountain ridge. The Delaware Water Gap began to form 500 million years ago when quartz pebbles from mountains in the area were deposited in a shallow sea. The Martinsburg Shale on the eastern side of what was to be Kittatinny Mountain was uplifted 450 million years ago when a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto- North America. These islands slid over the North American plate, and deposited rock on top of plate, forming the Highlands and Kittatinny Valley. About 400 million years ago, a small, narrow continent collided with proto-North America. The heat from the pressure melted the quartzite, which allowed it to bend the quartz pebbles and Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate. This layer was then uplifted and cracked over thousands of years. During this period, the Delaware River slowly cut its path down through the shattered and cracked quartzite. If the quartzite had not been cracked, the river would not have been able to cut its path through the mountain to form the gap.Delaware water Gap National Recreation Area, The geology of the Delaware Water Gap Millions of years of rain, ice, snow, and wind erosion shaped the area. The Wisconsin glaciation, which occurred between 21,000 B.C. and 13,000 B.C., covered the entire Kittatinny Ridge and ended near Belvidere. When the glaciers retreated, the existing gap assumed its present form. The mountain consists of Silurian Shawangunk conglomerate. This is gray quartzite, which makes the mountain highly resistant to weathering. The Silurian High Fall formation of sandstone is on the western side of the gap near the base. The eastern side of the gap has Ordovician Martinsburg shale. Sedimentary rock is along the river. The Bloomsburg Red Beds, a red shale, are at the gap under Dunsfield Creek. The Delaware Water Gap is about across at river level and wide at the top. The river through the gap is 290 feet above sea level. The ridge of the Appalachians that the Delaware crosses is called the Blue Mountains in Pennsylvania and the Kittatinny Ridge in New Jersey. This is the first major ridge of the Appalachian mountains. The New Jersey mountain is Mount Tammany, named after the Native American Chief Tamanend. The Pennsylvania mountain is Mount Minsi, named after the Native American tribe of the area. The summit of Tammany is above sea level. ==Flora and fauna== In 1739, America's first botanist, John Bartram of Philadelphia, followed the course of the Delaware River in his search for American trees, evergreens and shrubs to supply new species that were formerly unknown to British naturalists. These gardeners waited months for shipments of saplings, seeds, and pinecones to be sent by sea that were then introduced into English gardens. Using Native American trails , Bartram rode on horseback through the Water Gap, which allowed entry to the lands beyond. The Brother Gardeners: Botany, Empire and the birth of an obsession, by Andrea Wulf. Publisher Alfred A. Knopf New York 2009. Pg 77 A northern deciduous forest cloaks the slopes of the Delaware Water Gap. Hardwood species comprising the forest include various oaks, hickories, maples, ash, elm, cherry, walnut, birch, sycamore, and beech. Coniferous species include Eastern White Pine, Pitch Pine, Eastern Red Cedar, and Eastern Hemlock. Black bear, whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, raccoons, gray fox, fisher, and chipmunks are some of the forest species of the area. Shad migrate up the river through the gap in the spring. Other fish include bass, trout, carp, and walleye. Timber rattlesnakes and copperheads also inhabit the rocky areas of the mountain. Salamanders are found in the moist areas of the forest. Eastern Prickly Pear Cactus also grows on the mountain near the red dot trail on the south eastern facing slope halfway up the mountain. ==Transportation== Steep rock walls prohibited foot travel through the gap until a road was built on the Pennsylvania side of the river in 1793. In 1830 a road was built on the New Jersey side through the gap and north toward Pahaquarry. Interstate 80 passes through the gap on the New Jersey side as of the early 1970s via the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. The Pennsylvania portion of the New Jersey Cut-Off mainline of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad comes into Slateford, PA. The Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority owns the trackage in the Water Gap area and is operated by the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad. Pennsylvania Route 611, which is adjacent to the railroad for most of way through the gap, occupies the right-of-way of a former trolley line. Interstate 80 occupies the former right-of-way of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. ==Tocks Island and the National Park Service== The Delaware Water Gap from Knowlton Township in New Jersey. In 1962, Congress authorized the building of a dam across the Delaware River at Tocks Island, upstream of the water gap. Meant to control hurricane-related flooding, it was never built. The land for the proposed reservoir, which had already been purchased, was used to create the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in 1965. There are two visitor centers, one in New Jersey near the Delaware River bridge and the other in Dingman's Ferry, Pennsylvania. Headquarters is located on River Road in Pennsylvania. The New Jersey side of the gap is also protected within Worthington State Forest, a New Jersey State Forest wholly contained within the recreation area. ==Hiking trails== The Red Dot Trail is a 1.2 mile hike up 1200 vertical feet to the top of Mt Tammany which has commanding views of the Mt. Minsi in Pennsylvania (the other side of the gap). The Blue Trail also goes to the top of Mt Tammany from the Appalachian Trail. It is about a 3-mile hike that is less steep than the red dot. The popular route is to hike up the Red Dot Trail and down the Blue Trail. The Dunfield Creek Trail has green blazes follows this pretty creek and eventually connects to the Appalachian Trail at Sunfish Pond. The Appalachian Trail which goes from Georgia to Maine enters the Delaware Water Gap at the Delaware River on the Route 80 Bridge and goes to Sunfish Pond and continues northeast to Stokes State Forest. The trail crosses Route 206 and continues along the ridgeline of the Kittatinny Mountains to High Point State Park and eventually goes into New York State. There are many other hiking trails in the area for all levels of hiking. It is best to use a guide book or stop into the Delaware Water Gap visitor center for more information. ==Rock climbing== The gap is a popular place to rock-climb in New Jersey. The climbs are , climbing on Silurian Shawagunk conglomerate, which is quartzite, with bands of shale from a half inch to four inches thick. Most climbing is done on the New Jersey side due to easier access. There are about one hundred climbs on the New Jersey side. Climbs range from 5.1 to 5.14 on the Yosemite Decimal System scale. Climbers follow the gray dot trail along route 80, then passing the large rock face on route 80. They then go up the path to the route they choose. In recent years, the Pennsylvania side has been closed to climbing during the nesting season for peregrine falcons; this has resulted in overgrowth of trails and climbing routes, providing an experience closer to the natural state than is found at more popular climbing destinations. ==Boy Scout camps== The Easton Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America operated Weygadt Scout Reservation in the Delaware Water Gap at the base of Mount Tammany from 1931 until 1968.NPS.GOV - History of the Delaware Watergap The Reservation was originally home to two Scout camps‚Äîthe Easton Council's Camp Weygadt on the southern part of the reservation and the Bethlehem Area Council's Camp Minsi on the northern section of the reservation. In the later part of the 1930s, the Bethlehem Council moved their camp to the Poconos, and the entire reservation in the Water Gap became Camp Weygadt. Camp Minsi is now located in Pocono Summit, Pennsylvania, on the shores of Stillwater Lake. Pahaquarra Boy Scout Camp was located on the New Jersey side of the Delaware Water Gap on Old Mine Road at the abandoned Pahaquarry Copper Mine. The camp served Boy Scouts from the George Washington Council. Just north of this camp was Camp Cowaw Boy Scout Camp which served Raritan Council Boy Scouts. ==See also== * Mount Tammany Fire Road ==References== ==External links== *Camp Cowaw *Pahaquarry Abandoned Mine at Delaware Water Gap * Category:Delaware River * Category:Water gaps of the United States Category:Landforms of Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:Landforms of Northampton County, Pennsylvania Category:Landforms of Warren County, New Jersey Category:Geology of New Jersey Category:Geology of Pennsylvania Category:Rail mountain passes of the United States Category:Water gaps of Pennsylvania Category:Valleys of New Jersey Category:Geologic formations of New Jersey Category:Geologic formations of Pennsylvania Category:Appalachian Trail Category:Climbing areas of the United States Category:Tourism regions of New Jersey Category:Tourist attractions in Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:Tourist attractions in Northampton County, Pennsylvania Category:Interstate 80 ","title":"Delaware Water Gap"},{"id":"299936","text":"The natural nuclear fission reactors of Oklo: Oklo is a region near the town of Franceville, in the Haut-Ogoou√© province of the Central African country of Gabon. Several natural nuclear fission reactors were discovered in the uranium mines in the region in 1972. ==History== Gabon was a French colony when prospectors from the French nuclear energy commissariat (the industrial parts, which later became the COGEMA and later Areva NC) discovered uranium in the remote region in 1956. France immediately opened mines operated by Comuf (Compagnie des Mines d'Uranium de Franceville) near Mounana village in order to exploit the vast mineral resources and the State of Gabon was given a minority share in the company. For forty years, France mined for uranium in Gabon. Once extracted, the uranium was used for electricity production in France and much of Europe. Today, however, the uranium deposits are exhausted, and the mine is no longer worked. Currently, mine reclamation work is ongoing in the region affected by the mine operations. Some of the mined uranium was found to have a lower concentration of uranium-235 than expected, as if it had already been in a reactor. When geologists investigated they also found products typical of a reactor. They concluded that the deposit had been in a reactor: a natural nuclear fission reactor, around 1.8 to 1.7 billion years BP ‚Äì in the Paleoproterozoic Era during Precambrian times. At that time the natural uranium had a concentration of about 3% 235U, and could have reached criticality with natural water as neutron moderator allowed by the special geometry of the deposit. ==See also== * Oklo Mine * Deep geological repository * List of uranium mines * Mounana ==ReferencesAlt URL Category:Uranium mines Category:Radioactive waste repositories Category:Mines in Gabon Category:Energy in Gabon Category:Nuclear reactors ","title":"Oklo"},{"id":"299939","text":"The Cyperaceae are a family of graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as sedges.

These species are widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical Asia and tropical South America. While sedges may be found growing in almost all environments, many are associated with wetlands, or with poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands or sedge meadows. Some species superficially resemble the closely related rushes and the more distantly related grasses. Features distinguishing members of the sedge family from grasses or rushes are stems with triangular cross-sections (with occasional exceptions) and leaves that are spirally arranged in three ranks. In comparison, grasses have alternate leaves, forming two ranks. Some well-known sedges include the water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) and the papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus), from which the writing material papyrus was made.

He is best known as the bassist and primary lyricist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He has also recorded and performed with Heaven & Hell, GZR, and Ozzy Osbourne. Butler currently is the bassist of Deadland Ritual. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Butler received the nickname \\"Geezer\\" at approximately age eight, because he \\"used to call everybody Geezer\\" at school. \\"It was just a slang term for a man.\\" Butler grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic family in Birmingham. The Butler family had seven children and were poor, typically having \\"no money whatsoever\\". Two of Butler's older brothers had been called upon to serve in the army, and in the Vietnam War era, Butler feared that he would be next. However, mandatory service was ended in England a couple of years before he was due to be conscripted. Butler was heavily influenced by the writing of Aleister Crowley as a teenager. By his late teens, he had stopped attending Mass. He cited a loss of belief, and feels that everyone should sooner or later decide for themselves what to believe in. By the end \\"I was going to Mass every Sunday just to take a look at all the nice girls that were going there\\", he recalled years later. ===Black Sabbath=== Butler in 1970 Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed, in the autumn of 1967, with John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne soon joining as lead vocalist. At that time, Butler was dating a girl who lived near Tony Iommi, and Iommi's earliest memories of Butler involved seeing him walking past his house every day to visit her. Later, Iommi and Butler became acquainted when their bands played at a nearby nightclub. Separated for a time, Osbourne and Butler reunited in the blues foursome, Polka Tulk, along with guitarist Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, both of whom had recently left the band Mythology. They renamed their new band Earth, but a band already existed in the small-time English circuit with the same name, so they were forced to change the name yet again. Inspired by the popular Boris Karloff horror film of the same name, Butler suggested the name Black Sabbath in early 1969. Inspired by John Lennon, Butler played rhythm guitar in his pre-Sabbath days, including with Rare Breed. When Sabbath was formed, Iommi made it clear that he did not want to play with another guitarist, so Butler moved to bass. According to Butler, \\"I'd never played bass until I was on stage at the first gig that we played. Borrowed the bass guitar off one of my friends and it only had three strings on it.\\" Butler lists Jack Bruce of Cream as his biggest influence as a bassist. Iommi described Butler as being \\"from another planet\\" in the band's early days; he took LSD, wore Indian hippie dresses, and was very peaceful. At the time Black Sabbath was formed, Butler was studying to become an accountant, and this training resulted in him managing the band's finances in the early days. Butler performing with Black Sabbath in 1995 After Black Sabbath fired vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979, Butler also briefly left the band to deal with the divorce from his first wife. The 1980 album Heaven and Hell was actually recorded with bassist Craig Gruber but Butler returned to the band at the last minute and re-recorded the bass parts prior to release. He again left the band in 1984 after touring in support of their 1983 album, Born Again, though he returned months later as the band attempted a comeback with vocalist David Donato. In 1988, Butler joined the backing band of his former Sabbath bandmate Osbourne to take part in the No Rest for the Wicked World Tour. He rejoined Black Sabbath in 1991 for the reunion of the Mob Rules line-up, but again quit the group after the Cross Purposes tour in 1994. In 1995 Butler again joined Osbourne's band to perform on the Ozzmosis album. After recording Ozzmosis, he formed G/Z/R, issuing Plastic Planet in 1995. His next solo album, Black Science, followed in 1997. Butler returned to Sabbath once more for the 1997 edition of Ozzfest, and has remained with the band since. In 2005 he released Ohmwork, his third solo album. In October 2006 it was announced that Butler, along with Tony Iommi, would be reforming the Dehumanizer-era Black Sabbath line-up with Vinny Appice and Ronnie James Dio, under the name Heaven & Hell to differentiate between the reunited touring band fronted by Osbourne, and the Dio-fronted version of the band. He rejoined Iommi and Osbourne to record 13 and toured in support of the album, which reached its conclusion in 2017. ==Personal life== Butler is married to Gloria Butler, who managed Heaven & Hell. He was divorced from his first wife in 1980. He also shares his Los Angeles home with several cats, of whom he has posted pictures on his website. His oldest son, Biff Butler, was the frontman in the nu metal band Apartment 26. Butler says Biff is very religious and brings up his children in the Catholic faith. Butler's other son James earned a degree in social sciences from Oxford University and resides in London. Butler describes him as \\"very politically minded\\". \\"My youngest is extremely left-wing, and I think it's because he was brought up knowing wealth and money, whereas I was brought up having no money whatsoever. That's where the church came in and made up for the lack of money because everybody knew each other in the street and everybody used to help each other out\\", Butler said. Butler is a lifelong supporter of Aston Villa Football Club, and during Black Sabbath's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Butler is heard shouting \\"Up the Villa\\" as the members of the band left the stage. He has referred to football as his \\"religion\\" and has stated that Villa legend Peter McParland is his \\"all-time hero\\". According to Osbourne, Butler \\"never uses foul language\\". He was raised on a vegetarian diet, largely due to his family being too poor to buy meat on a regular basis, and has been a vegan since approximately 1994. His mother was also a vegetarian. Butler appeared in a promotional ad for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in 2009 and later urged fans to boycott Fortnum & Mason until they remove foie gras from their shelves. Butler said, \\"I've seen some outrageous things in my time, but watching those poor birds suffer simply so that their diseased livers can be sold on your shop floor is horrific!\\"\\"Black Sabbath's Geezer ButlerCalls for Foie Gras Boycott,\\" Karrang Radio, 1 March 2013. Over the years, Butler has become disillusioned with politics, saying \\"For me, it's almost pointless voting anymore because it seems to be the same no matter what party or politics you stand for. It all seems corrupted to me. It's all the same old people that rule the world.\\" He has also expressed concern over the increasing level of control government has in people's lives. \\"Every time I go back to England, there are things that totally surprise me that you never think would happen in England, just all the CCTV everywhere. There seems to be so much control over people these days\\", he said in 2014. In January 2015, Butler was briefly detained after a bar brawl in Death Valley, California and charged with misdemeanor assault, public intoxication and vandalism. He was released following detoxification and a citation. In 2016 he opened up about the event: \\"This guy started mouthing off about something. He was, like, some drunken Nazi bloke. He [...] started going on about Jews and everything - Jews this, Jews that. My missus is Jewish and I'd just had enough, and me hand sort of met his chin. I whacked him one.\\" == Style and legacy== Butler in 2013 Butler is noted for his melodic playing, and as being one of the first bassists to use a wah pedal and to down-tune his instrument (from the standard E-A-D-G to the lower C#-F#-B-E), as exemplified on Black Sabbath's Master of Reality album, to match Iommi who had started tuning his guitar to C# (a minor third down). During the band's Ozzy Osbourne era, Butler wrote most of the band's lyrics, drawing heavily upon his fascination with religion, science-fiction, fantasy and horror, and musings on the darker side of human nature that posed a constant threat of global annihilation. Butler is regarded as one of the most influential bassists in heavy metal. Billy Sheehan of Mr. Big said: \\"He‚Äôs a founding father of a whole genre of music and a man who really set the bar early on to be such an integral part of the sound and song structure of Sabbath\\". In Mick Wall's biography of Iron Maiden entitled Run to the Hills, founder Steve Harris recalls: \\"I distinctly remember trying to play along to Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" ‚Äì at first I just could not get it. I threw the guitar on my bed and walked out in a huff, but the next day I came back, picked it up and played it all the way through note-for-note! Once I got going, I started getting into bass-lines with a bit more subtlety to them...\\". Former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, who defined him his \\"number 1 influence\\", stated: \\"All true metal bassists look up to Geezer as a pioneer and Godfather of our chosen instrument. The best, ever\\". Rex Brown of Pantera and Kill Devil Hill asserted: \\"He‚Äôs a legend. He‚Äôs everything. Geezer is so much of an influence on me. Other bassists such as Cliff Burton,Joel McIver, To live is to die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton, p.86 Les Claypool, Steve DiGiorgio, Alex Webster, John Myung, Johnny Lee Middleton, Greg Smith cited Butler as a significant influence on their style. ==Equipment== Butler currently endorses Lakland basses and has his own signature model. For amplification, Butler is endorsed by Hartke bass amplification, Kilo bass head and 4X10 HyDrive cabinet. In the past, he has been known to use Ampeg SVT & B-15 bass amps and Fender, Dan Armstrong Plexi, Rickenbacker, Yamaha BB, Vigier and B.C. Rich Basses.

The shootings were reminiscent of the Beltway sniper attacks that took place in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC in the fall of 2002. In July 2012, Shawn Lester, who had been indicted for all three murders in 2011, pleaded guilty to the second degree murder of one of the victims. The charges with respect to the other two murders were dropped as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. ==Victims== *August 10, 2003: Gary Carrier Jr., 44, of South Charleston, was fatally shot in the head while talking on a payphone outside a Charleston, West Virginia Go-Mart. *August 14, 2003: Both victims were residents of Campbells Creek, West Virginia. They were slain 90 minutes and 10 miles apart. **Jeanie Patton, 31, was killed at a Speedway filling station around 10:30. She was struck by a bullet to the back of her head as she was about to pay for gas she pumped. **Okey Meadows Jr., 26, was shot in the neck while purchasing milk and paying for it through a security window at the Go- Mart on U.S. 60. ==Investigation== The victims in the West Virginia sniper shootings were killed by a single bullet from long distances as they stopped at shops or gas stations. All three victims were killed late at night by the same kind of small-caliber rifle, although police have not determined if all three were murdered with the same weapon. Ballistic tests show that a .22-caliber rifle was used to kill the second and third victims. The first bullet could not be completely checked due to damage, but appeared to have similar characteristics to the other two bullets. Police said that they were looking for a dark-colored full-size pickup truck. Eyewitnesses believed that the driver was a large white male, but couldn't identify the suspect further due to the darkness. A man was eventually arrested who matched this profile and who had implied to witnesses that he was the sniper, but no charges related to the shootings were ever brought against him. The police considered the possibility that the shootings were drug-related. The second two victims had drug connections, but the police were not aware of any drug connections for the first victim. About five months earlier, while exiting a local Kroger supermarket, Randy Burgess was shot twice in the chest sniper-style and died the next day. Although no hard evidence connected this murder with the three that would follow, law enforcement did not dismiss the possibility. In October 2003, a joint task force investigating the shootings announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the killer. This reward would later be increased to $100,000. A key witness who had identified a local area resident, Shawn Lester, as the shooter shortly after the murder was ignored by the Kanawha County Sheriff's Department, even though he had passed a polygraph test. At some time before the three successive murders, the witness's younger brother had stolen an automobile engine belonging to Lester that had a large quantity of methamphetamine hidden inside. Lester later confided in the witness that \\"he had taken something important to me, so I'll take something important to him. Keep an eye on the news\\". Jeannie Patton was the longtime girlfriend of the witness's younger brother. When law enforcement failed to act on his information, the witness agreed to be a guest (anonymously) on a local Public-access television program named \\"West Virginia's Most Wanted\\", hosted by Andrew Palmer. The show aired in January 2007, and Palmer presented a theory that a gang called the Charleston Five carried out the shootings. He suggested that two victims were chosen randomly to throw suspicion off the gang for killing its intended target, Jeanie Patton. Seven and a half years later, on March 31, 2011, Shawn Lester was arrested and charged with the murder of Jeannie Patton. The property of a woman believed to have sheltered Lester and his gang was excavated to search for the pickup truck used in at least two of the murders and for bodies of possible further victims. ==Conviction== Lester was finally indicted for all three murders in August 2011. At the outset of his trial a year later, he pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Jeannie Patton. However, the murder charges with respect to Gary Carrier Jr. and Okey Meadows Jr. were dropped as part of the plea bargain. Lester was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Later, an additional 6 years were added to the sentence after he pleaded guilty to firearms possession charges. ==See also== *Beltway sniper attacks *Ohio highway sniper attacks *Serial Shooter ==References== ==External links== *W.

The tutor spends a few hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to transfer their expertise on the topic or skill to the student. Tutoring can take place in different settings. ==History== Tutoring began as an informal and unstructured method of educational assistance, dating back to periods in Ancient Greece. Tutors operated on an ad-hoc or impromptu basis in varied and unfixed settings wherein the main goal of the tutor was to impart knowledge to the learner in order to help the latter gain proficiency in the subject area. Methods of tutoring only began to become more structured after the 20th century through focus and specialisation in the training of tutors, application of tutoring, and evaluation of tutors. From the 20th century onwards, with the rapid spread of mainstream education, the demand for tutoring has also increased as a way to supplement formal education. ==British and Irish secondary schools== In British and Irish secondary schools, form tutors are given the responsibilities of a form or class of students in a particular year group (up to 30 students). They usually work in year teams headed by a year leader, year head, or guidance teacher. Form tutors will provide parents with most of the information about their child's progress and any problems they might be experiencing. Ordinarily, the form tutor is the person who contacts a parent if there is a problem at school; however, the year leader or guidance teacher may contact the parents, since the form tutor has full-time responsibility as a specialist subject teacher. ==Private tutoring in Asia== A 2012 study by the Asian Development Bank and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong pointed out that private tutoring can dominate the lives of young people and their families, maintain and exacerbate social inequalities, divert needed household income into an unregulated industry, and create inefficiencies in education systems. It can also undermine official statements about fee-free education and create threats to social cohesion.ADB Study Highlights Dark Side of 'Shadow Education', Shadow Education: Private Supplementary Tutoring and its Implications for Policy Makers in Asia. In South Korea, nearly 90% of elementary students receive some sort of shadow education.Kim, Kyung-Keun. 2010. \\"Educational Equality\\", in Lee, Chong Jae; Kim, Seong-yul & Adams, Don (eds.), Sixty Years of Korean Education.

Private Supplementary Tutoring of Secondary Students: Investigation Report. Hong Kong: Caritas. 60% of primary students in West Bengal, India,, Pratham. 2011. Annual Status of Education Report 2010. and 60% of secondary students in Kazakhstan receive private tutoring.Kalikova, Saule & Zhanar Rakhimzhanova. 2009. \\"Private Tutoring in Kazakhstan\\", in Silova, Iveta (Ed.), Private Supplementary Tutoring in Central Asia: New Opportunities and Burdens. Demand for tutoring in Asia is exploding; by comparison globally, shadow education is most extensive in Asia. This is partly due to the stratification of education systems, cultural factors, perceptions of shortcomings in regular school systems, and the combination of growing wealth and smaller family sizes. Therefore, the education sector has become a profitable industry which businesses have created different kinds of products and advertisement such as \\"the king/queen of tutorial\\", a usual advertisement tactic of Hong Kong tutorial centers that has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India where tutors achieve \\"celebrity-like status\\". In some cases, successful Southeast Asian tutors will even embrace the title of \\"tutor\\". Online private tutor matching platform and online learning platform offering online learning materials are other creations. In Cambodia, most tutoring is provided by teachers,Dawson, Walter. 2010. \\"Private Tutoring and Mass Schooling in East Asia: Reflections of Inequality in Japan, South Korea, and Cambodia.\\" Asia Pacific Education Review 11(1):14-24. whereas in Hong Kong, it is provided by individuals, small companies or large companies., Kwo, Ora & Mark Bray. 2011. \\"Facing the Shadow Education System in Hong Kong.\\" IIAS Newsletter (University of Leiden, International Institute for Asian Studies) In Mongolia, most tutoring is labor-intensive,Dong, Alison, Batjargal Ayush, Bolormaa Tsetsgee, & Tumendelger Sengedorj. 2006. \\"Mongolia\\". In Iveta Silova, Virginija B≈´dienƒó, & Mark Bray (Eds.), Education in a Hidden Marketplace: Monitoring of Private Tutoring. New York: Open Society Institute, pp.257-277 while entrepreneurs in South Korea make use of computers and other forms of technology. ===Policy=== A 2012 study by the Asian Development Bank and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong recommended policymakers across the region take a closer look at how ‚Äòshadow education‚Äô affects family budgets, children's time, and national education systems. It suggested that in order to reduce the need for private lessons, improvements in mainstream schools should be made. Regulations are also needed to protect consumers. ==Costs of tutoring== Some studies have estimated costs associated with \\"shadow education\\". In Pakistan, expenditures on tutoring per child averaged $3.40 a month in 2011. In India, average spending was lower, but still equated to about $2 per month.Aslam, Monazza & Paul Atherton. 2011. \\"The \\"Shadow\\" Education Sector in India and Pakistan: The Determinants, Benefits and Equity Effects of Private Tutoring.\\" Presentation at the UKFIET (United Kingdom Forum for International Education and Training) Conference, University of Oxford, 13‚Äì15 September. In Georgia, household expenditures for private tutoring at the secondary school level was $48 million in 2011.EPPM (International Institute of Education Policy, Planning & Management). 2011. Study of Private Tutoring in Georgia. Tbilisi: EPPM, p.29. (In Georgian) In Hong Kong, the business of providing private tutoring to secondary schools reached $255 million in 2011.Synovate Limited. 2011. Marketing survey of tutoring businesses in Hong Kong, cited in Modern Education Group Limited (2011), Global Offering (for stock market launch), Hong Kong, p.96. In India, a 2008 survey estimated the size of the private tutoring sector to be $6.4 billion.Vora, Nikhil & Shweta Dewan. 2009. Indian Education Sector: Long Way from Graduation!. Mumbai: IDFC-SSK Securities Ltd., p.60. In Japan, families spent $12 billion in 2010 on private tutoring. In the Republic of Korea, where the government has attempted to cool down the private tutoring market, shadow education costs have continually grown, reaching a staggering $17.3 billion in 2010. Household expenditures on private tutoring are equivalent to about 80% of government expenditures on public education for primary and secondary students.Kim, Sunwoong & Ju-Ho Lee. 2010. \\"Private Tutoring and Demand for Education in South Korea.\\" Economic Development and Cultural Change 58(2), p.261. In the United States, the tutoring market is fragmented. Some online tutoring marketplaces, however, have managed to aggregate a large number of private tutors on their platform and also tutoring data. For example, one such site has over 34,000 registered tutors in California and made public their tutoring hourly rate data. ==Effectiveness== In many countries, individuals can become tutors without training. In some countries, including Cambodia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, and Tajikistan, the pattern of classroom teachers supplementing their incomes by tutoring students after school hours is more a necessity than a choice, as many teachers‚Äô salaries hover close to the poverty line. In the Republic of Korea, the number of private tutors expanded roughly 7.1% annually on average from 2001 to 2006, and by 2009 the sector was the largest employer of graduates from the humanities and social sciences.Kim, Kyung-Min & Daekwon Park. 2012. \\"Impacts of Urban Economic Factors on Private Tutoring Industry.\\" Asia Pacific Education Review 13 (20), p.273. Private tutoring is not always effective in raising academic achievement; and in some schools students commonly skip classes or sleep through lessons because they are tired after excessive external study. This means that the shadow system can make regular schooling less efficient. Teachers who spend more time focusing on private lessons than regular classes can cause greater inefficiencies in the mainstream school system. Situations in which teachers provide extra private lessons for pupils for whom they are already responsible in the public system can lead to corruption, particularly when teachers deliberately teach less in their regular classes in order to promote the market for private lessons. When private tutoring is provided by well trained tutor however the effects can be dramatic, with pupils improving performance by two standard deviations. See also Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem. ==Types of tutoring== There can be an existing overlap between different types of tutoring with respect to the setting or location of tutoring, the size of tutor-learner pairings/groups, and the method of tutoring provided, for example, one-on-one peer tutoring can take place through online tutoring. Tutoring is typically private since it is exists independent of the system of public and private education, that is, one can be enrolled in public/private schooling and attend private tutoring services. === Academic coaching === Academic coaching is a type of mentoring applied to academics. Coaching involves a collaborative approach. Coaches try to help students learn how they best learn and how to operate in an academic environment. Tutors help students learn the material in individual courses while coaches help students learn how to be successful in school. In college, that includes such topics as: study skills, time management, stress management, effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, and understanding how to use a syllabus. Academic coaches meet with the student regularly throughout the semester. Coaches work with students in all kinds of situations, not just those who are struggling academically. Academic coaching is also serves to help students prepare for entrance exams to gain entry to schools or universities, and it is a particularly popular in Asia. For example, in India, a majority of students, be it of any class or stream, visit a coaching center or a \\"study circle.\\" ===Home-based tutoring=== In-home tutoring is a form of tutoring that occurs in the home. Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation. This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs. The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil. Due to the informal and private nature of in-home tutoring, there is limited substantial or conclusive information on in-home tutoring. ===Online tutoring=== Online tutoring is another way for a student to receive academic help, either scheduled or on-demand. Sessions are done through an application where a student and tutor can communicate. Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing, online videos and other specialized applets which make it easier to convey information back and forth. Online tutoring has relatively recently emerged as a mechanism to provide tutoring services in contrast to more traditional in-person teaching. One of the potential drawbacks of online tutoring stems from the influx or sensory overload of information from different materials. \\"For example, material presented in multiple modalities run the risk of interrupting the learner from a coherent learning experience, of imposing a ‚Äúsplit attention‚Äù effect (the mind cannot concentrate on two things simultaneously), or of overloading the learner's limited supply of cognitive resources.\\" === Peer tutoring === Peer tutoring refers to the method of tutoring that involves members of the same peer group teaching or tutoring one another. The characteristics of a peer tutoring group/pairing vary across age, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity. It has been defined as \\"a class of practices and strategies that employs peers as one-on-one teachers to provide individualized instruction, practice, repetition, and clarification of concepts\\" ===Tutoring response to Covid-19=== Covid-19 (coronavirus) negatively affected the academic success of students around the world. Some countries (and at least one US State) initiated special tutoring programs to reduce this impact. In May 2020 the Bill and Crissy Haslam Foundation, in partnership with organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs in the State of Tennessee, launched the Tennessee Tutoring Corps to recruit at least 1,000 qualified college tutors to help the most vulnerable K-6th grade students. Some prominent education researchers have called on the U.S. to dramatically expand tutoring programs through organizations such as AmeriCorps. In June 2020, the Dutch Government was the first country to announce a plan to allocate the equivalent of $278 million US to provide extra school support such as summer schools, extended school days, and tutoring. The Ministry of Education proposed to recruit specially trained student-teachers to provide the tutoring. Also in June 2020 the British Government announced plans to spend ¬£1 billion on an education ‚Äúcatch-up plan‚Äù. State primary and secondary schools will split ¬£650 million in additional funding for the 2020-21 academic year to help their pupils catch up on education missed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will have discretion on how the funds are used, however the Department for Education said it expects them to spend some of it on small group tutoring \\"for whoever needs it‚Äù. The remaining ¬£350 million will pay for the establishment of a ‚Äò‚ÄôNational Tutoring Programme‚Äô‚Äô, giving schools access to subsidised tutoring sessions and free coaches for up to two million disadvantaged pupils. ==Effects== === Academic performance === Studies have found that peer tutoring provides academic benefits for learners across the subject areas of \\"reading, mathematics, science, and social studies\\" Peer tutoring has also been found to be an effective teaching method in enhancing the reading comprehension skills of students, especially that of students with a low academic performance at the secondary level in schools. Additionally, peer tutoring has been proven especially useful for those with learning disabilities at the elementary level, while there is mixed evidence showing the effectiveness of peer tutoring for those at the secondary level. One study suggests that phonologically based reading instruction for first-graders at risk for learning disability can be delivered by non-teachers. In the study, non- certified tutors gave students intensive one-to-one tutoring for 30 minutes, 4 days a week for one school year. The students outperformed untutored control students on measures of reading, spelling, and decoding; with effect sizes ranging from .42 to 1.24. The tutoring included instruction in phonological skills, letter-sound correspondence, explicit decoding, rime analysis, writing, spelling, and reading phonetically controlled text. Although the effects diminished at the end of second grade, the tutored students continued to significantly outperform untutored students in decoding and spelling. === Economic effects === Although certain types of tutoring arrangements can require a salary for the tutor, typically tutoring is free of cost and thus financially affordable for learners. The cost-effectiveness of tutoring can prove to be especially beneficial for learners from low-income backgrounds or resource-strapped regions. In contrast, paid tutoring arrangements can create or further highlight socioeconomic disparities between low-income, middle- income and high-income populations. A study found that access to private tutoring was less financially affordable for low-income families, who thus benefited less from private tutoring as compared to high-income populations, who had the resources to profit from private tutoring. ==Issues== === Tutoring as \\"Shadow Education\\" === Tutoring has also emerged as a supplement to public and private schooling in many countries. The supplementary nature of tutoring is a feature in the domain of what some scholars have termed \\"shadow education\\". Shadow education has been defined as \\"a set of educational activities that occur out side formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student's formal school career.\\" The term \\"shadow\\" has four components to it: firstly, the existence of and need for tutoring is produced by the existence of the formal education system; secondly, the formal education system is the mainstream system and thus tutoring is its shadow; thirdly, the focus remains on mainstream education in schools; fourthly, tutoring is largely informal and unstructured as compared to formal or mainstream education. As a consequence of the popularity of shadow education, private tutoring can sometimes overshadow mainstream education with more priority given to enrolling in private tutoring centers. Mark Bray claims that \\"Especially near the time of major external examinations, schools in some countries may be perceived by pupils to be less able to cater for their specific needs.\\" ==Tutoring agency== A tutoring agency is a business that acts as an intermediary between people who are looking for tutors and tutors wishing to offer their services. The term tuition agency is an alternative term, used specifically in Singapore and Malaysia. ===Purpose and function=== Tutoring agencies are commercial organisations, specializing in introducing tutors to students requiring help in academic studies. Tutoring agencies exist largely due to the problems parents and students face in finding a specialist who can help them with the study of one or more specific subjects. Some agencies contract directly with the client (usually parents) to provide service. The point of contact is between the client and the agency. Tutoring agencies may charge tutors a commission fee for assigning jobs to them. In India, Malaysia and Singapore, this fee would typically be a half of the allocated job's monthly revenue to a tutor. Jobs that are assigned for a short duration, for example in the case of last minute revision for an exam, may carry a lesser fee of around a quarter of the job's monthly revenue to a tutor. Some tutoring agencies do not charge commission fees for jobs assigned to tutors or students. Alternatively, clients may be sent a list of names of tutors who have pre-registered with the tutoring agency and then contact the names on the list to ascertain which tutors are available and, if acceptable, make contractual arrangements with the chosen tutor. At the same time, tutors are given the name and contact details of the client and are encouraged to get their call in first. ===Tutoring around the world=== Tutoring agencies are common in many countries including Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, the UAE, the U.K. and the U.S.A., although it is not regulated in most countries. In the UK, after much discussion in the media, a limited company was set up in October 2013. The Tutors' Association was previously named The London Association Of Certified Financial Analysts. In the US there are at least three professional tutoring associations: the Association for the Coaching and Tutoring Professsion (ACTP) https://myatp.org , the American Tutoring Association and the National Tutoring Association . In Australia there is the Australian Tutoring Association . In Singapore, tutoring agencies, also known as tuition agencies, are not regulated by the Ministry of Education. ===Tutors=== There are both full-time and part-time tutors. Part-time tutors may be students who want to earn extra money while they are still going to school, such as undergraduates of universities. Tutors may be self-employed. If the agency does not employ the tutors, then the agency is remunerated by the tutor, who adds a fee to the amount that the client is charged each lesson, and then passes the fees back to the agency weekly or monthly as required. In Singapore, although tutor registration is generally free of charge, tutors will have to pay a percentage of his or her first month's tuition fee, usually 60% to the tuition agency as commission for referring them to students. Tutors will subsequently be paid the full month's tuition fees by the customer (the parents), according to the pre-arranged agreement. If tutors are employed by the agency, the agency handles all client contract and payment arrangements. The agency is then responsible for employing the tutor with all that employment entails. From the agency's point of view, there is no longer any requirement to declare the fees charged by the agency (something which can cause friction with clients who do not appreciate the high cost of recruitment, vetting etc.) but they are now responsible for employee benefits due to the tutor. ===Controversies=== In Singapore, parents and students have positive as well as negative comments. Tutoring centers (tuition centers) must be registered with the Singapore Ministry of Education. However, tutoring agencies (tuition agencies) are not. Instead, tutoring agencies are required to register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) under the Business Registration Act. There is a history of poor compliance and consumer complaints. ==See also== * Cram school * Homework coach * Learning by teaching * Mentorship * Peer-mediated instruction * Teacher * Tuition agency * Tutorial * Virtual education ==References== Category:Education terminology Category:Learning Category:Teaching ms:Tuisyen ","title":"Tutor"},{"id":"299970","text":"A college-preparatory school (shortened to preparatory school, prep school, or college prep) is a type of secondary school. The term can refer to public, private independent or parochial schools primarily designed to prepare students for higher education. ==North America== ===United States=== In the United States, there are public, private, and charter college preparatory schools and they can be either parochial or secular. Admission is sometimes based on specific selection criteria, usually academic, but some schools have open enrollment. Fewer than 1% of students enrolled in school in the United States attend an independent, private preparatory school, compared to 9% who attend parochial schools and 88% who attend public schools. Public and charter college preparatory schools are typically connected to a local school district and draw from the entire district instead of the closest school zone. Some offer specialized courses or curricula that prepare students for a specific field of study, while others use the label as a promotional tool without offering programs that differ from a conventional high school. The term \\"prep school\\" in the U.S. is usually associated with private, elite institutions that have very selective admission criteria and high tuition fees, catering to students in the 13 - 18 age range. Prep schools can be day schools, boarding schools, or both, and may be co-educational or single-sex. Currently day schools are more common than boarding, and since the 1970s co- educational schools are more common than single-sex.Sarah Alexander Chase, Perfectly prep: Gender extremes at a New England prep school (Oxford University Press, 2008) Unlike the public schools which are free, they charge tuition ($10,000 to 40,000+ a year in 2014).Lisa R. Bass, \\"Boarding schools and capital benefits: Implications for urban school reform.\\" The Journal of Educational Research (2014) 107#1 pp: 16‚Äì35. Some prep schools are affiliated with a particular religious denomination. Unlike parochial schools, independent preparatory schools are not governed by a religious organization, and students are usually not required to receive instruction in one particular religion. While independent prep schools in the United States are not subject to government oversight or regulation, they are accredited by one of the six regional accreditation agencies for educational institutions. ==Japan== In Japan, college-prep schools are called \\"yobikou\\" (‰∫àÂÇôÊ†°), which literally means a school used to progress into another school. Prep schools in Japan are usually considered prestigious and are often difficult to get into. However, there are many tiers of prep schools, the entry into which depends on the university that the school leads into.William K. Cummings, Education and equality in Japan (Princeton University Press, 2014). Japanese prep schools started as \\"chu-gakkou\\" (‰∏≠Â≠¶Ê†°), secondary schools for boys, which were founded after the secondary school law in 1886. Later, \\"koutou-jo-gakkou\\" (È´òÁ≠âÂ•≥Â≠¶Ê†°), secondary school for girls (1891), and \\"jitsugyo-gakkou\\" (ÂÆüÊ•≠Â≠¶Ê†°), vocational schools (1924), were included among \\"chutou-gakkou\\" and were legally regarded as schools on the same level as school for boys, but graduates from those two types of schools had more requirements on college entrance. In the modern period, many Japanese secondary schools were five-year schools except for during a short term from 1943 to 1946. The social status of \\"chu-gakkou\\", or \\"kyusei chu-gakkou\\" (ÊóßÂà∂‰∏≠Â≠¶Ê†°), secondary schools for boys under the old system, didn't disappear even after the new system (6-3-3) took effect in 1947. Plenty of \\"shin-gakkou\\" are six-year schools these days, and many of them have their origins in \\"kyusei chu-gakkou\\" and \\"kotou jo-gakkou\\", or ones attached to universities. Japanese pupils who aspire to a prep school education take written examinations when they are in sixth grade in each prep school. Other than six-year prep schools, the top municipal senior high school (three-year schools) in each school zone and some high-ranked private senior high schools (ditto) are also regarded as \\"shingaku-kou\\" (ÈÄ≤Â≠¶Ê†°). In the 21st century, some trial cases that connect public junior and senior high schools are seen in each region, too, which broadens education for college entrance. As Japanese government provides grant-in-aid to private schools, the tuition is 5,000‚Äì10,000 US dollars per year even if it is a private school. ==See also== * International Baccalaureate * Cram school ==References== ==Further reading== * Adam Hochschild, Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels (Syracuse University Press, 1997), \\"World on a Hilltop,\\" pp. 123‚Äì139. ==External links== * The Independent Schools Directory (Global) * National Association of Independent Schools * Independent Schools Association of the Southwest * Canadian Association of Independent Schools * The Association of Boarding Schools Category:School types * Category:High schools and secondary schools ","title":"College-preparatory school"},{"id":"299971","text":"A sedative or tranquilliser is a substance that induces sedation by reducing irritability or excitement.

In spite of the fact that each sedative acts in its own way, they all produce beneficial relaxing effects by increasing GABA activity. At higher doses, it may result in slurred speech, staggering gait, poor judgment, and slow, uncertain reflexes. Doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepines, when used as a hypnotic to induce sleep, tend to be higher than amounts used to relieve anxiety, whereas only low doses are needed to provide a peaceful effect. Sedatives can be misused to produce an overly- calming effect (alcohol being the classic and most common sedating drug). In the event of an overdose or if combined with another sedative, many of these drugs can cause deep unconsciousness (see hypnotic) and even death. ==Terminology== There is some overlap between the terms \\"sedative\\" and \\"hypnotic\\". Advances in pharmacology have permitted more specific targeting of receptors, and greater selectivity of agents, which necessitates greater precision when describing these agents and their effects: * Anxiolytic refers specifically to the effect upon anxiety. (However, some benzodiazepines can be all three: sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics). * Tranquilizer can refer to anxiolytics or antipsychotics. * Soporific and sleeping pill are near-synonyms for hypnotics. === The term \\"chemical cosh\\" === The term \\"chemical cosh\\" (a club) is sometimes used popularly for a strong sedative, particularly for: * widespread dispensation of antipsychotic drugs in residential care to make people with dementia easier to manage. * use of methylphenidate to calm children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, though paradoxically this drug is known to be a stimulant. ** See also Antipsychotic controversy ===Types of sedatives=== ==Therapeutic use== Doctors often administer sedatives to patients in order to dull the patient's anxiety related to painful or anxiety-provoking procedures. Although sedatives do not relieve pain in themselves, they can be a useful adjunct to analgesics in preparing patients for surgery, and are commonly given to patients before they are anaesthetized, or before other highly uncomfortable and invasive procedures like cardiac catheterization, colonoscopy or MRI. == Risks == ===Sedative dependence=== Some sedatives can cause psychological and physical dependence when taken regularly over a period of time, even at therapeutic doses. Dependent users may get withdrawal symptoms ranging from restlessness and insomnia to convulsions and death. When users become psychologically dependent, they feel as if they need the drug to function, although physical dependence does not necessarily occur, particularly with a short course of use. In both types of dependences, finding and using the sedative becomes the focus in life. Both physical and psychological dependence can be treated with therapy. ===Misuse=== Many sedatives can be misused, but barbiturates and benzodiazepines are responsible for most of the problems with sedative use due to their widespread recreational or non-medical use. People who have difficulty dealing with stress, anxiety or sleeplessness may overuse or become dependent on sedatives. Some heroin users may take them either to supplement their drug or to substitute for it. Stimulant users may take sedatives to calm excessive jitteriness. Others take sedatives recreationally to relax and forget their worries. Barbiturate overdose is a factor in nearly one-third of all reported drug-related deaths. These include suicides and accidental drug poisonings. Accidental deaths sometimes occur when a drowsy, confused user repeats doses, or when sedatives are taken with alcohol. A study from the United States found that in 2011, sedatives and hypnotics were a leading source of adverse drug events (ADEs) seen in the hospital setting: Approximately 2.8% of all ADEs present on admission and 4.4% of ADEs that originated during a hospital stay were caused by a sedative or hypnotic drug.Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A. Origin of Adverse Drug Events in U.S. Hospitals, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #158. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. July 2013. A second study noted that a total of 70,982 sedative exposures were reported to U.S. poison control centers in 1998, of which 2310 (3.2%) resulted in major toxicity and 89 (0.1%) resulted in death. About half of all the people admitted to emergency rooms in the U.S. as a result of nonmedical use of sedatives have a legitimate prescription for the drug, but have taken an excessive dose or combined it with alcohol or other drugs. There are also serious paradoxical reactions that may occur in conjunction with the use of sedatives that lead to unexpected results in some individuals. Malcolm Lader at the Institute of Psychiatry in London estimates the incidence of these adverse reactions at about 5%, even in short-term use of the drugs. The paradoxical reactions may consist of depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, violent behavior and symptoms sometimes misdiagnosed as psychosis. ===Dangers of combining sedatives and alcohol=== Sedatives and alcohol are sometimes combined recreationally or carelessly. Since alcohol is a strong depressant that slows brain function and depresses respiration, the two substances compound each other's actions and this combination can prove fatal. === Worsening of psychiatric symptoms === The long-term use of benzodiazepines may have a similar effect on the brain as alcohol, and are also implicated in depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mania, psychosis, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders (including benzodiazepine-induced persisting dementia which persists even after the medications are stopped). As with alcohol, the effects of benzodiazepine on neurochemistry, such as decreased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, are believed to be responsible for their effects on mood and anxiety. Additionally, benzodiazepines can indirectly cause or worsen other psychiatric symptoms (e.g., mood, anxiety, psychosis, irritability) by worsening sleep (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced sleep disorder). Like alcohol, benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep but, while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood). === Dementia === Sedatives and hypnotics should be avoided in people with dementia, according to the medication appropriateness tool for co‚Äêmorbid health conditions in dementia criteria. The use of these medications can further impede cognitive function for people with dementia, who are also more sensitive to side effects of medications. ===Amnesia=== Sedatives can sometimes leave the patient with long-term or short-term amnesia. Lorazepam is one such pharmacological agent that can cause anterograde amnesia. Intensive care unit patients who receive higher doses over longer periods, typically via IV drip, are more likely to experience such side effects. Additionally, the prolonged use of tranquilizers increases the risk of obsessive and compulsive disorder, where the person becomes unaware whether he has performed a scheduled activity or not, he may also repetitively perform tasks and still re-performs the same task trying to make-up for coutinous doubts. Remembering names that were earlier known becomes an issue such that the memory loss becomes apparent. ===Disinhibition and crime=== Sedatives ‚Äî most commonly alcohol but also GHB, Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), and to a lesser extent, temazepam (Restoril), and midazolam (Versed) ‚Äî have been reported for their use as date rape drugs (also called a Mickey) and being administered to unsuspecting patrons in bars or guests at parties to reduce the intended victims' defenses. These drugs are also used for robbing people. Statistical overviews suggest that the use of sedative-spiked drinks for robbing people is actually much more common than their use for rape. Cases of criminals taking rohypnol themselves before they commit crimes have also been reported, as the loss of inhibitions from the drug may increase their confidence to commit the offence, and the amnesia produced by the drug makes it difficult for police to interrogate them if they are caught. == See also == * Hypnotic * Antidepressants * Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome * Tranquilizer * Tranquilizer gun * Diphenhydramine citrate ==Notes== == References == == Further reading == * Tone, Andrea.

(literally: \\"Fount of Life\\") was an SS-initiated, state-supported, registered association in Nazi Germany with the goal of raising the birth rate of Aryan children of persons classified as 'racially pure' and 'healthy' based on Nazi racial hygiene and health ideology. Lebensborn provided welfare to its mostly unmarried mothers, encouraged anonymous births by unmarried women at their maternity homes, and mediated adoption of these children by likewise 'racially pure' and 'healthy' parents, particularly SS members and their families. The Cross of Honour of the German Mother was given to the women who bore the most Aryan children. Abortion was legalised by the Nazis for disabled children, but strictly punished otherwise. Initially set up in Germany in 1935, Lebensborn expanded into several occupied European countries with Germanic populations during the Second World War. It included the selection of 'racially worthy' orphans for adoption and care for children born from Aryan women who had been in relationships with SS members. It originally excluded children born from unions between common soldiers and foreign women, because there was no proof of 'racial purity' on both sides. During the war, many children were kidnapped from their parents and judged by Aryan criteria for their suitability to be raised in Lebensborn homes, and fostering by German families. At the Nuremberg Trials, much direct evidence was found of the kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany, across Greater Germany during the period 1939‚Äì1945. ==Background== The Lebensborn e.V. (e.V. stands for eingetragener Verein or registered association), meaning \\"fount of life\\", was founded on 12 December 1935, to counteract falling birth rates in Germany, and to promote Nazi eugenics. Located in Munich, the organization was partly an office within the Schutzstaffel (SS) responsible for certain family welfare programs, and partly a society for Nazi leaders. On 13 September 1936, Heinrich Himmler wrote the following to members of the SS: In 1939, membership stood at 8,000, of which 3,500 were SS leaders. The Lebensborn office was part of SS Rasse und Siedlungshauptamt (SS Race and Settlement Main Office) until 1938, when it was transferred to Hauptamt Pers√∂nlicher Stab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (Personal Staff of the Reichf√ºhrer-SS), i.e. directly overseen by Himmler. Leaders of Lebensborn e. V. were SS-Standartenf√ºhrer and SS-Oberf√ºhrer Dr. . ==Implementation== Christening of a Lebensborn child, c. 1935‚Äì1936 Initially the programme served as a welfare institution for wives of SS officers; the organization ran facilitiesprimarily maternity homeswhere women could give birth or get help with family matters. The programme also accepted unmarried women who were either pregnant or had already given birth and were in need of aid, provided that both the woman and the father of the child were classified as \\"racially valuable\\". About 60% of the mothers were unmarried. The program allowed them to give birth secretly away from home without social stigma. In case the mothers wanted to give up the children, the program also had orphanages and an adoption service. When dealing with non-SS members, parents and children were usually examined by SS doctors before admission. The first Lebensborn home (known as 'Heim Hochland') opened in 1936, in Steinh√∂ring, a tiny village not far from Munich. The first home outside of Germany opened in Norway in 1941. Many of these facilities were established in confiscated houses and former nursing homes owned by Jews. Leaders of the League of German Girls were instructed to recruit young women with the potential to become good breeding partners for SS officers. While Lebensborn e. V. established facilities in several occupied countries, its activities were concentrated around Germany, Norway and occupied northeastern Europe, mainly Poland. The main focus in occupied Norway was aiding children born to Norwegian women and fathered by German soldiers. In northeastern Europe the organisation, in addition to services provided to SS members, engaged in the transfer of children, mostly orphans, to families in Germany. Lebensborn e. V. had or planned to have facilities in the following countries (some were merely field offices): * Germany: 10 * Austria: 3 * Poland (General Governmentthe occupied Polish territory and annexed lands of Poland): 6 (8 if Stettin and Bad Polzin are included.)Bydgoszcz, Krak√≥w, Helen√≥wek pod ≈ÅodziƒÖ, Otwock, Smoszew ko≈Ço Krotoszyna, Smoszewo; 8 if you include Stettin and Po≈Çczyn-Zdr√≥j (which became a part of Poland only after the war) * Norway: 9 * Denmark: 2 * France: 1 (February 1944August 1944)in Lamorlaye * Belgium: 1 (March 1943September 1944)in W√©gimont, in the municipality of Soumagne * Netherlands: 1 * Luxembourg: 1 About 8,000 children were born in Lebensborn homes in Germany, and between 8,000 and 12,000 children in Norway. Elsewhere the total number of births was much lower. For more information about Lebensborn in Norway, see war children. In Norway the Lebensborn organisation handled approximately 250 adoptions. In most of these cases the mothers had agreed to the adoption, but not all were informed that their children would be sent to Germany for adoption. The Norwegian government recovered all but 80 of these children after the war. ==Germanisation== Kidnapping of Polish children during the Nazi-German resettlement operation in Zamo≈õƒá county Polish children in Nazi- German labour camp in Dzier≈ºƒÖzna near Zgierz In 1939, the Nazis started to kidnap children from foreign countriesmainly from Yugoslavia and Poland, but also including Russia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Norway for the Lebensborn program. They started to do this because \\"It is our duty to take [the children] with us to remove them from their environment ... either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people or we destroy this blood,\\" Himmler reportedly said. The Nazis would seize children in full view of the parents. The kidnapped children were administered several tests and were categorised into three groups: * those considered desirable to be included into the German population, * those who were acceptable, and * the unwanted. The children classified as unwanted were taken to concentration camps to work or were killed. The children from the other groups, if between the ages of 2 and 6, were placed with families in the programme to be brought up by them in a kind of foster child status. Children of ages 6 to 12 were placed in German boarding schools. The schools assigned the children new German names and taught them to be proud to be part of Germany. They forced the children to forget their birth parents and erased any records of their ancestry. Those who resisted Germanisation were beaten and, if a child continued to rebel, he or she would be sent to a concentration camp.\\"The Lebensborn\\", Jewish Virtual Library's description of the Lebensborn program In the final stages of the war, the files of all children kidnapped for the programme were destroyed. As a result, researchers have found it nearly impossible to learn how many children were taken. The Polish government has claimed that 10,000 children were kidnapped, and less than 15% were returned to their biological parents. Other estimates include numbers as high as 200,000, although according to Dirk Moses a more likely number is around 20,000. ==Post-war== ===Kidnapping charges=== trial at Nuremberg After the war, the branch of the Lebensborn organisation operating in north-eastern Europe was accused of kidnapping children deemed 'racially valuable' in order to resettle them with German families. However, of approximately 10,000 foreign-born children located after the war in the American-controlled area of Germany, in the trial of the leaders of the Lebensborn organisation (United States of America v. Ulrich Greifelt, et al.), the court found that 340 had been handled by Lebensborn e. V. The accused were acquitted on charges of kidnapping. The court found ample evidence of an existing programme of the kidnapping or forced movement of children in north-eastern Europe, but concluded that these activities were carried out by individuals who were not members of Lebensborn. Exactly how many children were moved by Lebensborn or other organisations remains unknown due to the destruction of archives by SS members prior to fleeing the advancing Allied forces. From the trial's transcript:Trial of Ulrich Greifelt and Others, United Nations War Crimes Commission. Part III > The prosecution has failed to prove with the requisite certainty the > participation of Lebensborn, and the defendants connected there with in the > kidnapping programme conducted by the Nazis. While the evidence has > disclosed that thousands upon thousands of children were unquestionably > kidnapped by other agencies or organisations and brought into Germany, the > evidence has further disclosed that only a small percentage of the total > number ever found their way into Lebensborn. And of this number only in > isolated instances did Lebensborn take children who had a living parent. The > majority of those children in any way connected with Lebensborn were orphans > of ethnic Germans. Upon the evidence submitted, the defendant Sollmann is > found not guilty on counts one and two of the indictment. ===Treatment of children=== After Germany's surrender, the press reported on the unusually good weight and health of the \\"super babies\\". They spent time outdoors in sunlight and received two baths a day. Everything that came into contact with the babies was disinfected first. Nurses ensured that the children ate everything given to them. Until the last days of the war, the mothers and the children at maternity homes got the best treatment available, including food, although others in the area were starving. Once the war ended, local communities often took revenge on the women, beating them, cutting off their hair, and running them out of the community. Many Lebensborn children were born to unwed mothers. After the war, Lebensborn survivors were often subjected to ostracization. ===False assumptions=== Himmler's effort to secure a 'racially pure' Greater Germany, sloppy journalism on the subject, as well as Nazi ideology retained by some, led to persistent false assumptions about the programme. The main misconception, perpetuated by Nazi sympathizers as a straw man, was that the programme involved coercive breeding. The first stories reporting that Lebensborn was a coercive breeding programme can be found in the German magazine Revue, which ran a series on the subject in the 1950s. The programme did intend to promote the growth of Aryan populations, through encouraging relationships between German soldiers and Nordic women in occupied countries. Access to Lebensborn was restricted in accordance with the Nordicist eugenic and racial policies of Nazism, which could be referred to as supervised selective breeding. Recently discovered records and ongoing testimony of Lebensborn childrenand some of their parentsshows that some SS men did sire children in Himmler's Lebensborn program.\\"Himmler was my godfather\\", Times (UK) Online, 6 November 2006 This was widely rumored within Germany during the period of the programme.Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, pp. 246‚Äì7, ==Self-help groups and aftermath== Help, recognition, and justice for Lebensborn survivors have been varied. In Norway, children born to Norwegian mothers by German fathers were allegedly often bullied, raped, abused, and persecuted by the government after the war, and placed in mental institutions. The Norwegian government attempted to deport Lebensborn to Germany, Brazil, and Australia but did not succeed. A group of Lebensborn children sued the Norwegian government into admitting complicity. In 2008, their case before the European Court of Human Rights was dismissed, but they were each offered an ¬£8,000 payment from the Norwegian government.Rob Sharp, \\"The chosen ones: The war children born to Nazi fathers in a sinister eugenics scheme speak out\\", The Independent, 20 January 2008. Retrieved 23 April 2015. In November 2006, in the German town of Wernigerode, an open meeting took place among several Lebensborn children, with the intention of dispelling myths and encouraging those affected to investigate their origins.\\"Nazi 'master race' children meet\\", BBC News, 4 November 2006David Crossland, \\"Nazi Program to Breed Master Race: Lebensborn Children Break Silence\\", Spiegel, 07 November 2006.

Retrieved 23 April 2015. Other countries that had Lebensborn clinics include France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, and Luxembourg.

In the television series, The Man in the High Castle, Joe Blake and Nicole D√∂rmer are among several characters who were Lebensborn children. The video game My Child Lebensborn, which won the BAFTA Games Awards in 2018 for \\"Game Beyond Entertainment\\", lets players experience the bullying Lebensborn children went through after the war.

The university's main, residential campus is situated on 160 acres (65 ha) near downtown Redlands. An additional eight regional locations throughout California largely provide programs for working adults. ==History== ===Founding=== While currently a secular institution overall, the University of Redlands' roots go back to the founding of two other American Baptist institutions, California College in Oakland, and Los Angeles University. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake damaged the finances of California College, a Baptist commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in Southern California. The Reverend Jasper Newton Field, a Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to propose a donation of at least $100,000 and for an interdenominational campus on land donated by a K.C. Wells. On June 27, 1907 the Commission voted in favor of the Redlands proposal. Ground was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. Nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending. On January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the administration building. Bekins Hall and the President's mansion were the only two other buildings completed. Now-university president Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for endowment, but the 1912 United States cold wave, which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible. President Field resigned in 1914. Victor LeRoy Duke, dean and mathematics professor, became the next president. The southern California Baptist community initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment. By 1925, the faculty numbered 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, the University was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, a gymnasium, and Memorial Chapel were built. A school of education was added. A developing alumni base also started to support the University. By 1928, the University's endowment was $2.592 million, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities.Nelson, Lawrence Emmerson, \\"Redlands: Biography of a College, the first fifty years of the University of Redlands\\" University of Redlands, CA 1958. ===The Great Depression=== By the beginning of 1932, the effects of the Great Depression started to be felt at the university. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the university owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, President Duke died of a cerebral hemorrhage. The administration of the university's third president, Clarence Howe Thurber, soon ran afoul of ultra-conservative churches. Student members complained of a liberal attitude toward Baptist doctrine being taught at the campus. The later affair of William H. Roberts, a psychology professor who became the campaign manager of Upton Sinclair's run for governor in 1934, also severely strained town and gown relations. ===During and after World War II=== The 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands particularly with the onset of direct U.S. involvement in World War II. As conscription and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and March Field. The July 1, 1943, arrival of a Navy V-12 unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, was Redlands‚Äô largest enrollment ever, and gradually led to the easing of social restrictions. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year's Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever on the campus. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the trustees finally discarded the \\"no dancing\\" policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.Moore, Frank E. \\"Redlands, Our Town\\" Moore Historical Foundation, Redlands, California, 1987 The passage of the G.I. Bill further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units for 50 veterans' families (\\"Vets' Village\\") were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June 1949, 126 were veterans, 70 of whom were married. The 1950s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements were made to the university. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the university was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hunnex, in Philosophy. Compulsory chapel attendance fell to the student militancy of the 1960s and 1970s. The seventh president of the university, Dr. Douglas Moore, was not Baptist. The school went some years without clergymen on the Board of Trustees. Following Moore, James R. Appleton served as the eighth president of the University of Redlands for 18 years from 1987‚Äì2005. Dr. Stuart Dorsey served as the ninth president of the University of Redlands from 2005 to 2010. During this period, the university opened the Center for the Arts, and renovated the Armacost Library, adding five computer laboratories and a caf√©. Dr. Dorsey resigned his position on March 16, 2010, amid controversy over budget deficits and proposed cuts. On March 17, 2010, the then-current chancellor and former president Dr. James R. Appleton was appointed for a two- year term. In August 2012, Dr. Ralph Kuncl became the 11th president of the University of Redlands. As president, he has focused on expanding the internationalization of the University, raising its stature by bringing public intellectuals into campus residence as University Distinguished Fellows, leading a comprehensive campaign, and strengthening the University's financial health. In February 2019, the university announced an agreement in principle to acquire San Francisco Theological Seminary (SFTS) in a transaction that would preserve the secular nature of the university as a whole, while maintaining the historic religious affiliations of SFTS. The deal closed on July 1, 2019, creating a new U of R graduate school‚Äîthe Graduate School of Theology‚Äîand a U of R campus in the Bay Area that hosts programming from both institutions. ==Organization== Naslund Study Lounge in Armacost Library Students at the university study in one of several schools and centers: College of Arts & Sciences (including the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies, School of Music, and Center for Spatial Studies); School of Business (including the School of Continuing Studies); School of Education; and Graduate School of Theology. ===College of Arts and Sciences=== The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) serves approximately 2,400 undergraduate students and 100 graduate students from 41 states and 28 countries. The College has 187 full-time faculty members serving more than 50 major areas of study. Eighty- five percent of full-time faculty have a Ph.D. or terminal degree. The student-faculty ratio is approximately 13:1; the average class size is 19. Professors or instructors teach all courses and sections. ====Johnston Center for Integrative Studies==== Born in the midst of the Experiential Education Movement, Johnston College is an endowed college that began as an experiment in professor-student mentor relationships and a student-initiated, contract- driven education, and operated as an autonomous unit of the University for approximately 10 years. The first class of approximately 30 students graduated in 1972. The structure of the educational system was based on seminars (8‚Äì10 students), tutorials (3‚Äì8), and independent studies. In 1979, it was integrated into the College of Arts and Sciences as the Johnston Center for Individualized Studies. It operated under that name until the mid-1990s, when it was renamed the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies. Today, about 200 Redlands students live and learn together in the Johnston complex, which includes two residence halls and five faculty offices. Students design their own majors in consultation with faculty and write contracts for their courses, for which they receive narrative evaluations in lieu of traditional grades. ====School of Music==== The University of Redlands School of Music was founded along with the University as its School of Fine Arts. It is today an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music, and its requirements for entrance and graduation comply with the standards of this accrediting organization. Approximately 350 students study music with 13 full-time and 26 adjunct faculty. The School of Music offers Bachelor of Music (BM) degrees in Composition, Performance, and Education; Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees in Music; and Master of Music (MM) degrees. Any University student may participate in musical activities through enrollment (usually by audition) in the University Choir, Chapel Singers, Madrigals, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, Studio Jazz Band, Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, University Opera, and a variety of chamber music ensembles. Students are invited to register for private, group, or class lessons, available on all instruments and for voice. ====Center for Spatial Studies==== The Center for Spatial Studies endeavors to create a spatially infused learning community at the University of Redlands, through faculty-student interaction, research, and community service. ===School of Business=== Founded in 1976 as the Alfred North Whitehead College for Lifelong Learning, the School of Business began as an experiment in providing educational services to working adults in locations throughout Southern California. It was one of the first successful ventures in quality education through off-site learning. It evolved to become the School of Business in 2001. The School of Business currently has approximately 700 undergraduate students and close to 800 graduate students (2010), taught by 22 full-time and 46 adjunct professors. Classes are held at the Redlands campus as well as regional campuses in Burbank, Orange County, Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario, Riverside, Temecula, Torrance, and San Diego. Programs are also planned on the University's new campus in Marin County, California. Degrees granted by the School of Business include: B.S. in Management; B.S. in Business; MBA (in daytime, evening, and online programs); MBA Concentrations in Location Analytics, Marketing, Global Business, and Financing; M.S. in Organizational Leadership; and M.S. in Information Technology. ====School of Continuing Studies==== Part of the School of Business, the School of Continuing Studies offers certificate programs, individual courses, workshops, and onsite custom programs offered as open enrollment, with no formal admission or application required of participants. ===School of Education=== The oldest graduate division within the University, the School of Education was founded in 1924. As of 2006, it serves 516 students in graduate coursework, with 17 full-time professors and 30 adjunct professors. Geared primarily to the working professional, the School also partners with the College of Arts and Sciences to offer undergraduates a chance to earn their teaching credential. The School offers master's degrees in learning and teaching, curriculum and instruction, clinical mental health counseling, school counseling, educational administration, and higher education, as well a number of credentials: Preliminary Teaching Credential (multiple or single subject), Education Specialist Teaching Credential, Pupil Personnel Services Credential‚ÄîSchool Counseling, Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (Tier 1), and Clear Administrative Services Credential (Tier II). In addition, a Doctorate in Leadership for Educational Justice (Ed.D.), the University's only doctoral program, is grounded in theories of social justice and a commitment to ensuring equity for students from all backgrounds. In 2001, the School of Education partnered with the Lewis Center for Educational Research in Apple Valley, California to offer Preliminary Teaching Credentials onsite and serve Apple Valley and the surrounding high desert communities. In 2008, the University of Redlands School of Education expanded to a second regional campus in Orange County. In 2012, the School began offering programs in Temecula and Rancho Cucamonga. Programs are also planned on the University's new campus in Marin County, California. ====Center for Educational Justice==== The Center for Educational Justice (CEJ) sponsors institutes, symposia, workshops, and other educational efforts. Topics relate to social advocacy, research, policy development, and professional training on equity, fairness, care, respect, and critical consciousness of broader societal inequities. The center was founded in 2005, and is currently under the direction of Dr. Jose Lalas. ===Graduate School of Theology=== The Graduate School of Theology is a multi-faith and interdisciplinary program that resulted from a merger between the San Francisco Theological Seminary and the University of Redlands on July 1, 2019. A member of the Graduate Theological Union (GTU), the Graduate School of Theology also provides its students with access to classes and resources from the GTU's member and affiliate institutions. ====San Francisco Theological Seminary==== Through the Graduate School of Theology, San Francisco Theological Seminary offers Doctor of Ministry, Master of Divinity, and Master of Arts in Theological Studies degree programs, as well as several diplomas and certificates. ====The Shaw Chaplaincy Institute for Spiritual Care + Compassionate Leadership==== The Shaw Chaplaincy Institute is an accredited clinical pastoral education provider offering interfaith programs that explore the spiritual side of providing health care. ====Applied Wisdom Institute==== A spiritual rather than religious hub, the Applied Wisdom Institute provides certificate programs, seminars, and conferences. ==Academics== The University of Redlands offers traditional undergraduate liberal arts degree programs within the College of Arts and Sciences, along with graduate programs in business, education, communicative disorders, music and geographic information systems. The Johnston Center for Integrative Studies offers customized degree programs for undergraduates, based upon a contract system and narrative evaluations. ===Admissions and retention=== In its 2020 rankings, U.S. News & World Report classified admission to the University of Redlands as \\"selective,\\" with an acceptance rate of approximately 68% and a freshmen retention rate of 88%. ==Athletics== Redlands competes in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC), which operates within NCAA Division III. Redlands was one of the founding members of the SCIAC in 1915 and is one of only two schools to have had continuous membership. The university competes in 21 sports: ten men's teams and eleven women's teams. The men's teams include: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swim and dive, tennis, track and field, and water polo. The women's teams include: basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swim and dive, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and water polo. The mission of Bulldog Athletics is to provide student-athletes with an opportunity to compete successfully in an intercollegiate athletic program that is an integral part of their educational experience. About 20 percent of U of R's College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates are student-athletes; including intramural sports (which focus on recreational experiences) more than 50 percent of College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates participate in athletics. The average GPA of student- athletes is 3.2, and 90 percent of student-athletes return for their second year of study at the U of R. In addition to numerous championships, 70 percent of the University's varsity teams have ranked in the top 25 nationally in NCAA Division III and SCIAC since 2009. In 2018, the University embarked on a $20 million campaign for Bulldog Athletics to create a new home for the program on Brockton Avenue, build a new tennis complex, and revitalize the Currier Gymnasium. ===Mascot=== The Bulldogs are represented by a live bulldog mascot, a tradition dating back to 1918. The bulldogs name began not with a dog, but with a football game; in 1917, after Redlands embarrassed a rival school 20-0, the opposing coach was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe U of R football team might well be called the bulldogs of the conference for the fight they put into the game.‚Äù The current mascot is Adelaide, or \\"Addie,\\" named after founding first lady of the University and wife to the university's first president, Jasper Newton Field. Adelaide is the first female mascot in U of R's 100-year-old Bulldog tradition. ==Community service== The university's Community Service Learning program, which is now more than 25 years old, provides students the opportunity to extend their learning beyond the classroom in activities from mentoring local youths to building houses in Mexico. Each year, University of Redlands students complete more than 120,000 hours of service. These efforts have been recognized by the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Role. ==Campus housing== The university, whose Redlands campus has been consistently honored by Arbor Day Foundation as a Tree Campus USA School, offers its undergraduate students guaranteed housing during their four years of study and, for the most part, undergraduate students are required live on campus. Exceptions include students who are over the age of 23, living with a parent, or married; sometimes exemptions are also granted to upperclass students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Many residence halls are \\"living- learning communities,\\" with themes such as \\"freshmen,\\" \\"social justice,\\" \\"substance-free,\\" etc. These themes and configurations change from time to time. ===Alternative living=== The university offers alternative housing to various organizations. Merit houses are awarded to organizations for use during the school year. The university also offers a Greek System, unaffiliated with national Greek organizations, which also contains several houses for residence by the groups' members. The houses that comprise the group of Greek housing are mostly on \\"Frat Row\\", which is located behind the school softball field, all with the exception of the Chi Rho Psi house. ==Greek life== Hunsaker University Center ; Active social fraternities * Pi Chi: founded 1909 * Chi Rho Psi: founded 1927; re-founded 2001 * Chi Sigma Chi: founded 1936 * Kappa Sigma Sigma: founded 1916 *Gamma Delta Rho: founded 2019 ; Active social sororities *Delta Kappa Psi: founded 1910 *Alpha Theta Phi: founded 1911 * Alpha Sigma Pi: founded 1914 *Beta Lambda: founded 1921; re-founded 1988 * Alpha Xi Omicron: founded 1927; re-founded 1998 * Kappa Pi Zeta: founded 1926; re-founded 2011 *Alpha Chi Delta: founded 1927; re-founded 2016 ; Active business fraternities * Delta Sigma Pi: Xi Pi chapter (chapter founded 1999) ; ;Active service fraternities * Alpha Phi Omega: Sigma Beta chapter ; Honors societies * Omicron Delta Kappa: a national leadership honor society emphasizing holistic development * Phi Alpha Theta: a national honor society for the study of history * Phi Beta Kappa: an interdisciplinary national academic honor society * Pi Gamma Mu: an international social science honor society that is dedicated to community service and interdisciplinary scholarship in the social sciences * Psi Chi: a national honor society in the field of psychology * Sigma Tau Delta: a national English honor society that provides social and scholarly opportunities ==Diversity-based exchanges and organizations== In October 2017, the University of Redlands partnered with Tuskegee University, a private, historically black university in Alabama, enabling student and faculty exchanges between the institutions and opening the door to a variety of other joint programming. Diversity-based organizations on the University of Redlands campus include: * Rangi Ya Giza (RYG) (founded on May 15, 1992): non-Greek, diversity based brotherhood that seeks to positively affect the campus and community by organizing service projects, raising awareness of local and global issues, and taking action against injustices in our society. Rangi Ya Giza is Swahili for \\"A Darker Shade\\" to represent their East African roots. RYG focuses specifically on benefiting organizations in the community such as Boys & Girls Club of Redlands, Emmerton Elementary school, and the Stillman House. * Wadada Wa Rangi Wengi (WRW) (founded on October 15, 1992): non-Greek sisterhood dedicated to raising awareness about issues of diversity, gender, and social injustice. Wadada Wa Rangi Wengi means \\"Sisters of Many Shades\\" in Swahili. WRW sponsors many events on campus, including Breast Cancer Awareness Week, Diversity Mixer, and Sexual Violence Awareness Week. (RYG and WRW were both founded in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots.) * Fidelity, Isonomy, Erudition (FIE) (founded on February 10, 2006): co-ed siblinghood that prides itself in its commitment to service and awareness, creating a more empathetic community, and combating a gender binary. Service, Awareness, and Siblinghood are the three pillars the organization's members stand firm on. FIE was recognized as the University's Multicultural Organization of the Year in 2006 & 2010\\\\. ==Filming at Redlands== Due to its location in the Greater Los Angeles Area, The University of Redlands campus has been used as the setting for films such as Goodbye My Fancy, with Joan Crawford and Robert Young, Hell Night, Joy Ride, Slackers, and The Rules of Attraction. It has also been used in at least one Perry Mason episode as a stand-in for the fictional Euclid College. The campus was also used for the Korean drama The Heirs, where Kim Tan (Lee Minho) attends during his exile in America. ==Redlands culture and traditions== * The \\"R\\": This letter carved into the vegetation of the San Bernardino Mountains at 34¬∞11‚Ä≤00‚Ä≥N 117¬∞06‚Ä≤17‚Ä≥W started as prank in 1913, but still stands today and is currently the second-largest collegiate letter in the nation. * Mascot: The university has a live bulldog who serves as its official mascot. The female pup Adelaide now holds the U of R mascot title. Histories are kept of the past and present bulldog mascots on the University of Redlands website. * Commencement: The university holds its annual commencement ceremonies on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday in late April instead of May or June. ==Notable alumni== ===Government and politics=== * Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, former interior minister, brother of king Salman of Saudi Arabia * Pete Aguilar, elected to Congress for the 31st District in November 2014, Former Mayor of Redlands, California * David Boies, attorney, represented the Justice Department in United States v.

Rockefeller. He was often known as ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù, to distinguish him from his father. From early adulthood, he was interested in philanthropy and business ethics. But in 1913, a bitter strike in the Colorado Fuel and Iron company, part-owned by him, had provoked an attack by the National Guard, causing casualties. His action in visiting the miners and their families in person, to resolve their grievances, did much to present a more humanized image of the Rockefellers, as well as marking a new departure in industrial relations generally. He was involved in the development of the vast office complex in midtown Manhattan known as the Rockefeller Center, making him one of the largest real estate holders in the city. To the end of his life, he was famous for his philanthropy, donating over $500 million to a wide variety of different causes, notably in educational establishments. Rockefeller was the father of six children: Abby, John III, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop, and David. ==Early life== Rockefeller was the fifth and last child of Standard Oil co- founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. His four older sisters were Elizabeth (Bessie), Alice (who died an infant), Alta, and Edith. Living in his father's mansion at 4 West 54th Street, he attended Park Avenue Baptist Church at 64th Street (now Central Presbyterian Church) and the Browning School, a tutorial establishment set up for him and other children of associates of the family; it was located in a brownstone owned by the Rockefellers, on West 55th Street. His father John Sr. and uncle William Avery Rockefeller Jr. co-founded Standard Oil together. Initially he had intended to go to Yale University but was encouraged by William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago, among others, to enter the Baptist-oriented Brown University instead. Nicknamed \\"Johnny Rock\\" by his roommates, he joined both the Glee and the Mandolin clubs, taught a Bible class, and was elected junior class president. Scrupulously careful with money, he stood out as different from other rich men's sons.Details of Brown University days ‚Äì see Bernice Kert, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: The Woman in the Family. New York: Random House, 1993. (pp.62‚Äì63) In 1897, he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts, after taking nearly a dozen courses in the social sciences, including a study of Karl Marx's Das Kapital. He joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. ==Business career== After graduation from Brown, Rockefeller joined his father's business in October 1897, setting up operations in the newly formed family office at 26 Broadway where he became a director of Standard Oil. He later also became a director at J. P. Morgan's U.S. Steel company, which had been formed in 1901. Junior resigned from both companies in 1910 in an attempt to \\"purify\\" his ongoing philanthropy from commercial and financial interests after the Hearst media empire unearthed a bribery scandal involving John Dustin Archbold (the successor to Senior as head of Standard Oil) and two prominent members of Congress.Resignation from Standard Oil and U.S. Steel boards - see Ron Chernow, Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr., London: Warner Books, 1998. (pp.548-551) In September 1913, the United Mine Workers of America declared a strike against the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I;) company in what would become the Colorado Coalfield War. Junior owned a controlling interest in CF&I; (40% of its stock) and sat on the board as an absentee director. In April 1914, after a long period of industrial unrest, the Ludlow Massacre occurred at a tent camp occupied by striking miners. At least 20 men, women, and children died in the slaughter. This was followed by nine days of violence between miners and the Colorado National Guard. Although he did not order the attack that began this unrest, there are accounts to suggest Junior was mostly to blame for the violence, with the awful working conditions, death ratio, and no paid dead work which included securing unstable ceilings, workers were forced into working in unsafe conditions just to make ends meet. In January 1915, Junior was called to testify before the Commission on Industrial Relations. Many critics blamed Rockefeller for ordering the massacre.In the Hot Seat: Rockefeller Testifies on Ludlow, New York Times, May 21, 1915. Retrieved December 26, 2017. Margaret Sanger wrote an attack piece in her magazine The Woman Rebel, declaring, \\"But remember Ludlow! Remember the men and women and children who were sacrificed in order that John D. Rockefeller Jr., might continue his noble career of charity and philanthropy as a supporter of the Christian faith.\\"The Public Papers of Margaret Sanger: Web Edition. Nyu.edu. Retrieved on September 5, 2013.Baker, Jean H. Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion Hill and Wange New York 2011 page 79 He was at the time being advised by William Lyon Mackenzie King and the pioneer public relations expert, Ivy Lee. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized version of the Rockefellers.Robert L. Heath, ed.. Encyclopedia of public relations (2005) 1:485 Mackenzie King said Rockefeller's testimony was the turning point in Junior's life, restoring the reputation of the family name; it also heralded a new era of industrial relations in the countryThe Ludlow massacre and the turning point in Junior's life - Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr., London: Warner Books, 1998. (pp.571-586) During the Great Depression, he was involved in the financing, development, and construction of the Rockefeller Center, a vast office complex in midtown Manhattan, and as a result became one of the largest real estate holders in New York City. He was influential in attracting leading blue-chip corporations as tenants in the complex, including GE and its then affiliates RCA, NBC and RKO, as well as Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil), Associated Press, Time Inc, and branches of Chase National Bank (now JP Morgan Chase). The family office, of which he was in charge, shifted from 26 Broadway to the 56th floor of the landmark 30 Rockefeller Plaza upon its completion in 1933. The office formally became \\"Rockefeller Family and Associates\\" (and informally, \\"Room 5600\\"). In 1921, Junior received about 10% of the shares of the Equitable Trust Company from his father, making him the bank's largest shareholder. Subsequently, in 1930, Equitable merged with Chase National Bank, making Chase the largest bank in the world at the time. Although his stockholding was reduced to about 4% following this merger, he was still the largest shareholder in what became known as \\"the Rockefeller bank.\\" As late as the 1960s, the family still retained about 1% of the bank's shares, by which time his son David had become the bank's president.Largest shareholder in Chase Bank - see David Rockefeller, Memoirs, New York: Random House, 2002. (pp.124-25) In the late 1920s, Rockefeller founded the Dunbar National Bank in Harlem. The financial institution was located within the Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments at 2824 Eighth Avenue near 150th Street, servicing a primarily African-American clientele. It was unique among New York City financial institutions in that it employed African Americans as tellers, clerks and bookkeepers as well as in key management positions. However, the bank folded after only a few years of operation. ==Philanthropy and social causes== In a celebrated letter to Nicholas Murray Butler in June 1932, subsequently printed on the front page of The New York Times, Rockefeller, a lifelong teetotaler, argued against the continuation of the Eighteenth Amendment on the principal grounds of an increase in disrespect for the law. This letter became an important event in pushing the nation to repeal Prohibition.Letter on Prohibition - see Daniel Okrent, Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center, New York: Viking Press, 2003. (pp.246/7). Rockefeller was known for his philanthropy, giving over $537 millionThe Philanthropy Hall of Fame, John Rockefeller Jr. to myriad causes over his lifetime compared to $240 million to his own family.Agenda for Reform He created the Sealantic Fund in 1938 to channel gifts to his favorite causes; previously his main philanthropic organization had been the Davison Fund. He had become the Rockefeller Foundation's inaugural president in May 1913 and proceeded to dramatically expand the scope of this institution, founded by his father. Later he would become involved in other organizations set up by Senior: Rockefeller University and the International Education Board. In the social sciences, he founded the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial in 1918, which was subsequently folded into the Rockefeller Foundation in 1929.Laura Spelman Memorial - see Chernow, op.cit. (p.596) A committed internationalist, he financially supported programs of the League of Nations and crucially funded the formation and ongoing expenses of the Council on Foreign Relations and its initial headquarters building in New York in 1921.Funding of the CFR and other international institutions - Ibid., (p.638); John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson, The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988. (p.156) He established the Bureau of Social Hygiene in 1913, a major initiative that investigated such social issues as prostitution and venereal disease, as well as studies in police administration and support for birth control clinics and research. In 1924, at the instigation of his wife, he provided crucial funding for Margaret Sanger (who ironically had previously been an opponent of his because of his mistreatment of workers) in her work on birth control and involvement in population issues.The Bureau of Social Hygiene and social issues; funding for Margaret Sanger - see Harr & Johnson, op.cit. (pp.113-15, 191, 461-2) He donated five thousand dollars to her American Birth Control League in 1924 and a second time in 1925.Katz, Esther Sanger, Margaret The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger Volume 1: The Woman Rebel University of Illinois Press 2003 page 430 John D. Rockefeller Jr., financier In the arts, he gave extensive property he owned on West 54th Street in Manhattan for the site of the Museum of Modern Art, which had been co-founded by his wife in 1929. In 1925, he purchased the George Grey Barnard collection of medieval art and cloister fragments for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also purchased land north of the original site, now Fort Tryon Park, for a new building, The Cloisters. In November 1926, Rockefeller came to the College of William and Mary for the dedication of an auditorium built in memory of the organizers of Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic fraternity founded in Williamsburg in 1776. Rockefeller was a member of the society and had helped pay for the auditorium. He had visited Williamsburg the previous March, when the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin escorted him ‚Äî along with his wife Abby, and their sons, David, Laurance, and Winthrop ‚Äî on a quick tour of the city. The upshot of his visit was that he approved the plans already developed by Goodwin and launched the massive historical restoration of Colonial Williamsburg on November 22, 1927. Amongst many other buildings restored through his largesse was The College of William & Mary's Wren Building.Colonial Williamsburg Journal, 2004 In 1940, Rockefeller hosted Bill Wilson, one of the original founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, and others at a dinner to tell their stories. \\"News of this got out on the world wires; inquiries poured in again and many people went to the bookstores to get the book, \\"Alcoholics Anonymous.\\" Rockefeller offered to pay for the publication of the book, but in keeping with AA traditions of being self-supporting, AA rejected the money.Forward to the 2nd Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous, p. xviii Through negotiations by his son Nelson, in 1946 he bought for $8.5 million - from the major New York real estate developer William Zeckendorf - the land along the East River in Manhattan which he later donated for the United Nations headquarters. This was after he had vetoed the family estate at Pocantico as a prospective site for the headquarters (see Kykuit).Family estate vetoed as site for the UN headquarters - Ibid., (pp.432-3) Another UN connection was his early financial support for its predecessor, the League of Nations; this included a gift to endow a major library for the League in Geneva which today still remains a resource for the UN.Endowment of UN library - Ibid., (p.173) A confirmed ecumenicist, over the years he gave substantial sums to Protestant and Baptist institutions, ranging from the Interchurch World Movement, the Federal Council of Churches, the Union Theological Seminary, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York's Riverside Church, and the World Council of Churches. He was also instrumental in the development of the research that led to Robert and Helen Lynd's famous Middletown studies work that was conducted in the city of Muncie, Indiana, that arose out of the financially supported Institute of Social and Religious Research. As a follow on to his involvement in the Ludlow Massacre, Rockefeller was a major initiator with his close friend and advisor William Lyon Mackenzie King in the nascent industrial relations movement; along with major chief executives of the time, he incorporated Industrial Relations Counselors (IRC) in 1926, a consulting firm whose main goal was to establish industrial relations as a recognized academic discipline at Princeton University and other institutions. It succeeded through the support of prominent corporate chieftains of the time, such as Owen D. Young and Gerard Swope of General Electric.Key involvement in the Industrial Relations movement - Ibid., (pp.183-4) ==Overseas philanthropy== In the 1920s, he also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I, such as the Reims Cathedral, the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau and the Ch√¢teau de Versailles, for which in 1936 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d'honneur, which was awarded decades later to his son David Rockefeller. He also liberally funded the notable early excavations at Luxor in Egypt, and the American School of Classical Studies for excavation of the Agora and the reconstruction of the Stoa of Attalos, both in Athens; the American Academy in Rome; Lingnan University in China; St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo; the library of the Imperial University in Tokyo; and the Shakespeare Memorial Endowment at Stratford-on-Avon. In addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem ‚Äì the Rockefeller Museum ‚Äì which today houses many antiquities and was the home of many of the Dead Sea Scrolls until they were moved to the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.Restorations and constructions in France, Egypt, Greece and Jerusalem - see David Rockefeller, Memoirs, op.cit. (pp.44-8). ==Conservation== Grand Teton Range and Snake River He had a special interest in conservation, and purchased and donated land for many American National Parks, including Grand Teton (hiding his involvement and intentions behind the Snake River Land Company), Mesa Verde National Park, Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, Yosemite, and Shenandoah. In the case of Acadia National Park, he financed and engineered an extensive Carriage Road network throughout the park. Both the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway that connects Yellowstone National Park to the Grand Teton National Park and the Rockefeller Memorial in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were named after him. He was also active in the movement to save redwood trees, making a significant contribution to Save the Redwoods League in the 1920s to enable the purchase of what would become the Rockefeller Forest in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. In 1951, he established Sleepy Hollow Restorations, which brought together under one administrative body the management and operation of two historic sites he had acquired: Philipsburg Manor House in North Tarrytown, now called Sleepy Hollow (acquired in 1940 and donated to the Tarrytown Historical Society), and Sunnyside, Washington Irving's home, acquired in 1945. He bought Van Cortland Manor in Croton-on-Hudson in 1953 and in 1959 donated it to Sleepy Hollow Restorations. In all, he invested more than $12 million in the acquisition and restoration of the three properties that were the core of the organization's holdings. In 1986, Sleepy Hollow Restorations became Historic Hudson Valley, which also operates the current guided tours of the Rockefeller family estate of Kykuit in Pocantico Hills. He is the author of the noted life principle, among others, inscribed on a tablet facing his famed Rockefeller Center: \\"I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty\\".Life principle - see John Donald Wilson, The Chase: The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 1945-1985, Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1986. (p.328) In 1935, Rockefeller received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award, \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\" He was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1943. ==Family== In August 1900, Rockefeller was invited by the powerful senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich of Rhode Island to join a party aboard President William McKinley's yacht, the USS Dolphin, on a cruise to Cuba. Although the outing was of a political nature, Rockefeller's future wife, philanthropist/socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich, was included in the large party; the two had first met in the fall of 1894 and had been courting for over four years. Rockefeller married Abby on October 9, 1901, in what was seen at the time as the consummate marriage of capitalism and politics. She was a daughter of Senator Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman \\"Abby\\" Chapman. Moreover, their wedding was the major social event of its time - one of the most lavish of the Gilded Age. It was held at the Aldrich Mansion at Warwick Neck, Rhode Island, and attended by executives of Standard Oil and other companies.Details of the 1901 wedding - Harr & Johnson, op.cit., (pp.81-5) The couple had six children; Abby in 1903, John III in 1906, Nelson in 1908, Laurance in 1910, Winthrop in 1912, and David in 1915. Abby died of a heart attack at the family apartment at 740 Park Avenue in April 1948. Junior remarried in 1951, to Martha Baird, the widow of his old college classmate Arthur Allen. Rockefeller died of pneumonia on May 11, 1960, at the age of 86 in Tucson, Arizona, and was interred in the family cemetery in Tarrytown, with 40 family members present. His sons, the five Rockefeller brothers, established an extensive network of social connections and institutional power over time, based on the foundations that Junior - and before him Senior - had laid down. David became a prominent banker, philanthropist and world statesman. Abby and John III became philanthropists. Laurance became a venture capitalist and conservationist. Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller later became state governors; Nelson went on to become Vice President of the United States under President Gerald Ford. ==Residences== Junior's principal residence in New York was the 9-story mansion at 10 West 54th Street, but he owned a group of properties in this vicinity, including Nos. 4, 12, 14 and 16 (some of these properties had been previously acquired by his father, John D. Rockefeller). After he vacated No. 10 in 1936, these properties were razed and subsequently all the land was gifted to his wife's Museum of Modern Art. In that year he moved into a luxurious 40-room triplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue. In 1953, the real estate developer William Zeckendorf bought the 740 Park Avenue apartment complex and then sold it to Rockefeller, who quickly turned the building into a cooperative, selling it on to his rich neighbors in the building. Years later, just after his son Nelson become Governor of New York, Rockefeller helped foil a bid by greenmailer Saul Steinberg to take over Chemical Bank. Steinberg bought Junior's apartment for $225,000, $25,000 less than it had cost new in 1929. It has since been called the greatest trophy apartment in New York, in the world's richest apartment building.Michael Gross: 740 Park Avenue ==Honors and legacy== In 1929, Junior was elected an honorary member of the Georgia Society of the Cincinnati. In 1935, he received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\" In 1939, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society under statute 12. The John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library at Brown University, completed in 1964, is named in his honor. ==See also== * Rockefeller family * John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway * John D.

It has been introduced to the Kai Islands, Indonesia, Puerto Rico and Singapore. This species was only formally described in 2004, after it was discovered that the previous formal descriptions pertained to individuals of a different cockatoo species, the Ducorps' or Solomons cockatoo (Cacatua ducorpsii). Tanimbar corellas are the smallest of the white cockatoos. It is classified as Near Threatened due to deforestation and bird trade. It breeds well in captivity and there is a large avicultural population. ==Description== In an aviary Tanimbar corellas weigh, on average, about for females and for males. They are about from head to tail. Like all members of the family Cacatuidae, the Tanimbar corella is crested, meaning it has a collection of feathers on its head that it can raise or lower. Its body is mainly covered with white feathers, with salmon or pink colored feathers between the beak and eyes. The deeper (proximal) parts of the crest feathers and neck feathers are also a salmon color, but the coloration here is hidden by the white color of the more superficial (distal) areas of these feathers. The underside of its wing and tail feathers exhibit a yellowish tinge. The beak is pale grey and eye colour ranges from brown to black. Both sexes are similar. They are often confused with the little corella (bare-eyed cockatoo) due to their similar appearance. The maximum recorded lifespan for a (captive) Tanimbar corella is 26 years ‚Äì though this figure may be a significant under-representation, considering the long-lived nature of many other cockatoo species. ==Conservation== A pet juvenile Due to ongoing habitat loss on Tanimbar, limited range and illegal hunting, the Tanimbar corella is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In the 1970s, Japanese loggers ravaged the islands. Many of the dazed, disoriented birds were captured for the pet trade. Although many died from stress during shipment, there may be a small silver lining behind this ecological disaster, because many Tanimbar corellas have reproduced in captive breeding programs. As such, there are now more Tanimbar corellas in captivity than in the wild. ==Scientific naming== Historically, the discovery of the species as Lophochroa goffini is attributed to Otto Finsch in 1863. It was named for Andreas Leopold Goffin, a friend of Finsch and apparently a Dutch naval lieutenant who died the same year at the age of 26. In 2000, it became clear that Finsch's formal description of this species was based on two specimens that actually belonged to an entirely different cockatoo species, the Ducorps' or Solomons cockatoo (Cacatua ducorpsii). Cacatua goffini thus became a synonym for Cacatua ducorpsii, leaving this species without a proper scientific name and description. In 2004, the species was formally described as Cacatua goffiniana, maintaining the intent of Finsch to name a species of cockatoo after his friend. The new description is based on an individual collected from the Tanimbar Islands in 1923 by Dr. Felix Kopstein. ==In aviculture== Pet flying in a harness In aviculture the parrot is widely known as the Goffin's cockatoo. Pet birds handreared from hatching can imitate human speech, but generally they are not good talkers. They are generally quieter than the \\"large cockatoos\\" but can still be quite loud, and they have a sharp screech that some find irritating. They can make good pets, as they are friendly and sociable when properly socialized. Like most cockatoos, they enjoy being handled and stroked. They are intelligent and they can be trained and can learn tricks. Tanimbar corellas learn by watching and copying. Just by opening the cage door, a Tanimbar corella's attention can be drawn to the latch on its cage and it can learn by trial and error how to open the latch with its beak and escape the cage in seconds. Tanimbar corellas can destroy furniture with their beaks and can chew through wires and cause potentially dangerous electrical incidents. Handreared Tanimbar corellas tend to demand a lot of attention. Occasionally, captive birds of this species (like many cockatoos) develop self-destructive behaviours such as feather-plucking, or stereotypy if they do not have an interesting and enriching environment. Caged Tanimbar corellas require a frequent change of toys to play with so they do not become bored. They need time out of their cage for one-on-one social contact of at least four hours daily and also to exercise their wings and fly. Even very tame birds can bite humans when irritated or even when being excessively playful. Their droppings are semi-solid and can be messy. Many new bird owners are not aware of the time and money a cockatoo demands and pet birds are often passed from one owner to the next or relinquished to animal shelters. Tanimbar corella chicks make a repetitive soft howling/screeching noise (producer calls) when they are hungry. In the UK their sale is controlled as they are classified as a rare species. Each bird must have an official certificate to prove that it was captive-bred and not imported. ==Intelligence== Tool use behaviour has been observed in the Tanimbar corella in captivity. It was reported in November 2012 by Professor Alice Aursperg of the University of Vienna, that a cock bird named Figaro was observed spontaneously shaping splinters of wood and small sticks in order to create rakes that were then utilized, enabling him to extend his reach and retrieve otherwise unavailable food items located upon the other side of his aviary mesh. In July 2013, the results of a joint study involving scientists from University of Oxford, the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute, again involving the Tanimbar corellas of the Vienna Goffin Lab, were announced. It was discovered that the birds possessed the ability to solve complex mechanical problems, in one case spontaneously working out how to open a five-part locking mechanism in sequence to retrieve a food item. The corellas were able to very quickly adapt their behaviour and again open the lock when the mechanism sections were modified or re-ordered, demonstrating an apparent concept of working towards a particular goal and knowledge of the way in which physical objects act upon each other ‚Äì rather than merely an ability to repeat a learned sequence of actions. A later experiment also conducted at the Vienna Goffin Lab by Prof. Auersperg and her team broadly adapted the Stanford marshmallow experiment for the Tanimbar corella, to investigate whether the birds were capable of self-control and of anticipating a delayed gain. The corellas were given the opportunity to exchange a favoured food item (in this case a pecan nut) for an even more desirable nut (a cashew), if they were only able to hold the first nut for a period of time and then return it to the human researcher's hand uneaten ‚Äì at which point the nuts would be exchanged. Although pecan nuts are normally consumed instantly, it was discovered that the corellas could resist the temptation to eat the nut for periods of time for up to 80 seconds once aware that a cashew was also on offer. This behaviour (having also previously been demonstrated in corvids) further disproves the previous belief that birds are incapable of self- control. Further work by Auersperg's team, published in November 2018, showed that the corellas would cut cardboard to length with their beak, to obtain a reward, but seemed unable to change the width of the tools. ==References== == External links == * World Parrot Trust Parrot Encyclopedia ‚Äì Species Profiles * More Tanimbar corella Info * \\"Cockatoo 'makes and uses tools'\\", Belfast Telegraph, 6 November 2012 Tanimbar corella Category:Birds of the Tanimbar Islands Tanimbar corella ","title":"Tanimbar corella"},{"id":"300004","text":"Post Office Brighton is a town in Northumberland County, Ontario, Canada, approximately east of Toronto and west of Kingston.

However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival. The Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to over 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near Lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living. Presqu'ile Provincial Park, just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions. The park is noted for bird-watching and other nature-oriented activities. Memory Junction Railway Museum, located in a former Grand Trunk station, has a collection of rail equipment and memorabilia. ==Communities== Besides the town proper of Brighton, the municipality of Brighton comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Carman, Codrington, Hilton, Spring Valley, Smithfield (partially); Butler Creek, Cankerville, Cedar Creek, Gosport, Orland, Presqui'le Point, Wade Corners. ==History== The village of Brighton was incorporated on January 1, 1859. On December 1, 1980, it became a town. The original Simpson house, at 61 Simpson Street, was built in 1850. ==The artificial island area of Brighton== Part of the current Municipality of Brighton is on a separate artificial island. This is a consequence of the borders chosen when the Township of Brighton was created in 1851, and the excavation of the Murray Canal across the historic Isthmus of Murray.

It is located on the north shore of Lake Ontario and has a population of approximately 7959 as of 2016. It is adjacent to the city of Kingston and is considered part of the Greater Kingston area. Amherstview is named for Amherst Island, directly to the south in Lake Ontario. When the community was first established in the 1950s, the spelling was generally \\"Amherst View\\". Amherst is a common place name found in many parts of Canada commemorating Lord Jeffrey Amherst (1717‚Äì97), Field-Marshal of the British Army, Commander-in-Chief in North America, and Governor General of British North America from 1760 to 1763. The community is the eastern end of the Loyalist Parkway, a stretch of Highway 33 that travels along Lake Ontario, in an area in which many United Empire Loyalists settled. Amherstview is home to Fairfield House which is itself situated in Fairfield Park on the shore of Lake Ontario. Fairfield House was constructed in 1793 by the Fairfield family who were among the first Loyalists to settle the area. It served as the family home and a portion of the building was also used as a tavern for some time. The impressive wood frame building is now a museum exhibiting period artifacts and furniture and offering guided tours. Public transportation between Amherstview and Kingston is provided by Kingston Transit. Since Amherstview is part of Loyalist Township, it has no legal boundaries. General boundaries are Lake Ontario to the south, the Canadian National rail line to the north, Coronation Boulevard to the east (the City of Kingston boundary), and Lennox and Addington County Road 6 to the west. Amherstview is home to the Henderson Recreation Centre. The centre houses a public library, a 25 m public swimming pool, and an arena and also includes an outdoor soccer field. Amherstview is also home to the educational institutions Amherstview Public School, and elementary and middle school composed of students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.

It is considered the world's first meteorological station. Unofficially, the monument is also called Aerides (), which means Winds. The structure features a combination of sundials, a water clock, and a wind vane.Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. de Solla Price, p. 345 It was supposedly built by Andronicus of Cyrrhus around 50 BC, but according to other sources, might have been constructed in the 2nd century BC before the rest of the forum. In summer of 2014, the Athens Ephorate of Antiquities began cleaning and conserving the structure; restoration work was completed in August 2016. ==Site== The 12-metre-tall structure has a diameter of about 8 metres and was topped in antiquity by a weathervane-like Triton that indicated the wind direction.Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. de Solla Price, p. 353 Below the frieze depicting the eight wind deities--Boreas (N), Kaikias (NE), Apeliotes (E), Eurus (SE), Notus (S), Lips (SW), Zephyrus (W), and Skiron (NW)--there are eight sundials. In its interior, there was a water clock (or clepsydra), driven by water coming down from the Acropolis. Research has shown that the considerable height of the tower was motivated by the intention to place the sundials and the wind-vane at a visible height on the Agora, effectively making it an early example of a clocktower.Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. de Solla Price, p. 349 According to the testimony of Vitruvius and Varro, Andronicus of Cyrrhus designed the structure.Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. de Solla Price, p. 354 The tower's columns bore capitals of a design now known as \\"Tower of the Winds Corinthian\\", although they lack the volutes ordinarily found in Corinthian capitals. Turkish dervishes in the building, early 19th century In early Christian times, the building was used as the bell-tower of an Eastern Orthodox church. Under Ottoman rule it became a tekke and was used by whirling dervishes. At that time it was buried up to half its height, and traces of this can be observed in the interior, where Turkish inscriptions may be found on the walls. It was fully excavated in the 19th century by the Archaeological Society of Athens.

The polarization between inmates and custodial staff, between custodial staff and professional staff, led inevitably to the destruction of the program and deterioration in the life of the institution.\\" This riot, together with successors in 1975, led to an official Sub-Committee on the Penitentiary System in Canada, chaired by Justice Mark MacGuigan.Annual Report 2007/08, 35th Anniversary, Office of the Correctional Investigator, 1973-2008 The 1977 MacGuigan Report recommended the creation of an Independent Chairperson (ICP) to investigate prisoner complaints.Independent Chairperson to Adjudicate Disciplinary Proceedings 1977 ===1971‚Äì1981=== From 1971‚Äì1981, the penitentiary served as Corrections Canada's Ontario Region Reception Centre.

Cimeti√®re Saint-Vincent, Paris. Marcel Aym√© (29 March 1902 ‚Äì 14 October 1967) was a French novelist, children's writer, humour writer, screenwriter and theatre playwright. == Biography == Marcel Aym√© was born in Joigny, in the Yonne department of Burgundy. He was educated at the Coll√®ge de Dole, then worked as a journalist in Paris, among other things. His first published novel was Br√ªlebois (1926), and in 1929 his La Table aux crev√©s won the Prix Renaudot. After the great success of his novel La Jument verte (1933), translated into English as The Green Mare, he concentrated mostly on writing and published children's stories, novels, and collections of stories. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts. In theater, Marcel Aym√© found success with his plays Lucienne et le boucher, Cl√©rambard (1949), a farce, and T√™te des autres (1952), which criticized the death penalty. He died in 1967 and was buried in the Cimeti√®re Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris. == Work == One of Aym√©'s most famous short stories is \\"Le Passe-Muraille\\" or \\"The Walker-Through-Walls\\". A statue in Paris features the story's main character, Dutilleul. At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovers that he has \\"the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease\\". What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure ends up pushing Dutilleul toward ever more sinister pursuits. == Legacy == His works have inspired a number of movies, television shows, songs and comic strips.

The lateral confines or channel margins are known as the stream banks or river banks, during all but flood stage. Under certain conditions a river can branch from one stream bed to multiple stream beds. A flood occurs when a stream overflows its banks and flows onto its flood plain. As a general rule, the bed is the part of the channel up to the normal water line, and the banks are that part above the normal water line. However, because water flow varies, this differentiation is subject to local interpretation. Usually, the bed is kept clear of terrestrial vegetation, whereas the banks are subjected to water flow only during unusual or perhaps infrequent high water stages and therefore might support vegetation some or much of the time.The old bed of the left A woman digs in a dry stream bed in Kenya to find water during a drought. The nature of any stream bed is always a function of the flow dynamics and the local geologic materials, influenced by that flow. With small streams in mesophytic regions, the nature of the stream bed is strongly responsive to conditions of precipitation runoff. Where natural conditions of either grassland or forest ameliorate peak flows, stream beds are stable, possibly rich, with organic matter and exhibit minimal scour. These streams support a rich biota. Where conditions produce unnatural levels of runoff, such as occurs below roads, the stream beds will exhibit a greater amount of scour, often down to bedrock and banks may be undercut. This process greatly increases watershed erosion and results in thinner soils, upslope from the stream bed, as the channel adjusts to the increase in flow. The stream bed is very complex in terms of erosion. Sediment is transported, eroded and deposited on the stream bed. The majority of sediment washed out in floods is \\"near-threshold\\" sediment that has been deposited during normal flow and only needs a slightly higher flow to become mobile again. This shows that the stream bed is left mostly unchanged in size and shape. Beds are usually what would be left once a stream is no longer in existence; the beds are usually well preserved even if they get buried, because the walls and canyons made by the stream usually have hard walls, usually soft sand and debris fill the bed. Dry stream beds are also subject to becoming underground water pockets (buried stream beds only) and flooding by heavy rains and water rising from the ground and may sometimes be part of the rejuvenation of the stream. ==See also== * * Armor (hydrology) * Benthic zone * Hyporheic zone * Thalweg ==References== Category:Water streams Category:Fluvial landforms Category:Limnology Category:Riparian zone Category:Freshwater ecology ","title":"Stream bed"},{"id":"300028","text":"Lal Krishna Advani (born 8 November 1927) is an Indian politician who served as the 7th Deputy Prime Minister of India from 2002 to 2004 under Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

He was the National Democratic Alliance prime ministerial candidate in the 2009 general elections. Advani began his political career as a volunteer of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation. In 2015 he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian honour.\\"Padma awards 2015 announced: Advani, Amitabh among 104 awardees\\", Zee News, 26 January 2015. ==Early and personal life== L. K. Advani was born in Karachi in a Sindhi Hindu family of businessmen to parents Kishanchand D. Advani and Gyani Devi. He completed his early schooling from Saint Patrick's High School, Karachi, and then enrolled in Government College Hyderabad, Sindh. His family migrated to India during Partition and settled down in Bombay, where he graduated in Law from the Government Law College of the Bombay University, where he became friends with Deewan Parmanand Gangwani, and considered him, Ram Jethmalani and A.K Brohi the best lawyers produced by Government Law College. L. K. Advani married Kamla Advani (1932‚Äì2016) in February 1965. He has a son, Jayant, and a daughter, Pratibha. Pratibha Advani produces TV serial shows, and also supports her father in his political activities. His wife died on 6 April 2016 due to old age. Despite no longer being an MP, Advani lives in an official bungalow in Delhi due to security considerations, as of June 2019. ==Political career== ===Early career=== Advani joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1941 as a 14-year-old boy.'My idea of happiness is good books', interview in EYE, the Indian Express, 19‚Äì25 September 2010. He became a pracharak (full-time worker) of the Karachi branch and developed several shakhas there. After Partition, Advani was sent as a pracharak to Matsya-Alwar in Rajasthan, which had witnessed communal violence following Partition. He worked in Alwar, Bharatpur, Kota, Bundi and Jhalawar districts until 1952. ===Bharatiya Jana Sangh=== Advani became a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, also known simply as the Jana Sangh, a political party founded in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee in collaboration with the RSS. He was appointed as the secretary to S. S. Bhandari, then General Secretary of the Jana Sangh in Rajasthan. In 1957, he was moved to Delhi to look after the Parliamentary affairs. He soon became the general secretary and, later, President of the Delhi unit of the Jana Sangh. During 1966 to 1967 he served as the leader of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in the Interim Delhi Metropolitan Council. After the 1967 elections, he was elected as the Chairman of the First Delhi Metropolitan Council and served till 1970. He also assisted K. R. Malkani in editing the RSS weekly Organiser, and became a member of the national executive in 1966. He became a member of the Rajya Sabha from Delhi for the six-year tenure from 1970. After serving various positions in the Jana Sangh, he became its President in 1973 at the Kanpur session of the party working committee meeting. His first act as president of the BJS was to expel founder member and veteran leader Balraj Madhok from primary membership of the party for supposedly violating the party directives and acting against the interests of the party. He was a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat from 1976 to 1982. After the Indira Gandhi's Emergency, the Jana Sangh and many other opposition parties merged into the Janata Party. Advani and colleague Atal Bihari Vajpayee fought the Lok Sabha Elections of 1977 as members of the Janata Party. ===Janata Party to Bharatiya Janata Party=== The Janata Party was formed by political leaders and activists of various political parties who had been united in opposing the state of Emergency imposed in 1975 by then- Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. After elections were called in 1977, the Janata Party was formed from the union of the Congress (O), the Swatantra Party, the Socialist Party of India, the Jana Sangh and the Lok Dal. Jagjivan Ram split from the Indian National Congress, bringing a small faction known as the Congress for Democracy with him, and joined the Janata alliance. The widespread unpopularity of Emergency rule gave the Janata Party and its allies a landslide victory in the election. Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister of India, Advani became the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Vajpayee became the Foreign Minister. The erstwhile members of the Jana Sangh quit the Janata Party and formed the new Bharatiya Janata Party. Advani became a prominent leader of the newly founded BJP and represented the party in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian Parliament) from Madhya Pradesh for two terms beginning in 1982. ===The rise of the BJP=== Atal Bihari Vajpayee was appointed the first president of the new party. Ramachandra Guha writes that despite the factional wars within the Janata government, its period in power had seen a rise in support for the RSS, marked by a wave of communal violence in the early 1980s. Despite this, the BJP under Vajpayee initially took a more moderate approach to Hindutva, to gain a wider appeal. This strategy was unsuccessful, as the BJP won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. A few months prior to the election, Indira Gandhi was assassinated, creating a sympathy wave for the Congress that also contributed to the BJP's low tally, as the Congress won a record number of seats. This failure led to a shift in the party's stance; Advani was appointed party president, and the BJP returned to the hardline Hindutva of its predecessor. L.K. Advani with Dmitry Medvedev of Russia. Under Advani, the BJP became the political face of the Ayodhya dispute over the Ram Janmabhoomi. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had begun a movement for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple once stood there that had been demolished by the Mughal emperor Babur when he constructed the Babri mosque. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has supported the claim that a Hindu structure once stood at the site, without commenting on a possible demolition. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election manifesto, which provided rich dividends in the general elections of 1989. Despite the Congress winning a plurality in the election, it declined to form a government, and so the National Front government of VP Singh was sworn in. The support of the BJP, with its tally of 86 seats, was crucial to the new government. Advani embarked on a \\"Rath Yatra\\", or chariot journey, to mobilise karsevaks, or volunteers, to converge upon the Babri Masjid to offer prayers. This Rath Yatra, undertaken in an air-conditioned van decorated to look like a chariot, began from Somnath in Gujarat and covered a large portion of Northern India until it was stopped by the Chief Minister of Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, on the grounds that it was leading to communal violence. In the 1991 general elections, the BJP won the second largest number of seats, after the Congress. While on the Yatra, Advani carried symbols of the Hindu religion and made multiple speeches regarding the \\"Hindu society's alleged failure to protect its shrines from desecration by Muslim conquerors\\". In 1992, two years after Advani ended his yatra, despite assurances given by the Kalyan Singh-led BJP Government to the Supreme Court, the Babri Masjid was demolished by communal forces, with alleged complicity of the Kalyan Singh government. Advani reportedly delivered a provocative speech prior to the Masjid's demolition. Advani was among the accused in the Babri Masjid case. On 30 September 2020, the CBI's special court acquitted Advani and released him from all charges. The CBI judge while acquitting Advani mentioned that the demolition was not pre-planned and that the accused were \\"trying to stop the mob and not incite them\\". ===1996 General Elections=== After the 1996 general elections, the BJP became the single largest party and was consequently invited by the President to form the Government. However, Advani himself did not contest the 1996 elections from any constituency over allegations of involvement in the Hawala scandal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister in May 1996. However, the Government did not last long and Vajpayee resigned after thirteen days. ===Second term (1998‚Äì99)=== After two years in the political wilderness, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), came to power with Vajpayee returning as Prime Minister in March 1998, when elections were called after India saw two unstable Governments headed by H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral respectively. After the fall of two United Front government between 1996 and 1998 (H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral), the Lok Sabha, (lower house) of India's Parliament was dissolved and new elections were held. Now, a coalition of political parties signed up with BJP to form the Nationwide Democratic Alliance (NDA), headed by A. B. Vajpayee. The NDA won a majority of seats in parliament. However, the govt survived only 13 several months until mid-1999 when All Indian Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) under J. Jayalalitha withdrew its assistance to the government. With the NDA no longer having a majority, the Parliament was again dissolved and new elections were organised. Vajpayee remained the Prime Minister until elections were organised. Advani assumed the office of Home Minister and was later elevated to the position of Deputy Prime Minister. As Union Minister, Advani had a tough time with India facing a string of internal disturbances in the form of rebel attacks allegedly supported by Pakistan. The NDA government lasted for its full term of five years till 2004, the first non-Congress government to do so. Lal Krishna Advani with Condoleezza Rice in 2005 Advani was charged in a scandal where he allegedly received payments through hawala brokers. He and others were later discharged by the Supreme Court of India, because there was no additional evidence that could be used to charge them.\\"SC clears Advani, Shukla in hawala case\\" , The Indian Express, 3 March 1998. According to the judicial inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) they could not find any substantive evidence; the Supreme Court ruling stated that no statement even mentioned Advani's name and that evidence against him was limited to the mention of his name on a few loose sheets of paper. However, the failure of this prosecution by the CBI was widely criticised.Advani has hit bull's eye each time Times of India ‚Äì 30 March 2004 While some believe the CBI probe catapulted his rise through the BJP on his newfound \\"moral authority\\",\\"Advani's influence in the BJP sprang from his moral authority\\" , The Telegraph, Calcutta, 30 December 2005. others have claimed the inquiry was a political stunt.\\"Which Jain? What Hawala?\\" , The Indian Express, 15 September 1998. As elections approached in 2004, Advani was supremely confident and conducted an aggressive campaign. The BJP suffered a defeat in the general elections held in 2004, and was forced to sit in the opposition. Another coalition, the United Progressive Alliance led by the resurgent Congress came to power, with Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. The NDA disintegrated with the Telugu Desam Party, which had supported the NDA government from the outside, deserting the alliance. Vajpayee retired from active politics after the 2004 defeat, putting Advani to the forefront of the BJP. Advani became Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2009. During this period, Advani had to deal with rebellion from within the party. His two close associates, Uma Bharati, and Madan Lal Khurana, and longtime rival Murali Manohar Joshi publicly spoke out against him. In June 2005, he drew much criticism when he, while on a visit to the Jinnah Mausoleum at Karachi ‚Äì his town of birth, endorsed Mohammad Ali Jinnah and described him a \\"secular\\" leader. This did not sit well with the RSS either and Advani was forced to relinquish his post as BJP president. However, he withdrew the resignation a few days later. The relationship between Advani and the RSS reached a low point when the latter's chief K. S. Sudarshan opined that both Advani and Vajpayee give way to new leaders. At the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the BJP in Mumbai in December 2005, Advani stepped down as party president and Rajnath Singh, a relatively junior politician from the state of Uttar Pradesh was elected in his place. In March 2006, following a bomb blast at a Hindu shrine at Varanasi, Advani undertook a \\"Bharat Suraksha Yatra\\" (Sojourn for National Security), to highlight the alleged failure of the ruling United Progressive Alliance in combating terrorism. ===Prime Minister candidacy=== Advani discussing black money in a rally during the election campaign of 2009. In an interview with a news channel in December 2006, Advani stated that as the Leader of the Opposition in a parliamentary democracy, he considered himself the Prime Ministerial candidate for the general elections, ending on 16 May 2009. Some of his colleagues were not supportive of his candidacy. A major factor in favour of Advani was that he had always been the most powerful leader in the BJP with the exception of Vajpayee, who endorsed Advani's candidacy. On 2 May 2007, BJP President Rajnath Singh stated that: \\"After Atal there is only Advani. Advani is the natural choice. It is he who should be PM\\". On 10 December 2007, the Parliamentary Board of BJP formally announced that L. K. Advani would be its prime ministerial candidate for the general elections due in 2009. However, Indian National Congress and its allies won the 2009 general elections, allowing incumbent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to continue in office. Following the defeat in the elections, L. K. Advani paved the way for Sushma Swaraj to become the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Advani unexpectedly resigned from all his posts in the BJP on 10 June 2013 following the appointment of Narendra Modi as the head of the electoral campaign of BJP for the 2014 elections on 9 June 2013. In a short terse letter addressed to BJP President Rajnath Singh, he said, \\"I no longer have the feeling that this is the same idealistic party created by Dr Mookerji, Deen Dayalji, Nanaji and Vajpayeeji whose sole concern was the country, and its people. Most leaders of ours are now concerned just with their personal agendas.\\" Ultimately, Advani withdrew his resignation on 11 June 2013. ===Marg Darshak Mandal=== In 2014, Advani joined the Marg Darshak Mandal (vision committee) of the BJP along with Murli Manohar Joshi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\\"No Advani, Joshi, Vajpayee in BJP Parliamentary Board, party makes Marg Darshak Mandal for them\\" , IBN Live, 26 August 2014. ===Rath Yatras=== In a bid to boost the popularity of the BJP and unify the Hindutva ideology, Advani organised 6 long distance rath yatras or processions across the country, starting in 1987. #Ram Rath Yatra: Advani started his first Rath Yatra from Somnath, Gujarat on 25 September 1990 to finally reach Ayodhya on 30 October 1990. The yatra has been linked to the Mandir-Masjid dispute centred around Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site at Ayodhya. The BJP and Advani, however, focused the yatra on the secularism‚Äìcommunalism debate. The yatra was stopped in Bihar by Lalu Prasad Yadav, then Chief Minister of Bihar and was arrested on the orders of Vishwanath Pratap Singh, then Prime Minister of India. #Janadesh Yatra: Four Yatras named Janadesh Yatra started on 11 September 1993 from four corners of country. Advani led this yatra from Mysore. Travelling through 14 States and two Union Territories, the yatris congregated at Bhopal on 25 September in a massive rally. The purpose of Janadesh Yatrawas to seek the people's mandate against the two Bills, the Constitution 80th Amendment Bill and the Representation of People (Amendment) Bill. #Swarna Jayanti Rath Yatra: The Swarna Jayanti Rath Yatra by Mr. Advani travelled across India between May and July 1997. According to Mr.Advani, the yatra was conducted in celebration of 50 years of Indian Independence and also to project the BJP as a party committed to good governance. #Bharat Uday Yatra: The Bharat Uday Yatra took place in the run-up to the 2004 Lok Sabha Elections. #Bharat Suraksha Yatra: The BJP launched a nationwide mass political campaign in the form of the Bharat Suraksha Yatra from 6 April to 10 May 2006. It consisted of two yatras ‚Äì one led by Advani, Leader of the Opposition (Lok Sabha), from Dwaraka in Gujarat to Delhi; and the other led by Rajnath Singh, then the President of the BJP, from Jagannath Puri in Orissa to Delhi. The yatra was focused on left wing terrorism, minority politics, corruption, protection of democracy and price rise. #Jan Chetna Yatra: The Jan Chetna Yatra was launched on 11 October 2011 from Sitab Diara, Bihar. The BJP states the purpose of Jan Chetna Yatra is to mobilise public opinion against corruption of the UPA government and put BJP agenda of good governance and clean politics before the people of India. ==Writings== My Country My Life is an autobiographical book by L.

He was the only person in the last half- century to escape over the wall from the Kingston Penitentiary, one of Canada's most secure prisons. ==History== Tyrone Conn was born in 1967, as Ernest Bruce Hayes, to an Ontario 15-year-old mother and a father from Newfoundland and Labrador. Soon after his birth, his mother abandoned him to the care of his father, who in turn abandoned him to the care of his maternal grandparents. They placed him for adoption as of the age of three. He was adopted by a Belleville, Ontario psychiatrist, Dr. E. Bert Conn,Died in 2013, at the age of 80, without visitation or service, at his request. Obituary of Dr. E. Bert Conn; www.yourlifemoments.ca. Retrieved 2014-10-20. and his wife. Dr. Conn was described as abusive and his wife as mentally unstable. Tyrone Conn remained with Dr. Conn and his wife for eight years before being returned to the care of the local Children's Aid Society. He then spent the balance of his adolescent and teenage years in foster homes, group homes and youth detention facilities, starting at the Brookside Training School, at the age of fourteen. During his time with his adoptive parents, Conn had developed a habit of compulsive stealing, starting with food and escalating, by his teens, to cars. From the age of thirteen to his death, nineteen years later, Conn was only \\"legally at large\\" for a total of sixty-nine days.Mike Heffernan, Who killed Ty Conn: A case study of failure. The Independent, July 27, 2011. Retrieved 2014-10-26. Conn had also been \\"illegally at large\\" by escaping from a number of lower-security institutions. In 1998, Conn was transferred to Kingston Penitentiary for acting as an informant at the Millhaven Institution. He advised security staff at Millhaven that fellow inmates were planning an escape and was therefore placed in protective custody. Conn's escape on May 6, 1999 from inside the compound was the 26th in the history of facility. More than 50 escapees were involved in those 26 incidents. Conn employed a ladder and homemade grappling hook to scale the wall and used cayenne pepper to prevent dogs from following his scent. Conn was found in a Toronto apartment building two weeks after his escape. Surrounded by police, he committed suicide, rather than be captured. Other theories assert that Conn accidentally discharged the stolen shotgun in his possession during the standoff, while he was speaking on the telephone to Theresa Burke, a CBC producer. Burke and journalist Linden MacIntyre, both associated with the television program The Fifth Estate, later published Who Killed Ty Conn (Viking Press Canada, 2000;Publication details of Who Killed Ty Conn; Amazon.ca. Retrieved 2014-10-18. reissued 2011, Creative Book Publishing, St. John'sTara Bradbury, Who killed Ty Conn?; The Telegram, July 9, 2011. Retrieved 2014-10-18.). MacIntyre had met and befriended Conn in 1994, during the course of researching an investigative story on the effects of child abuse. At the time, Conn was serving a 47-year sentence, principally for bank robbery. The length of the compound sentence was despite the lack of violence in his criminal record.Clayton Ruby, Born to run...and die (Review of Who Killed Ty Conn). The Globe and Mail, November 11, 2000.

Since its creation, it uses characters from Madou Monogatari. It was created by Masamitsu \\"Moo\\" Niitani, the founder of Compile, who was inspired by certain elements from the Tetris and Dr. Mario series of games. The game was released by Tokuma Shoten on the same day of the MSX2 release under the name and as part of the Famimaga Disk series for the Family Computer Disk System. A year after the MSX2 and FDS versions, Sega released an arcade version, which heavily expanded the previous versions by including a one-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode. ==Gameplay== The main game of Puyo Puyo is played against at least one opponent, computer or human. The game itself has three modes, Single Puyo Puyo, Double Puyo Puyo, and Endless Puyo Puyo. In Single mode, the player takes on the role of Arle Nadja, a 16-year-old female spellcaster that has the pleasure of foiling the Dark Prince's plans. The Dark Prince wishes to take over the world, and Arle stands in his way. As such, Arle must first however battle her way through 12 opponents before facing the Dark Prince. With the exception of Rulue, they are not sent by the Dark Prince, and mostly they just want to pull shenanigans with her (for Rulue, she fell in love with the Dark Prince). Once Arle has beaten the Dark Prince, the world is saved, so she can return home. As in all main Puyo games, the story mode consists of playing Puyo matches against a fixed sequence of characters in one of three courses. In Double mode, two players play against each other. In exactly the same fashion as before, by out-chaining one another, the player tries to fill up their opponent's grid. Since the rules of sending so many garbage blocks made games short-lived, no matter how many chains are sent, Compile added the rule of Offsetting in Puyo Puyo 2 and onwards. This lets players counter opponents' attacks with chains of their own, sending any garbage blocks back to them as a result of overflow. In endless mode, the player must continually match puyos to get the highest score they can. In Mission mode, the player must complete 52 missions requiring the Puyos on the field to be eliminated by using limited pieces. ==Development== An English- translated version of arcade original was created and released internationally which replaces the original voice work, changes many of the characters' names, and removes the wings of the Harpies (which are called Dark Elves in the English version). Sega had re-released Puyo Puyo for the Mega Drive on December 18, 1992 and the Game Gear on March 19, 1993 in Japan. The Game Gear port of Puyo Puyo contains an English version named Puzlow Kids; this version appears whenever the game cartridge is used in a North American or European system. A PC-9801 port was released by Compile for the PC-9801 on March 19, 1993, the same day the Game Gear port was released. Tokuma Shoten had re- released their version Puyo Puyo for the Family Computer itself on July 23, 1993, which added a 2-player competitive mode. Banpresto released a version for the Super Famicom under the title on December 10, 1993. A port to the Game Boy was developed by Winkysoft, published by Banpresto and released on July 31, 1994 under the original name. NEC released their version of Puyo Puyo for the PC Engine's CD-ROM¬≤ on April 22, 1994 titled . CRI Middleware released their version of Puyo Puyo for the FM Towns in December 1994. The game was ported to Amiga by request of Amiga Power magazine and was featured on a cover disk under the name Super Foul Egg. It was then ported to RISC OS on Acorn by Owain Cole (and featured on an Acorn User cover disk), and finally ported to Java. In late 1995 it was ported to the Apple IIGS by Bret Victor. Before being branded as Puyo Pop internationally, the first game saw release outside Japan in 1993 as Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine in North America and Europe for the Mega Drive/Genesis as well as the Game Gear and Master System (in Europe and Brazil). Two years later, it was released as Kirby's Avalanche (Kirby's Ghost Trap in Europe) for the Super NES in North America and Europe respectively. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed the arcade version of Puyo Puyo on their December 15, 1992 issue as being the fifth most- successful table arcade unit of the year. The Mega Drive version was a bestseller in Japan for four months.Official Japanese Mega Drive sales chart, September 1993, published in Mega (magazine) issue 12, page 12 == Legacy == The Mega Drive version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on December 2, 2006, while the arcade version was released on April 12, 2011. The arcade VC release features online play. In August 22, 2019, the Arcade version has been re-released for the Nintendo Switch under the brand, with online-playing features. ==References== ==External links== * *Hardcore Gaming 101 - Puyo Puyo Details the entirety of the series and all of its spinoffs Category:1991 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Compile (company) games Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Game Boy games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Mobile games Category:MSX2 games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Sharp X68000 games Category:FM Towns games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:N-Gage games Category:Puyo Puyo Category:Tokuma Shoten games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:TurboGrafx-CD games Category:Video game franchises Category:Virtual Console games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Toshiaki Sakoda ja:„Å∑„Çà„Å∑„Çà#Êóß‰∏ñ‰ª£„Å∑„Çà„Å∑„ÇàÔºàÊóß„Å∑„ÇàÔºâ ","title":"Puyo Puyo (video game)"},{"id":"300045","text":"Paul Leduc (born 11 March 1942) is a film director. He was born in Mexico City, Mexico. One of Leduc's most acclaimed works is Frida, naturaleza viva (1983 - marketed as Frida in the U.S.), a tribute to the indomitable spirit and determination of the painter Frida Kahlo. == Overview == Paul Leduc Rosenzweig studied architecture and theatre, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; attended a French film school, Institut des hautes etudes cinematographiques (IDHEHC). His film career began in a university department of film studies. His first films were documentaries. Leduc like other filmmakers of his time were seeking for answers to create a form of cinema capable of ‚Äúaffirming our culture and our language. Daring the encounter with our originality-and with reality, the profound relationship with what happens to us and what entertains, afflicts or liberates us.‚Äù Leduc was able to launch his career due to a unique situation. During the reign of President Luis Echeverria (1970‚Äì76) the Mexican government actively intervened as a producer of cinema. Under this new policy the government paid for the amplification of Reed: Insurgent Mexico to 35mm. This is the only time the Mexican government intervened in one of Leduc films. For the rest of his career he funded his films independently, through universities and unions, and with collective efforts. Leduc's works reflect a person‚Äôs concern for certainty. Etnocidio: notas sobre el Mezquital is a powerful documentary on the extermination of the native peoples in Latin America. This documentary shows how the Otomi Indians of the Mezquital region in Mexico to relate their experiences with ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù society. The creation of the film was through a collaborative effort, the ‚Äúscript‚Äù was written by Roger Bartra, Mexico‚Äôs top leading rural sociologist. This film was based on Bartra years of research in the Mezquital region. == Critically Acclaimed Films == Reed: Insurgent Mexico is one of Leduc's most accomplished fiction in film, and was the first really distinctive work of the \\"New Cinema\\" movement in Mexico. The film was produced on a very small budget with a 16mm camera. Purposely undramatic, Reed interprets the Mexican revolution (1910‚Äì17) in a way that had not been seen since Fernando De Fuentes's masterpieces of (1933‚Äì35). This film provides the viewer with a beautiful sepia tone which help reproduce the environment of historic revolutionary setting. A Mexican critic, Jorge Ayala Blanco, described Reed as \\"raging against, incinerating, and annihilating the spider web that had been knitted over the once-living image of the revolution, while briefly illuminating the nocturnal ruins of our temporal and cultural distance from the men who participated in that upheaval.\\" The film is a dramatization of John Reed's famous account of the Mexican revolution, Insurgent Mexico, with Reed as the main character. Leduc‚Äôs most critically acclaimed film is Frida: Naturaleza viva. This film is regarded as a highly expressionist and lyrical work on the famous Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Leduc is credited for succeeding in recreating Frida‚Äôs passionate existence and her pain. This film kept words to a minimum whether spoken or written. This style was highly experimental. Leduc breaks from traditional cinematographic styles, the absence of dialogue, to reduce the famous figures of history and culture such as Frida Kahlo to cartoons of themselves. He uses the film to develop these characters in a way that allows them to remain at the lowest common denominator of the popular stereotypes fomented in mass culture. What makes this film unique is the sense of time. ‚ÄúThe director observes no sense of chronology, moving forwards and backwards I time as Frida grows younger or older, scene by scene.‚Äù ==Documentaries == Leduc has produced several documentaries, among them: * Parto psicoprofil√°ctico (1969) * Bach y sus int√©rpretes (1975) * Etnocidio: notas sobre el Mezquital ; Estudios para un retrato ( Francis Bacon ) (1978) * Puebla hoy (1978) * Monjas coronadas (1978) * ABC del etnocidio: notas sobre el Mezquital (1976), and * Puebla hoy (1979). ==Films == Leduc has also produced films about historical events, such as: * Comunicados del comit√© nacional de huelga (1968) * Reed: M√©xico insurgente (1973), a dramatization based on the first hand reports of the Mexican Revolution by journalist John Reed. * Sur, sureste 2604; El mar (1974) * Historias prohibidas de Pulgarcito (1979) * Compl√≥t petr√≥leo: la cabeza de la hidra (1981). * Como ves?

This positions EFILM to become the leader in digital intermediates with the largest dedicated digital laboratory in the industry. *2003 - EFILM and Panavision develop proprietary optics for the digital projection systems EFILM uses in its digital intermediate process. The optical modifications are put on-line in June 2003. :EFILM performs the world's first location-based Digital Color Timing for a theatrically released film, Universal's Bruce Almighty. The work is done under the direction of Dean Semler, ASC in Austin Texas while Dean is shooting The Alamo. The system includes EFILM's computer based color timing system, proprietary digital projection and our colorist. The session lasts two days with Dean giving specific direction and previewing the results on location via a digital projector. EFILM then returns to its home in Hollywood with the meta data created on location to complete the film. *2004 - Universal's Van Helsing is digitally assembled at 2K and EFILM creates digital cinema preview screening versions directly from the 2K files, which is an industry first. All previous digital previews came from the HD process. The EFILM approach ensures all the work that goes into the preview screenings ends up in the final movie. :EFILM scans the live action film, digitally assembles the cut, color times the entire film and renders and film records Spiderman 2 at 4K.

The Colorstream color science tool allows DPs to manipulate, store and retrieve printer lights, contrast, saturation and explore special looks they develop with the film's colorist prior to shooting. Color decisions made on set are then imported into the digital dailies and digital intermediate (DI). Colorstream allows for the efficient hand off of images from dailies to previews into DI and deliverables. From on-set previews of digitally captured images through the post production, the Colorstream state-of-the-art technology allows for the precise tracking of all frames through the entire digital motion picture production process and has been used in such feature films as Click, Apocalypto, Appaloosa and 2012. :EFILM opens a separate division dedicated solely to finishing motion picture trailers. EFILM Trailers is a natural extension of the technical innovations for Digital Intermediates applied to the demanding marketplace of trailers. *2007 - EFILM receives a technical achievement award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their creation of the Digital Color Separation process for archival of motion pictures. *2011 - EFILM develops post production workflow for Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, the first U.S. Feature film to shoot using the ARRIRAW format on the Alexa. With an already long-established working relationship with ARRI and a virtual pipeline in place that could accommodate the project, EFILM was approached by the filmmakers to undertake this first-of-its-kind venture. It was veteran cinematographer Chris Menges' initial foray into digital cinematography and he wanted a very filmic look. Dailies were produced at Deluxe, New York and the look was set during the dailies process, per Menges's direction. == Awards== ===2011=== * Hollywood Post Alliance (HPA) - Creativity and Innovation Award ‚Äì The Tree of Life ‚Äì Steven J.

Later in life, he was a restaurant owner, political candidate, and radio broadcaster. ==Early life== Lewis was born Abraham Meister on April 30, 1923 in Manhattan; the son of Alexander Meister (1893‚Äì1929), house painter and immigrant from Minsk, Russia, and Ida Neidel (1900‚Äì1950), garment worker and immigrant from the Russian Empire. Two brothers were Phillip (1926‚Äì1982) and Henry (1930‚Äì2017).1940 United States census extract which supports the 1923 year of birthRecord of \\"Al Lewis\\"; April 30, 1923 ‚Äì February 3, 2006; SSN: 050-18-4924. Social Security Administration. Social Security Death Index. Provo, Utah: MyFamily.com, Inc., 2006. He had originally given his birth year as 1910. His reputed early radio work in the mid-1930s would indicate the earlier birth date, as did an off-the-cuff remark on the TVLegends interview, 2002, where he says \\"not a bad memory for 92\\". Ted Lewis, his son, firmly said his father was born in 1923 to a Jewish family in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York.\\"'Grandpa Munster' Al Lewis dies\\", abc.net.au, May 2, 2006. Other sources placed his birth in Wolcott, New York, but no official record of his birth has been published to date (2006), and officials in Wolcott say they have no record of any Meister. The Times wrote: \\"Lewis was born Albert Meister, probably in 1923, but he insisted that he was born in 1910. This, and Lewis's many other questionable stories, means that much of the actor's life is a broth of conjecture that his fans will no doubt squabble over for years to come.\\" On his application for a Social Security number, completed sometime between 1936 and 1950, Lewis gave his date of birth as April 30, 1923. The 1940 census lists an Albert Meister \\"age 16\\" living on Douglass Street in Brooklyn, New York.Ancestry.com In a 1998 interview with Walt Shepperd, Lewis said: > My mother was a worker, worked in the garment trades.

My mother wouldn't back down to anyone.* The > New Times ===Education=== According to a report in the Jewish Week, Al Lewis attended Yeshiva Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York in his youth and \\"asked annoying questions: to the teachers.\\" Lewis then attended Thomas Jefferson High School, which he left in his junior year. He claimed to have attended Oswego State Teachers College (now SUNY Oswego), notwithstanding his lack of a high school diploma, and to have earned a Ph.D. in child psychology from Columbia University in 1941, of which Columbia has no record. Lewis did send at least one of his children to Yeshiva in the San Fernando Valley. ==Career== ===Acting=== Al Lewis as Grandpa (back) with the cast of The Munsters, 1964 His acting career begins the well-documented portion of his life. He worked in burlesque and vaudeville theaters, then on Broadway in the dramas The Night Circus (1958) and One More River (1960) and as the character Moe Shtarker in the musical comedy Do Re Mi (1962). His earliest television work includes appearances on the crime drama Decoy and The Phil Silvers Show. From 1959 to 1963, he appeared in four episodes of Naked City. Lewis' first well-known television role was as Officer Leo Schnauser on the sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? from 1961 to 1963, also starring Fred Gwynne (Lewis reprised the role in the 1994 movie of the same name). In the series, Lewis first played Al Spencer the Auto Body Man in two early first-season episodes, then landed the more familiar role of Officer Schnauser. He is best remembered as Grandpa on The Munsters, which ran on CBS from 1964 to 1966. In 1967, Lewis played the part of Zalto the wizard in the Lost in Space episode \\"Rocket to Earth\\". His first role in a movie was as Machine Gun Manny in Pretty Boy Floyd (1960). He had small roles in The World of Henry Orient (1964), They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), They Might Be Giants (1971). He appeared as Hanging Judge Harrison in Used Cars (1980), played a security guard on an episode of Taxi, and had a minor role in Married to the Mob (1988). His last film role was in Night Terror (2002). Jim McDermott Lewis was a recurring guest on The Howard Stern Show. In 1987, during a \\"Howard Stern Freedom Rally\\" against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that was broadcast live, Lewis repeatedly shouted \\"fuck the FCC!\\" until Stern was able to take the microphone away from him. Stern and the station were not punished for Lewis' comments. Unlike some actors, Lewis did not mind being typecast. He enjoyed acting out his Grandpa character--in the original costume--and got a surprising amount of mileage from such a short-lived role. \\"Why not?\\" he said. \\"It pays the bills.\\" In 1991, he appeared as Grandpa Munster in an episode of Hi Honey, I'm Home on ABC. In 1991, he appeared in a low-budget movie titled Grampire (My Grandpa Is a Vampire in the U.S. version), wearing much the same costume as he did in The Munsters. From 1987 to 1989, Lewis hosted Super Scary Saturday on TBS in his Grandpa Munster outfit. This was parodied in Gremlins 2: The New Batch with the character of Grandpa Fred (Robert Prosky). ===Partial filmography=== * I Vampiri (1957) - Assistant * Pretty Boy Floyd (1960) - Machine Gun Manny * The World of Henry Orient (1964) - Store Owner * Car 54, Where Are You?

He was featured in the Atari 7800 videogame Midnight Mutants,AtariAgeAtari 7800Midnight Mutants (Atari), atariage.com; accessed June 9, 2015. an action-adventure title with a Halloween theme. His appearance in the game mirrored his Grandpa persona in The Munsters. In 1987, he opened an Italian restaurant named Grampa's Bella Gente at 252 Bleecker Street in New York City. In September 1989, he licensed a comedy club named Grampa's to an entrepreneurial family on New Dorp Plaza in Staten Island. ==Politics== As a left-wing activist, he hosted a politically oriented radio program on WBAI (whose theme song was King Curtis' \\"Foot Pattin'\\") and ran as Green Party candidate for governor of New York in 1998. In that race, he sought to be listed on the ballot as Grandpa Al Lewis, arguing that he was most widely known by that name. His request was rejected by the Board of Elections, a decision upheld in court against his challenge. Despite this setback, he achieved one of his campaign objectives. His total of 52,533 votes exceeded the threshold of votes set by New York law (50,000) and hence guaranteed the Green Party of New York an automatic ballot line for the next four years (see election results, New York governor). He said that, with no political machine and no money backing him, the likelihood of winning the governorship would be \\"like climbing Mount Everest barefooted\\". ==Personal life and final years== Lewis married Marge Domowitz in 1956, with whom he had three sons, Dave, Ted, and Paul. The marriage ended in divorce in 1977. In 1984, he married actress Karen Ingenthron, to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. In his final years, he resided on Roosevelt Island in New York City. In 2003, he was hospitalized for an angioplasty, and complications from the surgery led to an emergency bypass and the amputation of his right leg below the knee as well as all of the toes on his left foot. He died on February 3, 2006, of natural causes in a hospital.

His work represents a profound stylistic shift from the calm perspectival regularity that characterized the art of the Florentine Renaissance. He is famous for his use of twining poses, coupled with ambiguous perspective; his figures often seem to float in an uncertain environment, unhampered by the forces of gravity. ==Biography and early work== Jacopo Carucci was born at Pontorme, near Empoli, to Bartolomeo di Jacopo di Martino Carrucci and Alessandra di Pasquale di Zanobi. Vasari relates how the orphaned boy, \\"young, melancholy and lonely\\", was shuttled around as a young apprentice: Pontormo painted in and around Florence, often supported by Medici patronage. A foray to Rome, largely to see Michelangelo's work, influenced his later style. Haunted faces and elongated bodies are characteristic of his work. An example of Pontormo's early style is a fresco depicting the Visitation of the Virgin and St Elizabeth, with its dancelike, balanced figures, painted from 1514 to 1516. This early Visitation makes an interesting comparison with his painting of the same subject which was done about a decade later, now housed in the parish church of St. Michael Archangel in Carmignano, about 20 km west of Florence. Placing these two pictures together‚Äîone from his early style, and another from his mature period‚Äîthrows Pontormo's artistic development into sharp relief. In the earlier work, Pontormo is much closer in style to his teacher, Andrea del Sarto, and to the early sixteenth century renaissance artistic principles. For example, the figures stand at just under half the height of the overall picture, and though a bit more crowded than true high renaissance balance would prefer, at least are placed in a classicizing architectural setting at a comfortable distance from the viewer. In the later work, the viewer is brought almost uncomfortably close to the Virgin and St. Elizabeth, who drift toward each other in clouds of drapery. Moreover, the clear architectural setting that is carefully constructed in earlier piece has been completely abandoned in favor of a peculiar nondescript urban setting. Joseph in Egypt, 1515-1518; Oil on wood; 96 x 109 cm; National Gallery, London The Joseph canvases (now in the National Gallery in London) offer another example of Pontormo's developing style. Done around the same time as the earlier Visitation, these works (such as Joseph in Egypt, at left) show a much more mannerist leaning. According to Giorgio Vasari, the sitter for the boy seated on a step is his young apprentice, Bronzino. In the years between the SS Annunziata and San Michele Visitations, Pontormo took part in the fresco decoration of the salon of the Medici country villa at Poggio a Caiano (1519‚Äì20), 17 km NNW of Florence. There he painted frescoes in a pastoral genre style, very uncommon for Florentine painters; their subject was the obscure classical myth of Vertumnus and Pomona in a lunette. From lunette of Vertumnus and Pomona, 1520-21 In 1522, when the plague broke out in Florence, Pontormo left for the Certosa di Galluzzo, a cloistered Carthusian monastery where the monks followed vows of silence. He painted a series of frescoes, now quite damaged, on the passion and resurrection of Christ. ==Main works in Florence== The Deposition from the Cross, 1525-1528 The large altarpiece canvas for the Brunelleschi-designed Capponi Chapel in the church of Santa Felicita, Florence, portraying The Deposition from the Cross (1528), is considered by many Pontormo's surviving masterpiece. The figures, with their sharply modeled forms and brilliant colors are united in an enormously complex, swirling ovular composition, housed by a shallow, somewhat flattened space. Although commonly known as The Deposition from the Cross, there is no actual cross in the picture. The scene might more properly be called a Lamentation or Bearing the Body of Christ. Those who are lowering (or supporting) Christ appear as anguished as the mourners. Though they are bearing the weight of a full-grown man, they barely seem to be touching the ground; the lower figure in particular balances delicately and implausibly on his front two toes. These two boys have sometimes been interpreted as angels, carrying Christ in his journey to Heaven. In this case, the subject of the picture would be more akin to an Entombment, though the lack of any discernible tomb disrupts that theory, just as the lack of cross poses a problem for the Deposition interpretation. Finally, it has also been noted that the positions of Christ and the Virgin seem to echo those of Michelangelo's Piet√† in Rome, though here in the Deposition mother and son have been separated. Thus in addition to elements of a Lamentation and Entombment, this picture carries hints of a Piet√†.One attempt at defining mannerist art is to characterize it as art that follows art rather than art that follows nature, or life. [See for example Sydney Freedberg's notion of the 'quoted' form in \\"Observations on the Painting of the Maniera\\" Art Bulletin 47 (1965), pp. 187‚Äì97.] Though Freedberg did not classify Pontormo as a strictly maniera painter, if we accept that the Deposition does hold a quotation from Michelangelo's Piet√†, then perhaps we can understand better how Pontormo fits in as a mannerist and into his own larger history of sixteenth century art. It has been speculated that the bearded figure in the background at the far right is a self-portrait of Pontormo as Joseph of Arimathea. Another unique feature of this particular Deposition is the empty space occupying the central pictorial plane as all the Biblical personages seem to fall back from this point. It has been suggested that this emptiness may be a physical representation of the Virgin Mary's emotional emptiness at the prospect of losing her son. Annunciation, fresco On the wall to the right of the Deposition, Pontormo frescoed an Annunciation scene (at left). As with the Deposition, the artist's primary attention is on the figures themselves rather than their setting. Placed against white walls, the Angel Gabriel and Virgin Mary are presented in an environment that is so simplified as to almost seem stark. The fictive architectural details above each of them, are painted to resemble the gray stone pietra serena that adorns the interior of Santa Felicit√†, thus uniting their painted space with the viewer's actual space. The startling contrast between the figures and ground makes their brilliant garments almost seem to glow in the light of the window between them, against the stripped-down background, as if the couple miraculously appeared in an extension of the chapel wall. The Annunciation resembles his above mentioned Visitation in the church of San Michele at Carmignano in both the style and swaying postures. Vasari tells us that the cupola was originally painted with God the Father and Four Patriarchs. The decoration in the dome of the chapel is now lost, but four roundels with the Evangelists still adorn the pendentives, worked on by both Pontormo and his chief pupil Agnolo Bronzino. The two artists collaborated so closely that specialists dispute which roundels each of them painted. This tumultuous oval of figures took three years for Pontormo to complete. According to Vasari, because Pontormo desired above all to \\"do things his own way without being bothered by anyone,\\" the artist screened off the chapel so as to prevent interfering opinions. Vasari continues, \\"And so, having painted it in his own way without any of his friends being able to point anything out to him, it was finally uncovered and seen with astonishment by all of Florence...\\"Giorgio Vasari, The Lives of the Artists, tr. Julia Conaway Bondanella and Peter Bondanella (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 409 A number of Pontormo's other works have also remained in Florence; the Uffizi Gallery holds his mystical Supper at Emmaus as well as portraits. Many of Pontormo's well known canvases, such as the early Joseph in Egypt series (c. 1515) and the later Martyrdom of St Maurice and the Theban Legion (c. 1531) depict crowds milling about in extreme contrapposto of greatly varied positions. His portraits, acutely characterized, show similarly Mannerist proportions. ==Lost or damaged works== Christ and Creation of Eve Study for Deluge Dead in Last Judgment Many of Pontormo's works have been damaged, including the lunettes for the cloister in the Carthusian monastery of Galluzo. They now are displayed indoors, although in their damaged state. Perhaps most tragic is the loss of the unfinished frescoes for the choir of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence which consumed the last decade of his life.Still visible to the traveler Lassel in his travels through Italy, published 1698 , page 105. His frescoes depicted a Last Judgment day composed of an unsettling morass of writhing figures. The remaining drawings, showing a bizarre and mystical ribboning of bodies, had an almost hallucinatory effect. Florentine figure painting had mainly stressed linear and sculptural figures. For example, the Christ in Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel is a massive painted block, stern in his wrath; by contrast, Pontormo's Jesus in the Last Judgment twists sinuously, as if rippling through the heavens in the dance of ultimate finality. Angels swirl about him in even more serpentine poses. If Pontormo's work from the 1520s seemed to float in a world little touched by gravitational force, the Last Judgment figures seem to have escaped it altogether and flail through a rarefied air. In his Last Judgment, Pontormo went against pictorial and theological tradition by placing God the Father at the feet of Christ, instead of above him, an idea Vasari found deeply disturbing: > But I have never been able to understand the significance of this scene, > although I know that Jacopo had wit enough for himself, and also associated > with learned and lettered persons; I mean, what he could have intended to > signify in that part where there is Christ on high, raising the dead, and > below His feet is God the Father, who is creating Adam and Eve. Besides > this, in one of the corners, where are the four Evangelists, nude, with > books in their hands, it does not seem to me that in a single place did he > give a thought to any order of composition, or measurement, or time, or > variety in the heads, or diversity in the flesh-colours, or, in a word, to > any rule, proportion or law of perspective, for the whole work is full of > nude figures with an order, design, invention, composition, colouring, and > painting contrived after his own fashion, and with such melancholy and so > little satisfaction for him who beholds the work, that I am determined, > since I myself do not understand it, although I am a painter, to leave all > who may see it to form their own judgement, for the reason that I believe > that I would drive myself mad with it, and would bury myself alive, even as > it appears to me that Jacopo in the period of eleven years that he spent > upon it sought to bury himself and all who might see the painting, among all > those extraordinary figures... Wherefore it appears that in this work he > paid no attention to anything save certain parts, and of the other more > important parts he took no account whatever. In a word, whereas he had > thought in the work to surpass all the paintings in the world of art, he > failed by a great measure to equal his own (past) works; whence it is > evident that he who seeks to strive beyond his strength and, as it were, to > force nature, ruins the good qualities with which he may have been liberally > endowed by her. ==Critical assessment and legacy== Vasari's Life of Pontormo depicts him as withdrawn and steeped in neurosis while at the center of the artists and patrons of his lifetime. This image of Pontormo has tended to color the popular conception of the artist, as seen in the film of Giovanni Fago, Pontormo, a heretical love. Fago portrays Pontormo as mired in a lonely and ultimately paranoid dedication to his final Last Judgment project, which he often kept shielded from onlookers. Yet as the art historian Elizabeth Pilliod has pointed out, Vasari was in fierce competition with the Pontormo/Bronzino workshop at the time when he was writing his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. This professional rivalry between the two bottegas could well have provided Vasari with ample motivation for running down the artistic lineage of his opponent for Medici patronage.See \\"An Introduction to Vasari's Story\\" in Pontormo, Bronzino, and Allori: A Genealogy of Florentine Art (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001). Portrait of Maria Salviati, the wife of famous military leader Giovanni delle Bande Nere de' Medici, and Giulia, a Medici relative who was left in Maria's care after the murder of the child's father; Walters Art Museum Perhaps as a result of Vasari's derision, or perhaps because of the vagaries of aesthetic taste, Pontormo's work was quite out of fashion for several centuries. The fact that so much of his work has been lost or severely damaged is testament to this neglect, though he has received renewed attention by contemporary art historians. Indeed, between 1989 and 2002, Pontormo's Portrait of a Halberdier (at right), held the title of the world's most expensive painting by an Old Master. Regardless as to the veracity of Vasari's account, it is certainly true that Pontormo's artistic idiosyncrasies produced a style that few were able (or willing) to imitate, with the exception of his closest pupil Bronzino. Bronzino's early work is so close to that of his teacher, that the authorship of several paintings from the 1520s and '30s is still under dispute‚Äîfor example, the four tondi containing the Evangelists in the Capponi Chapel, and the Portrait of a Lady in Red now in Frankfurt. Pontormo shares some of the mannerism of Rosso Fiorentino and of Parmigianino. In some ways he anticipated the Baroque as well as the tensions of El Greco. His eccentricities also resulted in an original sense of composition. At best, his compositions are cohesive. The figures in the Deposition, for example, appear to sustain each other: removal of any one of them would cause the edifice to collapse. In other works, as in the Joseph canvases, the crowding makes for a confusing pictorial melee. It is in the later drawings that we see a graceful fusion of bodies in a composition which includes the oval frame of Jesus in the Last Judgement. ==Anthology of works== Portrait of a Halberdier, 1528-1530, oil on canvas, J.

It is the second smallest rorqual after the common minke whale and the third smallest baleen whale. Although first scientifically described in the mid-19th century, it was not recognized as a distinct species until the 1990s. Once ignored by the whaling industry due to its small size and low oil yield, the Antarctic minke was able to avoid the fate of other baleen whales and maintained a large population into the 21st century, numbering in the hundreds of thousands.Branch, T. A. (2006). \\"Abundance estimates for Antarctic minke whales from three completed circumpolar sets of surveys, 1978/79 to 2003/04\\". Paper SC/58/IA18 submitted to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee, pp. 1-28. Surviving to become the most abundant baleen whale in the world, it is now one of the mainstays of the industry alongside its cosmopolitan counterpart the common minke. It is primarily restricted to the Southern Hemisphere (although vagrants have been reported in the North Atlantic) and feeds mainly on euphausiids. ==Taxonomy== ===History=== In February 1867, a fisherman found an estimated male rorqual floating in the R√≠o de la Plata near Belgrano, about ten miles from Buenos Aires, Argentina. After bringing it ashore he brought it to the attention of the German Argentine zoologist Hermann Burmeister, who described it as a new species, Balaenoptera bonaerensis, the same year.Burmeister, H. (1867). \\"Preliminary description of a new species of finner whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis)\\". Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London: 707-713. The skeleton of another specimen, a individual taken off Otago Head, South Island, New Zealand, in October 1873, was sent by Professor Frederick Hutton, keeper of the Otago Museum in Dunedin, to the British Museum in London, where it was examined by the British zoologist John Edward Gray, who described it as a new species of \\"pike whale\\" (minke whale, B. acutorostrata) and named it B. huttoni. Both descriptions were largely ignored for a century. Gordon R. Williamson was the first to describe a dark-flippered form in the Southern Hemisphere, based on three specimens, a pregnant female taken in 1955 and two males taken in 1957, all brought aboard the British factory ship Balaena. All three had uniformly pale gray flippers and bicolored baleen, with white plates in the front and gray plates in the back. Further studies in the 1960s supported his description.Kasuya, T. and T. Ichihara. (1965). \\"Some informations on minke whales from the Antarctic\\". Sci. Rep. Whales Res. Inst., 19: 37-43. In the 1970s osteological and morphological studies suggested it was at least a subspecies of the common minke whale, which was designated B. a. bonaerensis, after Burmeister's specimen. In the 1980s further studies based on external appearance and osteology suggested there were in fact two forms in the Southern Hemisphere, a larger form with dark flippers and a \\"diminutive\\" or \\"dwarf form\\" with white flippers, the latter of which appeared to be more closely related to the common form of the Northern Hemisphere. This was strengthened by genetic studies using allozyme and mitochondrial DNA analyses, which proposed there were at least two species of minke whale, B. acutorostrata and B. bonaerensis, with the dwarf form being more closely related to the former species.Wada, S., and Numachi, K. I. (1991). \\"Allozyme analyses of genetic differentiation among the populations and species of the Balaenoptera\\". Genetic ecology of whales and dolphins. Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue 13): 125-154.Wada, S., Kobayashi, T., and Numachi, K. I. (1991). \\"Genetic variability and differentiation of mitochondrial DNA in minke whales\\". Genetic ecology of whales and dolphins. Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue 13): 203-215. One study, in fact, suggested that sei whales and the offshore form of Bryde's whale were more closely related to one another than either species of minke whale were to each other. The American scientist Dale W. Rice supported these conclusions in his seminal work on marine mammal taxonomy, giving what he called the \\"Antarctic minke whale\\" (B. bonaerensis, Burmeister, 1867), full specific status ‚Äì this was followed by the International Whaling Commission a few years later. Other organizations followed suit. ===Divergence=== Antarctic and common minke whales diverged from each other in the Southern Hemisphere 4.7 million years ago, during a prolonged period of global warming in the early Pliocene which disrupted the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and created local pockets of upwelling, facilitating speciation by fragmenting populations. ===Hybrids=== There have been two confirmed hybrids between Antarctic and common minke whales. Both were caught in the northeastern North Atlantic by Norwegian whaling vessels. The first, an female taken off western Spitsbergen () on 20 June 2007, was the result of a pairing between a female Antarctic minke and a male common minke. The second, a pregnant female taken off northwestern Spitsbergen () on 1 July 2010, on the other hand, had a common minke mother and an Antarctic minke father. Her female fetus, in turn, was fathered by a North Atlantic common minke, demonstrating that back-crossing is possible between hybrids of the two species. ==Description== ===Size=== The Antarctic minke is among the smallest of the baleen whales, with only the common minke and the pygmy right whale being smaller. The longest caught off Brazil were an female taken in 1969 and an male taken in 1975, the former four feet longer than the second longest females and the latter five feet longer than the second longest males. Off South Africa, the longest measured were a female and a male. The heaviest caught in the Antarctic were a female that weighed 10.4 metric tons (11.5 short tons) and an male that weighed 8.8 metric tons (9.7 short tons). At physical maturity, females average and males . At sexual maturity, females average and males . Calves are estimated to be at birth. ===External appearance=== A pair of Antarctic minke whales showing their prominent, falcate dorsal fins Yushin Maru, showing the coloration of the baleen. Like their close relative the common minke, the Antarctic minke whale is robust for its genus. They have a narrow, pointed, triangular rostrum with a low splashguard. Their prominent, upright, falcate dorsal fin ‚Äì often more curved and pointed than in common minkes ‚Äìis set about two-thirds the way along the back. About half of individuals have a light gray flare or patch on the posterior half of the dorsal fin, similar to that seen in species of dolphins in the genus Lagenorhynchus. They are dark gray dorsally and clean white ventrally. The lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw and is dark gray on both sides. Antarctic minkes lack the light gray rostral saddle present in the common and dwarf forms. All individuals possess pale, thin blowhole streaks trailing from the blowhole slits, which first veer left and then right ‚Äì particularly the right streak. These streaks appear to be more prominent and consistent on this species than on either the common or dwarf minke. Most also have a variably colored ‚Äì light gray, light gray with dark edges, or simply dark ‚Äì ear streak trailing behind the opening for the auditory meatus, which widens and becomes more diffuse posteriorly. A light gray variably shaped double chevron or W-shaped pattern (analogous to a similar pattern seen on their larger cousin the fin whale) lies between the flippers. This broadens to form a light gray shoulder patch above the flippers. Like common and dwarf minkes, they have two light gray to whitish swaths, called the thorax and flank patches, the former running diagonally up from the axilla and diagonally down again to form a triangular intrusion into the dark gray of the thorax and the latter rising more vertically along its anterior edge and extending further dorsally before gradually sloping posteriorly to merge with the white of the ventral side of the caudal peduncle. A dark gray, roughly triangular thorax field separates the two, while a narrower dark gray shoulder infill separates the thorax patch from the shoulder patch. Two light gray, forward directed caudal chevrons extend from the dark gray field above, forming a whitish peduncle blaze between them. The smooth sided flukes, usually about wide, are dark gray dorsally and clean white (occasionally light gray to gray) ventrally with a thin, dusky margin. Some small, dark gray speckling may be present on the body. Antarctic minkes lack the bright white, transverse flipper band of the common minke and the white shoulder blaze and bright white flipper patch (occupying the proximal two-thirds of the flipper) of the dwarf minke. Instead, their narrow, pointed flippers, about one-sixth to one-eighth of the total body length, are normally either a plain light gray with an almost white leading edge and a darker gray trailing edge or two-toned, with a thin light gray or dark band separating the darker gray of the proximal third of the flipper from the lighter gray of the distal two-thirds. Unlike the dwarf minke, the dark gray between the eye and flipper does not extend unto the ventral grooves of the throat to form a dark throat patch; there is instead an irregularly shaped line running from about the level of the eye to the anterior insertion of the flipper, merging with the light gray of the shoulder patch. The longest baleen plates average in length and about in breadth and number 155 to 415 pairs (average 273). They are two-toned, with a dark gray outer margin on the posterior plates and a white outer margin on the anterior plates ‚Äì though there may be some rows of dark plates amongst the white plates. There is a degree of asymmetry, with a smaller number of white plates on the left side than on the right (12% on average for the left versus 34% on average for the right). The dark gray border occupies about one third of the width of the plates (ranging from about one-seventh to over half of its width), with the average width being greater on the left side than on the right. In contrast, dwarf minkes have smaller baleen plates of only in length, have a greater number of white plates (over 54%, often 100%) that lack this asymmetrical coloration, and have a narrow dark gray border (when present) of less than 6% of the width of the plate. Antarctic minkes have an average of 42 to 44 thin, narrow ventral grooves (range 32 to 70) that extend to about 48% of the length of the body ‚Äì well short of the umbilicus. ==Distribution== Antarctic minke whale in Neko Harbour, Antarctica ===Range=== Antarctic minke whales occur throughout much of the Southern Hemisphere. In the western South Atlantic, they have been recorded off Brazil from 0¬∞53'N to 27¬∞35'S (nearly year-round),Siciliano, S., Emin-Lima, R., Rodrigues, A.L.F., de Sousa e Silva Jr. J., Scholl, T.G.S. and Moura de Oliveira, J.

They appear to disperse into offshore waters during the breeding season. In the spring (October‚ÄìDecember), Japanese sighting surveys from 1976 to 1987 recorded relatively high encounter rates of minke whales off South Africa and Mozambique (20¬∞ ‚Äì 30¬∞S, 30¬∞ ‚Äì 40¬∞E), off Western Australia (20¬∞ ‚Äì 30¬∞S, 110¬∞ ‚Äì 120¬∞E), around the Gambier Islands of French Polynesia (20¬∞ ‚Äì 30¬∞S, 130¬∞ ‚Äì 140¬∞W), and in the eastern South Pacific (10¬∞ ‚Äì 20¬∞S, 110¬∞ ‚Äì 120¬∞W). Later surveys, which distinguished between Antarctic and dwarf minke whales, showed that most of these were Antarctic minke whales. They have a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean (where they have been recorded year-round),Scheidat, M., Bornemann, H., Burkhardt, E., Flores, H., Friedlaender, A., Kock, K.

They are most abundant in the MacKenzie Bay-Prydz Bay area (60¬∞ ‚Äì 80¬∞E, south of 66¬∞S) and relatively numerous off Queen Maud Land (0¬∞ ‚Äì 20¬∞E, 66¬∞ ‚Äì 70¬∞S), in the Davis (80¬∞ ‚Äì 100¬∞E, south of 66¬∞S) and Ross Seas (160¬∞E ‚Äì 140¬∞W, south of 70¬∞S), and in the southern Weddell Sea (20¬∞ ‚Äì 40¬∞W, south of 70¬∞S). Like their larger cousin the blue whale, they have a particular affinity for the pack ice. In the spring (October‚ÄìNovember), they occur widely throughout the pack ice zone to near the edge of the fast ice, where they have been observed between belts of pack ice and in leads and polynyas ‚Äì often in heavy ice cover. Some individuals have become trapped in the ice and were forced to overwinter in the Antarctic ‚Äì for example, up to 120 \\"lesser rorquals\\" were trapped in a small breathing hole with sixty killer whales and an Arnoux's beaked whale in Prince Gustav Channel, east of the Antarctic Peninsula and west of James Ross Island, in August 1955.Taylor, R. J. F. (1957). \\"An unusual record of three species of whale being restricted to pools in Antarctic sea-ice\\".

The first was marked off Queen Maud Land () and the second southeast of the South Orkney Islands (). Over twenty individuals marked with these Discovery tags showed large-scale movements around the Antarctic continent, each moving more than 30 degrees of longitude ‚Äì two, in fact, had moved over 100 degrees of longitude. The first was marked off the Ad√©lie Coast () and recovered the following season off the Princess Ragnhild Coast (), a minimum of 114 degrees of longitude. The second was marked north of Cape Adare () and recovered nearly six years later northwest of the Riiser- Larsen Peninsula (), a minimum of over 139 degrees of longitude. Both were marked and recovered in January.Buckland, S. T. and Duff, E. I. (1989). \\"Analysis of southern hemisphere minke whale mark-recovery data\\". Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue 11): 121-143. On 20 January 1972, a broken-off bill of a marlin (Makaira sp.) was found embedded in the rostrum of a minke whale caught in the Southern Ocean at , providing indirect evidence of migration to the warmer tropical or subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean. ===Population=== Earlier estimates suggested that there were several hundred thousand minke whales in the Southern Ocean. In 2012, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission agreed upon a best estimate of 515,000. The Report of the Scientific Committee acknowledged that this estimate is subject to some degree of negative bias because some minke whales would have been outside the surveyable ice edge boundaries.International Whaling Commission. (2013). \\"Report of the Scientific Committee\\". Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 14 (Supplement): 1-86. ==Biology== ===Natural history=== Antarctic minke whales become sexually mature at 5 to 8 years of age for males and 7 to 9 years of age for females. Both become physically mature at about 18 years of age. After a gestation period of about 10 months, a single calf of is born ‚Äì twin and triplet fetuses have been reported, but are rare. After a lactation period of about six months, the calf is weaned at a length of . The calving interval is estimated to be about 12.5 to 14 months. Peak calving is from May to June, while peak conception is from August to September. Females may live up to 43 years of age.Evans, Peter G. H. (1987). The Natural History of Whales and Dolphins. Facts on File. ===Prey=== Antarctic minke whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids. In the Southern Ocean, over 90% of individuals fed on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); E. crystallorophias also formed an important part of the diet in some areas, particularly in the relatively shallow waters of Prydz Bay. Rare and incidental items include calanoid copepods, the pelagic amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii, Antarctic sidestripes (Pleuragramma antarcticum), the crocodile icefish Cryodraco antarcticus, nototheniids, and myctophids. The majority of individuals examined off South Africa had empty stomachs. The few that did have food in their stomachs had all preyed on euphausiids, mainly Thysanoessa gregaria and E. recurva. ===Predation=== Antarctic minke whales are the main prey item of Type A killer whales in the Southern Ocean. Their remains have been found in the stomachs of killer whales caught by the Soviets, while individuals caught by the Japanese exhibited damaged flippers with tooth rake scars and parallel scarring on the body suggestive of killer whale attacks. Large groups of killer whales have also been observed chasing, attacking, and even killing Antarctic minke whales. Most attacks involve Type A killer whales, but on one occasion, in January 2009, a group of ten Type B or pack ice killer whales, which normally preyed on Weddell seals in the area by wave-washing them off ice floes, were observed to attack, kill, and feed on a juvenile Antarctic minke whale in Laubeuf Fjord, between Adelaide Island and the Antarctic Peninsula. ===Parasites and epibiotics=== Little has been published on the parasitic and epibiotic fauna of Antarctic minke whales. Individuals were often found with orange-brown to yellowish patches of the diatom Cocconeis ceticola on their bodies ‚Äì 35.7% off South Africa and 67.5% in the Antarctic. Of a sample of whales caught by a Japanese expedition along the ice edge, one-fifth was infested with cyamids (those from one whale were identified as Cyamus balaenopterae). Several hundred of these whale lice can be found on a single whale, with an average of 55 per individual ‚Äì most are found at the end of the ventral grooves and around the umbilicus. The copepod Pennella was found on only one whale. Cestodes were commonly found in the intestines (one example was identified as Tetrabothrius affinis). ==Behavior== ===Group size and composition=== Antarctic minke whales are more gregarious than their smaller counterparts, the common and dwarf minke whale. The average group size in the Antarctic was about 2.4 (adjusted downwards for observer bias), with about a quarter of the sightings consisting of singles and one-fifth of pairs; the largest aggregation consisted of 60 individuals. Off South Africa, the average group size was about two, with singles (nearly 46%) and pairs (31%) being the most common ‚Äì the largest was 15. Off Brazil, most sightings were of singles (32.6%) or pairs (31.5%), with the largest group consisting of 17 individuals. Like common minke whales, Antarctic minkes exhibit a great deal of spatial and temporal segregation by sex, age class, and reproductive condition. Off South Africa, immature animals predominate from April to May, while mature whales (mainly males) dominate from June onwards ‚Äì in August and September mature males often accompany cow-calf pairs. Off Brazil, a good proportion of the individuals are immature (particularly for females) in July and August, but by September most are mature, and by October and November nearly all are mature. Females outnumber males two to one off Brazil, while the opposite is true off South Africa, where males outnumber females nearly two to one. Over a quarter of the females off South Africa were found to be lactating, whereas lactating females are very rare in the Antarctic ‚Äì though a cow-calf pair was observed in the austral winter (August) in the Lazarev Sea. In the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic, immature animals are normally solitary and occur in lower latitudes further offshore, while mature whales are typically found in mixed groups (usually one sex outnumbers the other, and groups composed solely of males or females are occasionally found) and occur in higher latitudes. Mature males dominate in middle latitudes, while mature females predominate in the higher latitudes of the pack ice zone ‚Äì from two-thirds to three-quarters of the whales in the Ross Sea consist of pregnant females. An immature Antarctic minke whale was observed briefly associating with four dwarf minke whales on the Great Barrier Reef in July 2000. Unlike common minke whales, they often have a prominent blow, which is particularly visible in the calmer waters near the pack ice. In the narrow holes and cracks in the pack ice they have been observed spyhopping ‚Äì raising their head vertically ‚Äì to expose their blowholes to breathe; individuals have even been seen to break breathing holes through sea ice in the winter (July‚ÄìAugust), rising in a similar manner. When traveling fast in open water they can create larger versions of the \\"roostertail\\" of spray created by their smaller cousin, the Dall's porpoise. During bouts of feeding they will lunge multiple times onto their side (either left or right) into a dense patch of prey with mouth agape and ventral pleats expanded as their gular pouch fills with prey-laden water. After making a series of shorter dives during which they will surface anywhere from two to fifteen times, they will make a longer dive of up fourteen minutes. Shallower dives of normally less than are made at night (from about 8 p.m. to about 2 a.m.) while deeper dives that can be over deep are made during the day (from about 2 a.m. to about 8 p.m.). ===Vocalizations=== Antarctic minke whales produce a variety of sounds, including whistles, calls reminiscent of a clanging bell, clicks, screeches, grunts, downsweeps, and a sound called bioduck. Downsweeps are intense, low frequency calls that sweep down from about 130 to 115 Hz to about 60 Hz, with a peak frequency of 83 Hz. Each sweep has a duration of 0.2 seconds and an average source level of about 147 decibels at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre. The bio-duck call, first described in the 1960s and named by sonar operators on Oberon- class submarines for its purported resemblance to the quack of a duck, consist of a series of anywhere from three to a dozen pulse trains that range from 50 to 200 Hz and have a peak frequency of about 154 Hz ‚Äì they sometimes also possess harmonics of up to 1 kHz. They are repeated about every 1.5 to 3 seconds and have a source level of 140 decibels at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre. Their source remained a mystery for decades until attributed to the Antarctic minke whale in a paper published in 2014 ‚Äì though it had been suggested to originate from this species as early as the mid-2000s.Matthews, D., Macleod, R., and R. D. McCauley. (2004). \\"Bio-duck activity in the Perth Canyon: an automatic detection algorithm\\". In Proceedings of Acoustics 2004, 3‚Äì5 November 2004, Gold Coast, Australia, pp. 63‚Äì66. It has been recorded in the Ross and Lazarev Seas, over Perth Canyon, off Western Australia from late June to early December,McCauley, R., Bannister, J., Burton, C., Jenner, C., Rennie, S., and C. S. Kent. (2004). \\"Western Australian exercise area blue whale project: final summary report\\". CMST Report R2004‚Äì29, Project 350, 1-73. and in the King Haakon VII Sea from April to December. The sound seems to be made near the surface before foraging dives, but nothing is known of its function. ==Whaling== The barque Antarctic, sent by whaling pioneer Svend Foyn and led by Henrik Johan Bull, managed to harpoon at least three minke whales in the Antarctic between December 1894 and January 1895. Two were saved, both being used for fresh meat (one had only yielded two barrels of blubber).Bull, H. J. (1896). The cruise of the 'Antarctic' to the South Polar regions. London: Edward Arnold. In December 1923, when the men of the first modern whaling expedition to visit the Ross Sea saw \\"a number of spouts\\" after leaving the ice edge they were soon disgusted to find out that they from lowly minke whales. The few caught by the British in the 1950s were taken more for curiosity than anything else. The chemist Christopher Ash, who had served on the British factory ship Balaena during this time, stated that they were small enough to be lifted by their tails using a 10-ton spring balance and weighed entire. \\"Generally this is done when there are no other whales about and the deck empty except for a crowd of sightseers,\\" Ash explained, \\"but this crowd quickly scatters when the whale is just hanging free and starts to spin around and swing from side to side, as it almost always does.\\" Like Bull before him, Ash commented on their meat, which he described as \\"fine-textured in comparison with the other whales, and if properly cooked almost indistinguishable from beef.\\"Ash, C. (1962). Whaler's Eye. George Allen and Unwin Ltd., London. They were primarily exploited for this very reason ‚Äì their high quality meat ‚Äì in later years, which fetched as much as two dollars a pound in 1977.T√∏nnessen, J. and A. O. Johnsen. (1982). The history of modern whaling. University of California Press, Berkeley. With the larger blue, fin, and sei whales depleted, whaling nations focused their attention on the smaller, but more numerous, minke whales. Though the Soviets had caught several hundred in the 1950s, it was not until 1971-72 that a significant catch was made, with over 3,000 being taken (nearly all by a single Japanese expedition). Not wanting to repeat the same mistakes it had made with previous species, the International Whaling Commission set a quota of 5,000 for the following season, 1972-73. Despite these precautions, the quota was exceeded by 745 ‚Äì later quotas would be as high as 8,000. During the commercial whaling era, from 1950-51 to 1986-87, 97,866 minke whales (the vast majority probably Antarctic minkes) were caught in the Southern Ocean ‚Äì mainly by the Japanese and Soviets ‚Äì with a peak of 7,900 being reached in 1976-77. Harpoon guns of lesser caliber and \\"cold harpoons\\" (harpoons without explosive shells) had to be used due to their small size, while no air was pumped into the carcasses when they were tied alongside for towing to ensure the greatest quality of meat. While an expedition or two was fitted out each year specifically for minke whales ‚Äì the Jinyo Maru in 1971-72, the Chiyo Maru from 1972-73 to 1974-75, and the Kyokusei Maru in 1973-74 ‚Äì most expeditions, which targeted other species, ignored minkes during the peak of the whaling season (November‚ÄìDecember and late February to early March) and only caught them on whaling grounds relatively close to those of larger ones ‚Äì the minke whaling grounds were much further south (south of 60¬∞S) than those for fin and sei whales. From 1987 to the present, Japan has been sending a fleet consisting of a single factory ship and several catcher/spotting vessels to the Southern Ocean to catch Antarctic minkes under Article VIII of the IWC, which allows the culling of whales for scientific research. The first research program, Japanese Research Program in the Antarctic (JARPA), began in 1987-88, when 273 Antarctic minkes were caught. The quota and catch soon increased to 330 and 440. In 2005-06, the second research program, JARPA II, began. In its first two years, in what Japan called its \\"feasibility study\\", 850 Antarctic minkes, as well as 10 fin whales, were to be taken each season (2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07). The quota was reached in the first season, but due to a fire, only 508 Antarctic minkes were caught in the second. In 2007-08, because of constant harassment from environmental groups, they failed to reach the quota again, with a catch of only 551 whales. Beginning in 1968, larger numbers of minke whales were caught off Natal, South Africa, mainly to supplement the dwindling supply of larger species, particularly the sei whale. A total of 1,113 whales (nearly all Antarctic minke, but a few dwarf minke as well) were caught off the province between 1968 and 1975, with a peak of 199 in 1971. They were taken by whale catchers of 539 to 593 gross tons with 90 mm harpoon guns mounted on their bows, which brought them to the whaling station at Durban () for processing. Gunners refused to take minkes early in the day, because sharks devoured any minke carcasses that were flagged, forcing the catchers to tow them during the chasing of other whales and thus slowing them down. They also could not use asdic, as it frightened them and lead to protracted chases. The season lasted from February to September, with a peak in the last month of the season. In 1966, minke whales became the target of whaling operations off northeastern Brazil (6¬∞ ‚Äì 8¬∞S) due, once again, to the decline of sei whales. Over 14,000 were caught between 1949 and 1985, with a peak of 1,039 in 1975. They were caught by a succession of whale catchers ‚Äì the 367-ton Koyo Maru 2 (1966‚Äì1971), the 306-ton Seiho Maru 2 (1971‚Äì1977), and the 395-ton Cabo Branco (also called Katsu Maru 10, 1977‚Äì1985) ‚Äì up to 100 miles offshore and brought to the whaling station at Costinha, operated by the Compania de Pesca Norte do Brasil (COPESBRA) since 1911. The season lasted from June to December, with a peak in either September or October. An male Antarctic minke whale (confirmed by genetics) was caught west of Jan Mayen () in the northeastern North Atlantic on 30 June 1996. ==Other mortality== Entanglement in fishing gear and probably ship strikes are other sources of mortality. The former have been reported off Peru and Brazil, and the latter off South Australia. All involved calves or juveniles. ==Conservation status== The Antarctic minke whale is currently considered Near Threatened by the IUCN red list. However, the IUCN states that the population size is \\"clearly in the hundreds of thousands\\". The Antarctic minke whale is listed on Appendix II \\"Appendix I and Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. In addition, the Antarctic minke whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region. ==See also== *List of cetaceans *List of whale vocalizations ==References== == External links == * * Category:Cetaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Cetaceans of the Pacific Ocean Category:Baleen whales Category:Cetaceans of the Indian Ocean Category:Mammals described in 1867 Category:Taxa named by Hermann Burmeister ","title":"Antarctic minke whale"},{"id":"300076","text":"Cast may refer to: ==Music== * Cast (band), an English alternative rock band * Cast (Mexican band), a progressive Mexican rock band * The Cast, a Scottish musical duo: Mairi Campbell and Dave Francis * Cast, a 2012 album by Trespassers William * Cast, a 2018 album by KAT-TUN ==Science and technology== * Casting (metalworking) ** Cast iron, a group of iron-carbon alloys * Cast (geology), a cavity formed by decomposition that once were covered by a casing material * Cast, visible piles of mineral-rich organic matter excreted above ground by earthworms * Cast of the eye, a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other when looking at an object * Orthopedic cast, a protective shell to hold a limb in place, for example to help in healing broken bones * Cast (computer science), to change the interpretation of a bit pattern from one data type to another in computer programming * Urinary cast, tubules found in urine * Google Cast, a protocol built into the Google Chromecast and other embedded technologies ==Sports== * Cast (archery), the distance a bow can shoot its arrow * Cast, in falconry, to fly two or more falconry birds together * Cast, in fishing, to cast a line refers to the act of throwing bait or a lure using a fishing line out over the water using a flexible fishing rod ==Other uses== * Cast member, one of the performers in a play, movie, or other performing art form * Cast, the casting of a magic spell * Plaster cast, a copy made in plaster of another three-dimensional form, such as a sculpture * Cast, Finist√®re, a commune of the Finist√®re d√©partement, France * Cast, a theatre venue in Doncaster, UK ==People with the name== * Kristin Cast (born 1986), coauthor of the House of Night series with her mother P.C.

They are also often isolated from waves entering from their surroundings. This combination means that a person or detector exclusively hears direct sounds (no reverberant sounds), in effect simulating being inside an infinitely large room. Anechoic chambers, a term coined by American acoustics expert Leo Beranek, were initially exclusively used to refer to acoustic anechoic chambers. Recently, the term has been extended to RF anechoic chambers, which eliminate reflection and external noise caused by electromagnetic waves. Anechoic chambers range from small compartments the size of household microwave ovens to ones as large as aircraft hangars. The size of the chamber depends on the size of the objects and frequency ranges being tested. ==Acoustic anechoic chambers== Minimization of the reflection of sound waves by an anechoic chamber's walls Consumer Reports anechoic chamber Anechoic chambers are commonly used in acoustics to conduct experiments in nominally \\"free field\\" conditions, free- field meaning that there are no reflected signals. All sound energy will be traveling away from the source with almost none reflected back. Common anechoic chamber experiments include measuring the transfer function of a loudspeaker or the directivity of noise radiation from industrial machinery. In general, the interior of an anechoic chamber is very quiet, with typical noise levels in the 10‚Äì20 dBA range. In 2005, the best anechoic chamber measured at ‚àí9.4 dBA. In 2015, an anechoic chamber on the campus of Microsoft broke the world record with a measurement of ‚àí20.6 dBA. The human ear can typically detect sounds above 0 dBA, so a human in such a chamber would perceive the surroundings as devoid of sound. Anecdotally, some people may not like such quietness and can become disoriented. The mechanism by which anechoic chambers minimize the reflection of sound waves impinging onto their walls is as follows: In the included figure, an incident sound wave I is about to impinge onto a wall of an anechoic chamber. This wall is composed of a series of wedges W with height H. After the impingement, the incident wave I is reflected as a series of waves R which in turn \\"bounce up-and-down\\" in the gap of air A (bounded by dotted lines) between the wedges W. Such bouncing may produce (at least temporarily) a standing wave pattern in A. During this process, the acoustic energy of the waves R gets dissipated via the air's molecular viscosity, in particular near the corner C. In addition, with the use of foam materials to fabricate the wedges, another dissipation mechanism happens during the wave/wall interactions. As a result, the component of the reflected waves R along the direction of I that escapes the gaps A (and goes back to the source of sound), denoted R', is notably reduced. Even though this explanation is two-dimensional, it is representative and applicable to the actual three-dimensional wedge structures used in anechoic chambers. ===Semi- anechoic and hemi-anechoic chambers=== Full anechoic chambers aim to absorb energy in all directions. To do this, all surfaces, including the floor, need to be covered in sound absorbent material. A mesh grille is usually installed above the floor to provide a surface to walk on and place equipment. This mesh floor is typically placed at the same floor level as the rest of the building, meaning the chamber itself extends below floor level. This mesh floor is damped and floating on absorbent buffers to isolate it from outside vibration or electromagnetic signals. In contrast, semi-anechoic or hemi-anechoic chambers have a solid floor that acts as a work surface for supporting heavy items, such as cars, washing machines, or industrial machinery, which could not be supported by the mesh grille in a full anechoic chamber. Recording studios are often semi-anechoic. The distinction between \\"semi-anechoic\\" and \\"hemi-anechoic\\" is unclear. In some uses they are synonyms, or only one term is used. Other uses distinguish one as having an ideally reflective floor (creating free-field conditions with a single reflective surface) and the other as simply having a flat untreated floor. Still other uses distinguish them by size and performance, with one being likely an existing room retrofitted with acoustic treatment, and the other a purpose-built room which is likely larger and has better anechoic performance. ==Radio-frequency anechoic chambers== An RF anechoic chamber A large drive-in EMC RF anechoic test chamber. Note the orange caution cones for size reference. F-16 Fighting Falcon in the anechoic test chamber at Eglin Air Force Base The internal appearance of the radio frequency (RF) anechoic chamber is sometimes similar to that of an acoustic anechoic chamber; however, the interior surfaces of the RF anechoic chamber are covered with radiation absorbent material (RAM) instead of acoustically absorbent material. Uses for RF anechoic chambers include testing antennas, radars, and is typically used to house the antennas for performing measurements of antenna radiation patterns, electromagnetic interference. Performance expectations (gain, efficiency, pattern characteristics, etc.) constitute primary challenges in designing stand alone or embedded antennas. Designs are becoming ever more complex with a single device incorporating multiple technologies such as cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE, MIMO, RFID and GPS. ===Radiation-absorbent material=== RAM is designed and shaped to absorb incident RF radiation (also known as non-ionising radiation) as effectively as possible, from as many incident directions as possible. The more effective the RAM, the lower the resulting level of reflected RF radiation. Many measurements in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and antenna radiation patterns require that spurious signals arising from the test setup, including reflections, are negligible to avoid the risk of causing measurement errors and ambiguities. ===Effectiveness over frequency=== Close-up of a pyramidal RAM Waves of higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and are higher in energy, while waves of lower frequencies have longer wavelengths and are lower in energy, according to the relationship \\\\lambda= v/f where lambda represents wavelength, v is phase velocity of wave, and f is frequency. To shield for a specific wavelength, the cone must be of appropriate size to absorb that wavelength. The performance quality of an RF anechoic chamber is determined by its lowest test frequency of operation, at which measured reflections from the internal surfaces will be the most significant compared to higher frequencies. Pyramidal RAM is at its most absorptive when the incident wave is at normal incidence to the internal chamber surface and the pyramid height is approximately equal to \\\\lambda/4, where \\\\lambda is the free space wavelength. Accordingly, increasing the pyramid height of the RAM for the same (square) base size improves the effectiveness of the chamber at low frequencies but results in increased cost and a reduced unobstructed working volume that is available inside a chamber of defined size. ===Installation into a screened room=== An RF anechoic chamber is usually built into a screened room, designed using the Faraday cage principle. This is because most of the RF tests that require an anechoic chamber to minimize reflections from the inner surfaces also require the properties of a screened room to attenuate unwanted signals penetrating inwards and causing interference to the equipment under test and prevent leakage from tests penetrating outside. ===Chamber size and commissioning=== At lower radiated frequencies, far-field measurement can require a large and expensive chamber. Sometimes, for example for radar cross-section measurements, it is possible to scale down the object under test and reduce the chamber size, provided that the wavelength of the test frequency is scaled down in direct proportion by testing at a higher frequency. RF anechoic chambers are normally designed to meet the electrical requirements of one or more accredited standards. For example, the aircraft industry may test equipment for aircraft according to company specifications or military specifications such as MIL-STD 461E. Once built, acceptance tests are performed during commissioning to verify that the standard(s) are in fact met. Provided they are, a certificate will be issued to that effect. The chamber will need to be periodically retested. ===Operational use=== Test and supporting equipment configurations to be used within anechoic chambers must expose as few metallic (conductive) surfaces as possible, as these risk causing unwanted reflections. Often this is achieved by using non-conductive plastic or wooden structures for supporting the equipment under test. Where metallic surfaces are unavoidable, they may be covered with pieces of RAM after setting up to minimize such reflection as far as possible. A careful assessment may be required as to whether the test equipment (as opposed to the equipment under test) should be placed inside or outside the chamber. Typically most of it is located in a separate screened room attached to the main test chamber, in order to shield it from both external interference and from the radiation within the chamber. Mains power and test signal cabling into the test chamber require high quality filtering. Fiber optic cables are sometimes used for the signal cabling, as they are immune to ordinary RFI and also cause little reflection inside the chamber. ===Health and safety risks associated with RF anechoic chamber=== The following health and safety risks are associated with RF anechoic chambers: *RF radiation hazard *Fire hazard *Trapped personnel Personnel are not normally permitted inside the chamber during a measurement as this not only can cause unwanted reflections from the human body but may also be a radiation hazard to the personnel concerned if tests are being performed at high RF powers. Such risks are from RF or non- ionizing radiation and not from the higher energy ionizing radiation. As RAM is highly absorptive of RF radiation, incident radiation will generate heat within the RAM. If this cannot be dissipated adequately there is a risk that hot spots may develop and the RAM temperature may rise to the point of combustion. This can be a risk if a transmitting antenna inadvertently gets too close to the RAM. Even for quite modest transmitting power levels, high gain antennas can concentrate the power sufficiently to cause high power flux near their apertures. Although recently manufactured RAM is normally treated with a fire retardant to reduce such risks, they are difficult to completely eliminate. Safety regulations normally require the installation of a gaseous fire suppression system including smoke detectors. ==See also== * Soundproofing * Vibration isolation * Buffer (disambiguation) * Damped wave * Damping * Damper (disambiguation) * Electromagnetic reverberation chamber * Reverberation room * Sensory deprivation * GTEM cell ==References== ==External links== * 360-degree video of an anechoic chamber * Pictures and description of an acoustic anechoic chamber * Anechoic Chambers, Past and Present * How RF Anechoic Chambers Work * Video tour of an EMC/RF Test facility.

The northern region of Tr√°s-os-Montes, as all the country, had succumbed to the Napoleonic regency of Junot. As soon as news came of the disembarkation of the British in Portuguese Estremadura, the rebellion broke out. Bragan√ßa, and soon after Chaves, proclaimed liberation. The militias were formed to fight the invader. Napoleon, worried about what was happening in Spain and upset with the failure of the expedition of his forces, decided to come personally to the Peninsula in whose submission he had invested 300,000 men. The British, who had disembarked in 1807 in Galicia under the command of general John Moore, did not surpass 30,000 in number. With his customary mobility Napoleon multiplied himself, divided and destroyed the British and the Spanish in quick and precise blows. He ordered Soult to pursue the British in Galicia. Moore's army was defeated and hounded across the mountains of Lugo; the British general himself was killed during the final combats carried out around the bay of Coru√±a, where the remnants of his forces re-embarked. Some months later the same Soult received orders to invade Portugal from the North and expel the British from Portuguese soil. The carrying out of the order was, however, strongly impeded by the winter, which had made the Minho River almost impassable, and by the resistance of Portuguese forces located between Cerveira and Valen√ßa. Then general Soult decided to go around the mountainous border of the Upper Minho and make his penetration across the dry border of Tr√°s-os-Montes. His forces numbered around 23,000 men (among them 4,000 on horse) and 50 pieces of artillery. Some of these troops were experienced since they had participated in the battles of Friedland and Austerlitz. The border was crossed on 7 March 1809. ==The attack on Chaves== The defence of the border of Tr√°s-os-Montes was in the hands of brigadier Francisco Silveira, whose forces, numbering 2,800 regular troops, 2,500 militia and only 50 cavalry,Southey, p.169 were concentrated around the stronghold of Chaves. The fortifications, who were in bad conditions, were protected by 50 pieces of artillery, but with only a few of them fit for service, were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Pizarro. After initial skirmishes near the border, the Portuguese forces retreated to Chaves, and then Silveira ordered the abandonment of the stronghold. This decision caused great unrest among the militias and the population. Prudently, the brigadier led his forces south avoiding any risk against the superior forces. But pressured by the people and the militias, lieutenant colonel Francisco Pizarro disobeyed orders and accepted the command of the popular forces, preparing to resist the invading forces with 500 troops (1st line), 2,000 militias (2nd line) and 1,200 ordenan√ßas (3d line).Soriano, p. 123 Silveira tried to change his mind, even calling a war council to discuss the problem, but he couldn't get a formal decision, especially since the French who arrived on 10 March were now preparing to attack the most northerly fort of S√£o Neutel. Pizarro held his ground and the future count left with his officers to join his forces, who had occupied the highlands south of Chaves. Soult then summoned the stronghold of Chaves to surrender, but no answer was given. But soon it was obvious in the stronghold that defence was useless. Although fire from the artillery and muskets persisted since the French arrival, the defenders ultimately recognized that Silveira‚Äôs decision to retreat had been the most sensible one. Soult sent a second message calling for the surrender of the stronghold, and it was accepted on the 12 March. Chaves surrendered and the French troops marched into the town on 13 March. Soult, with so many prisoners on his hands, released the civilians of the militias and ordenan√ßas, under oath of not taking up arms against the French, and tried to recruit 500 of the line troops, who soon deserted. These actions by Marshal Soult were strongly criticized by several of his officers, especially those who had participated in the first French invasion of Portugal of the previous year under Junot, as they preferred that the stronghold had been taken by assault and the garrison put to the sword.Napier, This wise and gentle proceeding was much blamed by some of his officers, especially those who had served under Junot. They desired that Chaves might be assaulted, and the garrison put to the sword, for they were embued with a personal hatred of the Portuguese, and being adverse to serve in the present expedition, endeavoured, as it would appear, to thwart their general (...) p.182 ==The Portuguese counterattack== Meanwhile the Portuguese forces had left their positions near Vidago and retreated farther south to a low pass between Vila Pouca and Vila Real. Soult, though, had decided to make his way south by way of the Barroso, due west instead of south. He left a small garrison of a few hundred men in Chaves under the command of Major Messeger, and the hospital he had transferred from Monterey, Galicia, with many wounded or sick. As soon as Silveira knew that the main French army has gone away, he decided to attack Chaves. For some days a French detachment had approached Vila Pouca in an attempt to force the entrenched Portuguese forces to retreat. But soon it was discovered that these forces had gone to Boticas to join up with the main French army which was already on its way west. Soult's army went on to win the First Battle of Porto. Once again Silveira went down into the T√¢mega River valley and attacked the Chaves stronghold on 21 March. The small French garrison tried to resist, but the Portuguese knew the town well and were able to penetrate the walls through an opening called the \\"Opening of the Butchershops.\\" In the streets there was hand-to-hand combat, and the French, leaving almost 300 dead, retreated into the S√£o Francisco Fort. 200 French fell prisoners into the hands of the Portuguese. The Portuguese, having no artillery, blockaded the French for four days. On the fifth day, when all was ready for the final assault to be carried out by escalating the fort, Silveira gave Messeger an ultimatum, under which he should surrender without conditions. Messeger then requested an hour of truce in order to take a decision. After the time given had ended, and still without a response, Silveira issued a final ultimatum, warning Messenger that if he did not surrender in five minutes he would give orders for the storming of the fort. The French commander immediately surrendered without conditions. 25 officers, 23 civilians and surgeons, and about 1,300 soldiers were captured and taken under escort to Vila Real. 114 Spanish who were left in Chaves as prisoners by Soult were restored to liberty.Southey, p.195 This skilful and valiant maneuver by Silveira seriously upset Soult's plans, obliging him to wait, for lack of supply lines, between the Douro and the Vouga. After the Second Battle of Porto, the French army was obliged by Wellesley to retreat quickly to its starting point, the city of Ourense in Galicia, Spain. In the final phase of this retreat, Silveira was almost able to intercept the French troops near Montealegre. Some of his detachments were even able to see the rearguard crossing the border near the rugged mountains of Larouco. Beresford had come up to Chaves and let the opportunity to destroy the French slip away. Once the danger had passed, Beresford, under the insistence of Silveira, called a court martial for Francisco Pizarro. This War Council took place in Lisbon in 1809 and found the reckless lieutenant colonel innocent of the charges. This successful defeat of the French by the badly equipped Portuguese army gave the town of Chaves an important place in Portuguese history. It, together with the defeat of pro-Royalist forces in 1912, gave Chaves the deserved title of the Heroic City of Chaves (Cidade Her√≥ica de Chaves), the name of many streets and avenues in Portugal. ==See also== * Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil * History of Portugal * John VI of Portugal * Napoleonic Wars ==Notes== ==References== * William Francis Patrick Napier, History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France, from the Year 1807 to the Year 1814.

Situated on Mt. Taygetos, near ancient Sparta, it served as the capital of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea in the 14th and 15th centuries, experiencing a period of prosperity and cultural flowering. The site remained inhabited throughout the Ottoman period, when it was mistaken by Western travellers for ancient Sparta. In the 1830s, it was abandoned and the new town of Sparti was built, approximately eight kilometres to the east. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Sparti, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior ==History== Mystras, 1686. Pantanassa Monastery detail In late 1248, William II of Villehardouin, ruler of the Frankish Principality of Achaea, captured Monemvasia, the last remaining Byzantine outpost on the Morea. This success was soon followed by the submission of the restive Tsakones on Mount Parnon, the Slavic Melingoi tribe of Mount Taygetos, and the inhabitants of the Mani peninsula, thereby extending his sway over all of Laconia and completing the conquest of the peninsula, which had begun in 1205, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. Laconia was incorporated into the princely domain, and the young prince passed the winter of 1248‚Äì49 there, touring the country and selecting sites for new fortifications such as Grand Magne and Leuktron; finally, near his residence of Lacedaemon (ancient Sparta), on a spur of Mount Taygetos, he built the fortress that came to be known as Mystras. In September 1259, William of Villehardouin was defeated and captured, along with many of his nobles, at the Battle of Pelagonia, by the forces of the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Two years later, the Nicaeans recaptured Constantinople, putting an end to the Latin Empire and restoring the Byzantine Empire. At this point, the emperor concluded an agreement with the captive prince: William and his men would be set free in exchange for an oath of fealty, and for the cession of Monemvasia, Grand Magne, and Mystras. The handover was effected in 1262, and henceforth Mystras was the seat of the governor of the Byzantine territories in the Morea. Initially this governor (kephale) was changed every year, but after 1308 they started being appointed for longer terms. Almost immediately on his return to the Morea, William of Villehardouin renounced his oath to the emperor, and warfare broke out between Byzantines and Franks. The first Byzantine attempts to subdue the Principality of Achaea were beaten back in the battles of Prinitsa and Makryplagi, but the Byzantines were firmly ensconced in Laconia. Warfare became endemic, and the Byzantines slowly pushed the Franks back. The insecurity engendered by the raids and counter-raids caused the inhabitants of Lacedaemon to abandon their exposed city and settle at Mystras, in a new town built under the shadow of the fortress. From 1348 until its surrender to the Ottoman Turks on 31 May 1460, Mystras was the residence of a Despot who ruled over the Byzantine Morea, known as the \\"Despotate of the Morea\\". This was the city's golden age; according to the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Mystras \\"witnessed a remarkable cultural renaissance, including the teaching of Plethon [..], and attracted artists and architects of the highest quality\\". The frescos in the Peribleptos Monastery Church, dating between 1348 and 1380, are a very rare surviving late Byzantine cycle, crucial for the understanding of Byzantine art. Mystras was also the last centre of Byzantine scholarship; the Neoplatonist philosopher George Gemistos Plethon lived there until his death in 1452. He and other scholars based in Mystras influenced the Italian Renaissance, especially after he accompanied the emperor John VIII Palaiologos to Florence in 1439. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, was despot at Mystras before he came to the throne. Demetrius Palaeologus the last despot of Morea, surrendered the city to the Ottoman emperor Mehmed II in 1460. As Mezistre, it was the seat of a Turkish sanjak. The Venetians occupied it from 1687 to 1715, but otherwise the Ottomans held it until 1821 and the beginning of the Greek War of Independence. It was abandoned under King Otto for the newly rebuilt town of Sparta. In 1989 the ruins, including the fortress, palace, churches, and monasteries, were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ==Geography== Mystras is situated on the slopes of Taygetos Mountain. The archaeological site stands above the modern village of Mystras and the city of Sparta. The greenery surrounding the area is composed mainly by pine trees and cypresses.

Average relative humidity is 71.1%. Average rainfall for the years 2009-2013 is 1,600 millimeter per year. ==History== The province was created on 1 March 1972, when it was split off from Ubon Ratchathani Province. ==Symbols== The seal of the province shows two mythical lions, called singh, facing the chedi Pra A-non, in the temple Wat Maha That in the city of Yasothon. In the legendary account of the founding of the city, a lion came out of the forest when the site was chosen; hence the city was called Ban Singh Tha (), Home (of) Imposing Lion. (For facts behind the legend, and of two men called Singh, see the city's history). At the bottom of the seal is a lotus flower (Nymphaea lotus), as the lotus is both the provincial flower of the province and of Ubon Ratchathani Province, of which Yasothon was part until 1972. The provincial tree is Anisoptera costata. ==Administrative divisions== Yasothon with 9 districts ===Provincial government=== The province is divided into nine districts (amphoe).

The attack was led by Henrique Paiva Couceiro, who had campaigned in Africa and who had become the leader of the royalists. The royalists had been discreetly armed by the Spanish king, Alfonso XIII, and had concentrated their forces in Galicia. The attack ended with a defeat for the royalist forces. ==First incursion (October 3, 1911)== Couceiro had undertaken a first incursion in 1911 with about 1,000 men, who had formed in groups of 60-70 men. They had left the town of Ver√≠n, 12 kilometers from the northern border with Spain, and had marched towards the border. Most of the men were from the region of Tr√°s- os-Montes and were from a diverse array of social classes and skills. There were more than 100 priests in the group. In terms of military equipment, there were only 400 ancient rifles, a few Winchester rifles, and Mauser Pocket Pistols adapted to rifles, to which were added a score of semi-automatic pistols, daggers, and swords. The 1,000 men had crossed the border after a long march in the mountainous region between Bragan√ßa and Vinhais, near the present-day Montesinhos National Park. The republican garrison in Bragan√ßa had waited for an attack that never came. This is because the royalists had changed their plans and now marched on Vinhais, which had a smaller garrison of men--only eighty infantry, cavalry and border guards. These forces from Vinhais had left the small town and had concentrated on a hill nearby. Negotiations were begun but the military commander of Vinhais refused to join or to surrender. He gave Paiva Couceiro two hours to abandon Portuguese territory. The royalist flag of Portugal. Meanwhile, the Vinhais commander had sent messengers to Chaves and Bragan√ßa asking for reinforcements. When day came and he saw the large group of royalists camped nearby, he knew that he would have to retreat and he did so. The royalists occupied Vinhais. They hoisted the white-and-blue flag of the monarchy and proclaimed the end of the Republic. Priests of neighboring villages and a band of villagers cheered them on and used the Republican flag for target practice. However, the royalists, who were expecting a general uprising, did not receive the support they were expecting. On the nearby mountain, Republican troops remained and at any moment Republican reinforcements were expected to arrive from Chaves. Thus, the royalists abandoned Vinhais, and headed for the border. The republican garrison from Vinhais had meanwhile retreated towards Chaves, where they had met the troops coming in their support. When they arrived in Vinhais the royalists had already left. Crossing the rugged mountains north of Vinhais, and reduced to about 600 men after desertions, the rebels made their way back into Spain. The companies that still remained formed nine groups, some staying near Xinzo de Limia and Ourense, but the bulk of the column concentrated nearer the border in Ver√≠n. ==The attack on Chaves (July 8, 1912)== Paiva Couceiro in Galicia (June, 1912) After a hard winter in exile the refugees were eager to fight again. In February Paiva Couceiro joined them in Galicia. It was hoped that the towns in the north, now more than ever, would come over to their side. They now had more men and material. The original plan was to cross the mountains of the Barroso, west of Chaves, and link up with followers of a pro-monarchist priest in Cabeceiras de Basto. The army was divided into three groups. One tried to capture the fortress of Valen√ßa do Minho across from Spanish Tui. This endeavor ended in resounding defeat and retreat back into Galicia. The second group, of 200 men, was to enter Portugal via Vila Verde da Raia and create a diversion for Couceiro‚Äôs larger plan. The third group, composed of 450 men was the main column, commanded by Paiva Couceiro. This larger group crossed the border near a small village called Sendin, north of Montalegre. 23 soldiers and some customs police defended the town. Alerting Chaves to the danger, these men from Sendin retreated to a nearby hill south of the town. Chaves was convinced that Couceiro would attack Montalegre and head south towards Cabeceiras de Basto. The rebels raised camp at dawn and moved east towards Chaves. In Padornelos a few people came out to greet them and offer their allegiance to the king and to the Catholic Church. Vilar de Perdizes was the next village, where the priest knelt to kiss Paiva Couceiro‚Äôs feet. Meanwhile, the military commander in Chaves, Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho, not knowing of Paiva Couceiro‚Äôs move across the north, had decided to send the main part of his forces with machine guns towards Montalegre to stop the royalists‚Äô passage to the south. Another group of 100 men was sent to the border to resist a possible incursion from the small group of Royalists that were in Feces, across from Vila Verde. On the morning of July 8 the rebels appeared just outside Chaves. No one had expected this attack, since the last news had the rebels just outside Montalegre. The people of Chaves had not even paid attention to the warnings brought from the customs guards who had fled the northern villages. Chaves then came under attack. Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho hurried to recall the troops that he had sent out a day earlier; however, he also had local support from the townspeople. 150 civilian volunteers from Chaves, trained briefly months earlier, hurried to help the authorities against the royalists. The regular soldiers numbered around 100. The battle was one of scattered firing with small arms and casualties were light. The rebels could not penetrate the defenses, nor could the garrison venture out to attack them. Meanwhile, the rebel group on the border, in Feces, had remained in its position, until they could hear the sounds of gunfire coming from Chaves. They crossed the border and managed to raise the royalist flag over the customs house. The small detachment of regular troops had meanwhile moved south to take up a better position. This group of rebels, nevertheless, never made it past the border. After a lull in the fighting, the royalists opened fire on the town with their two artillery pieces. The town‚Äôs guns had been taken away to defend the road to Montalegre. However, the Chaves forces were supplemented by reinforcing regular forces, who set up their artillery on a hill called Alto da Forca, south of the town, from which they could fire at will on the royalists. ==Royalist defeat== The royalists were unable to return fire, and this defeat resulted in a general celebration in Chaves. The streets filled with people, who were crying and laughing in each other‚Äôs arms. Paiva Couceiro‚Äôs forces suffered 30 dead. It is said that, near the border, a rebel soldier, not hiding his tears and rage, responded to someone who offered him a glass of wine: ‚ÄúWhy do I want wine? What I only wanted was the Monarchy in Portugal.‚Äù After the final dispersion of his men to Spain, Paiva Couceiro published a manifesto explaining his reasons for the defeat and proclaiming that his struggle was over. ==Tributes== In honor of the republican victory, in Lisbon a street was given the name ‚ÄúDefenders of Chaves‚Äù, and in Porto another street was given the name ‚ÄúHeroes of Chaves.‚Äù ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *History of Portugal, Cambridge University Press, 1937. *Guia de Portugal, Tr√°s os Montes e Alto-Douro, 3rd edition, July 1995. *Cr√≥nica da Vila Velha de Chaves, J√∫lio M.

He was probably born in County Cork. When he was 14 his father and Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh) fatally wounded each other in single combat near Cork city. He took part in the Flight of the Earls in 1607, when Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, together with more than ninety of their family and followers, the chief of the Gaelic and Catholic resistance in Ireland, fled to Europe. He later said that his involvement in the Flight was accidental, in that he had sought the protection of Tyrone from legal proceedings being taken against him, and fled with him because he had nowhere else to go. Sir William spent several years abroad, living firstly in Brussels and then Dordrecht, where he married his first wife Gertrude de Vries. Having received a pardon from King James I and extensive grants of land in Ireland, he was appointed President of Munster by Charles I in 1627. He warmly supported the arbitrary government of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, actively assisting in raising and drilling the Irish levies destined for the service of the king against the Parliament. He was a member of the Irish House of Commons from 1634, as MP for County Cork. In the great Irish Rebellion of 1641 he bore the chief responsibility for dealing with the insurgents in Munster; but the forces and supplies placed at his disposal were utterly inadequate. ==Reputation== His reputation in the minds of Irish nationalist historians is that he executed martial law in his province with the greatest severity, hanging large numbers of rebels, often without much proof of guilt. In 1843 Daniel O'Connell quoted him as saying about the harsh policy adopted by the government in Dublin: \\"The undue promulgation of that severe determination to extirpate the Irish and papacy out of the kingdom, your Lordship rightly apprehends to be too unseasonably published\\" in a such sense that he approved of the policy of extirpation. O'Connell went on \\"This St. Leger was himself one of the chief extirpators\\". The quotation can also be read in another sense, in that St Leger's use of the words \\"undue\\", \\"severe\\" and \\"too unseasonably\\" point to his disapproval of such a policy. As a landowner, St Leger's Irish property would have been worthless without Irish labourers and tenant farmers to work on it.\\"A Memoir on Ireland Native and Saxon\\" (1843) Chapter III - Part II In terms of geography, his reputation for cruelty in Munster (a whole province) is actually limited to a small area near Clonmel in early December 1641 where his force did kill several dozen people without due process, which led on to the killings in revenge of English or Protestant people in the same area. Whether St Leger ordered or approved of the murders by his force is still unproven. Why he would want to provoke such an uprising in Munster, where 90% of the population was Irish and Catholic, and where Protestants like him numbered less than 10%, is still unclear.M.

William married twice and had 6 children.

The Year 2038 problem (also called Y2038, Epochalypsehttps://www.linaro.org/blog/the-end-of-an- era/https://www.tomsguide.com/us/2038-bug-bh2017,news-25551.html, Y2k38, or Unix Y2K) relates to representing time in many digital systems as the number of seconds passed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and storing it as a signed 32-bit integer. Such implementations cannot encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. Similar to the Y2K problem, the Year 2038 problem is caused by insufficient capacity used to represent time. == Cause == The latest time since 1 January 1970 that can be stored using a signed 32-bit integer is (2-1 = 2,147,483,647 seconds after 1 January 1970). Programs that attempt to increment the time beyond this date will cause the value to be stored internally as a very large negative number, which these systems will interpret as having occurred at 20:45:52 on Friday, 13 December 1901 rather than 19 January 2038. This is caused by integer overflow, during which the counter runs out of usable digit bits, and flips the sign bit instead. This reports a maximally negative number, and continues to count up, towards zero, and then up through the positive integers again. Resulting erroneous calculations on such systems are likely to cause problems for users and other reliant parties. Programs that work with future dates will begin to run into problems sooner; for example, a program that works with dates 10 years in the future will need to be fixed no later than 19 January 2028. == Early problems == In May 2006, reports surfaced of an early manifestation of the Y2038 problem in the AOLserver software. The software was designed with a kludge to handle a database request that should \\"never\\" time out. Rather than specifically handling this special case, the initial design simply specified an arbitrary time-out date in the future. The default configuration for the server specified that the request should time out after one billion seconds. One billion seconds (approximately 32 years) after 01:27:28 UTC on 13 May 2006 is beyond the 2038 cutoff date. Thus, after this time, the time-out calculation overflowed and returned a date that was actually in the past, causing the software to crash. When the problem was discovered, AOLServer operators had to edit the configuration file and set the time-out to a lower value.Weird \\"memory leak\\" problem in AOLserver 3.4.2/3.x 12 May 2006 Players of games or apps which are programmed to impose waiting periods are running into this problem when the players try to bypass the waiting period by setting the date on their devices to a date past 19 January 2038, but are unable to do so, since a 32-bit Unix time format is being used. == Vulnerable systems == Embedded systems that use dates for either computation or diagnostic logging are most likely to be affected by the 2038 problem. Many transportation systems from flight to automobiles use embedded systems extensively. In automotive systems, this may include anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC/ESP), traction control (TCS) and automatic four-wheel drive; aircraft may use inertial guidance systems and GPS receivers.GPS suffers its own time counter overflow problem known as GPS Week Number Rollover. However, this does not imply that all these systems will suffer from the Y2038 problem, since many such systems do not require access to dates. For those that do, those systems which only track the difference between times/dates and not absolute times/dates will, by the nature of the calculation, not experience a major problem. This is the case for automotive diagnostics based on legislative standards such as CARB (California Air Resources Board). Another major use of embedded systems is in communications devices, including cell phones and Internet appliances (routers, wireless access points, etc.) which rely on storing an accurate time and date and are increasingly based on UNIX-like operating systems. For example, the Y2038 problem makes some devices running 32-bit Android crash and not restart when the time is changed to that date. Despite the modern 18‚Äì24 month generational update in computer systems technology, embedded systems are designed to last the lifetime of the machine in which they are a component. It is conceivable that some of these systems may still be in use in 2038. It may be impractical or, in some cases, impossible to upgrade the software running these systems, ultimately requiring replacement if the 32-bit limitations are to be corrected. MySQL database's built-in functions like \`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()\` will return 0 after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. Early Mac OS X versions are susceptible to the Year 2038 problem. == Data structures with time problems == Many data structures in use today have 32-bit time representations embedded into their structure. A full list of these data structures is virtually impossible to derive but there are well-known data structures that have the Unix time problem: * file systems (many file systems use only 32 bits to represent times in inodes) * binary file formats (that use 32-bit time fields) * databases (that have 32-bit time fields) * database query languages, like SQL that have \`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()\`-like commands Examples of systems using data structures that may contain 32-bit time representations include: * embedded factory, refinery control and monitoring subsystems * assorted medical devices * assorted military devices Any system making use of data structures containing 32-bit time representations will present risk. The degree of risk is dependent on the mode of failure. == Network Time Protocol timestamps == The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has a related overflow issue, which manifests itself in 2036, rather than 2038. The 64-bit timestamps used by NTP consist of a 32-bit part for seconds and a 32-bit part for fractional second, giving NTP a time scale that rolls over every 232 seconds (136 years) and a theoretical resolution of 2‚àí32 seconds (233 picoseconds). NTP uses an epoch of 1 January 1900. The first rollover occurs in 2036, prior to the UNIX year 2038 problem. Implementations should disambiguate NTP time using a knowledge of the approximate time from other sources. Since NTP only works with the differences between timestamps and never their absolute values, the wraparound is invisible in the calculations as long as the timestamps are within 68 years of each other. However, after a wraparound the clients can still face two problems: # They receive the date 1900-01-01 00:00:00UTC, not 2036-02-07 06:28:15 (plus or minus some leap seconds) as the new time. # When a client tries to adopt this time and store it in UNIX time format, as many embedded systems do, it will fail because UNIX time starts at 13 December 1901 (signed 32 bit integer) or 1 January 1970 (unsigned 32 bit integer). This means that for NTP the rollover will be invisible for most running systems, since they will have the correct time to within a very small tolerance. However, systems that are starting up need to know the date within no more than 68 years. Given the large allowed error, it is not expected that this is too onerous a requirement. One suggested method is to set the clock to no earlier than the system build date or the release date of the current version of the NTP software. Many systems use a battery-powered hardware clock to avoid this problem. Even so, future versions of NTP may extend the time representation to 128 bits: 64 bits for the second and 64 bits for the fractional-second. The current NTP4 format has support for Era Number and Era Offset, that when used properly should aid fixing date rollover issues. According to Mills, \\"The 64 bit value for the fraction is enough to resolve the amount of time it takes a photon to pass an electron at the speed of light. The 64 bit second value is enough to provide unambiguous time representation until the universe goes dim.\\"University of Delaware Digital Systems Seminar presentation by David Mills, 26 April 20062‚àí64 seconds is about 54 zeptoseconds or (light would travel 16.26 picometres, or approximately 0.31 √ó Bohr radius), and 264 seconds is about 585 billion years. == Possible solutions == There is no universal solution for the Year 2038 problem. For example, in the C language, any change to the definition of the \`time_t\` data type would result in code compatibility problems in any application in which date and time representations are dependent on the nature of the signed 32-bit \`time_t\` integer. For example, changing \`time_t\` to an unsigned 32-bit integer, which would extend the range to 2106 (specifically, 06:28:15 UTC on Sunday, 7 February 2106), would adversely affect programs that store, retrieve, or manipulate dates prior to 1970, as such dates are represented by negative numbers. Increasing the size of the \`time_t\` type to 64-bit in an existing system would cause incompatible changes to the layout of structures and the binary interface of functions. Most operating systems designed to run on 64-bit hardware already use signed 64-bit \`time_t\` integers. Using a signed 64-bit value introduces a new wraparound date that is over twenty times greater than the estimated age of the universe: approximately 292 billion years from now. The ability to make computations on dates is limited by the fact that \`tm_year\` uses a signed 32 bit integer value starting at 1900 for the year. This limits the year to a maximum of 2,147,485,547 (2,147,483,647 + 1900). FreeBSD uses 64-bit \`time_t\` for all 32-bit and 64-bit architectures except 32-bit i386, which uses unsigned 32-bit \`time_t\` instead.https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?arch Starting with NetBSD version 6.0 (released in October 2012), the NetBSD operating system uses a 64-bit \`time_t\` for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Applications that were compiled for an older NetBSD release with 32-bit \`time_t\` are supported via a binary compatibility layer, but such older applications will still suffer from the Year 2038 problem. OpenBSD since version 5.5, released in May 2014, also uses a 64-bit \`time_t\` for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. In contrast to NetBSD, there is no binary compatibility layer. Therefore, applications expecting a 32-bit \`time_t\` and applications using anything different from \`time_t\` to store time values may break. Linux originally used a 64-bit \`time_t\` for 64-bit architectures only; the pure 32-bit ABI was not changed due to backward compatibility. Starting with version 5.6, 64-bit \`time_t\` is supported on 32-bit architectures, too. This was done primarily for the sake of embedded Linux systems. The x32 ABI for Linux (which defines an environment for programs with 32-bit addresses but running the processor in 64-bit mode) uses a 64-bit \`time_t\`. Since it was a new environment, there was no need for special compatibility precautions. Network File System version 4 has defined its time fields as \`struct nfstime4 {int64_t seconds; uint32_t nseconds;}\` since December 2000. Values greater than zero for the seconds field denote dates after the 0-hour, January 1, 1970. Values less than zero for the seconds field denote dates before the 0-hour, January 1, 1970. In both cases, the nseconds (nanoseconds) field is to be added to the seconds field for the final time representation. Alternative proposals have been made (some of which are already in use), such as storing either milliseconds or microseconds since an epoch (typically either 1 January 1970 or 1 January 2000) in a signed 64-bit integer, providing a minimum range of 300,000 years at microsecond resolution. In particular, Java's use of 64-bit long integers everywhere to represent time as \\"milliseconds since 1 January 1970\\" will work correctly for the next 292 million years. Other proposals for new time representations provide different precisions, ranges, and sizes (almost always wider than 32 bits), as well as solving other related problems, such as the handling of leap seconds. In particular, TAI64 is an implementation of the International Atomic Time (TAI) standard, the current international real-time standard for defining a second and frame of reference. == See also == * Deep Impact is believed to have been lost at the time its internal clock reached 232 one-tenth seconds since 2000, on 11 August 2013, 00:38:49 UTC. * John Titor, alleged time traveler who is sometimes related to the problem * Time formatting and storage bugs * Unix time * Year 10,000 problem * Year 2000 problem == Notes == == References == == External links == *Y2038 Proofness Design glibc Wiki *Entry in How Stuff Works * The Project 2038 Frequently Asked Questions *Critical and Significant Dates 2038 *A 2038-safe replacement for time.h on 32 bit systems *The number glitch that can lead to catastrophe * Problem Year 02038 Problem Category:Operating system technology Year 02038 problem Category:Unix Category:Linux Category:Software bugs ","title":"Year 2038 problem"},{"id":"300132","text":"slalom gates. The stem christie or \\"wedge christie\\" is a technique used in skiing for turning. The turn comprises three steps: 1. Forming a wedge by rotating the tail of one ski outwards at an angle to the direction of movement, which initiates a change in direction opposite to the stemmed ski. 2. Bringing the other ski parallel to the wedged ski. 3. Completing the turn with both skis parallel as they carve an arcing turn sliding sideways together. ==History== Austrian ski guide Hannes Schneider developed the stem christie. Having perfected it by 1910 he promoted it as the mainstay of the Arlberg technique, which he called the \\"Alpine System\\". It replaced the Telemark turn as the standard for descending on skis. The technique was widely used up until the late 1960s, when its use diminished in favor of the parallel turn. Skis with increasingly \\"parabolic sidecut\\" accelerated the obsolescence of the stem Christie, starting in the late 1990s, because of their improved turning characteristics over skis with minimal sidecut. The term, \\"christie\\", derives from the turning technique employed by Norwegian jumpers in Christiania, Norway, which was called the \\"stem Christiania\\" and became shortened to \\"stem christie\\". ==See also== *Snowplough turn - also known as the wedge turn or stem turn *Parallel turn *Skiing Topics ==Notes== ==References== Category:Skiing techniques ","title":"Stem christie"},{"id":"300135","text":"Laetiporus is a genus of edible mushrooms found throughout much of the world. Some species, especially Laetiporus sulphureus, are commonly known as sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom, or the chicken fungus because many think they taste like chicken. The name \\"chicken of the woods\\" is not to be confused with another edible polypore, Maitake (Grifola frondosa) known as \\"hen of the woods\\", or with Lyophyllum decastes, known as the \\"fried chicken mushroom\\". The name Laetiporus means \\"with bright pores\\". ==Description== Laetiporus sp. from Anamalai Hills, Southern Western Ghats, IndiaIndividual \\"shelves\\" range from across. These shelves are made up of many tiny tubular filaments (hyphae). The mushroom grows in large brackets ‚Äì some have been found that weigh over 45 kg (100 pounds). It is most commonly found on wounds of trees, mostly oak, though it is also frequently found on eucalyptus, yew, sweet chestnut, and willow, as well as conifers in some species. Laetiporus species are parasitic and produce brown rot in the host on which they grow. Young fruiting bodies are characterized by a moist, rubbery, sulphur-yellow to orange body sometimes with bright orange tips. Older brackets become pale and brittle almost chalk-like, mildly pungent, and are often dotted with beetle or slug/woodlouse holes. Similar species include Laetiporus gilbertsonii (fluorescent pink, more amorphous) and L. coniferica (common in the western United States, especially on red fir trees). Edibility traits for the different species have not been well documented, although all are generally considered edible with caution. The sulphur shelf mushroom sometimes comes back year after year when the weather suits its sporulation preferences. From late spring to early autumn, the sulphur shelf thrives, making it a boon to mushroom hunters and a bane to those concerned about the health of their trees. This fungus causes a brown cubical rot and embrittlement which in later stages ends in the collapse of the host tree, as it can no longer flex and bend in the wind. Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus cincinnatus) in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York on October 5, 2012. ==Phylogenetics== L. cincinnatus, Ohio, US Phylogenetic analyses of ITS, nuclear large subunit and mitochondrial small subunit rDNA sequences from a variety of North American species have delineated five distinct clades within the core Laetiporus clade: sulphureus clade I contains white-pored L. sulphureus isolates, while sulphureus clade II contains yellow-pored L. sulphureus isolates. In addition, phylogenetic clades have been identified from Japan, Hawaii, South America, Europe, and South Africa. ==Edibility== The mushroom can be prepared in most ways that one can prepare chicken meat. It can also be used as a substitute for chicken in a vegetarian diet. Additionally, it can be frozen for long periods of time and retain its edibility. In certain parts of Germany and North America, it is considered a delicacy. L. sulphureus prepared dish In some cases eating the mushroom \\"causes mild reactions ... for example, \\"swollen lips\\" or in rare cases \\"nausea, vomiting, dizziness and disorientation\\" to those who are sensitive. This is believed to be due to a number of factors that include allergies to the mushroom's protein or toxins which are only somewhat stable at high temperatures. As such, many field guides request that those who eat Laetiporus exercise caution by only eating fresh, young brackets and begin with small quantities to see how well it sits in their stomach. Laetiporus sulphureus has a potent ability to inhibit staph bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), as well as moderate ability to inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtilis. ==Species== *Laetiporus ailaoshanensis B.K.Cui & J.Song (2014) *Laetiporus baudonii (Pat.)

Thus bent, the ski follows the turn without sliding. It contrasts with earlier techniques such as the stem Christie, which slides the ski outward from the body (\\"stemming\\") to generate sideways force. Parallel turns generate much less friction and are more efficient both in maintaining speed and minimizing skier effort. The parallel turn was invented in the 1930s by Austrian ski racer Anton Seelos from Seefeld in Tirol.Nick Howe: The Blitz Form Kitz, Skiing Heritage 1/1997 p.17. Parallel turns require solid contact from the skier's lower leg to the ski to rotate it on-edge. This was difficult to achieve with early ski equipment, limiting the technique to the high performance realm of racing. The introduction of composite skis, metal edges, releasable clamping bindings, and stiff plastic boots combined to allow parallel turns even on beginner equipment. By the late 1960s it rapidly replaced stemming for all but very short-radius turns. The evolution of shaped skis in the 1990s advanced the carving turn to preeminence. Today parallel turns are taught to teach novice skiers the effect of weighting and unweighting their skis. They are still the basic technique for steep hills, off piste and mogul skiing. ==Basic action== The parallel turn relies on two dynamics: releasing the edge hold by reducing the angle between ski and snow surface which makes the front of the ski skid downhill (skidding inwards) and then applying a force to change the edge and make the ski turn across the line of greatest slope (skidding outwards). The skier initiates the turn by moving their knees or the whole body laterally in the direction of the desired turn. The motion of knees is translated through the calf to the high cuffs on the ski boots, to the bindings, and then to the skis. This reduces the edge hold and causes the skis to rotate on their edges, with the skier's weight and the force they put upon them to change the edge of the skis which turns them across the line of greatest slope. To stop the turn the knee or the body is rotated back to the neutral position until the edge holds and the skidding stops. While both skis take part, in practice the ski on the outside of the turn is dominant. Moving the legs to the side shifts the center of gravity, compensated for by moving the hips in the opposite direction. The effect is to keep the skier's upper body upright while the lower torso and legs shift side-to-side. The skier pressures the front of their skis to keep the fore-and-aft center of gravity of the skier's mass over their toes. The parallel turn can be improved through dynamic \\"weighting\\". Turns are often linked in a series of continual arcs, one direction then the other. Lifting the body through the middle of the switch partially releases the skis arcs, easing the transition to the opposite direction. ==Changing the technique== In the 1990s skis were progressively widened at the tips and tails relative to the waist. Applying an edge of these \\"shaped\\" or \\"parabolic\\" skis brings a curved surface to the snow, resulting in a carve turn. ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20120416142507/http://www.youcanski.com/en/coaching/inside_ski.htm * http://www.mechanicsofsport.com/skiing/manoeuvres/parallel_turn.html ==External links== * An excellent film of the classic parallel technique can be found in . Note that the skier's upper body remains pointed down the fall line, and their body moves only a small amount from side to side. Turns are initiated at the tip, and skidding progressively develops--note the amount of snow being thrown off the back of the ski as the turn develops. The skis can be seen to bend into arcs, but these are relatively modest. This is a much different technique than the modern carving turn, where the skis and skier move through smooth arcs.

A feminist active in the tangwai movement, she joined the Democratic Progressive Party in 1990, and was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1992. Subsequently, she served as Taoyuan County Magistrate between 1997 and 2000, and was the Vice President of the Republic of China from 2000 to 2008, under President Chen Shui-bian. Lu announced her intentions to run for the presidency on 6 March 2007, but withdrew to support eventual DPP nominee Frank Hsieh. Lu ran again in 2012, but withdrew for a second time, ceding the nomination to DPP chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen. She lost the party's Taipei mayoral nomination to Pasuya Yao in 2018, and stated that she would leave the party. However, by the time Lu announced in September 2019 that she would contest the 2020 presidential election on behalf of the Formosa Alliance, she was still a member of the Democratic Progressive Party. ==Early life== Lu was born in T≈çen Town (now Taoyuan City), in northern Taiwan, during Japanese rule. She has one older brother and three older sisters. After graduating from Taipei First Girls' High School, Lu studied law at the National Taiwan University. Graduating in 1967, she went on to gain a Master of Laws from both the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (in comparative law, 1971) and Harvard University (1978). ==Rise in politics== During the 1970s, Lu established herself as a prominent feminist advocate in Taiwan, which included writing of New Feminism or Xin N√ºxing Zhuyi (). She renounced her KMT membership, joined the Tangwai movement, and worked on the staff of Formosa Magazine. Lu then became increasingly active in the tang-wai, the opposition movement calling for democracy and an end to authoritarian rule. In 1979 she delivered a 20-minute speech criticizing the government at an International Human Rights Day rally that later became known as the Kaohsiung Incident. Following this rally, virtually the entire leadership of Taiwan's democracy movement, including Lu, was imprisoned. She was tried, found guilty of violent sedition, and sentenced by a military court to 12 years in prison. She was named by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience, and, due to international pressure, coupled with the work of Ma Ying-jeou and Jerome A. Cohen, was released in 1985, after approximately five-and-a-half years in jail. ===Elected offices=== Lu joined the Democratic Progressive Party in November 1990, and was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1992. In 1997, she won an election to be the Magistrate of Taoyuan, a post she held until Chen Shui-bian selected her as his running mate in the 2000 presidential elections. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" style=\\"margin:0 1em 1em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; text-align:center; border- collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"width:620px;\\" Taoyuan County Magistrate Special By-Election Result - ! e9e9e9;\\" No. ! e9e9e9;\\" Party ! e9e9e9;\\" Candidate ! e9e9e9;\\" Votes ! e9e9e9;\\" Percentage ! e9e9e9;\\" - 1align=\\"left\\"Annette Lualign=\\"right\\"324,07455.3% 20px - 2align=\\"left\\"Fang Li-hsiualign=\\"right\\"216,32536.9% - 3align=\\"left\\"Lai Lai-kunalign=\\"right\\"45,5267.8%  -  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\" Total  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 594,529  58.77% voter turnout  } ==Novel== Lu completed her novel entitled These Three Women while in prison. To evade the surveillance of the detention facility, she wrote part of the novel on toilet paper using a washbasin as a desk. In 2008, the novel was adapted into a screenplay for TV drama of the same name. The drama was broadcast on 24 November 2008 on the Chinese Television System. ==Vice Presidency, 2000‚Äì2008== On 18 March 2000, Lu was elected vice president. She was awarded the World Peace Corps Mission's World Peace Prize in 2001.Lu becomes first woman to win World Peace Prize TAIPEI TIMES. Monique Chu. [November 30, 2001] Controversy erupted over this in Taiwan, with Lu's political opponents accusing her of vastly overstating the significance and value of that award. She was also the ROC's first elected vice president to adopt a Western first name. In her interview with TIME Asia Magazine, she said the KMT never thought they would transfer their regime to her on behalf of the freedom fighters. Lu was a contender for the 2008 presidential election; she announced her candidacy on March 6 and faced Yu Shyi-kun, Frank Hsieh, and Su Tseng-chang for the nomination. After receiving only 6.16% of the votes cast in the DPP primary, Lu withdrew from the race.\\"VP quits race for Taiwan presidency\\", Al Jazeera, 7 May 2007.\\"Frank Hsieh Confirmed as DPP Standard Bearer\\", The China Post, 8 May 2007. ===Assassination attempt=== On 19 March 2004, Lu was shot in the right kneecap while campaigning in Tainan. Chen was shot in the abdomen at the same event. Both survived the shooting and left Chi-mei Hospital on the same day. The Pan- Blue Coalition suggested that the shooting was not an assassination attempt but that it was staged to a self-inflicted wound in order to gain sympathy votes. The Chen/Lu ticket won the election on the following day with a 0.228% margin, a figure significant to those who related it to the assassination incident. ==Later political career== Lu announced in March 2018 that she would contest the Democratic Progressive Party mayoral primary for Taipei. Soon after the DPP nominated Pasuya Yao as its candidate, Lu stated her intention to leave the party. She remained a DPP member through 2019, and announced in September 2019 that she would contest the 2020 presidential election on behalf of the Formosa Alliance, with Peng Pai-hsien as her running mate. On 2 November 2019, Lu suspended her presidential campaign. ==Cross-strait relations== In terms of Cross-Strait relations with China, Lu has been more outspoken in favor of Taiwan independence than President Chen Shui-bian, and as such has been more heavily attacked than Chen both by the government of the People's Republic of China as well as by supporters of Chinese reunification. Her remarks have led state newspapers in mainland China to accuse her of provoking \\"animosity between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits\\".\\"What Is Annette Lu Up To?\\", People's Daily, 4/17/00 PRC state media has also labeled Lu as \\"insane\\" and a \\"scum of the earth\\". In 2010 Lu visited South Korea and advocated Taiwan's use of what she called \\"soft power,\\" meaning peaceful economic and political development, as a model for the resolution of international conflicts.Soft power lets Taiwan overcome poverty, survive despotism: Lu, Taiwan News, 18 February 2010. In mid-April 2013 speaking at George Washington University, Lu called for the DPP to have a better understanding about Mainland China because Taiwan's future depends on the development on the mainland. She stated that cross-strait relations should be defined as not only a distant relative, but also a near neighbor. And she stressed that there should be no hatred nor war between Taiwan and Mainland China, and both side should pursue peaceful coexistence, industrial cooperation and cultural exchanges. Speaking at the founding ceremony of Anti- One China Principle Union in Taipei on 29 April 2013, Lu warned on silent annexation of Taiwan into China since the introduction of Anti-Secession Law in 2005 and the gradual erosion of Taiwan's sovereignty. However, she said Taiwan doesn't oppose that there is one China in the world, but Taiwan is not part of China. She criticized ROC President Ma Ying-jeou for making Taiwan becomes more and more dependent on China. She even reiterated her 1996 Consensus to oppose Kuomintang's 1992 Consensus in dealing with the PRC, in which she said Taiwan has been an independent sovereign country after the 1996 ROC presidential election. ==Corruption charges and acquittal== On September 21, 2007, Lu, along with DPP chairman Yu Shyi-Kun and National Security Office secretary-general Mark Chen, were separately indicted on charges of corruption by the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of Taiwan. Lu was accused of embezzlement and special fund abuse of about US$165,000. On July 2, 2012, all three were acquitted of all charges. ==See also== * Politics of the Republic of China * Democratic Pacific Union ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== *Vice President Lu's Remarks of Appreciation for the 2001 World Peace Prize * Government Information Office of the Republic of China, Official Biography 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006 Category:1944 births Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Taiwan Category:Democratic Progressive Party Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Living people Category:World Peace Prize laureates Category:Magistrates of Taoyuan County Category:Members of the 2nd Legislative Yuan Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:People from Taoyuan District Category:Taiwan independence activists Category:Taiwanese feminists Category:Taiwanese women in politics Category:Taoyuan City Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni Category:Vice Presidents of the Republic of China on Taiwan Category:Shooting survivors Category:Taiwanese women writers Category:Taiwanese politicians of Hakka descent Category:Taiwanese prisoners and detainees Category:Women vice presidents ","title":"Annette Lu"},{"id":"300150","text":"4-Aminobenzoic acid (also known as para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA because the number 4 carbon in the benzene ring is also known as the para position) is an organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and carboxyl groups. The compound occurs extensively in the natural world. ==Production and occurrence== In industry, PABA is prepared mainly by two routes: * Reduction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid * Hoffman degradation of the monoamide derived from terephthalic acid. Food sources of PABA include liver, brewer's yeast (and unfiltered beer), kidney, molasses, mushrooms, and whole grains. A review on this compound. ==Biology== ===Biochemistry=== Tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway PABA is an intermediate in the synthesis of folate by bacteria, plants, and fungi. Many bacteria, including those found in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli, generate PABA from chorismate by the combined action of the enzymes 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase.Folate Synthesis (Abstract) Plants produce PABA in their chloroplasts, and store it as a glucose ester (pABA-Glc) in their tissues. Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA to folate, so require folate from dietary sources such as green leafy vegetables. In humans, PABA is considered nonessential and, although it has been referred to historically as \\"vitamin Bx\\", is no longer recognized as a vitamin, because most people have a microbiome that will generate PABA. Sulfonamide drugs are structurally similar to PABA, and their antibacterial activity is due to their ability to interfere with the conversion of PABA to folate by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Thus, bacterial growth is limited through folate deficiency. ===Medical use=== The potassium salt is used as a drug against fibrotic skin disorders, such as Peyronie's disease, under the trade name Potaba. PABA is also occasionally used in pill form by sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome to treat its associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and in nutritional epidemiological studies to assess the completeness of 24-hour urine collection for the determination of urinary sodium, potassium, or nitrogen levels. ===Nutritional supplement=== Despite the lack of any recognized syndromes of PABA deficiency in humans, except for those who lack the colonic bacteria that generate PABA, many claims of benefit are made by commercial suppliers of PABA as a nutritional supplement. The benefit is claimed for fatigue, irritability, depression, weeping eczema (moist eczema), scleroderma (premature hardening of the skin), patchy pigment loss in the skin (vitiligo), and premature grey hair. ==Commercial and industrial use== PABA finds use mainly in the biomedical sector. Other uses include its conversion to specialty azo dyes and crosslinking agents. PABA is also used as a biodegradable pesticide, though its use is now limited due to evolution of new variants of bio-pesticides. In the past, PABA was widely used in sunscreens as a UV filter. It is a UVB absorber, meaning it can absorb wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm.Melanoma Madness The scientific flap over sunscreens and skin cancer -- Chemical studies, Science News Online, 6/6/98 (accessed 10/1/2009, 2009) Patented in 1943, PABA was one of the first active ingredients to be used in sunscreen.F. P.; Mitchnick, M.; Nash, J. F. A Review of Sunscreen Safety and Efficacy Photochem. Photobiol. 1998, 68, 243 256. The first in vivo studies on mice showed that PABA reduced UV damage. In addition, it was shown to protect against skin tumors in rodents.H.; Thune, P.; Eeg Larsen, T. The inhibiting effect of PABA on photocarcinogenesis Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1990, 282, 38 41 Animal and in vitro studies in the early 1980s suggested PABA might increase the risk of cellular UV damage. On the basis of these studies, as well as problems with allergies and clothing discoloration, PABA fell out of favor as a sunscreen. However, water-insoluble PABA derivatives such as padimate O are currently used in some products. ==Safety considerations== PABA is largely nontoxic; the median lethal dose of PABA in dogs (oral) is 2 g/kg. Allergic reactions to PABA can occur. It is formed in the metabolism of certain ester local anesthetics, and many allergic reactions to local anesthetics are the result of reactions to PABA.Toxicity, Local Anesthetics: eMedicine Emergency Medicine ==See also== *4-Aminosalicylic acid ==References== ==External links== * Para-Aminobenzoic acid MS Spectrum *PABA Cancer link Category:Anilines Category:Benzoic acids Category:IARC Group 3 carcinogens Category:Sunscreening agents Category:Non-proteinogenic amino acids ","title":"4-Aminobenzoic acid"},{"id":"300152","text":"PABA may refer to: * Pan Asian Boxing Association, a boxing organization * Philippine Amateur Baseball Association, the governing body of baseball in the Philippines * 4-Aminobenzoic acid, also known as para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA, an organic compound * Barter Island LRRS Airport (ICAO: PABA) * Paba Upazila, Bangladesh ","title":"PABA"},{"id":"300154","text":"Abergavenny Thursdays Football Club was a Welsh football team based in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. The club was founded in 1927 though several defunct clubs had existed in the town since the mid 19th century. It won the Welsh Football League title on two occasions in the late 1950s where it gained a reputation as one of the strongest teams competing in the Welsh leagues. The Thursdays won its last two titles prior to the founding of the League of Wales in 1992. As a founder member of the new League of Wales, they competed in the Division's inaugural season. Financial issues at the start of the campaign led to an exodus of players and staff and the club suffered relegation after finishing bottom of the table. The club entered a decline in the ensuing years that saw it suffer seven relegations in ten seasons, ending its playing days playing in the Gwent County League Division 3. It withdrew from the league in August 2013 after agreeing with local side Govilon FC to merge and form a new club Abergavenny Town FC. The ground Penypound Stadium is run and maintained by the Thursday‚Äôs Trust, thus preserving the history of the club. ==History== Records show that organised football was started in Abergavenny during the 1890s with the founding of Abergavenny Rangers. The team later became known as Abergavenny Rangers Thursdays before dropping Rangers from its name altogether in 1908. The Thursdays, who were unconnected to the first team formed in the town, were founded in 1927. The club's name derived from the fact that many Welsh towns gave workers a half-day on Thursdays, leading to the founding of many social clubs due to the free time. The club won promotion to the top tier of the Welsh Football League in 1951. They won the Welsh Football League Cup in 1952 after defeating Caerau Athletic in the final. Eight years after entering Division One, the club won its first Welsh Football League title during the 1958‚Äì59 season, finishing 15 points clear of second placed side Cardiff City reserves after winning 28 of their 36 league matches. They retained the title the following year. They also reached the semi-final of the Welsh Cup during their second title winning season, the furthest the club ever advanced in the competition, suffering a defeat to Wrexham in a replay. Thursdays' strong performances in the Welsh leagues led to an invitation to join the Southern Football League, part of the English football league system. The club eventually declined the offer in the hope of a Welsh national league being formed, an idea put forward by Llanelli after their request to join the Southern League was declined by the Football Association of Wales (FAW). Although there was strong support in the north of Wales for the idea, southern clubs playing in the English league system, such as Merthyr Tydfil and Barry Town, believed that the standard of competition was too low and resisted the move leading to its collapse. Several of the Thursdays' players during this era went on to join English Football League sides after performing well for the club, including Brian Evans and Danny McCarthy. In the 1960s, the team remained in the top tier and finished as runners-up on three consecutive occasions between 1963 and 1965, losing out to Swansea Town reserves each time. Thursdays reached their second Welsh Football League Cup final in 1963 but suffered a defeat to Brecon Corinthians. They suffered consecutive relegations at the start of the 1970s, dropping into Division Two and did not return to the top tier of Welsh football until 1988. ===League of Wales and decline=== Success returned to the club in the 1990‚Äì91 season, when the club won the Welsh Football League for the first time in 31 years, and they retained the title a year later. As such, they became one of the founding members of the League of Wales, a new national division which promised European football for the highest-placed teams. However, prior to the start of the inaugural season, the club was required to provide a bond to the FAW as security to ensure that floodlights would be installed in time for the start of the campaign. Although Thursdays obliged, the money put a considerable strain on the club's financial resources and the ensuing huncertainty as to whether the club would be competing in the League of Wales led to a mass exodus of players, as well as the resignation of manager Ray Warren and coach John Lewis. Kyle Holmes, one of the few senior players who remained, was appointed player-manager in their place and quickly assembled a team in preparation for the start of the season. They suffered a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Bangor City on the opening day of the season before securing their first point a week later with a 1‚Äì1 draw with Porthmadog. However, Thursdays ended the first season of the League of Wales with relegation after finishing in last place. Thursdays dropped to Division One of the Welsh Football League and finished 14th in their first campaign. Their second year brought some positive results back to the club after they finished fourth but another mass exodus of players followed and hope of a return to the League of Wales were soon forgotten. After low placed finishes in the following two seasons, Thursdays suffered a disastrous campaign in the 1997‚Äì98 season, failing to win any of their 36 league matches and conceding 210 goals which led to relegation to Division Two. After finishing 12th in their first season, the club entered a severe decline in which they suffered four successive relegations, dropping from Division Two of the Welsh Football League to Division Three of the regional Gwent County League, during which they conceded 675 goals. Their final relegation season, saw the club collect only two points in the Division Two of the Gwent County League as they failed to win a game. In 2004, a supporter's trust, named The Thursdays Trust, was founded with the intention of taking over control of the club in an effort to stabilise its financial future. The trust included former manager Kyle Holmes and several former players. The trust took over ownership of the club and renovated several areas of the ground. Tentative approaches were made over a potential merger between the Thursdays and local side Mardy in 2006 but were eventually dismissed. The club's last 11 seasons were spent in the Third Division of the Gwent County League. In August 2013, Thursdays withdrew from the Gwent County League days before they were due to play Pontypool in their opening match of the 2013‚Äì14 season, citing a lack of players. The problem had been a longstanding issue within the local area and the Thursdays had struggled for consistent levels for a number of seasons. Within a year of the old club's demise, a new club was formed to represent the town of Abergavenny ‚Äì Abergavenny Town F.C.. being renamed from their former name of Govilon FC. ==Honours== Welsh Football League Division 1 *Champions: 1958‚Äì59, 1959‚Äì60, 1990‚Äì91, 1991‚Äì92 Welsh Football League Cup *Winners: 1951‚Äì52 *Runners-up: 1962‚Äì63 ==References== ==External links== * () Category:Defunct football clubs in Wales Category:Association football clubs established in 1927 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2013 Category:Sport in Monmouthshire Category:Abergavenny Category:1927 establishments in Wales Category:2013 disestablishments in Wales Category:Cymru Premier clubs Category:Welsh Football League clubs ","title":"Abergavenny Thursdays F.C."},{"id":"300155","text":"tomsrtbt (pronounced: Tom's Root Boot) is a very small Linux distribution.

The most famous saga-genre is the √çslendingas√∂gur (sagas concerning Icelanders), which feature Viking voyages, migration to Iceland, and feuds between Icelandic families. But sagas' subject matter is diverse, including pre-Christian Scandinavian legends; saints and bishops both from Scandinavia and elsewhere; Scandinavian kings and contemporary Icelandic politics; and chivalric romances either translated from Continental European languages or composed locally. Sagas originated in the Middle Ages, but continued to be composed in the ensuing centuries. Whereas the dominant language of history-writing in medieval Europe was Latin, sagas were composed in the vernacular: Old Norse and its later descendants, primarily Icelandic. While sagas are written in prose, they share some similarities with epic poetry, and often include stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text. == Etymology and meaning of saga == The main meanings of the Old Norse word saga (plural s«´gur) are 'what is said, utterance, oral account, notification' and the sense used in this article: '(structured) narrative, story (about somebody)'.Dictionary of Old Norse Prose/Ordbog over det norr√∏ne prosasprog (Copenhagen: [Arnamagn√¶an Commission/Arnamagn√¶anske kommission], 1983‚Äì), s.v. '1 saga sb. f.'. It is cognate with the English words say and saw (in the sense 'a saying', as in old saw), and the German Sage; but the modern English term saga was borrowed directly into English from Old Norse by scholars in the eighteenth century to refer to Old Norse prose narratives.\\"saw, n.2.\\", OED Online, 1st edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, December 2019).\\"saga, n.1.\\", OED Online, 1st edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, December 2019). The word continues to be used in this sense in the modern Scandinavian languages: Icelandic saga (plural s√∂gur), Faroese s√∏ga (plural s√∏gur), Norwegian soge (plural soger), Danish saga (plural sagaer), and Swedish saga (plural sagor). It usually also has wider meanings such as 'history', 'tale', and 'story'. It can also be used of a genre of novels telling stories spanning multiple generations, or to refer to saga-inspired fantasy fiction.J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series was translated into Swedish by √Öke Ohlmarks with the title Sagan om ringen: \\"The Saga of the Ring\\". (The 2004 translation was titled Ringarnas herre, a literal translation from the original.) Icelandic journalist √ûorsteinn Thorarensen (1926‚Äì2006) translated the work as Hringadr√≥ttins saga meaning \\"Saga of the Lord of the Rings\\". Swedish folksaga means folk tale or fairy tale, while konstsaga is the Swedish term for a fairy tale by a known author, such as Hans Christian Andersen. In Swedish historiography, the term sagokung, \\"saga king\\", is intended to be ambiguous, as it describes the semi- legendary kings of Sweden, who are known only from unreliable sources.Snorres Ynglingasaga (Fotevikensmuseum) == Genres == Snorri Sturluson, portrait by Christian Krohg: Illustration for Heimskringla 1899-Edition Norse sagas are generally classified as follows. === Kings' sagas === Kings' sagas (konungas√∂gur) are of the lives of Scandinavian kings. They were composed in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries. A pre-eminent example is Heimskringla, probably compiled and composed by Snorri Sturluson. These sagas frequently quote verse, invariably occasional and praise poetry in the form of skaldic verse. === Sagas of Icelanders and short tales of Icelanders === The Icelanders' sagas (√çslendingas√∂gur), sometimes also called \\"family sagas\\" in English, are purportedly (and sometimes actually) stories of real events, which usually take place from around the settlement of Iceland in the 870s to the generation or two following the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in 1000. They are noted for frequently exhibiting a realistic style.V√©steinn √ìlason, 'Family Sagas', in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. by Rory Mcturk (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), pp. 101-18. It seems that stories from these times were passed on in oral form until they eventually were recorded in writing as √çslendingas√∂gur, whose form was influenced both by these oral stories and by literary models in both Old Norse and other languages. The majority ‚Äî perhaps two thirds of the medieval corpus ‚Äî seem to have been composed in the thirteenth century, with the remainder in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. These sagas usually span multiple generations and often feature everyday people (e.g. Bandamanna saga) and larger-than-life characters (e.g. Egils saga). Key works of this genre have been viewed in modern scholarship as the highest-quality saga-writing. While primarily set in Iceland, the sagas follow their characters' adventures abroad, for example in other Nordic countries, the British Isles, northern France and North America.√çslendingas√∂gur (heimskringla.no) Some well-known examples include Nj√°ls saga, Laxd√¶la saga and Grettis saga. The material of the short tales of Icelanders (√æ√¶ttir or √çslendinga√æ√¶ttir) is similar to √çslendinga s√∂gur, in shorter form, often preserved as episodes about Icelanders in the kings' sagas. Like kings' sagas, when sagas of Icelanders quote verse, as they often do, it is almost invariably skaldic verse. === Contemporary sagas === Contemporary sagas (samt√≠√∞ars√∂gur or samt√≠mas√∂gur) are set in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Iceland, and were written soon after the events they describe. Most are preserved in the compilation Sturlunga saga, from around 1270‚Äì80, though some, such as Arons saga Hj√∂rleifssonar are preserved separately.Sagas of Contemporary History (Blackwell Reference Online) The verse quoted in contemporary sagas is skaldic verse. === Legendary sagas === Legendary sagas (fornaldars√∂gur) blend remote history, set on the Continent before the settlement of Iceland, with myth or legend. Their aim is usually to offer a lively narrative and entertainment. They often portray Scandinavia's pagan past as a proud and heroic history. Some legendary sagas quote verse ‚Äî particularly V«´lsunga saga and Hei√∞reks saga ‚Äî and when they do it is invariably Eddaic verse. Some legendary sagas overlap generically with the next category, chivalric sagas.Matthew, Driscoll, 'Late Prose Fiction (Lygis√∂gur)', in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. by Rory McTurk (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), pp. 190-204. === Chivalric sagas === Chivalric sagas (riddaras√∂gur) are translations of Latin pseudo-historical works and French chansons de geste as well as Icelandic compositions in the same style. Norse translations of Continental romances seem to have begun in the first half of the thirteenth century;J√ºrg Glauser, 'Romance (Translated Riddaras√∂gur)', in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. by Rory McTurk (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), pp. 190-204. Icelandic writers seem to have begun producing their own romances in the late thirteenth century, with production peaking in the fourteenth century and continuing into the nineteenth. While often translated from verse, sagas in this genre almost never quote verse, and when they do it is often unusual in form: for example, Jarlmanns saga ok Hermanns contains the first recorded quotation of a refrain from an Icelandic dance-song,A√∞alhei√∞ur Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir, 'How Icelandic Legends Reflect the Prohibition on Dancing', ARV, 61 (2006), 25‚Äì52. and a metrically irregular riddle in √ûjalar-J√≥ns saga.'√ûjalar-J√≥ns saga', trans. by Philip Lavender, Leeds Studies in English, n.s. 46 (2015), 73-113 (p. 88 n. 34). === Saints' and bishops' sagas === Saints' sagas (heilagra manna s√∂gur) and bishops' sagas (biskupa s√∂gur) are vernacular Icelandic translations and compositions, to a greater or lesser extent influenced by saga-style, in the widespread genres of hagiography and episcopal biographies. The genre seems to have begun in the mid-twelfth century.Margaret Cormack, 'Christian Biography', in A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture, ed. by Rory Mcturk (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), pp. 27-42. ==History== Excerpt from Nj√°ls saga in the manuscript M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k (AM 132 folio 13r) c. 1350. Icelandic sagas are based on oral traditions and much research has focused on what is real and what is fiction within each tale. The accuracy of the sagas is often hotly disputed. Most of the medieval manuscripts which are the earliest surviving witnesses to the sagas were taken to Denmark and Sweden in the seventeenth century, but later returned to Iceland. Classical sagas were composed in the thirteenth century. Scholars once believed that these sagas were transmitted orally from generation to generation until scribes wrote them down in the thirteenth century. However, most scholars now believe the sagas were conscious artistic creations, based on both oral and written tradition. A study focusing on the description of the items of clothing mentioned in the sagas concludes that the authors attempted to create a historic \\"feel\\" to the story, by dressing the characters in what was at the time thought to be \\"old fashioned clothing\\". However, this clothing is not contemporary with the events of the saga as it is a closer match to the clothing worn in the 12th century. It was only recently (start of 20th century) that the tales of the voyages to North America (modern day Canada) were authenticated.Strange Footprints on the Land (Author: Irwin, Constance publisher: Harper & Row, 1980) Most sagas of Icelanders take place in the period 930‚Äì1030, which is called s√∂gu√∂ld (Age of the Sagas) in Icelandic history. The sagas of kings, bishops, contemporary sagas have their own time frame. Most were written down between 1190 and 1320, sometimes existing as oral traditions long before, others are pure fiction, and for some we do know the sources: the author of King Sverrir's saga had met the king and used him as a source.Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages (The Skaldic Project) While sagas are generally anonymous, a distinctive literary movement in the 14th century involves sagas, mostly on religious topics, with identifiable authors and a distinctive Latinate style. Associated with Iceland's northern diocese of H√≥lar, this movement is known as the North Icelandic Benedictine School (Nor√∞lenski Benediktsk√≥linn).Sagaer og √Üventyr; √çsland, 1350-1399, 1350-1399 (Landsb√≥kasafn √çslands) The vast majority of texts referred to today as \\"sagas\\" were composed in Iceland. One exception is √ûi√∞reks saga, translated/composed in Norway; another is Hjalmars saga och Hramers, a post- medieval forgery composed in Sweden. While the term saga is usually associated with medieval texts, sagas ‚Äî particularly in the legendary and chivalric saga genres ‚Äî continued to be composed in Iceland on the pattern of medieval texts into the nineteenth century.Matthew James Driscoll, The Unwashed Children of Eve: The Production, Dissemination and Reception of Popular Literature in Post-Reformation Iceland (Enfield Lock: Hisarlik Press, 1997). === Explanations for saga writing === Icelanders produced a high volume of literature relative to the size of the population. Historians have proposed various theories for the high volume of saga writing. Early, nationalist historians argued that the ethnic characteristics of the Icelanders were conducive to a literary culture, but these types of explanations have fallen out of favor with academics in modern times. It has also been proposed that the Icelandic settlers were so prolific at writing in order to capture their settler history. Historian Gunnar Karlsson does not find that explanation reasonable though, given that other settler communities have not been as prolific as the early Icelanders were. Pragmatic explanations were once also favoured: it has been argued that a combination of readily available parchment (due to extensive cattle farming and the necessity of culling before winter) and long winters encouraged Icelanders to take up writing. More recently, Icelandic saga-production has been seen as motivated more by social and political factors. The unique nature of the political system of the Icelandic Commonwealth created incentives for aristocrats to produce literature, offering a way for chieftains to create and maintain social differentiation between them and the rest of the population. Gunnar Karlsson and Jesse Byock argued that the Icelanders wrote the Sagas as a way to establish commonly agreed norms and rules in the decentralized Icelandic Commonwealth by documenting past feuds, while Iceland's peripheral location put it out of reach of the continental kings of Europe and that those kings could therefore not ban subversive forms of literature. Because new principalities lacked internal cohesion, a leader typically produced Sagas \\"to create or enhance amongst his subjects or followers a feeling of solidarity and common identity by emphasizing their common history and legends\\". Leaders from old and established principalities did not produce any Sagas, as they were already cohesive political units. Later (late thirteenth- and fourteenth-century) saga-writing was motivated by the desire of the Icelandic aristocracy to maintain or reconnect links with the Nordic countries by tracing the ancestry of Icelandic aristocrats to well-known kings and heroes to which the contemporary Nordic kings could also trace their origins. ==Editions and translations== The corpus of Old Norse sagas is gradually being edited in the √çslenzk fornrit series, which covers all the √çslendingas√∂gur and a growing range of other ones. Where available, the √çslenzk fornrit edition is usually the standard one. The standard edition of most of the chivalric sagas composed in Iceland is by Agnete Loth.Agnete Loth, ed., Late Medieval Icelandic Romances, Editiones Arnamagaeanae, series B, 20‚Äì24, 5 vols (Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1962‚Äì65).

On February 6, 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the National Speleological Society. During his career, he established many of the basic safety procedures used in cave and overhead diving today. Exley was also a pioneer of extreme deep scuba diving. For purposes of rescue during cave diving, Exley helped standardize the usage of the \\"octopus\\", a redundant second stage diving regulator that can be used as a backup in the event the diver's primary second stage fails, or alternatively, to allow the diver and his buddy to have simultaneous access to the diver's gas if the buddy has an out-of-gas emergency. The octopus is now considered an essential piece of equipment among virtually all scuba divers, whether caving or in open water. He died at age 45 while trying to set a depth record by diving the world's deepest sinkhole, Mexico's deep, Zacat√≥n, a fresh water cenote. In the book, Diving into Darkness (a story about Dave Shaw and Don Shirley), the author comments: \\"Exley's status in the sport is almost impossible to overstate\\". ==Early life and career outside of diving== Exley began diving in 1965 at the age of 16. That same year he entered his first cave and was hooked on cave diving for the rest of his life. To finance this passion, Exley worked as a mathematics teacher at Suwannee High School in Live Oak, Florida. In spring 1973, Exley served as an aquanaut during an eight-day mission aboard the Hydrolab underwater habitat in the Bahamas.Caverns Measureless to Man, pp. 109‚Äì110. ==Records== Exley was the first in the world to log over 1000 cave dives (at the age of 23); in 29 years of cave diving he made over 4000 dives. Exley had an unusual resistance to nitrogen narcosis, and was one of the few divers to survive a open-water dive on simple compressed air. In acting as a safety diver for two divers trying to set an air-only depth record in 1970, Exley reached in salt water, but could go no deeper due to narcosis and the start of blackout (the two record-depth attempting unconscious divers died just out of reach beneath him, and such air-depth records are no longer sought or recorded). Interview with Exley. During his diving career, he set numerous depth and cave penetration records. Exley is one of only eleven men in the history of technical SCUBA diving to dive below , as well as the first. His carefully planned multistage decompressions from these dives, in open water (not in a decompression tank), sometimes required times of as much as 13.5 hours. However, he never suffered a classic case of decompression sickness in his career. Exley and German cave diver Jochen Hasenmayer became friends and rivals in the 1980s, each repeatedly attempting to break the depth records of the other.Burgess, pp. 320-321. == Death == Exley died, aged 45, on April 6, 1994 while attempting to descend to a depth of over in a freshwater cenote, or sinkhole, called Zacat√≥n in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. He made the dive as part of a dual dive with Jim Bowden, but Bowden aborted his descent early when his gas supply ran low. Exley's body was recovered when his support crew hauled up his unused decompression tanks. It was found that he had looped into the descent line, perhaps to sort out gas issues. His wrist-mounted dive computer read a maximum depth of . The cause of Exley's death could not be determined. Team members concluded the causes \\"...could include stress of HPNS exacerbated by the narcotic effects of nitrogen at that depth\\". The line was also wrapped (deliberately) around Exley's tank valves. Bowden and other experts have theorized that Exley might have done this in anticipation of his own death to prevent any dangerous body recovery operations. The remipede L. exleyi, discovered by Australian cave divers Andrew Poole and Dave Warren in August 1993, was named in honor of Sheck Exley. == Further reading == * ==References* Category:1949 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American cavers Category:American instructional writers Category:American underwater divers Category:Aquanauts Category:Cave diving explorers Category:Pioneering technical divers Category:Place of birth missing Category:Sport deaths in Mexico Category:Underwater diving deaths Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers ","title":"Sheck Exley"},{"id":"300188","text":"Regular script (; Hepburn: kaisho), also called Ê≠£Ê•∑ (), ÁúüÊõ∏ (zhƒìnsh≈´), Ê•∑È´î (k«éit«ê) and Ê≠£Êõ∏ (zh√®ngsh≈´), is the newest of the Chinese script styles (appearing by the Cao Wei dynasty c. 200 AD and maturing stylistically around the 7th century).

At the outbreak of the Second Chechen War he switched sides, offering his service to the Russian government, and later became the President of the Chechen Republic from 5 October 2003, acting as head of administration since July 2000. On 9 May 2004, he was assassinated by Chechen Islamists in Grozny, using a bomb blast during a World War II memorial victory parade. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, who led his father's militia, became one of his successors in March 2007 as the President of the Chechen Republic. ==Early life== Akhmad Abdulkhamidovich Kadyrov was born in Karaganda in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic on 23 August 1951 to a Chechen family that had been expelled from Chechnya during the Stalinist repressions. In April 1957, his family returned to Shalinsky District of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. In 1980, he started studying Islam at Mir-i Arab Madrasah in Bukhara, and followed by studying at Islamic University in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, from 1982 to 1986. In the early 1990s, he returned to Chechnya, and founded the Islam Institute in the village of Kurchaloy. ===First Chechen War=== Following the Chechen declaration of independence, he became a supporter of separatist president Dzhokhar Dudayev. Kadyrov fought prominently in the First Chechen War on the Chechen side as a militia commander. In 1995, he was appointed Chief Mufti of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Following the outbreak of violence between Moscow and Chechen separatists, Kadyrov declared that \\"Russians outnumber Chechens in many times, thus every Chechen would have to kill 150 Russians.\\"The High Cost of Job Security , The Moscow Times, 8 September 2006Profile: Akhmad Kadyrov, China Daily, 10 May 2004 ===Second Chechen War=== Akhmad Kadyrov and Vladimir Putin at a meeting in 2002. While the first war was mainly fought for nationalism, after the de facto independence of Ichkeria, much of the Chechen forces in the second war were jihadis, such as the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya. Kadyrov, as Chief Mufti, was critical of Wahhabism, to which many of the foreign fighters adhered. Early in 1999 he gave a speech before the armed militia telling them that the nation was behind them, that the recent outbreak of violence was the fault of Christian and foreign involvement, and that they should continue on fighting with persistence and trust.Ahmad Kadyrov 1999 speech (with English translation, posted by Islamists, YouTube) But by the autumn of 1999, Kadyrov ‚Äì a leading figure in the resistance movement ‚Äì decided to abandon the insurgency and offered his support to Russian federal forces in Second Chechen War.A Woman Behind the Lines of the War in Chechnya Anne Nivat, PublicAffairs publishers, 2001 (Google Books) Aslan Maskhadov immediately fired him from the Chief Mufti chair, although this decree was never accepted by Kadyrov, who abdicated himself a few months later due to his civilian chairman career. According to James Hughes, Kadyrov's U-turn may have been motivated partly by personal ambition and partly by a concern with the desperate condition of the Chechen population, and was also driven by a fear of the growing sectarian Wahhabi influence on the insurgency. After the Russian forces seized control over Chechnya in July 2000, Kadyrov was appointed acting head of the administration by the Russian president Vladimir Putin.Russia appoints Chechen leader, BBC News, 12 June 2000 On 5 October 2003, he was elected the first President of Chechnya. In this position, he remained mainly pro-Moscow. He also advocated numerous amnesty campaigns for former rebel fighters, who were allowed to join Chechen police and loyalist militia forces if they surrendered. His chief personal bodyguard was Movladi Baisarov. Reportedly, there were at least a dozen assassination attempts against him before the final one. ==Death and legacy== Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Ramzan Kadyrov at the grave of Akhmad Kadyrov in June 2012 On 9 May 2004, an explosion ripped through the VIP seating at the Dinamo football stadium during a mid-morning Soviet Victory Day parade in the capital city of Grozny, instantly killing Akhmad Kadyrov.

The bomb was said to have been built into the concrete of a supporting column during recent repairs. The Islamist Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev later claimed that he had paid $50,000 for the attack. Akhmad Kadyrov had four children, two daughters (Zargan and Zulay) and two sons.

Namco was founded by Masaya Nakamura on June 1, 1955, as , beginning as a producer and distributor of coin-operated amusement rides. After reorganizing to Nakamura Manufacturing Company in 1959, a partnership with Walt Disney Productions provided the company with the resources to expand its operations. It entered the video game industry after acquiring the struggling Japanese division of Atari in 1974, distributing games such as Breakout in Japan. The company renamed itself to Namco in 1977 and published Gee Bee, its first original video game, a year later. Namco's first major hit was the fixed shooter Galaxian in 1979. It was followed by Pac-Man in 1980, the best-selling arcade game of all time. Namco prospered during the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s, releasing popular titles such as Galaga, Xevious, and Pole Position. Namco entered the home console market in 1984 with conversions of its arcade games for the Nintendo Family Computer. Its American division acquired a stake in Atari Games in 1985, before selling it in 1987 due to disagreements between the two companies. Arguments over licensing contracts with Nintendo lead Namco to producing games for competing platforms, such as the Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, and PlayStation. The company continued its success with games such as Ridge Racer, Tekken, and Taiko no Tatsujin. Namco endured numerous financial difficulties in the late 1990s and 2000s as a result of the struggling Japanese economy and diminishing arcade market. In 2005, Namco merged with Bandai to form Namco Bandai Holdings, a Japanese entertainment conglomerate. It continued producing games until it was merged into Namco Bandai Games in 2006. Namco produced several multi-million-selling game franchises, such as Pac-Man, Galaxian, Tekken, and Ridge Racer. It operated video arcades and amusement parks globally, and also produced films, toys, cafe chains, and arcade cabinets. Namco is remembered for its unique corporate model, its importance to the industry, and its advancements in technology. Its successor, Bandai Namco Entertainment, continues to use the Namco brand for its video arcades and other entertainment products. ==History== ===Origins and acquisition of Atari Japan (1955‚Äì1977)=== Two mechanical rocking horses installed by Nakamura Seisakusho in 1955. On June 1, 1955, Japanese businessman Masaya Nakamura founded Nakamura Seisakusho Co., Ltd. in Ikegami, Tokyo. The son of a shotgun repair business owner, the struggling post-World War II economy in Japan made him unable to find work. Nakamura established his own company after his father's business saw success with producing pop cork guns. Beginning with only US$1,2000, Nakamura spent the money on two hand- cranked rocking horses that he installed on the roof garden of a Matsuya department store in Yokohama. The horses were loved by children and turned a decent profit for Nakamura, who began designing other kinds of amusement games such as goldfish scoopers and picture viewing machines. The business underwent a reorganization in 1959, when it changed its name to Nakamura Manufacturing Company. Noticing Nakamura's successful business, the Mitsukoshi department store chain approached him with the idea of designing a children's ride for the roof of its store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. He designed a moving train named Roadaway Race, which was a hit and lead to Mitsuokishi requesting similar rides for all of its stores. Along with Taito, Rosen Enterprises, and Nihon Goraku Bussan, the Nakamura Manufacturing Company became one of Japan's leading amusement companies. When Roadaway Race proved successful, it began work on other mechanical games at a similar scale. The first of these was Torpedo Launcher, a submarine warfare shooting gallery later titled Periscope. While its games sold well, Nakamura Manufacturing lacked the manufacturing lines and distribution networks that its competitors had, which made the production of games longer and expensive. Because other manufacturers had exclusive rights to do so, the company was unable to place its games inside stores. Nakamura Manufacturing opened its own production plant in 1967, moving its corporate office to a four-story building in Osaka. The company secured a deal with Walt Disney Productions to produce children's rides in the likenesses of its characters, a move that allowed the business to expand its operations and become a driving force in the Japanese coin-op market. Its other products included Ultraman-themed gun games and pinball tables branded with Osomatsu-kun characters. The logo to Nakamura Seisakusho In 1970, Nakamura Manufacturing released its first arcade game, a driving game titled Racer. The name Namco, an abbreviation of Nakamura Manufacturing Company, was inducted in 1971 as a brand for several of its machines. The company grew to having ten employees, which included Nakamura himself. It established a partnership with Kansei Seiki Seisakusho (Kasko), one of the largest amusement game providers in Japan; (Translation by Shmuplations. ) Nakamura Manufacturing was given the rights to distribute several of Kasco's games to other parts of the country. It saw continued success with its arcade games, which had become commonplace in bowling allies and grocery stores. A deal with Honda was secured to produce a motion-based ride based on its Dax line of minibikes. The company also established a robotics division to produce robots for entertainment centers and festivals, such as those that distributed pamphlets, ribbon making machines, and a robot named Putan that solved pre- built mazes. In August 1973, American game company Atari began establishing a series of divisions in Asia, one of which was named Atari Japan. Its president, Tanashi Takumi, approached Nakamura in early 1974 in regards to having his business become the distributor of Atari games across Japan. Nakamura, already planning global expansion following his company‚Äôs success, agreed to the deal. However, in part due to employee theft, Atari Japan was a financial disaster and nearly collapsed in its first few years of operation. When Takumi stopped showing up to work, the company was handed to Hideyuki Nakajima, a former employee of the Japan Art Paper Company. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, whose company was already struggling in America, chose to sell the Japanese division. His fixer, Ron Gordon, was given the task of finding the buyer for Atari Japan. After being turned down by Sega and Taito, Gordon‚Äôs offer was accepted by Nakamura for US$1.18 million. However, Nakamura informed Bushnell his company was unable to pay the money by the deadline; with no other takers for Atari Japan, Bushnell ultimately allowed Nakamura to only pay $550,000 and then $250,000 a year for three years. The acquisition allowed Nakamura Manufacturing to distribute Atari games across Japan, and made it the country's sixth-largest video game company by revenue. The Atari Japan purchase was not an immediate success, in part due to the medal game fad of the 1970s. While Nakamura Manufacturing saw some success with imports such as Kee Games's Tank, the Japanese video game industry's decrease in popularity did not make them as profitable as hoped. The market become more viable once restrictions on medal games were imposed by the Japanese government in 1976, as Nakamura Manufacturing began returning higher profits; its import of Atari's Breakout was so successful that it lead to rampant piracy in the industry. By the end of the year, Nakamura Manufacturing was one of Japan's leading video game companies. ===Galaxian, Pac-Man, and arcade success (1977‚Äì1984)=== Nakamura Manufacturing changed its corporate name to Namco in June 1977. It opened a division in Hong Kong named Namco Enterprises Asia, which maintained video arcades and amusement centers. As Namco's presence in Japan was steadily rising, Nakajima suggested to Nakamura that he open a division in the United States to increase worldwide brand awareness. Nakamura agreed to the proposal, and on September 1, 1978, established Namco America in Sunnyvale, California. With Nakajima as its vice president, Namco America's aim was to import games and license them to companies such as Atari and Bally Manufacturing. Its first import was Shoot Away, an electro-mechanical clay shooting game that proved successful in Japan. As the video game industry prospered in Japan during the 1970s with the release of Taito's Space Invaders, Namco turned its attention towards making its own video games. While its licensed Atari games were still profitable, sales were decreasing and the quality of the hardware used began deteriorating. Per the recommendation of company engineer Shigekazu Ishimura, the company retrofitted its ≈åta manufacturing facility into a small game division and purchased old stock computers from NEC for employees to study. Namco released Gee Bee, its first original game, in October 1978. Designed by new hire Toru Iwatani, it is a video pinball game that incorporates elements from Breakout and similar \\"block breaker\\" clones. Gee Bee fell short of the company's sales expectations and was unable to compete with games such as Space Invaders. However, it allowed Namco to gain a stronger foothold in the video game market. In 1979, Namco published its first major hit Galaxian, one of the first video games to incorporate RGB color graphics, score bonuses, and a tilemap hardware model. Galaxian is considered historically important for these innovations and mechanics built off of those in Space Invaders. It was released outside Japan by Midway Games, the video game division of Bally, where it became one of its best-selling titles and formed a relationship between it and Namco. Pac-Man has been Namco's mascot since the character's introduction in 1980. The space shooter genre became ubiquitous by the end of the decade, with games such as Galaxian and Space Invaders becoming commonplace in Japanese amusement centers. As video games often depicted the killing of enemies and shooting of targets, the industry possessed a predominately male playerbase. Toru Iwatani began work on a maze video game that was targeted primarily towards women, with simplistic gameplay and recognizable characters. Alongside a team of nine others, he created a game named Puck Man, where players controlled a character that had to eat dots in an enclosed maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursued them. Iwatani based its gameplay on women eating sweets and desserts, and designed its characters with soft colors and simplistic facial features. Puck Man was test-marketed in Japan on May 22, 1980 and released in July. It was only a modest success; players were more accustom to the shooting gameplay of Galaxian as opposed to Puck Mans visually distinctive characters and gameplay style. In North America, it was released as Pac-Man in December 1980. Selling over 400,000 arcade units total, Pac-Man is the best-selling arcade game of all time. Its simplicity and design has made it a fixture in popular culture and spawned a multi-million-selling franchise. Namco regularly released several successful games throughout the early 1980s. Pitch In, an electro-mechanical softball simulator from 1980, was a considerable success in Japan. It published Galaga, the follow-up to Galaxian, in 1981 to critical acclaim, usurping its predecessor in popularity with its fast-paced action and power-ups. 1982 saw the release of Pole Position, a racing game that is the first to use a real racetrack (the Fuji Speedway) and laid the foundations for the genre itself, and Dig Dug, a maze chaser that allowed players to create their own mazes. Namco's biggest post-Pac-Man success was the vertical- scrolling shooter Xevious in 1983, designed by new-hire Masanobu Endo. Xeviouss early usage of pre-rendered visuals, boss fights, and a cohesive world made it an astounding success in Japan, recording record-breaking sales figures that hadn't been seen since Space Invaders. The game's success lead to merchandise, tournament play, and the first video game soundtrack album. The same year, Namco released Mappy, an early side-scrolling platformer, and the Pole Position sequel Pole Position II. Endo went on to design The Tower of Druaga a year later, one of the first hugely successful action role-playing games. Druaga popularized the idea of note sharing and video game guidebooks, influencing games such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda. 1984 also saw the release of Pac-Land, a Pac-Man-themed platform game that paved the way for similar games such as Super Mario Bros., and Gaplus, a moderately successful update to Galaga. The success of Namco's arcade games prompted it to launch its own print publication, Namco Community Magazine NG, to allow its fans to connect with developers. ===Success with home consoles (1984‚Äì1989)=== Namco became one of the first third-party developers for the Famicom, with their arcade game ports increasing system sales. By 1984, the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) became the leading video game system in Japan, having sold over 1.2 million units and outperforming its competitor, the SG-1000. The console's success generated considerable demand from consumers, who often requested for new software; at the time, the Famicom possessed 16 games, all first-party releases. As a way to curb demand, Nintendo established a licensee program that allowed third-party companies to produce games for the Famicom in exchange for a cut of the profit. As the company showed interest in developing Famicom games during its launch, Namco became one of Nintendo's first third- party developers, along with Hudson Soft. Namco was given several preferential terms for being among the first to sign on, such as the ability to produce its own cartridges. Namco established a subsidiary named in 1984 which was to act as its console game division. It released its first four titles in September: Galaxian, Pac-Man, Xevious, and Mappy. Xevious sold over 1.5 million copies and became the Famicom's first \\"killer app\\". Namco's arcade game ports were considered high-quality and helped increase sales of the console. Namcot also began releasing games for the MSX, a popular Japanese computer. Namcot was financially successful and became an important pillar within the company. When Namco moved its headquarters to ≈åta, Tokyo in 1985, it used the profits generated from the Famicom conversion of Xevious to fund its construction (the building was nicknamed \\"Xevious\\" as a result). Namcot also began development of original software, such as Star Luster. The Talking Aid, a speech impairment device, was part of the company's attempts in venturing into other markets. When the North American video game crash concluded in 1985 with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Atari had effectively collapsed. After enduring numerous financial difficulties and losing its control in the industry, parent Warner Communications split the company into two entities. The first was Atari Corporation, which dealt with personal computers and video game consoles. The second was Atari Games, which produced arcade games and computer software. Commodore International founder Jack Tramiel acquired Atari Corporation while Warner struggled to find a buyer for Atari Games. Against the advice of its accountants at Price Waterhouse, Namco America purchased a 60% stake in Atari Games on February 4, 1985. The acquisition gave Namco the exclusive rights to distribute Atari games in Japan. Nakamura began losing interest and patience in Atari Games not long after the acquisition. As he started viewing Atari as a competitor to Namco, he was hesitant to pour additional funds and resources into the company. Nakamura also disliked having to share ownership with Warner Communications, fearing it could lead to him losing control of Atari Games and Namco going under. Nakajima grew frustrated with Nakamura's attempts at marketing Atari video games in Japan, and had constant disagreements with him over which direction to take the company. Viewing its acquisition as being largely unsuccessful, in 1987 Namco America sold the majority of its shares to Warner, while still retaining its right to release Atari games in Japan. The remaining portion was sold to Nakajima and a group of others;, Nakajima resigned from Namco America and became president of Atari Games. He established Tengen, a publisher that protested against Nintendo's licensing restrictions for the Nintendo Entertainment System by producing several unlicensed games. As Namco lacked a proper home console division in the United States, it gave Tengen permission to release some of its Famicom games like Pac-Man overseas. Namco- branded arcades were financially successful in Japan and the United States. In Japan, Namco continued to see expeditious growth. It published Pro Baseball: Family Stadium for the Famicom, which was critically acclaimed and sold over 2.5 million copies. Its sequel, Pro Baseball: Family Stadium '87, sold an additional two million. In 1986, Namco entered the restaurant industry by acquiring the Italian Tomato cafe chain. It also released Sweet Land, a popular candy-themed prize machine. One of Namco's biggest hits from the era was the racing game Final Lap from 1987. It is credited as the first arcade game to allow multiple machines to be connected‚Äîor \\"linked\\"‚Äîtogether to allow for additional players. Final Lap was one of the most-profitable coin-operated games of the era in Japan, remaining towards the top of sales charts for the rest of the decade. Namco's continued success in arcades provided its arcade division with the revenue and resources needed to fund its research and development (R&D;) divisions. Among the first creations of Namco's R&D; teams was the helicopter shooter Metal Hawk in 1988, fitted in a motion-based arcade cabinet. Its high development costs prevented it from being massed-produced. While most of its efforts were commercially unsuccessful, Namco grew interested in motion-based arcade games and began designing those at a larger scale. In 1988, Namco became involved in film production when it distributed the film Mirai Ninja in theaters, with a tie-in video game coinciding with its release. Namco also developed the beat 'em up Splatterhouse, one of the earliest \\"violent\\" video games for its fixture on gore and dismemberment. Namco unveiled its System 21 arcade system, one of the earliest arcade boards to utilize true 3D polygonal graphics, in early 1989. Nicknamed \\"Polygonizer\\", the company demonstrated its power through the Formula One racer Winning Run. With an arcade cabinet that shook and swayed the player as they drove, the game was seen as \\"a breakthrough product in term of programming technique\\" and garnered significant attention from the press. Winning Run was commercially successful, convincing Namco to continue researching 3D video game hardware. Video arcades under the Namco banner continued opening up in Japan and overseas, such as the family-friendly Play City Carrot and mature-oriented Plabo chains. ===Expansion into other markets (1989‚Äì1994)=== Namco saw continued success in the consumer game market as a result of the \\"Famicom boom\\" in the late 1980s. (Translation by Shmuplations. ) By 1989, sales of games for the Famicom and NES accounted for 40% of its annual revenue. However, during the same time frame, the company's licensing contract with Nintendo expired; when Namco attempted to renew its license, Nintendo chose to revoke many of the preferential terms it originally possessed. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi insisted that all companies, including Namco, had to follow the same guidelines. The revocation of Namco's terms enraged Nakamura, who announced the company would abandon Nintendo hardware and begin production of games for competing systems such as the PC Engine. Executives resisted the idea, fearing it would severely impact the company financially. Against Nakamura's protest, Namco signed Nintendo's new licensee contract anyway. While it continued to produce games for Nintendo hardware, most of Namco's quality releases came from the PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive. Namco's unreleased 16-bit console had hardware comparable to the Nintendo Super Famicom. In 1989, it was reported that Namco was underway with developing its own video game console to compete against companies such as Nintendo and NEC. Electronic Gaming Monthly claimed that the system, which was nearing completion, featured hardware comparable to the then-upcoming Nintendo Super Famicom. According to company engineer Yutaka Isokawa, it was produced to compete against the Mega Drive, a 16-bit console by Namco's arcade rival Sega. With the console industry being crowded by other competing systems, publications were unsure how well it would perform in the market. While the console was never released, it allowed Namco to familiarize itself with designing home video game hardware. Tadashi Manabe replaced Nakamura as president of Namco on May 2, 1990. Manabe, who had been the company's representative director since 1981, was tasked with strengthening relationships and teamwork ethics of management. A company reorganization lead to Namco America acquiring Atari Operations from Atari Games, allowing Namco to operate video arcades across the United States. Namco Hometek was established as the home console game division of Namco America; the latter's relations with Atari Games and Tengen made the company ineligible to become a Nintendo third-party licensee, instead relying on publishers such as Bandai to release its games in North America. In Japan, Namco's R&D; division finished development of two theme park attractions, which were demonstrated at the 1990 International Garden and Greenery Exposition (Expo '90): Galaxian3: Project Dragoon, a 3D rail shooter that supported 28 players, and a dark ride based on The Tower of Druaga. As part of the company's idea of \\"hyperentertainment\\" video games, Namco engineers had drafted ideas for a possible theme park based on Namco's experience with designing and operating indoor play areas and entertainment complexes. Both attractions were commercially successful and among the most popular of Expo 90's exhibitions. In arcades, Namco released Starblade, a 3D rail shooter noteworthy for its cinematic presentation. In February 1992, Namco opened its own theme park, Wonder Eggs, in the Futakotamagawa Time Spark area in Setagaya, Tokyo. Described as an \\"urban amusement center\\", Wonder Eggs was the first amusement park operated by a video game company. In addition to Galaxian3 and The Tower of Druaga, the park featured carnival games, carousals, motion simulators, and Fighter Camp, the first flight simulator available to the public. The park saw regularly high attendance numbers; 500,000 visitors attended in its first few months of operation and over one million by the end of the year. Namco's foray in the amusement park business was in response to its high net income and annual revenue from the end of its fiscal year. The park contributed to Namco's 34% increase in revenue by December 1992. A Ridge Racer Full Scale arcade machine. As his anxiety disorder prevented from properly running the company, Manabe resigned as president on May 1, 1992. As Nakamura returning to his role as Namco president, Manabe instead served as the company's vice chairman until his death in 1994. Namco's arcade division saw resounding success with the release of Ridge Racer in 1993, a racing game that demonstrated the capabilities of the company's System 22 board. With its usage of drifting and fully textured 3D graphics, Ridge Racer became one of Namco's most-successful games and is seen as a milestone in 3D computer graphics. The company followed its success with Tekken, a 3D fighting game, a year later. Designed by Virtua Fighter co-creator Seiichi Ishii, Tekkens wide array of playable characters and consistent framerate made it outperform Sega's game in popularity, and launched a multi-million-selling franchise as a result. The company continued expanding its operations, particularly within its overseas divisions; Namco America acquired Atari Operations in July 1993 and renamed it Namco Operations, allowing the company to operate video arcades across the United States. Further acquisitions were made throughout the year, such as the Aladdin's Castle chain from Bally Entertainment. In December, Namco of Japan acquired Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest-surviving film studio that at the time was undergoing bankruptcy procedures. The purchase allowed Nikkatsu to utilize Namco's computer graphics hardware for its films, while Namco was able to get a niche in the Japanese film industry. ===Relationship with Sony (1994‚Äì1998)=== Namco was one of the first third-party supporters for the PlayStation, and helped the system achieve success in its early years. In early 1994, Sony announced that it was developing its own video game console, the 32-bit PlayStation. The console began as a collaboration between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-based peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Fearing that Sony would assume control of the entire project, Nintendo silently scrapped the add-on. Sony chose to refocus its efforts in designing the PlayStation in-house as its own console. As it lacked the resources to produce its own games, Sony called for the support of third-party companies to develop PlayStation software. Namco, frustrated with Nintendo and Sega's licensing conditions for its consoles, agreed to support the PlayStation and became its first third-party developer. The company began work on a conversion of Ridge Racer, its most-popular arcade game at the time. The PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, with Ridge Racer as a launch title. Sony moved 100,000 units on launch day alone; publications attributed Ridge Racer to the PlayStation's early success, giving it an edge over its competitor the Sega Saturn. cf. cf. For a time, it was the best- selling PlayStation game in Japan. Namcot was consolidated into Namco in 1995; its final game was a PlayStation conversion of Tekken, published in March in Japan and in November worldwide. As the arcade version ran on Namco's System 11 board‚Äîbased on raw PlayStation hardware‚Äîthe home console version was able to be a near-perfect arcade conversion. Tekken is the first PlayStation game to sell one million copies, with Namco receiving a Guinness World Record for this achievement. Sony recognized Namco's quality arcade conversions for helping the PlayStation gain ground in the market, leading to a strong corporate relationship between the two companies. Early promotional material for the PlayStation adopted the tagline \\"PlayStation: Powered by Namco\\", while several of Namco's arcade boards were designed after PlayStation hardware. Its experience with designing its failed 16-bit console allowed the company to produce several peripherals for the PlayStation, such as the GunCon, the NeGcon, and the Namco Arcade Stick. Namco focused primarily on the PlayStation for the remainder of the decade; while it had signed contracts to produce games for systems such as the Sega Saturn and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, these were later dropped in favor of Sony. In December, the company released Time Crisis in arcades, a lightgun shooter notable for allowing players to duck behind objects to avoid enemy fire. Namco Cybertainment acquired the Edison Brothers Stores chain in April 1996, and in Japan Namco opened its Wonder Tower amusement center in Kyoto. In September 1997, Namco announced it would begin development of games for the Nintendo 64, a console struggling to receive support from third-party developers. Namco signed a contract with Nintendo that allowed the company to produce two games for the console: Famista 64, a version of its Family Stadium series, and an untitled RPG for the 64DD peripheral. The RPG was never released while the 64DD went on to become a commercial failure. In October 1998, which one publication described as being \\"the most stunning alliance this industry has seen in a long while\\", Namco announced a partnership deal with long-time rival Sega to bring some of its titles to the newly unveiled Dreamcast. As Namco primarily developed games for Sony hardware, and were among the biggest third-party developers for the PlayStation, the announcement surprised news outlets. For its PlayStation- based System 12 arcade board, Namco released the weapon-based fighting game Soulcalibur in 1998. Its 1999 Dreamcast port, which features multiple graphical enhancements and new gamemodes, is an early instance of a console game being better than its arcade version. Soulcalibur sold over one million units, won multiple awards, and contributed to the early success of the Dreamcast. ===Financial decline and restructuring (1998‚Äì2005)=== As a result of the Japanese Recession affecting the demand for video games, specifically arcade games, Namco experienced decline in its sales by 1998. While it saw success with titles such as Tekken 3, the company's arcade game division slumped by 21% in March as sales sharply declined. Namco Cybertainment underwent Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August, being forced to close several hundreds of its under-performing arcades across the United States. According to its 1998 annual report, Namco reported a 26.3% drop in its net sales, which it attributed to low consumer spending. In light of its struggling finances, the company continued expanding operations. In October 1999 it acquired the action-RPG game developer Monolith Soft, known for series such as Xenosaga, and entered the Japanese mobile phone market by releasing ports of games like Galaxian and Pac-Man for i-Mode cellular phones. In February 2000, Namco introduced the Cyber Lead II arcade cabinet, which featured PlayStation and Dreamcast VMU memory card slots that allowed players to transfer game data between systems. Taiko no Tatsujin was one of Namco's biggest hits during the 2000s. During a meeting with industry analysts on October 25, 2000, Namco supposedly hinted at a major financial loss. On October 29, Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported that it experienced a group net loss of 2.1 billion; as the company was known for its consistently high sales earnings, the announcement spread fear among analysts. Claiming that the struggling Japanese economy and dwindling coin-operated game market were to blame, Namco announced it would begin scaling back its financial forecasts to accommodate its losses. As the Japanese game market began to decline during the mid to late-1990s, its effect started seeping into the global arcade game industry as well. The Wonder Eggs park, which by that point had seen an attendance number of six million visitors, was closed on December 31, 2000. Following Sega and Taito's lead, Namco began closing many of its under- performing video arcades. While its arcade cabinets and games were still proving profitable, sales were lower than expected. In February, it reported further losses from a securities appraisal loss, restructuring Nikkatsu, and writing off a pension fund shortfall, which costed the company over 6.1 billion. By March 31, a total of 6.5 billion had been lost, which the company blamed on diminishing markets and high research and development costs. In response to its falling sales, Namco laid off 250 employees‚Äîwhich it referred to as \\"early retirement\\"‚Äîand began finding ways to restructure itself and increase income. In addition to announcing production of games for Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox, company management was shifted while its arcade division underwent reorganization. Namco saw strong success with the release of Taiko no Tatsujin, a popular drum-based rhythm game. The company entered the pachinko industry with machines based on its intellectual properties including Pac-Man, Xevious, and Gator Panic. Nakamura resigned from his position as Namco president later in the year, instead taking on a ceremonial role in its management. Particularly with its consumer game division, Namco began seeing improvement within its sales. The PlayStation 2 conversion of Taiko no Tatsujin, bundled with a drum controller named the Tatacon, was among its most-successful products. In addition to co-developing the Triforce, an arcade system board designed after the internals of the GameCube, Namco established a business alliance with Nintendo that allowed the two companies to collaborate with each other on GameCube games. Projects under this alliance include Star Fox Assault, Pac-Man Vs., Mr. Driller Drill Land, Mario Superstar Baseball, and the GameCube ‚Äì Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral. The company's overseas operations had seen considerably less positive results, as Namco America and Namco Hometek both underwent a corporate restructuring in September in result of decreasing profits. Namco's disappointment in the quality of Hometek's releases led to the latter being stripped of its research and development operations. In April 2003, Namco offered to merge its operations with Sega, who were struggling financially following the commercial failure of the Dreamcast. The merge would have established a new company named Sega Namco and become the largest Japanese video game developer, surpassing Nintendo, Konami, and Square Enix in revenue. Namco claimed that a merge was necessary in order for the company to remain competitive in the industry, and believed that Sega's development teams and catalog of recognizable properties would prove beneficial for both parties. When Namco applied its offer, Sega already announced its intent to merge with pachinko manufacturer Sammy Corporation. After a failed attempt to overturn the merge, Namco withdrew its offer the same day Sega stated it turned down the offer to merge with Sammy. Its Japanese division in March released the sleeper hit Katamari Damacy, which stemmed from a school project created at the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory, and opened a Korean office in August where it hoped to bring significant expansion to the country's game market. Shigeichi Ishimura, one of Namco's board members, became company president on April 1, 2005; Nakamura retained his role as chairman. In celebration of its 50th anniversary, Namco released NamCollection, a compilation of some of its most-popular PlayStation game, for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. Its Namja Town theme park opened Riraku no Mori, a companion park that held massage parlors for visitors; Namco believed it would help make relaxation a source of entertainment. In the arcade industry, the company released The Idolmaster; its unique cross between rhythm games and life simulations made it successful in Japan, resulting in the creation of a multi-million-grossing franchise. ===Bandai takeover and dissolution (2005‚Äì2006)=== Namco Bandai Holdings was established on September 25, 2005, combining the corporate assets of Namco and Bandai. In early 2005, Namco instigated talks with Bandai‚Äìa toy and anime company‚Äìover the two merging operations. Bandai showed interest in Namco's quality game development skills, and believed combining this with its wide library of profitable franchises, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, could increase their competitiveness. Both companies had discussed the previous year about a possible business alliance, but Bandai felt that Namco's similar business ideas and concepts could allow the two to join forces. The deal was opposed by Nakamura and advisors within Namco's content development divisions, as neither felt Bandai's corporate model and preference on marketing over quality would work well with Namco's design philosophies and \\"agricultural\\" work culture. However, as its financial state continued deteriorating and its executives were concerned the business wouldn't be able to operate independently, Namco believed a merge was necessary in order to survive the current industry landscape. Bandai's offer was accepted on May 2, with both companies saying in a joint statement that their difficulties in securing substantial profits were the reason for the merge. The business takeover, where Bandai acquired Namco for $1.7 billion, was finalized on September 29. An entertainment conglomerate named Namco Bandai Holdings was established the same day; while their executive departments merged, Bandai and Namco became independently-operating subsidiaries of the new umbrella holding company. Kyushiro Takagi, Namco's vice chairman, was appointed chairman and director of Namco Bandai Holdings. The stock swap was valued at 458 billion upon its completion, making Namco Bandai the third-largest Japanese game company after Nintendo and Sega Sammy Holdings. However, Namco Bandai's impatience to move forward with the merge and clashing corporate cultures between both parties resulted in a 30 billion deficit. As its parent company was preparing for a full business integration, Namco continued its normal operations, such as releasing Ridge Racer 6 as a launch title for the newly-unveiled Xbox 360 in October and collaborating with Nintendo to produce the arcade game Mario Kart Arcade GP. The company honored the 25th anniversary of its Pac-Man series with the Nintendo DS puzzle game Pac-Pix, and entered the massively multiplayer online game market with Tales of Eternia Online, an action role-playing game based on its Tales franchise. Former Namco Bandai Games (Bandai Namco Entertainment) headquarters in Shinagawa, Tokyo. On January 4, 2006, Namco Hometek was merged with Bandai Games‚ÄîBandai America's consumer game division‚Äîto create Namco Bandai Games America, absorbing Namco America's subsidiaries and completing Namco and Bandai's merge in North America. Namco's console game, business program, mobile phone, and research facility divisions were merged with Bandai's console division to create a new company, Namco Bandai Games, on March 31, as Namco was effectively dissolved. The Namco brand name was repurposed for a new Namco Bandai subsidiary the same day, which absorbed its predecessor's amusement facility and theme park operations. Namco's European division was folded into Namco Bandai Networks Europe on January 1, 2007, as it was reorganized into the company's mobile game and website division. Until February 2014, Namco Bandai Games used the Namco branding on several of its video games as a means to signify its legacy. The Namco Cybertainment division was renamed Namco Entertainment in January 2012, and to Namco USA in 2015. A division of Bandai Namco Holdings USA, Namco USA works with chains such as Walmart to host its video arcades in their respective locations. As of 2018, Namco USA, Namco Enterprises Asia, and Namco Funscape‚Äîthe amusement facility division of Bandai Namco Europe‚Äîremain the last companies within the holding company to use the original Namco trademark. The second Namco company was renamed Bandai Namco Amusement on April 1, 2018 following a corporate restructuring by its parent company. Amusement took over the arcade game development branch of Namco Bandai Games, which renamed itself to Bandai Namco Entertainment in 2015. Bandai Namco Holdings and its subsidiaries continue to use the Namco name for a variety of products, including mobile phone applications, streaming programs, and its line of eSports-focused arcade centers in Japan. ==Legacy== Namco was one of the world's largest producers of video arcade games, having published over 280 titles since 1978. Many of its games are considered some of the greatest of all time, including Pac-Man, Galaga, Xevious, Ridge Racer, Tekken 3, and Katamari Damacy. Pac-Man is considered one of the most-important video games ever made, having helped transition the industry from Space Invaders clone games to encouraging originality and creative thinking. Namco was recognized for the game's worldwide success in 2005 by Guinness World Records; by that timeframe, Pac- Man sold over 400,000 arcade units and grossed over $1 billion in quarters globally. In an obituary for Masaya Nakamura in 2017, Nintendo Lifes Damien McFerran wrote: \\"without Namco and Pac-Man, the video game arena would be very different today.\\" Namco's corporate philosophy and innovation have received recognition from publications. In a 1994 retrospective on the company, a writer for Edge described Namco as being \\"among the true pioneers of the coin- op business\\", a developer with a catalog of well-received and historically significant titles. The writer believed that Namco's success lied in its forward-thinking and firmness on quality, which they argued made it stand out from other developers. A staff member of Edges sister publication, Next Generation, wrote in 1998: \\"In a world where today's stars almost always become tomorrow's has-beens, Namco has produced consistently excellent games throughout most of its history.\\" The writer credited the company's connections with its players and its influential releases, namely Pac-Man, Xevious, and Winning Run, as the keys to its success in a rapidly changing industry. Publications and industry journalists have identified Namco's importance to the industry. Writers for Ultimate Future Games and Official UK PlayStation Magazine have credited the company and its games to the early success of the PlayStation, one of the most iconic entertainment brands worldwide. In addition, Official UK PlayStation Magazine wrote that Namco serves as \\"the godfather of game developers\\", and one of the most important video game developers in history. Staff for IGN in 1997 claimed that Namco represents the industry as a whole, with titles like Pac-Man and Galaga being associated with and representing video games. They wrote: \\"Tracing the history of Namco is like tracing the history of the industry itself. From its humble beginnings on the roof of a Yokohama department store, to the impending release of Tekken 3 for the PlayStation, Namco has always stayed ahead of the pack.\\" In 2012, IGN listed Namco among the greatest video game companies of all time, writing that many of its games‚Äîincluding Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Ridge Racer‚Äîwere of consistent quality and helped define the industry as a whole. ==See also== *List of Namco games ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:1955 establishments in Japan Category:Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences members Category:Amusement companies of Japan Category:Bandai Namco Holdings Category:Companies disestablished in 2006 Category:Defunct video game companies of Japan Category:Japanese brands Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Japan Category:Software companies based in Tokyo Category:Video game development companies Category:Video game companies established in 1955 Category:Video game companies of Japan Category:Video game publishers ","title":"Namco"},{"id":"300210","text":"The Armed Islamic Group (GIA, from ; ), was one of the two main Islamist insurgents groups that fought the Algerian government and army in the Algerian Civil War. It was created from smaller armed groups following the 1992 military coup and arrest and internment of thousands of officials in the Islamist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party after that party won the first round of parliamentary elections in December 1991. It was led by a succession of amirs (commanders) who were killed or arrested one after another. Unlike the other main armed groups, the Mouvement Islamique Arme (MIA) and later the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), in its pursuit of an Islamic state the GIA sought not to pressure the government into concessions but to destabilise and overthrow it, to \\"purge the land of the ungodly\\".Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.260, 266 Its slogan inscribed on all communiques was: \\"no agreement, no truce, no dialogue\\". The group desired to create \\"an atmosphere of general insecurity\\" and employed kidnapping, assassination, and bombings, including car bombs and targeted not only security forces but civilians. Between 1992 and 1998, the GIA conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation (notably those in Bentalha and Rais). It attacked and killed other Islamists that had left the GIA or attempted to negotiate with the government. It also targeted foreign civilians living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriate men and women in the country. The group established a presence outside Algeria, in France, Belgium, Britain, Italy and the United States, and launched terror attacks in France in 1994 and 1995. The \\"undisputed principal Islamist force\\" in Algeria in 1994, by 1996, militants were deserting \\"in droves\\", alienated by its execution of civilians and Islamists leaders.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.269-70 In 1999, a government amnesty law motivated large numbers of jihadis to \\"repent\\". The remnants of the GIA proper were hunted down over the next two years, leaving a splinter group the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC),Hugh Roberts, The Battlefield Algeria, 1988-2002: Studies in a Broken Polity, Verso: London 2003, p. 269: \\"Hassan Hattab's GSPC which has condemned the GIA's indiscriminate attacks on civilians and, since going it alone, has tended to revert to the classic MIA-AIS strategy of confining its attacks to guerrilla forces\\", which announced its support for Al-Qaeda in October 2003. The extent to which the group was infiltrated and manipulated by Algerian security services is disputed. The GIA was and is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Algeria and France. The GIA remains a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. ==History== ===Founding=== According to Algerian veterans of the Afghan jihad who founded the GIA, the idea of forming an armed group to fight jihad against the Algerian government was developed not after the coup but in 1989 after leaders of the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA) of Mustafa Bouyali, were freed from prison, but was not acted on due to the spectacular electoral political success of the FIS.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.257 Early in 1992, Mansour Meliani, a former aid to Bouyali, along with many \\"Afghans\\", broke with his former friend Abdelkader Heresay and left the MIA (Islamic Armed Movement), founding his own Jihadi group around July 1992. Meliani was arrested in July and executed in August 1993. Meliani was replaced by Mohammed Allal, aka Moh Leveilley, who was killed on 1 September 1992 by the Algerian military when they attacked a meeting held to unify command of the jihad.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.259 The economic state of Algeria was a dire situation, where the majority of the young people were unemployed. In Algeria, there was no middle class, there were the rich and there were the poor, leaving many young people no hope for the future. The GIA was able to act as a place for young men to feel a part of something larger. ====Abdelhak Layada==== Leveilley was replaced in January 1993 by Abdelhak Layada, who declared his group independent of the FIS and MIA and not obedient to its orders. It adopted the radical Omar El-Eulmi as a spiritual guide, and Layada affirmed that \\"political pluralism is equivalent to sedition\\".Abdelhak Layada, quoted in Jeune Afrique, 27 January 1994. He also believed jihad in Algeria was fard ayn, or an individual obligation of adult male Muslims.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.261 Layada threatened not just security forces but journalists (\\"grandsons of France\\") and the families of Algerian soldiers. From its inception on, the GIA called for and implemented the killing of anyone collaborating with or supporting the authorities, including government employees such as teachers and civil servants. Layada did not last long and was arrested in Morocco in May 1993. Beside's the GIA, the other major branch of the Algerian resistance was the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA). It was led by the ex-soldier \\"General\\" Abdelkader Chebouti, and was \\"well-organized and structured and favored a long-term jihad\\" targeting the state and its representatives and based on a guerrilla campaign like that of the War of Independence. From prison, Ali Benhadj issued a fatwa giving the MIA his blessing. ====Djafar al-Afghani==== In August 1993, Seif Allah Djafar, aka Mourad Si Ahmed, aka Djafar al-Afghani, a 30-year-old black marketer with no education beyond primary school, became GIA amir.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.263 Violence escalated under Djafar, as did the GIA's base of support outside of Algeria. Under him, the group named and assassinated specific journalists and intellectuals (such as Tahar Djaout), saying that \\"The journalists who fight against Islamism through the pen will perish by the sword.\\"Sid Ahmed Mourad, quoted in Jeune Afrique, 27/1/94. The GIA explicitly affirmed that it \\"did not represent the armed wing of the FIS\\",Agence France-Presse, 20 November 1993, quoted in Human Rights Abuses in Algeria: No One is Spared By Andrew Whitley, Human Rights Watch, 1994, p.54 and issued death threats against several FIS and MIA members, including MIA's Heresay and FIS's Kebir and Redjam. About the time al-Afghani took power of GIA, a group of Algerian jihadists returning from Afghanistan came to London. Together with Islamist intellectual Abu Qatada, they started up a weekly magazine, Usrat al-Ansar as a GIA propaganda outlet. Abu Qatada \\"provided the intellectual and ideological firepower\\" to justify GIA actions, and the journal became \\"a trusted source of news and information about the GIA for Islamists around the world.\\" The GIA soon broadened its attacks to civilians who refused to live by their prohibitions, and then foreigners living in Algeria. A hostage released on 31 October 1993 carried a message ordering foreigners to \\"leave the country. We are giving you one month. Anyone who exceeds that period will be responsible for his own sudden death.\\"The Times, 20 November 1993. By the end of 1993 26 foreigners had been killed.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.264 In November 1993 Sheik Mohamed Bouslimani \\"a popular figure who was prominent\\" in Hamas party of Mahfoud Nahnah was kidnapped and executed after \\"refusing to issue a fatwa endorsing the GIA's tactics.\\" Djafar was killed February 26, 1994. ====Cherif Gousmi==== Cherif Gousmi, aka Abu Abdallah Ahmed, became amir March 10, 1994. Under him, the GIA reached its \\"high water mark\\", and became the \\"undisputed principal Islamist force\\" in Algeria.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.265 In May, Islamist leaders Abderrezak Redjam (allegedly representing the FIS), Mohammed Said, the exiled Anwar Haddam, and the MEI's Said Makhloufi joined the GIA; a blow to the FIS and surprise since the GIA had been issuing death threats against the three since November 1993. This was interpreted by many observers as either the result of intra-FIS competition or as an attempt to change the GIA's course from within. On 26 August, the group declared a \\"Caliphate\\", or Islamic government for Algeria, with Gousmi as Commander of the Faithful, Mohammed Said as head of government, the US-based Haddam as foreign minister, and Mekhloufi as provisional interior minister. However, the very next day Said Mekhloufi announced his withdrawal from the GIA, claiming that the GIA had deviated from Islam and that this \\"Caliphate\\" was an effort by Mohammed Said to take over the GIA, and Haddam soon afterwards denied ever having joined it, asserting that this Caliphate was an invention of the security services. The GIA continued attacking its usual targets, notably assassinating artists, such as Cheb Hasni, and in late August added a new one to its list, threatening schools which allowed mixed classes, music, gym for girls, or not wearing hijab with arson. He was killed in combat on September 26, 1994. ====Djamel Zitouni==== Djamel Zitouni was the leader of the GIA from 1994‚Äì96 Cherif Gousmi was eventually succeeded by Djamel Zitouni who became GIA head on October 27, 1994. He was the responsible for carrying out a series of bombings in France in 1995.Institute for Counter Terrorism, 2 June 1999 . He was killed by a rival faction on July 16, 1996. ====Antar Zouabri and takfir==== Antar Zouabri, was the longest serving \\"emir\\" (1996‚Äì2002) was nominated by a faction of the GIA \\"considered questionable by the others\\".Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.272 The 26-year-old activist was a \\"close confidant\\" of Zitouni and continued his policy of \\"ever increasing violence and redoubled purges\\". Zouabri opened his reign as emir by issuing a manifesto entitled The Sharp Sword, presenting Algerian society as resistant to jihad and lamented that the majority of the people had \\"forsaken religion and renounced the battle against its enemies,\\" but was careful to deny that the GIA had ever accused Algerian society itself of impiety (kufr).Al seif al battar, p.39-40 Convinced of Zouabri's salafist orthodoxy, Egyptian veteran of the Afghan jihad Abu Hamza restarted the Al- Ansar bulletin/magazine in London. During the month of Ramadan (January‚ÄìFebruary 1997) hundreds of civilians were killed in massacres some with their throats cut. The massacres continued for months and culminated in August and September when hundreds of men women and children were killed in the villages of Rais, Bentalha, Beni Messous. Pregnant women were sliced open, children were hacked to pieces or dashed against walls, men's limbs were hacked off one by one, and, as the attackers retreated, they would kidnap young women to keep as sex slaves. The GIA issued a communiques signed by Zouabri claiming responsibility for the massacres and justifying them‚Äîin contradiction to his manifesto‚Äîby declaring impious (takfir) all those Algerians who had not joined its ranks.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.272-3 In London Abu Hamzu criticised the communique and two days later (September 29) announced the end of his support and the closure of the bulletin, cutting off GIA's communication with international Islamist community and the rest of the outside world. In Algeria, the slaughters drained the GIA of popular support (although evidence showed security forces cooperated with the killers preventing civilians from escaping, and may even have controlled the GIA). A week earlier the AIS insurgents announced it would declare a unilateral truce starting in October. These events marked the end of \\"organized jihad in Algeria,\\" according to one source (Gilles Kepel) Although Zouabri was seldom heard of after this and the jihad exhausted, massacres \\"continued unabated\\" through 1998Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.274 led by independent amirs with added \\"ingredients of vendetta and local dispute\\" to the putative jihad against the government. Armed groups \\"that had formerly belonged to the GIA\\" continued to kill, some replacing jihad with simple banditry, others settling scores with the pro-government \\"patriots\\" or others, some enlisting themselves in the services of landowners and frightening illegal occupants off of property. In 1999 the \\"Law on Civil Concord\\" granting amnesty to fighters was officially rejected by the GIA but accepted by many rank-and-file Islamist fighters; an estimated 85 percent surrendered their arms and returned to civilian life. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) splinter faction appears to have eclipsed the GIA since approximately 1998 and is currently assessed by the CIA to be the most effective armed group remaining inside Algeria. Both the GIA and GSPC leadership continue to proclaim their rejection of President Bouteflika's amnesty, but in contrast to the GIA, the GSPC has stated that it avoids attacks on civilians. Zouabri was himself killed in a gun battle with security forces 9 February 2002. The GIA, torn by splits and desertions and denounced by all sides even in the Islamist movement, was slowly destroyed by army operations over the next few years; by the time of Antar Zouabri's death it was effectively incapacitated. The GIA and Violence In Algeria, the desire to have a violent and armed version of Islamism wasn't the primary mode of action for the GIA. There was no idea to use violence as a notion of sacrifice or martyrdom, which is quite common in other Islamist groups. In this case, the GIA used violence as an instrument of change to have a social transformation within Algeria. The state, in the eyes of the GIA, was an enemy of Islam. There was a rhetoric that the state was the incarnation of taghout. In order to destroy it, they would use a strategy of organized rural and urban guerrillas. The society backed fighters would have the capabilities to overthrow the state and create a new regime based on Sharia law. In order to destabilize the state, the GIA instigated terror throughout the country. Using acts of violence such as planned assassinations, vehicle bombings, kidnappings. They often attacked members of the Algerian army and the police force. As time passed the GIA did not limit their violence to only stately officials. They used violence as a means of social control on the civilian population as well. They would commit theatrical assassinations in front of large groups of people so they could spread fear and have people support their cause. Two notable assassinations by the GIA was the assassination of Abdelkader Alloula, a theater director in Algeria and Cheb Hasni the most popular Ra√Ø music singer. ===Endgame=== In 1999, following the election of a new president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a new law gave amnesty to most guerrillas, motivating large numbers to \\"repent\\" and return to normal life. The violence declined substantially after Antar Zouabri was killed in 2002, Rachid Abou Tourab succeeded him and was allegedly killed by close aides in July 2004. He was replaced by Boulenouar Oukil. On 7 April 2005, the GIA was reported to have killed 14 civilians at a fake road block. Three weeks later on 29 April, Oukil was arrested. Nourredine Boudiafi was the last known \\"emir\\" of the GIA. He was arrested sometime in November 2004 and the Algerian government announced his arrest in early January 2005. A splinter group of the GIA that formed on the fringes of Kabylie (north central coast) in 1998, called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), rejected the amnesty. It dissociated itself from the previous indiscriminate killing of civilians and reverted to the classic MIA-AIS tactics of targeting combatant forces. This break away was led by Hassan Hattab. In October 2003, they announced their support for Al-Qaeda and in 2006, Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a \\"blessed union\\" between the two groups. In 2007, the group changed its name to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. It has focused on kidnapping for ransom as a means of raising funds and is estimated to have raised more than $50 million from 2003 to 2013. ==Claims of Algerian Government involvement== Various claims have been made that the GIA was heavily infiltrated at top level by agents of Algerian intelligence such as the D√©partement du Renseignement et de la S√©curit√© (DRS), who drove the organisation towards excessive violence against civilians in order to undermine its popular support. According to Heba Saleh of BBC News, > Algerian opposition sources allege that the group may have been manipulated > at times by elements within ruling military and intelligence circles. A > series of massacres in the summer of 1997 - in which many hundreds of people > were killed - took place near Algerian army barracks, but no-one came to the > help of the victims. Fouad Ajami writing in The New Republic in 2010: called the GIA \\"a bastard child of the encounter between the Islamists and the security services of the regime.\\" John Schindler in The National Interest stated, \\"Much of GIA's leadership consisted of DRS agents, who drove the group into the dead end of mass murder\\" Another source, journalist Nafeez Ahmed claims that 'Yussuf- Joseph'‚Äîan anonymous 14-year \\"career secret agent\\" in Algeria's s√©curit√© militaire who defected to Britain in 1997 and claims to have had access to \\"all the secret telexes\\"‚Äîtold Ahmed that GIA atrocities were not the work of 'Islamic extremists', but were 'orchestrated' by 'Mohammed Mediane, head of the Algerian secret service', and 'General Smain Lamari', head of 'the counter intelligence agency' and ... 'In 1992 Smain created a special group, L'Escadron de la Mort (the Squadron of Death)... The death squads organized the massacres ... ' including 'at least' two of the bombs in Paris in summer 1995. That operation was (allegedly) 'run by Colonel Souames Mahmoud, alias Habib, head of the secret service at the Algerian embassy in Paris.' According to Ahmed, \\"Joseph's testimony has been corroborated by numerous defectors from the Algerian secret services.\\" (Ahmed also claims that the \\"British intelligence believed the Algerian Government was involved in atrocities, contradicting the view the Government was claiming in public\\".) However, according to Andrew Whitley of Human Rights Watch, \\"It was clear that armed Islamist groups were responsible for many of the killings of both civilians and security force members that had been attributed to them by the authorities.Human Rights Abuses in Algeria: No One is Spared By Andrew Whitley, Human Rights Watch, 1994, p.54 According to the Shadow Report on Algeria, Algerians such as Zazi Sadou, have collected testimonies by survivors that their attackers were unmasked and were recognised as local radicals - in one case even an elected member of the FIS.Shadow Report on Algeria, To The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Submitted by: International Women‚Äôs Human Rights Law Clinic and Women Living Under Muslim Laws January, l999  p. 20. note 27: \\"Some fundamentalist leaders have attempted to distance themselves from these massacres and claimed that the State was behind them or that they were the work of the State-armed self- defense groups. Some human rights groups have echoed this claim to some extent. Inside Algeria, and particularly among survivors of the communities attacked, the view is sharply different. In many cases, survivors have identified their attackers as the assailants enter the villages unmasked and are often from the locality. In one case, a survivor identified a former elected FIS officials as one of the perpetrators of a massacre. Testimonies Collected by Zazi Sadou.\\" According to Max Abrahms, \\"the false flag allegation arose because the civilian attacks hurt the GIA‚Äînot because of any evidence\\" to support it. Abrahms describes the proliferation of false flag conspiracy theories, such as 9/11 conspiracy theories, as a commonplace reaction to the generally counterproductive effects of terrorist violence, but notes that it is a fallacy to assume that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of terrorism must be the same. Abrahms cites Mohammed Hafez, an academic expert on the subject who concluded: \\"The evidence does not support the claim that security forces were the principal culprits behind the massacres, or even willing conspirators in the barbaric violence against civilians. Instead, the evidence points to the GIA as the principal perpetrator of the massacres.\\" ==Leaders, \\"amirs\\"== *Mansour Meliani: July 1992, arrested that same month. *Abdelhak Layada: from January 1993 to May 1993 * Seif Allah Djafar aka Mourad Si Ahmed, aka Djafar al-Afghani: from August 1993 until his death February 26, 1994. * Cherif Gousmi aka Abu Abdallah Ahmed: from March 10, 1994, to his death in combat on September 26, 1994. *Djamel Zitouni: from October 27, 1994, until July 16, 1996.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.267-71 *Antar Zouabri: from 1996 to 9 February 2002. *Rachid Abou Tourab: killed July 2004. *Boulenouar Oukil: arrested 29 April 2005. *Nourredine Boudiafi: arrested sometime in November 2004. == See also == *Atlas Trappist Monks *Abdelkader Mokhtari ==Notes== ==References== * ==Further reading== * Colin Robinson, In the Spotlight: the Armed Islamic Group, Center for Defense Information, 5 February 2003 * Derradji Abder-Rahmane, Concise History of Political Violence in Algeria: Brothers in Faith Enemies in Amrs, Volume no.1 the Edwin Mellen Press, NY, USA, September 2002. * Derradji Abder-Rahmane, Concise History of Political Violence in Algeria: Brothers in Faith Enemies in Amrs, Volume no.2 the Edwin Mellen Press, NY, USA, November 2002. * GIA Magazine November 1991 ==External links== *Armed Islamic Group (Council on Foreign Relations) *Algeria accepts the unacceptable (Le Monde Diplomatique) *Who Really Bombed Paris by Naima Bouteldja (The Guardian) *Athena Intelligence Advanced Research Network on Insurgency and Terrorism Category:1990s in Algeria Category:Algeria‚ÄìFrance relations Category:Factions of the Algerian Civil War Category:Islamic terrorism in France Category:Jihadist groups in Algeria Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by the United Kingdom Category:Organizations designated as terrorist in Africa Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Canada Category:Organizations formerly designated as terrorist by the United States Category:Rebel groups in Algeria ","title":"Armed Islamic Group of Algeria"},{"id":"300211","text":"Homa may refer to: * Max Homa (born 1990), American professional golfer on the PGA Tour * Homa (ritual), a religious practice in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, involving making offerings into a consecrated fire * Homa (leafhopper), an insect genus in the tribe Empoascini * Homa (mythology), a creature of Persian mythology * Another spelling for Haoma in Zoroastrianism * A popular female Persian name * Homa F.C., a professional league football club based in Tehran, Iran * Homeostatic model assessment, a medical formula for quantifying insulin resistance * Homa Bay, a town and a bay on the shore of Lake Victoria in Kenya * Homa Mountain, a volcano near Homa Bay * Harmonic Oscillator Model of Aromaticity, a method for quantifying aromaticity * Homa (woreda), a district in Oromia Region, Ethiopia * Homa, Iran, a village in Lorestan Province, Iran * Homa, North Khorasan, a village in North Khorasan Province, Iran * Homa-ye Bala (disambiguation), places in Iran * Homag (disambiguation), various places in Iran * Homay, Iran (disambiguation), various places in Iran * Iran Air's acronym, in Persian-language * Homa Darabi foundation, founded by Parvin Darabi *Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, neighborhood of Montreal, Canada colloquially known as \\"HoMa\\" in short form ==See also== * Haoma, Avestan language name of a plant and its divinity * Huma (disambiguation), which has several different meanings * Houma (disambiguation), which has several different meanings ","title":"Homa"},{"id":"300215","text":"Doctoral ceremony at Leiden University (7 July 1721). A thesis or dissertationOriginally, the concepts \\"dissertation\\" and \\"thesis\\" (plural, \\"theses\\") were not interchangeable. When, at ancient universities, the lector had completed his lecture, there would traditionally follow a disputation, during which students could take up certain points and argue them. The position that one took during a disputation was the thesis, while the dissertation was the line of reasoning with which one buttressed it. Olga Weijers: The medieval disputatio. In: Hora est! On dissertations, p.23-27. Leiden University Library, 2005 is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings.International Standard ISO 7144: Documentation‚ÄîPresentation of theses and similar documents, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, 1986. In some contexts, the word \\"thesis\\" or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while \\"dissertation\\" is normally applied to a doctorate, while in other contexts, the reverse is true.Douwe Breimer, Jos Damen et al.: Hora est! On dissertations, Leiden University Library, 2005. The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations. The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration. The word \\"dissertation\\" can at times be used to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term \\"thesis\\" is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work. ==Etymology== The term \\"thesis\\" comes from the Greek , meaning \\"something put forth\\", and refers to an intellectual proposition. \\"Dissertation\\" comes from the Latin dissertƒÅti≈ç, meaning \\"discussion\\". Aristotle was the first philosopher to define the term thesis. > \\"A 'thesis' is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts with > the general opinion...for to take notice when any ordinary person expresses > views contrary to men's usual opinions would be silly\\". For Aristotle, a thesis would therefore be a supposition that is stated in contradiction with general opinion or express disagreement with other philosophers (104b33-35). A supposition is a statement or opinion that may or may not be true depending on the evidence and/or proof that is offered (152b32). The purpose of the dissertation is thus to outline the proofs of why the author disagrees with other philosophers or the general opinion. == Structure and presentation style == Cover page to S√∏ren Kierkegaard's university thesis (1841). === Structure === A thesis (or dissertation) may be arranged as a thesis by publication or a monograph, with or without appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of published papers. An ordinary monograph has a title page, an abstract, a table of contents, comprising the various chapters like introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and bibliography or more usually a references section. They differ in their structure in accordance with the many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents. Dissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature impinging on the topic of the study, the methods used, and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format : :a) an introduction: which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance :b) a literature review: reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue :c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen :d) a findings chapter: outlining the findings of the research itself :e) an analysis and discussion chapter: analysing the findings and discussing them in the context of the literature review (this chapter is often divided into two‚Äîanalysis and discussion) :f) a conclusion.:Thomas, Gary (2009) Your Research Project. Thousand Oaks: Sage.Rudestam & Newton (2007) Surviving your dissertation. Thousand Oaks: Sage. which shows judgement or decision reached by thesis === Style === Degree-awarding institutions often define their own house style that candidates have to follow when preparing a thesis document. In addition to institution-specific house styles, there exist a number of field-specific, national, and international standards and recommendations for the presentation of theses, for instance ISO 7144. Other applicable international standards include ISO 2145 on section numbers, ISO 690 on bibliographic references, and ISO 31 on quantities or units. Some older house styles specify that front matter (title page, abstract, table of content, etc.) must use a separate page number sequence from the main text, using Roman numerals. The relevant international standard and many newer style guides recognize that this book design practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of Arabic numerals starting with 1 for the first printed page (the recto of the title page). Presentation requirements, including pagination, layout, type and color of paper, use of acid-free paper (where a copy of the dissertation will become a permanent part of the library collection), paper size, order of components, and citation style, will be checked page by page by the accepting officer before the thesis is accepted and a receipt is issued. However, strict standards are not always required. Most Italian universities, for example, have only general requirements on the character size and the page formatting, and leave much freedom for the actual typographic details. == Thesis committee == The thesis committee (or dissertation committee) is a committee that supervises a student's dissertation. In the US, these committees usually consist of a primary supervisor or advisor and two or more committee members, who supervise the progress of the dissertation and may also act as the examining committee, or jury, at the oral examination of the thesis (see Thesis defense). At most universities, the committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with their primary adviser, usually after completion of the comprehensive examinations or prospectus meeting, and may consist of members of the comps committee. The committee members are doctors in their field (whether a PhD or other designation) and have the task of reading the dissertation, making suggestions for changes and improvements, and sitting in on the defense. Sometimes, at least one member of the committee must be a professor in a department that is different from that of the student. == Role of thesis supervisor == The role of the thesis supervisor is to assist and support a student in their studies, and to determine whether a thesis is ready for examination.Imperial College London, 'Roles and Responsibilities: Research Degree Supervision'. July 2014. https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial- college/administration-and-support-services/registry/qa/public/good- practice/roles-and-responsibilities/Research-Degree-Supervisor.pdf. Accessed 17 March 2020. See also M. Rogers, M.Sims, J.Bird and S. Elliott (2020) Organisational narratives vs the lived neoliberal reality. Australian Universities' Review. 62(1):26-40. The thesis is authored by the student, not the supervisor. The duties of the thesis supervisor also include checking for copyright compliance and ensuring that the student has included in/with the thesis a statement attesting that he/she is the sole author of the thesis.M. Rogers, M.Sims, J.Bird and S. Elliott (2020) Organisational narratives vs the lived neoliberal reality. Australian Universities' Review. 62(1):26-40. == Regional and degree-specific practices and terminologies == === Argentina === In the Latin American docta, the academic dissertation can be referred to as different stages inside the academic program that the student is seeking to achieve into a recognized Argentine University, in all the cases the students must develop original contribution in the chosen fields by means of several paper work and essays that comprehend the body of the thesis. Correspondingly to the academic degree, the last phase of an academic thesis is called in Spanish a defensa de grado, defensa magistral or defensa doctoral in cases in which the university candidate is finalizing their licentiate, master's, or PhD program. According to a committee resolution, the dissertation can be approved or rejected by an academic committee consisting of the thesis director, the thesis coordinator, and at least one evaluator from another recognized university in which the student is pursuing their academic program. All the dissertation referees must already have achieved at least the academic degree that the candidate is trying to reach. === Canada === At English- speaking Canadian universities, writings presented in fulfillment of undergraduate coursework requirements are normally called papers, term papers or essays. A longer paper or essay presented for completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree is sometimes called a major paper. High-quality research papers presented as the empirical study of a \\"postgraduate\\" consecutive bachelor with Honours or Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree are called thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis). Major papers presented as the final project for a master's degree are normally called thesis; and major papers presenting the student's research towards a doctoral degree are called theses or dissertations. At Canadian universities under the French influenced system, students may have a choice between presenting a \\"m√©moire\\"', which is a shorter synthetic work (roughly 75 pages) and a th√®se which is one hundred pages or more. A synthetic monograph associated with doctoral work is referred to as a \\"th√®se\\". See also compilation thesis. Either work can be awarded a \\"mention d'honneur\\" (excellence) as a result of the decision by the examination committee, although these are rare. A typical undergraduate paper or essay might be forty pages. Master's theses are approximately one hundred pages. PhD theses are usually over two hundred pages. This may vary greatly by discipline, program, college, or university. However, normally the required minimum study period is primarily depending on the complexity or quality of research requirements. Theses Canada acquires and preserves a comprehensive collection of Canadian theses at Library and Archives Canada' (LAC) through a partnership with Canadian universities who participate in the program. === Croatia === At most university faculties in Croatia, a degree is obtained by defending a thesis after having passed all the classes specified in the degree programme. In the Bologna system, the bachelor's thesis, called zavr≈°ni rad (literally \\"final work\\" or \\"concluding work\\") is defended after 3 years of study and is about 30 pages long. Most students with bachelor's degrees continue onto master's programmes which end with a master's thesis called diplomski rad (literally \\"diploma work\\" or \\"graduate work\\"). The term dissertation is used for a doctoral degree paper (doktorska disertacija). === Czech Republic === In the Czech Republic, higher education is completed by passing all classes remaining to the educational compendium for given degree and defending a thesis. For bachelors programme the thesis is called bakal√°≈ôsk√° pr√°ce (bachelor's thesis), for master's degrees and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees it is the diplomov√° pr√°ce (master's thesis), and for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree it is dissertation dizertaƒçn√≠ pr√°ce. Thesis for so called Higher-Professional School (Vy≈°≈°√≠ odborn√° ≈°kola, VO≈†) is called absolventsk√° pr√°ce. === Finland === The following types of thesis are used in Finland (names in Finnish/Swedish): * Kandidaatintutkielma/kandidatavhandling is the dissertation associated with lower-level academic degrees (bachelor's degree), and at universities of applied science. * Pro gradu(-tutkielma)/(avhandling )pro gradu, colloquially referred to simply as 'gradu', is the dissertation for master's degrees, which make up the majority of degrees conferred in Finland, and this is therefore the most common type of thesis submitted in the country. The equivalent for engineering and architecture students is diplomity√∂/diplomarbete. * The highest-level theses are called lisensiaatintutkielma/licentiatavhandling and (tohtorin)v√§it√∂skirja/doktorsavhandling, for licentiate and doctoral degrees, respectively. === France === The cover of the thesis presented by Claude Bernard to obtain his Doctorate of Medicine (1843). In France, the academic dissertation or thesis is called a th√®se and it is reserved for the final work of doctoral candidates. The minimum page length is generally (and not formally) 100 pages (or about 400,000 characters), but is usually several times longer (except for technical theses and for \\"exact sciences\\" such as physics and maths). To complete a master's degree in research, a student is required to write a m√©moire, the French equivalent of a master's thesis in other higher education systems. The word dissertation in French is reserved for shorter (1,000‚Äì2,000 words), more generic academic treatises. The defense is called a soutenance. === Germany === In Germany, an academic thesis is called Abschlussarbeit or, more specifically, the basic name of the degree complemented by -arbeit (rough translation: -work; e.g., Diplomarbeit, Masterarbeit, Doktorarbeit). For bachelor's and master's degrees, the name can alternatively be complemented by -thesis instead (e.g., Bachelorthesis). Length is often given in page count and depends upon departments, faculties, and fields of study. A bachelor's thesis is often 40‚Äì60 pages long, a diploma thesis and a master's thesis usually 60‚Äì100. The required submission for a doctorate is called a Dissertation or Doktorarbeit. The submission for a Habilitation, which is an academic qualification, not an academic degree, is called Habilitationsschrift, not Habilitationsarbeit. PhD by publication is becoming increasingly common in many fields of study. A doctoral degree is often earned with multiple levels of a Latin honors remark for the thesis ranging from summa cum laude (best) to rite (duly). A thesis can also be rejected with a Latin remark (non-rite, non-sufficit or worst as sub omni canone). Bachelor's and master's theses receive numerical grades from 1.0 (best) to 5.0 (failed). === India === In India the thesis defense is called a (Latin for \\"by live voice\\") examination (viva in short). Involved in the viva are two examiners, one guide(student guide) and the candidate. One examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an external examiner from a different university. In India, PG Qualifications such as MSc Physics accompanies submission of dissertation in Part I and submission of a Project (a working model of an innovation) in Part II. Engineering and Designing qualifications such as BTech, B.E., B.Des, MTech, M.E. or M.Des also involves submission of dissertation. In all the cases, the dissertation can be extended for summer internship at certain research and development organizations or also as PhD synopsis. === Indonesia === In Indonesia, the term thesis is used specifically to refer to master's theses. The undergraduate thesis is called skripsi, while the doctoral dissertation is called disertasi. In general, those three terms are usually called as tugas akhir (final assignment), which is mandatory for the completion of a degree. Undergraduate students usually begin to write their final assignment in their third, fourth or fifth enrollment year, depends on the requirements of their respective disciplines and universities. In some universities, students are required to write a proposal skripsi or proposal tesis (thesis proposal) before they could write their final assignment. If the thesis proposal is considered to fulfill the qualification by the academic examiners, students then may proceed to write their final assignment. === Iran === In Iran, usually students are required to present a thesis ( pƒÅyƒÅn-nƒÅmeh) in their master's degree and a dissertation ( resƒÅleh) in their Doctorate degree, both of which requiring the students to defend their research before a committee and gaining their approval. Most of the norms and rules of writing a thesis or a dissertation are influenced by the French higher education system. === Italy === In Italy there are normally three types of thesis. In order of complexity: one for the Laurea (equivalent to the UK Bachelor's Degree), another one for the Laurea Magistrale (equivalent to the UK Master's Degree) and then a thesis to complete the Dottorato di Ricerca (PhD). Thesis requirements vary greatly between degrees and disciplines, ranging from as low as 3‚Äì4 ECTS credits to more than 30. Thesis work is mandatory for the completion of a degree. === Malaysia === Malaysian universities often follow the British model for dissertations and degrees. However, a few universities follow the United States model for theses and dissertations. Some public universities have both British and US style PhD programs. Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses. === Pakistan === In Pakistan, at undergraduate level the thesis is usually called final year project, as it is completed in the senior year of the degree, the name project usually implies that the work carried out is less extensive than a thesis and bears lesser credit hours too. The undergraduate level project is presented through an elaborate written report and a presentation to the advisor, a board of faculty members and students. At graduate level however, i.e. in MS, some universities allow students to accomplish a project of 6 credits or a thesis of 9 credits, at least one publication is normally considered enough for the awarding of the degree with project and is considered mandatory for the awarding of a degree with thesis. A written report and a public thesis defense is mandatory, in the presence of a board of senior researchers, consisting of members from an outside organization or a university. A PhD candidate is supposed to accomplish extensive research work to fulfill the dissertation requirements with international publications being a mandatory requirement. The defense of the research work is done publicly. === Philippines === In the Philippines, an academic thesis is named by the degree, such as bachelor/undergraduate thesis or masteral thesis. However, in Philippine English, the term doctorate is typically replaced with doctoral (as in the case of \\"doctoral dissertation\\"), though in official documentation the former is still used. The terms thesis and dissertation are commonly used interchangeably in everyday language yet it generally understood that a thesis refers to bachelor/undergraduate and master academic work while a dissertation is named for doctorate work. The Philippine system is influenced by American collegiate system, in that it requires a research project to be submitted before being allowed to write a thesis. This project is mostly given as a prerequisite writing course to the actual thesis and is accomplished in the term period before; supervision is provided by one professor assigned to a class. This project is later to be presented in front of an academic panel, often the entire faculty of an academic department, with their recommendations contributing to the acceptance, revision, or rejection of the initial topic. In addition, the presentation of the research project will help the candidate choose their primary thesis adviser. An undergraduate thesis is completed in the final year of the degree alongside existing seminar (lecture) or laboratory courses, and is often divided into two presentations: proposal and thesis presentations (though this varies across universities), whereas a master thesis or doctorate dissertation is accomplished in the last term alone and is defended once. In most universities, a thesis is required for the bestowment of a degree to a candidate alongside a number of units earned throughout their academic period of stay, though for practice and skills-based degrees a practicum and a written report can be achieved instead. The examination board often consists of 3 to 5 examiners, often professors in a university (with a Masters or PhD degree) depending on the university's examination rules. Required word length, complexity, and contribution to scholarship varies widely across universities in the country. === Poland === In Poland, a bachelor's degree usually requires a praca licencjacka (bachelor's thesis) or the similar level degree in engineering requires a praca in≈ºynierska (engineer's thesis/bachelor's thesis), the master's degree requires a praca magisterska (master's thesis). The academic dissertation for a PhD is called a dysertacja or praca doktorska. The submission for the Habilitation is called praca habilitacyjna or dysertacja habilitacyjna. Thus the term dysertacja is reserved for PhD and Habilitation degrees. All the theses need to be \\"defended\\" by the author during a special examination for the given degree. Examinations for PhD and Habilitation degrees are public. === Portugal and Brazil === In Portugal and Brazil, a dissertation (disserta√ß√£o) is required for completion of a master. The defense is done in a public presentation in which teachers, students, and the general public can participate. For the PhD, a thesis (tese) is presented for defense in a public exam. The exam typically extends over 3 hours. The examination board typically involves 5 to 6 scholars (including the advisor) or other experts with a PhD degree (generally at least half of them must be external to the university where the candidate defends the thesis, but it may depend on the University). Each university / faculty defines the length of these documents, and it can vary also in respect to the domains (a thesis in fields like philosophy, history, geography, etc., usually has more pages than a thesis in mathematics, computer science, statistics, etc.) but typical numbers of pages are around 60‚Äì80 for MSc and 150‚Äì250 for PhD. In Brazil the Bachelor's Thesis is called TCC or Trabalho de Conclus√£o de Curso (Final Term / Undergraduate Thesis / Final Paper). === Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine === In Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine an academic dissertation or thesis is called what can be literally translated as a \\"master's degree work\\" (thesis), whereas the word dissertation is reserved for doctoral theses (Candidate of Sciences). To complete a master's degree, a student is required to write a thesis and to then defend the work publicly. The length of this manuscript usually is given in page count and depends upon educational institution, its departments, faculties, and fields of study === Slovenia === At universities in Slovenia, an academic thesis called diploma thesis is a prerequisite for completing undergraduate studies. The thesis used to be 40‚Äì60 pages long, but has been reduced to 20‚Äì30 pages in new Bologna process programmes. To complete Master's studies, a candidate must write magistrsko delo (Master's thesis) that is longer and more detailed than the undergraduate thesis. The required submission for the doctorate is called doktorska disertacija (doctoral dissertation). In pre Bologna programmes students were able to skip the preparation and presentation of a Master's thesis and continue straightforward towards doctorate. === Slovakia === In Slovakia, higher education is completed by defending a thesis, which is called bachelor's thesis \\"bakal√°rska pr√°ca\\" for bachelors programme, master's thesis or \\"diplomov√° pr√°ca\\" for master's degrees, and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees and dissertation \\"dizertaƒçn√° pr√°ca\\" for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree. === Sweden === Cover page of a licentiate dissertation in Sweden In Sweden, there are different types of theses. Practices and definitions vary between fields but commonly include the C thesis/Bachelor thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies, D thesis/'/Magister/one year master's thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies and E Thesis/two-year master's thesis, which corresponds to 30 HP or 20 weeks of independent studies. The undergraduate theses are called uppsats (\\"essay\\"), sometimes examensarbete, especially at technical programmes. After that there are two types of post graduate theses: licentiate thesis and PhD dissertation. A licentiate degree is approximately \\"half a PhD\\" in terms of the size and scope of the thesis. Swedish PhD studies should in theory last for four years, including course work and thesis work, but as many PhD students also teach, the PhD often takes longer to complete. The thesis can be written as a monograph or as a compilation thesis; in the latter case, the introductory chapters are called the kappa (literally \\"coat\\"). Either kind of PhD thesis is normally referred to as an avhandling. === United Kingdom === Outside the academic community, the terms thesis and dissertation are interchangeable. At universities in the United Kingdom, the term thesis is usually associated with PhD/EngD (doctoral) and research master's degrees, while dissertation is the more common term for a substantial project submitted as part of a taught master's degree or an undergraduate degree (e.g. MSc, BA, BSc, BMus, BEd, BEng etc.). Thesis word lengths may differ by faculty/department and are set by individual universities. A wide range of supervisory arrangements can be found in the British academy, from single supervisors (more usual for undergraduate and Masters level work) to supervisory teams of up to three supervisors. In teams, there will often be a Director of Studies, usually someone with broader experience (perhaps having passed some threshold of successful supervisions). The Director may be involved with regular supervision along with the other supervisors, or may have more of an oversight role, with the other supervisors taking on the more day-to-day responsibilities of supervision. === United States === In some U.S. doctoral programs, the \\"dissertation\\" can take up the major part of the student's total time spent (along with two or three years of classes) and may take years of full-time work to complete. At most universities, dissertation is the term for the required submission for the doctorate, and thesis refers only to the master's degree requirement. Thesis is also used to describe a cumulative project for a bachelor's degree and is more common at selective colleges and universities, or for those seeking admittance to graduate school or to obtain an honors academic designation. These projects are called \\"senior projects\\" or \\"senior theses\\"; they are generally done in the senior year near graduation after having completed other courses, the independent study period, and the internship or student teaching period (the completion of most of the requirements before the writing of the paper ensures adequate knowledge and aptitude for the challenge). Unlike a dissertation or master's thesis, they are not as long and they do not require a novel contribution to knowledge or even a very narrow focus on a set subtopic. Like them, they can be lengthy and require months of work, they require supervision by at least one professor adviser, they must be focused on a certain area of knowledge, and they must use an appreciable amount of scholarly citations. They may or may not be defended before a committee but usually are not; there is generally no preceding examination before the writing of the paper, except for at very few colleges. Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have total citations. Specific undergraduate courses, especially writing-intensive courses or courses taken by upperclassmen, may also require one or more extensive written assignments referred to variously as theses, essays, or papers. Increasingly, high schools are requiring students to complete a senior project or senior thesis on a chosen topic during the final year as a prerequisite for graduation. The extended essay component of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, offered in a growing number of American high schools, is another example of this trend. Generally speaking, a dissertation is judged as to whether it makes an original and unique contribution to scholarship. Lesser projects (a master's thesis, for example) are judged by whether they demonstrate mastery of available scholarship in the presentation of an idea. The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis may vary significantly among universities or programs. == Thesis examinations == One of the requirements for certain advanced degrees is often an oral examination (called a viva voce examination or just viva in the UK and certain other English-speaking countries). This examination normally occurs after the dissertation is finished but before it is submitted to the university, and may comprise a presentation (often public) by the student and questions posed by an examining committee or jury. In North America, an initial oral examination in the field of specialization may take place just before the student settles down to work on the dissertation. An additional oral exam may take place after the dissertation is completed and is known as a thesis defense or dissertation defense, which at some universities may be a mere formality and at others may result in the student being required to make significant revisions. === Examination results === The result of the examination may be given immediately following deliberation by the examination committee (in which case the candidate may immediately be considered to have received their degree), or at a later date, in which case the examiners may prepare a defense report that is forwarded to a Board or Committee of Postgraduate Studies, which then officially recommends the candidate for the degree. Potential decisions (or \\"verdicts\\") include: * Accepted/pass with no corrections. : The thesis is accepted as presented. A grade may be awarded, though in many countries PhDs are not graded at all, and in others, only one of the theoretically possible grades (the highest) is ever used in practice. * The thesis must be revised. : Revisions (for example, correction of numerous grammatical or spelling errors; clarification of concepts or methodology; an addition of sections) are required. One or more members of the jury or the thesis supervisor will make the decision on the acceptability of revisions and provide written confirmation that they have been satisfactorily completed. If, as is often the case, the needed revisions are relatively modest, the examiners may all sign the thesis with the verbal understanding that the candidate will review the revised thesis with their supervisor before submitting the completed version. * Extensive revision required. : The thesis must be revised extensively and undergo the evaluation and defense process again from the beginning with the same examiners. Problems may include theoretical or methodological issues. A candidate who is not recommended for the degree after the second defense must normally withdraw from the program. * Unacceptable. : The thesis is unacceptable and the candidate must withdraw from the program. This verdict is given only when the thesis requires major revisions and when the examination makes it clear that the candidate is incapable of making such revisions. At most North American institutions the latter two verdicts are extremely rare, for two reasons. First, to obtain the status of doctoral candidates, graduate students typically write a qualifying examination or comprehensive examination, which often includes an oral defense. Students who pass the qualifying examination are deemed capable of completing scholarly work independently and are allowed to proceed with working on a dissertation. Second, since the thesis supervisor (and the other members of the advisory committee) will normally have reviewed the thesis extensively before recommending the student proceed to the defense, such an outcome would be regarded as a major failure not only on the part of the candidate but also by the candidate's supervisor (who should have recognized the substandard quality of the dissertation long before the defense was allowed to take place). It is also fairly rare for a thesis to be accepted without any revisions; the most common outcome of a defense is for the examiners to specify minor revisions (which the candidate typically completes in a few days or weeks). At universities on the British pattern it is not uncommon for theses at the viva stage to be subject to major revisions in which a substantial rewrite is required, sometimes followed by a new viva. Very rarely, the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil (Master of Philosophy) instead, preventing the candidate from resubmitting the thesis. === Australia === In Australia, doctoral theses are usually examined by three examiners although some, like the Australian Catholic University and the University of New South Wales, have shifted to using only two examiners; without a live defense except in extremely rare exceptions. In the case of a master's degree by research the thesis is usually examined by only two examiners. Typically one of these examiners will be from within the candidate's own department; the other(s) will usually be from other universities and often from overseas. Following submission of the thesis, copies are sent by mail to examiners and then reports sent back to the institution. Similar to a master's degree by research thesis, a thesis for the research component of a master's degree by coursework is also usually examined by two examiners, one from the candidate's department and one from another university. For an Honours year, which is a fourth year in addition to the usual three-year bachelor's degree, the thesis is also examined by two examiners, though both are usually from the candidate's own department. Honours and Master's theses sometimes require an oral defense before they are accepted. === Germany === In Germany, a thesis is usually examined with an oral examination. This applies to almost all Diplom, Magister, master's and doctoral degrees as well as to most bachelor's degrees. However, a process that allows for revisions of the thesis is usually only implemented for doctoral degrees. There are several different kinds of oral examinations used in practice. The Disputation, also called Verteidigung (\\"defense\\"), is usually public (at least to members of the university) and is focused on the topic of the thesis. In contrast, the Rigorosum is not held in public and also encompasses fields in addition to the topic of the thesis. The Rigorosum is only common for doctoral degrees. Another term for an oral examination is Kolloquium, which generally refers to a usually public scientific discussion and is often used synonymously with Verteidigung. In each case, what exactly is expected differs between universities and between faculties. Some universities also demand a combination of several of these forms. === Malaysia === Like the British model, the PHD or MPhil student is required to submit their theses or dissertation for examination by two or three examiners. The first examiner is from the university concerned, the second examiner is from another local university and the third examiner is from a suitable foreign university (usually from Commonwealth countries). The choice of examiners must be approved by the university senate. In some public universities, a PhD or MPhil candidate may also have to show a number publications in peer reviewed academic journals as part of the requirement. An oral viva is conducted after the examiners have submitted their reports to the university. The oral viva session is attended by the Oral Viva chairman, a rapporteur with a PhD qualification, the first examiner, the second examiner and sometimes the third examiner. Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses to examine their PhD or MPhil candidates. === Philippines === In the Philippines, a thesis is followed by an oral defense. In most universities, this applies to all bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees. However, the oral defense is held in once per semester (usually in the middle or by the end) with a presentation of revisions (so-called \\"plenary presentation\\") at the end of each semester. The oral defense is typically not held in public for bachelor and master oral defenses, however a colloquium is held for doctorate degrees. ===Portugal=== In Portugal, a thesis is examined with an oral defense, which includes an initial presentation by the candidate followed by an extensive questioning/answering period. === North America === In North America, the thesis defense or oral defense is the final examination for doctoral candidates, and sometimes for master's candidates. The examining committee normally consists of the thesis committee, usually a given number of professors mainly from the student's university plus their primary supervisor, an external examiner (someone not otherwise connected to the university), and a chair person. Each committee member will have been given a completed copy of the dissertation prior to the defense, and will come prepared to ask questions about the thesis itself and the subject matter. In many schools, master's thesis defenses are restricted to the examinee and the examiners, but doctoral defenses are open to the public. The typical format will see the candidate giving a short (20‚Äì40-minute) presentation of their research, followed by one to two hours of questions. At some U.S. institutions, a longer public lecture (known as a \\"thesis talk\\" or \\"thesis seminar\\") by the candidate will accompany the defense itself, in which case only the candidate, the examiners, and other members of the faculty may attend the actual defense. === Russia and Ukraine === A student in Ukraine or Russia has to complete a thesis and then defend it in front of their department. Sometimes the defense meeting is made up of the learning institute's professionals and sometimes the students peers are allowed to view or join in. After the presentation and defense of the thesis, the final conclusion of the department should be that none of them have reservations on the content and quality of the thesis. A conclusion on the thesis has to be approved by the rector of the educational institute. This conclusion (final grade so to speak) of the thesis can be defended/argued not only at the thesis council, but also in any other thesis council of Russia or Ukraine. === Spain === The former Diploma de estudios avanzados (DEA) lasted two years and candidates were required to complete coursework and demonstrate their ability to research the specific topics they have studied. From 2011 on, these courses were replaced by academic Master's programmes that include specific training on epistemology, and scientific methodology. After its completion, students are able to enrol in a specific PhD programme (programa de doctorado) and begin a dissertation on a set topic for a maximum time of three years (full-time) and five years (part-time). All students must have a full professor as an academic advisor (director de tesis) and a tutor, who is usually the same person. A dissertation (tesis doctoral), with an average of 250 pages, is the main requisite along with typically one previously published journal article. Once candidates have published their written dissertations, they will be evaluated by two external academics (evaluadores externos) and subsequently it is usually exhibited publicly for fifteen natural days. After its approval, candidates must defend publicly their research before a three- member committee (tribunal) with at least one visiting academic: chair, secretary and member (presidente, secretario y vocal). A typical public Thesis Defence (defensa) lasts 45 minutes and all attendants holding a doctoral degree are eligible to ask questions. === United Kingdom, Ireland and Hong Kong === In Hong Kong, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the thesis defense is called a (Latin for \\"by live voice\\") examination (viva for short). A typical viva lasts for approximately 3 hours, though there is no formal time limit. Involved in the viva are two examiners and the candidate. Usually, one examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an external examiner from a different university. Increasingly, the examination may involve a third academic, the 'chair'; this person, from the candidate's institution, acts as an impartial observer with oversight of the examination process to ensure that the examination is fair. The 'chair' does not ask academic questions of the candidate.Pearce, Lynne (2005) How to Examine a Thesis, McGraw-Hill International, pp. 79‚Äì85 In the United Kingdom, there are only two or at most three examiners, and in many universities the examination is held in private. The candidate's primary supervisor is not permitted to ask or answer questions during the viva, and their presence is not necessary. However, some universities permit members of the faculty or the university to attend. At the University of Oxford, for instance, any member of the University may attend a DPhil viva (the University's regulations require that details of the examination and its time and place be published formally in advance) provided they attend in full academic dress. == Submission == A submission of the thesis is the last formal requirement for most students after the defense. By the final deadline, the student must submit a complete copy of the thesis to the appropriate body within the accepting institution, along with the appropriate forms, bearing the signatures of the primary supervisor, the examiners, and in some cases, the head of the student's department. Other required forms may include library authorizations (giving the university library permission to make the thesis available as part of its collection) and copyright permissions (in the event that the student has incorporated copyrighted materials in the thesis). Many large scientific publishing houses (e.g. Taylor & Francis, Elsevier) use copyright agreements that allow the authors to incorporate their published articles into dissertations without separate authorization. Failure to submit the thesis by the deadline may result in graduation (and granting of the degree) being delayed. At most U.S. institutions, there will also be various fees (for binding, microfilming, copyright registration, and the like), which must be paid before the degree will be granted. Once all the paperwork is in order, copies of the thesis may be made available in one or more university libraries. Specialist abstracting services exist to publicize the content of these beyond the institutions in which they are produced. Many institutions now insist on submission of digitized as well as printed copies of theses; the digitized versions of successful theses are often made available online. == See also == * Capstone course * Compilation thesis * Comprehensive examination * Dissertation Abstracts * Grey literature * Postgraduate education == References == == External links == * en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ETD Guide Guide to electronic theses and dissertations on Wikibooks * Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) * EThOS Database Database of UK Doctoral theses available through the British Library Category:Academia Category:Educational assessment and evaluation Category:Grey literature Category:Rhetoric Category:Scientific documents ","title":"Thesis"},{"id":"300221","text":"Testicular cancer is cancer that develops in the testicles, a part of the male reproductive system. Symptoms may include a lump in the testicle, or swelling or pain in the scrotum. Treatment may result in infertility. Risk factors include an undescended testis, family history of the disease, and previous history of testicular cancer. The most common type is germ cell tumors which are divided into seminomas and nonseminomas. Other types include sex-cord stromal tumors and lymphomas. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam, ultrasound, and blood tests. Surgical removal of the testicle with examination under a microscope is then done to determine the type. Testicular cancer is highly treatable and usually curable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Even in cases in which cancer has spread widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate greater than 80%. Globally testicular cancer affected about 686,000 people in 2015. That year it resulted in 9,400 deaths up from 7,000 deaths in 1990. Rates are lower in the developing than the developed world. Onset most commonly occurs in males 20 to 34 years old, rarely before 15 years old. The five-year survival rate in the United States is about 95%. Outcomes are better when the disease remains localized. ==Signs and symptoms== Image showing the first sign of testicular cancer One of the first signs of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self-exams. However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they have a family history of cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self- examinations for all young men. Symptoms may also include one or more of the following: *a lump in one testis which may or may not be painful *sharp pain or a dull ache in the lower abdomen or scrotum *a feeling often described as \\"heaviness\\" in the scrotum *firmness of the testicle *breast enlargement (gynecomastia) from hormonal effects of Œ≤-hCG *low back pain (lumbago) due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes along the back It is not very common for testicular cancer to spread to other organs, apart from the lungs. If it has, however, the following symptoms may be present: *shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough or coughing up blood (hemoptysis) from metastatic spread to the lungs *a lump in the neck due to metastases to the lymph nodes Testicular cancer, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and poor semen quality make up the syndrome known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome. ==Causes== A major risk factor for the development of testis cancer is cryptorchidism (undescended testicles). It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism; when cryptorchidism occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large. Other risk factors include inguinal hernias, Klinefelter syndrome, and mumps orchitis. Physical activity is associated with decreased risk and sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk. Early onset of male characteristics is associated with increased risk. These may reflect endogenous or environmental hormones. Higher rates of testicular cancer in Western nations have been linked to the use of cannabis.Testicular Cancer Risk Linked To Marijuana Smoking Medical News Today 2 September 2009.Cannabis linked to testicular cancer . The Independent 2 September 2009.Smoking Marijuana Tied to Testicular Cancer Web MD 9 October 2012. ==Mechanisms== Most testicular germ cell tumors have too many chromosomes, and most often they are triploid to tetraploid. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 on both sides of the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification. ==Diagnosis== Micrograph (high magnification) of a seminoma. H&E; stain. The main way testicular cancer is diagnosed is via a lump or mass inside a testis. More generally, if a young adult or adolescent has a single enlarged testicle, which may or may not be painful, this should give doctors reason to suspect testicular cancer. Mixed germ cell tumor containing embryonal carcinoma, seminoma, and yolk sac tumor. The embryonal carcinoma component (upper left, upper right, and lower left) shows pseudoglandular growth with high-grade features of large, epithelioid, anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli, indistinct cell borders with nuclear overlapping, pleomorphism, and frequent mitoses. The seminoma component (upper center) shows large, round-polyhedral cells with distinct cell membranes, abundant clear/watery cytoplasm, large central nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The yolk sac component (lower right, hugging the embryonal component) exhibits microcystic/reticular growth pattern. Other conditions may also have symptoms similar to testicular cancer: *Epididymitis or epididymoorchitis *Hematocele *Varicocele *Orchitis *Prostate infections or inflammations (prostatitis), bladder infections or inflammations (cystitis), or kidney (renal) infections (nephritis) or inflammations which have spread to and caused swelling in the vessels of the testicles or scrotum *Testicular torsion or a hernia *Infection, inflammation, retro-peritonitis, or other conditions of the lymph nodes or vessels near the scrotum, testicles, pubis, anorectal area, and groin *Benign tumors or lesions of the testicles *Metastasis to the testicles from another, primary tumor site(s) The nature of any palpated lump in the scrotum is often evaluated by scrotal ultrasound, which can determine exact location, size, and some characteristics of the lump, such as cystic vs solid, uniform vs heterogeneous, sharply circumscribed or poorly defined. The extent of the disease is evaluated by CT scans, which are used to locate metastases. The differential diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal orchiectomy - that is, surgical excision of the entire testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord). A biopsy should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum. Inguinal orchiectomy is the preferred method because it lowers the risk of cancer cells escaping. This is because the lymphatic system of the scrotum, through which white blood cells (and, potentially, cancer cells) flow in and out, links to the lower extremities, while that of the testicle links to the back of the abdominal cavity (the retroperitoneum). A transscrotal biopsy or orchiectomy will potentially leave cancer cells in the scrotum and create two routes for cancer cells to spread, while in an inguinal orchiectomy only the retroperitoneal route exists. Blood tests are also used to identify and measure tumor markers (usually proteins present in the bloodstream) that are specific to testicular cancer. Alpha- fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (the \\"pregnancy hormone\\"), and LDH-1 are the typical tumor markers used to spot testicular germ cell tumors. A pregnancy test may be used to detect high levels of chorionic gonadotropin; however, the first sign of testicular cancer is usually a painless lump. Note that only about 25% of seminomas have elevated chorionic gonadotropin, so a pregnancy test is not very sensitive for making out testicular cancer. ===Screening=== The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening males without symptoms for testicular cancer. ===Staging=== After removal, the testicle is fixed with Bouin's solution because it better conserves some morphological details such as nuclear conformation. Then the testicular tumor is staged by a pathologist according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors as published in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. Testicular cancer is categorized as being in one of three stages (which have subclassifications). The size of the tumor in the testis is irrelevant to staging. In broad terms, testicular cancer is staged as follows: *Stage I: the cancer remains localized to the testis. *Stage II: the cancer involves the testis and metastasis to retroperitoneal and/or paraaortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes below the diaphragm). *Stage III: the cancer involves the testis and metastasis beyond the retroperitoneal and paraaortic lymph nodes. Stage 3 is further subdivided into non-bulky stage 3 and bulky stage 3. Further information on the detailed staging system is available on the website of the American Cancer Society. ===Classification=== Although testicular cancer can be derived from any cell type found in the testicles, more than 95% of testicular cancers are germ cell tumors (GCTs). Most of the remaining 5% are sex cord‚Äìgonadal stromal tumours derived from Leydig cells or Sertoli cells. Correct diagnosis is necessary to ensure the most effective and appropriate treatment. To some extent, this can be done via blood tests for tumor markers, but definitive diagnosis requires examination of the histology of a specimen by a pathologist.

Surgery is performed by urologists; radiation therapy is administered by radiation oncologists; and chemotherapy is the work of medical oncologists. In most patients with testicular cancer, the disease is cured readily with minimal long-term morbidity. While treatment success depends on the stage, the average survival rate after five years is around 95%, and stage 1 cancer cases, if monitored properly, have essentially a 100% survival rate. === Testicle removal === The initial treatment for testicular cancer is surgery to remove the affected testicle (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle. Since only one testis is typically required to maintain fertility, hormone production, and other male functions, the afflicted testis is almost always removed completely in a procedure called inguinal orchiectomy. (The testicle is almost never removed through the scrotum; an incision is made beneath the belt line in the inguinal area.) In the UK, the procedure is known as a radical orchidectomy. ===Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection=== In the case of nonseminomas that appear to be stage I, surgery may be done on the retroperitoneal/paraaortic lymph nodes (in a separate operation) to accurately determine whether the cancer is in stage I or stage II and to reduce the risk that malignant testicular cancer cells that may have metastasized to lymph nodes in the lower abdomen. This surgery is called retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). However, this approach, while standard in many places, especially the United States, is out of favor due to costs and the high level of expertise required to perform successful surgery. Sperm banking is frequently carried out prior to the procedure (as with chemotherapy), as there is a risk that RPLND may damage the nerves involved in ejaculation, causing ejaculation to occur internally into the bladder rather than externally. Many patients are instead choosing surveillance, where no further surgery is performed unless tests indicate that the cancer has returned. This approach maintains a high cure rate because of the growing accuracy of surveillance techniques. === Adjuvant treatment === Since testicular cancers can spread, patients are usually offered adjuvant treatment - in the form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy - to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle. The type of adjuvant therapy depends largely on the histology of the tumor (i.e. the size and shape of its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e. how far cells have 'escaped' from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic CT scans and blood tests, in place of adjuvant treatment. Before 1970, survival rates from testicular cancer were low. Since the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy, chiefly platinum-based drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin, the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease. In the UK, a similar trend has emerged: since improvements in treatment, survival rates have risen rapidly to cure rates of over 95%. ===Radiation therapy=== Radiation may be used to treat stage II seminoma cancers, or as adjuvant (preventative) therapy in the case of stage I seminomas, to minimize the likelihood that tiny, non-detectable tumors exist and will spread (in the inguinal and para-aortic lymph nodes). Radiation is ineffective against and is therefore never used as a primary therapy for nonseminoma. ===Chemotherapy=== ==== Non-seminoma ==== Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non-seminoma when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (that is, stage 2B or 3). The standard chemotherapy protocol is three, or sometimes four, rounds of Bleomycin-Etoposide-Cisplatin (BEP). BEP as a first-line treatment was first reported by Professor Michael Peckham in 1983. The landmark trial published in 1987 which established BEP as the optimum treatment was conducted by Dr. Lawrence Einhorn at Indiana University. An alternative, equally effective treatment involves the use of four cycles of Etoposide-Cisplatin (EP). Lymph node surgery may also be performed after chemotherapy to remove masses left behind (stage 2B or more advanced), particularly in the cases of large nonseminomas. ==== Seminoma ==== As an adjuvant treatment, use of chemotherapy as an alternative to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.). Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of carboplatin, typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful adjuvant treatment, with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of radiotherapy. The concept of carboplatin as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. However, very long- term data on the efficacy of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting do not exist. Since seminoma can recur decades after the primary tumor is removed, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy should remain vigilant and not assume they are cured 5 years after treatment. ==Prognosis== Treatment of testicular cancer is one of the success stories of modern medicine, with sustained response to treatment in more than 90% of cases, regardless of stage. In 2011 overall cure rates of more than 95% were reported, and 80% for metastatic disease‚Äîthe best response by any solid tumor, with improved survival being attributed primarily to effective chemotherapy. By 2013 more than 96 per cent of the 2,300 men diagnosed each year in the U.K. were deemed cured, a rise by almost a third since the 1970s, the improvement attributed substantially to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. In the United States, when the disease is treated while it is still localized, more than 99% of people survive 5 years. ===Surveillance=== For many patients with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery may not be appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead. The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, will depend on the type of cancer (non-seminoma or seminoma), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the many patients who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with metastases (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative ‚Äúadjuvant‚Äù treatments, but the patients have to be prepared to follow a prolonged series of visits and tests. For both non-seminomas and seminomas, surveillance tests generally include physical examination, blood tests for tumor markers, chest x-rays and CT scanning. However, the requirements of a surveillance program differ according to the type of disease since, for seminoma patients, relapses can occur later and blood tests are not as good at indicating relapse. CT scans are performed on the abdomen (and sometimes the pelvis) and also the chest in some hospitals. Chest x-rays are increasingly preferred for the lungs as they give sufficient detail combined with a lower false-positive rate and significantly smaller radiation dose than CT. The frequency of CT scans during surveillance should ensure that relapses are detected at an early stage while minimizing the radiation exposure. For patients treated for stage I non-seminoma, a randomised trial (Medical Research Council TE08) showed that, when combined with the standard surveillance tests described above, 2 CT scans at 3 and 12 months were as good as 5 over 2 years in detecting relapse at an early stage. For patients treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, there have been no randomized trials to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST. This is assessing how often scans should take place and whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used instead of CT scans. MRI is being investigated because it does not expose the patient to radiation and so, if it is shown to be as good at detecting relapses, it may be preferable to CT. For more advanced stages of testicular cancer, and for those cases in which radiation therapy or chemotherapy was administered, the extent of monitoring (tests) after treatment will vary on the basis of the circumstances, but normally should be done for five years in uncomplicated cases and for longer in those with higher risks of relapse. ===Fertility=== A man with one remaining testis may maintain fertile. However, sperm banking may be appropriate for men who still plan to have children, since fertility may be adversely affected by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. A man who loses both testicles will be infertile after the procedure, though he may elect to bank viable, cancer-free sperm prior to the procedure. ==Epidemiology== Globally testicular cancer resulted in 8,300 deaths in 2013 up from 7,000 deaths in 1990. Testicular cancer has the highest prevalence in the U.S. and Europe, and is uncommon in Asia and Africa. Worldwide incidence has doubled since the 1960s, with the highest rates of prevalence in Scandinavia, Germany, and New Zealand. Although testicular cancer is most common among men aged 15‚Äì40 years, it has three peaks: infancy through the age of four as teratomas and yolk sac tumors, ages 25‚Äì40 years as post-pubertal seminomas and nonseminomas, and from age 60 as spermatocytic tumors. Germ cell tumors of the testis are the most common cancer in young men between the ages of 15 and 35 years. ===United States=== In the United States, about 8,900 cases are diagnosed a year. The risk of testicular cancer in white men is approximately 4-5 times the risk in black men, and more than three times that of Asian American men.Some facts about testicular cancer, American Cancer Society. The risk of testicular cancer in Latinos and American Indians is between that of white and Asian men. The cause of these differences is unknown. ===United Kingdom=== In the UK, approximately 2,000 people are diagnosed a year.CancerStats, 2007 UK incidence data , Cancer Research UK. Over a lifetime, the risk is roughly 1 in 200 (0.5%). It is the 16th most common cancer in men. It accounts for less than 1% of cancer deaths in men (around 60 men died in 2012). ==Other animals== Testicular tumors occur also in animals. In horses, these include interstitial cell tumors and teratomas. Typically, the former are found in older stallions (affected stallions may become extremely vicious, suggesting excessive production of androgen), and the latter are found in young horses and are large. ==References== == External links == * Ball Checker, self-exam app from the Testicular Cancer Society * Testicular Cancer - detailed guide from the American Cancer Society * Testicular Cancer - National Health Service information and resource page (UK) *Testicular cancer statistics from Cancer Research UK Category:Men's health Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Testicle disorders Category:Urological neoplasia ","title":"Testicular cancer"},{"id":"300228","text":"Sir Charles Richard Bean (born 16 September 1953) is a British economist and was Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England from 1 July 2008 until 30 June 2014.

It is a member of FIFA, UEFA and the IFAB. Established in 1876, it is the third- oldest national association in the world, and one of the four associations, along with the English Football Association, Scottish Football Association, Irish Football Association and FIFA, that make up the International Football Association Board, responsible for the Laws of the Game. ==History== The Wynnstay Arms Hotel, Wrexham The FAW was founded at a meeting held on 2 February 1876 at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel in Wrexham, initially to formalise the arrangements for the forthcoming match against Scotland. In May 1876, a further meeting was called, this time in the ballroom of the Wynnstay Arms Hotel in Ruabon where the name \\"Football Association of Wales\\" was agreed and the constitution drawn up. The arguments and discussions continued so long that the local policeman came in to call time. > \\"Sadly we have no record of the words actually used by the police constable > as he stood sternly surveying the scene in the Wynnstay Arms, Ruabon, on > that May night in 1876; but what they amounted to was that even if the > gentlemen were busy forming the Football Association of Wales it was past > closing time so would they mind forming it somewhere else‚Ä¶ \\"100 Years of > Welsh Soccer ‚Äì The Official History of The Football Association of Wales. > Peter Corrigan, 1976. The Wynnstay Arms Hotel, Ruabon, where the constitution of the FAW was agreed upon Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn was in attendance; as the local JP (and also the sitting Member of Parliament), he went next door, opened the court, extended the hotel's licensing hours and thus enabled the meeting to continue. The meeting ended with Llewelyn Kenrick appointed as the first chairman and honorary secretary with John Hawley Edwards as first treasurer. Kenrick continued to serve the FAW until 1884, when he left, probably because of the trend towards professionalism. In 1897, when the FAW secretary was charged with fraud, Kenrick returned to guide the association through the crisis. He made the final break a few months later over the minor issue of the allocation of gate money to Welsh Cup semi-finalists and finalists. Inspired by the success of the FA Cup, in 1877 the FAW ran the inaugural Welsh Cup competition. The trophy was intended to raise the standard of play and organisation of football in Wales. As such English border clubs were invited to participate. The prominent north-south divide within Wales meant that the association did not set up a national league. By the twentieth century Wales‚Äô senior clubs were competing in English league competitions thus relegating the lower standard and less glamorous Welsh Cup in importance. The allocation of a place in the European Cup Winners Cup from 1960 did boost interest in the competition but it has remained secondary in the priorities of Wales‚Äô leading clubs. The FAW is financially reliant on the proceeds of international matches. A lack of success on the pitch, Wales‚Äô unstable economy and a reoccurring inability to pick its star players have all meant that the association has struggled to achieve financial security. In the second half of the 20th century this was compounded by a failure to take full advantage of the new commercial and television opportunities that the wider game has enjoyed. On occasions financial problems have led the FAW to stage Wales‚Äô home matches in English stadia where capacities were larger than at domestic grounds. The FAW's inability to always pick the best players for the national side was rooted in the Welsh game's subservience to English football. As a foreign association, the FAW had no powers to demand players employed outside Wales be released for its international games. With Wales‚Äô best players traditionally employed by English clubs, her national team was reliant on clubs‚Äô willingness to release players. This caused reoccurring tensions as the Football League and its clubs tried to impose their authority over the national associations. Many of the FAW's members have also always been affiliated to the FA thus creating an uncertainty over the association's responsibilities and powers. Its unwillingness and inability to assert its independence was illustrated by it following the FA out of FIFA in 1919 and 1928, only to rejoin when its English counterparts did in 1946. Before World War II, like Wales as a whole, the FAW's ambitions for recognition were firmly within a British context. Her first international against opponents from beyond Britain was not until a match against France in 1933. The FAW's internal relationships were no easier due to a history of tension between members from north and south. Before World War II it did not even have complete control over football in the whole nation. The South Wales and Monmouthshire FA (founded in 1893) essentially acted as an independent association for all purposes except the national team. Although the south was represented on the FAW, the north effectively retained control of its decision-making council until the 1970s. The location of home internationals was the most common source of tension until 1989 when it was decided to hold all home games in the National Stadium at rugby's Cardiff Arms Park. When in 1985 the FAW moved its headquarter from Wrexham in the north to the capital Cardiff, the balance of power shifted firmly to the south. Previous logo used until 2019 By the 1980s there was concern within the FAW that its very existence was under threat. The UK's four independent associations within a single state were unique and the result of football's British origins. As pressure grew from non-European associations for a greater say in the running of football, Britain's special position became vulnerable. The case for Wales as a football nation was particularly weak in foreign eyes given the absence of any national league. Thus the FAW founded the League of Wales in 1992 to try and ensure its very future. Over 100 years after the formation of its national association, Wales finally became a football nation with its own national league. Yet despite the entry to European competitions that the league offered, Welsh clubs playing in England were less than enthusiastic about its prospects and a prolonged battle with the association began. This ended up in the High Court and defeat for the FAW in its attempt to coerce clubs to join the League of Wales. The league and the FAW emerged with their credibility and finances damaged, while Wales‚Äô best teams and players continue to play outside the immediate jurisdiction of their national association. The 1990s also saw the FAW struggle to establish its credibility with Welsh fans. Its choice of national manager, the weaknesses of its national league and its unmeritocratic committee structure have left the association vulnerable to public criticism. However, in the 21st century, the FAW modernised, developed innovative marketing strategies and concentrated on improving its relationships with fans and being seen as an important Welsh cultural institution. This centred on its Together Stronger campaign and culminated in qualification for Euro 2016. The FAW is also responsible for all disciplinary actions against players in teams associated with the FAW. This includes Welsh teams playing in the English football pyramid, superseding the English FA disciplinary system with the exception of Cardiff City and Swansea City A.F.C.. ==Structure== The FAW is based at Neptune Court, Vanguard Way, Cardiff. It is governed by a council including nineteen councillors who are either elected, or appointed every three years. In 2012, chief executive Jonathan Ford claimed the FAW had an income of ¬£14 million, funded from FIFA, UEFA, grants, sponsorship and TV revenue. All finances were spent on the further development of the game. In 2013, Dragon Park, the Wales National Football Development Centre, opened in Newport. ==See also== * Wales national football team * List of football clubs in Wales ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Wales at FIFA site * Wales at UEFA site * A Bibliography of Association Football in Wales Category:Sports organizations established in 1876 Wales Category:Sports governing bodies in Wales Category:Organisations based in Cardiff Category:1876 establishments in Wales Category:Sport in Cardiff Category:Professional associations based in Wales ","title":"Football Association of Wales"},{"id":"300240","text":"The papacy has been surrounded by numerous legends. Among the most famous are the claims that the papal tiara bears the Number of the Beast inscriptions, that a woman was once elected pope, or that the current pope will be the last. The latter claim is false for every known pope barring the incumbent, but it remains theoretically possible. ==Vicarius Filii Dei== One misconception surrounding the papal tiara suggests that the words (Latin for \\"Vicar of the Son of God\\") exist on the side of one of the tiaras. The story centres on the widely made claim that, when numerised (i.e., when those letters in the 'title' that have Roman numeral value are added together as in a chronogram) they produce the number 666, described in the Book of Revelation as the Number of the Beast (the Antichrist), who wears multiple crowns (identified by some as the triple tiara). This claim has been made by some Protestant sects who believe that the Pope, as head of the Roman Catholic Church, is the Beast or the False Prophet mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However, a detailed examination of the existing tiaras shows no such decoration. Further, is not among the titles of the Pope; the closest match is (\\"Vicar of Christ\\", also rendered in English as \\"Vicar of Jesus Christ\\"), the numerical values of which do not add up to 666, but to 214. There is also a dispute on the numerology of . Latin does not have the letter 'U' but instead uses 'V'; only if one uses the correct Latin spelling VICARIVS¬∑FILII¬∑DEI is the total produced (VICIVILIIDI = 5 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 50 + 1 + 1 + 500 + 1 = 666). Otherwise, the numbers add up to 661. ==Pope Joan== The claim that a woman, often called Pope Joan, became pope first appeared in a Dominican chronicle in 1250. It soon spread Europe-wide through preaching friars. The story grew in embellishment but centred on a set of claims. The period for this claim is traditionally given as AD 855‚Äì858, between the reigns of Leo IV and Benedict III; however, this possibility is unlikely, because Leo IV died on 17 July 855 and Benedict III was elected as his successor on 29 September 855. Jean de Mailly, a French Dominican at Metz, places the story in the year 1099, in his , which dates from approximately 1250 and gives what is almost certainly the earliest account of the woman who became known as Pope Joan. His compatriot Stephen of Bourbon acknowledges this by placing her rule at approximately 1100. Also, Rosemary and Darrell Pardoe, authors of The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend, is assuming that a more plausible time-frame would be 1086‚Äì1108, when there were a lot of antipopes, and the reign of the legitimate popes Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II was not always established in Rome, since this city was occupied by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and later sacked by the Normans. Generally, there are two versions of the legend. *In the first, an English woman, called Joan, went to Athens with her lover, and studied there. *In the second, a German woman called Giliberta was born in Mainz. \\"Joan\\" disguises herself as a monk, called Joannes Anglicus. In time, she rose to the highest office of the church, becoming a pope. After two or five years of reign, \\"Pope Joan\\" became pregnant and, during an Easter procession, she gave birth to the child on the streets when she fell off a horse. She was publicly stoned to death by the astonished crowd, and according to the legend, removed from the Vatican archives. As a consequence, certain traditions stated that popes throughout the medieval period were required to undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special chair with a hole in the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure. In a seventeenth-century study, Protestant historian David Blondel argued that 'Pope Joan' is a fictitious story. The story may well be a satire that came to be believed as reality. This view is generally accepted among historians. ==Prophecy of the Popes== According to the Prophecy of the Popes, some interpretations hold that after Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned on 28 February 2013, there will be one pope left before the destruction of Rome. This individual is labelled by the prophecy as Petrus Romanus. ==Documents of Jesus Christ== It is sometimes claimed that there exists a collection of documents that directly refer to Jesus, such as the execution order for Jesus signed by Pontius Pilate, or were personally written by Jesus, explaining to his followers how to conduct the formation of the Catholic Church after his death, or even the exact date of his return to judge mankind. These documents are said to be a closely guarded secret of the Catholic Church, and supposedly are hidden in the Vatican Secret Archives, or at past times in an underground vault if Nazi Germany would invade the Vatican. However, there is no solid evidence for any of these claims; in history, only one document has ever been attributed to Jesus himself, the Letter of Christ and Abgarus. Scholars generally believe that those letters were fabricated, probably in the 3rd century AD. Even in ancient times, Augustine and Jerome contended that Jesus wrote nothing at all during his life. The correspondence was rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius I and a Roman synod (c. 495). ==Jewish legends== Jewish legends related to the papacy include the Jewish pope Andreas and also concerning the fate of the Menorah, which some, including former Israeli Minister of Religious Affairs Shimon Shetreet, have believed is being held in secret by the Vatican, and the idea of hidden Jewish manuscripts in the Vatican Secret Archives. ==See also== *Vatican conspiracy theories ==References== ==Further reading== *Eamon Duffy, Saints & Sinners: A History of the Popes (Yale Nota Bene, 2001) *Joseph McCabe, A History of the Popes, Watts & Co, (1939) London. *Colin Morris, The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050‚Äì1250 (Cambridge, 1990) *K.

Accessed 2012-6-15. daughter of Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence and his mistress Taddea Malaspina. Following her father's assassination, she was reared at the court of Cosimo I de' Medici and married advantageously twice. ==Early life== A child named Giulia Romola, with an unknown father, was baptized in Florence on November 5, 1535; this was probably Giulia. Close to this date, her father had commissioned a portrait of himself drawing a female profile in silverpoint. Art historians believe the portrait may have been intended as a gift for his mistress, Taddea Malaspina, the sister of the marchioness of Massa, to commemorate the birth of their second child, Giulia. Giulia also had an older full brother, Giulio di Alessandro de' Medici, and at least one half-sister, Porzia de' Medici. After her father's assassination in 1537 and the ensuing power struggle among the Medici for control of Florence and of the family, Giulia and her brother Giulio were taken from their mother and placed under the guardianship of Alessandro's successor, Cosimo I de' Medici. Cosimo promised to treat the children well and their rooms were as opulent as those of his own children. Maria Salviati, the mother of Cosimo I, supervised the nurseries and watched over Giulia's bedside anxiously when the little girl became ill in February 1542. Giulia survived the fever, but her companion in the nursery, Cosimo I's illegitimate daughter Bia de' Medici, died.Langdon (2006), pp. 42-50 As she grew up, Giulia was completely integrated into life at court and was educated to a high standard, as were the daughters and other female wards of Cosimo I. As much attention was paid to Giulia's appearance as to that of Cosimo I's daughters. When she was twelve or thirteen, Cosimo I's wife Eleonora of Toledo was outraged because Giulia's riding cloak did not look right; it was not decorated as she had ordered and it was the wrong length.Langdon (2006), p. 128 Courtiers noted that the young Giulia was \\"the image of her father.\\" Cosimo arranged an advantageous marriage for her with Francesco Cantelmo, the Duke of Popoli, in 1550, when she was about fifteen years old, and provided a dowry for her of an amount that would be worth about eight million United States dollars today. ==Pontormo portrait== Giulia de' Medici as a child with Maria Salviati in a painting by Pontormo. Giulia is likely the child depicted in a portrait by Pontormo which shows Maria Salviati with a young child. The child had been painted out of the portrait and her image was not detected until 1937. Some art historians once identified the child as a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait appears to be a little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might be one of the first in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry.Langdon (2006), p. 40 This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. Maike Vogt-L√ºerssen argues in an article in Medicea ‚Äì Rivista interdisciplinare di studi medicei that the child in the portrait with Maria Salviati is actually Salviati's granddaughter Bia de' Medici. She believes that the child does not resemble the known portrait of an adult Giulia de' Medici and that the relationship between Maria Salviati and Giulia was not close enough to have warranted a portrait. Most group portraits were of family members with close blood ties.http://www.kleio.org/de/buecher/true_faces_medici.html ==Later life== Giulia's paternity was not seen as a disadvantage at court. Her descent from the main Medici line was honored; her father's assassination was compared with the assassination of Julius Caesar by Brutus. Through her mother, Giulia was related to Pope Innocent VIII. She displayed great pride in her family lineage and self-assurance. After the death of her first husband, Francesco Cantelmo, in 1555, the artist Alessandro Allori painted a second well-known portrait of Giulia, who was now in her mid-twenties. She was portrayed as a widow. To her left in the portrait is an intricately carved chair. Its sloping arm may represent steep terrain; art historian Gabrielle Langdon said she detected a faint climbing figure there which may represent Hercules. The Choice of Hercules was a popular allegory during the Renaissance about the victory of virtuous action over vice. Mario de Valdes y Cocom, a historian of the African diaspora, argues that the sloping arm of the chair also represents Monte della Verna, which Saint Bonaventure, a Christian scholastic theologian and philosopher, visited and where he was inspired to write his Itinerarium mentis in Deum. Bonaventure visited La Verna because this was the location where Francis of Assisi had a vision of a six-winged seraph and received the stigmata. Mario de Valdes y Cocom writes that Giulia's grandmother Simonetta, who was possibly of North African descent, married a mule driver from Collevecchio, a site associated with Monte della Verna. Her father Alessandro was insulted by people who called him Alessandro Collevecchio. Historians believe that the artist is alluding to Bonaventure's Neo-Platonic view of God as \\"the Divine Darkness\\". Some modern scholars see the painting as Giulia's response to criticism of her grandmother's north African descent and marriage to the mule driver from Collevecchio.Giulia de' Medici and her Portrait at PBS.org During her widowhood she often stayed at the Augustinian convent of San Clemente on San Gallo, where her sister Porzia was abbess. Giulia is recorded as a patron of this convent as well as other Augustinian convents. A second advantageous marriage was arranged for her soon after with Bernadetto de' Medici, a first cousin of Cosimo I. She married him on August 14, 1559. Their son Alessandro, who was named for her father, was born the following year on December 17, 1560. During the early years of her marriage to Bernadetto, they entertained lavishly and she may have accompanied her husband on diplomatic missions. Sometime in the 1560s, her relationship with her former guardian may have cooled when Giulia insisted that she be treated as an equal to Cosimo I's mistress, who was regarded with general disdain at court. Other sources indicate that she and her husband were still in good standing with the court when they moved to Naples in 1567. There they battled successfully to win the title and lands to the principality of Ottaviano (see also Princes of Ottajano), which their descendants hold today. ==Notes== ==References== *Langdon, Gabrielle (2006).

Evolved from the Vulgar Latin of Iberia, the most widely spoken Iberian Romance languages are Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan- Valencian-Balear and Galician.Ethnologue: Statistical Summaries These languages also have their own regional and local varieties. Based on mutual intelligibility, Dalby counts seven \\"outer\\" languages, or language groups: Galician-Portuguese, Spanish, Astur-Leonese, \\"Wider\\"-Aragonese, \\"Wider\\"-Catalan, Proven√ßal+Lengadocian, and \\"Wider\\"-Gascon. In addition to those languages, there are a number of Portuguese-based creole languages and Spanish-based creole languages, for instance Papiamento. ==Origins and development== Linguistic map of southwestern Europe Like all Romance languages, the Iberian Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin, the nonstandard (in contrast to Classical Latin) form of the Latin language spoken by soldiers and merchants throughout the Roman Empire. With the expansion of the empire, Vulgar Latin came to be spoken by inhabitants of the various Roman-controlled territories. Latin and its descendants have been spoken in Iberia since the Punic Wars, when the Romans conquered the territory (see Roman conquest of Hispania). The modern Iberian Romance languages were formed roughly through the following process: * The Romanization of the local Iberian population. * The diversification of Latin spoken in Iberia, with slight differences depending on location. * Development of Old Spanish, Galician- Portuguese, Astur-Leonese and Navarro-Aragonese (the West Iberian languages) and early Catalan language from Latin between the eighth and tenth centuries. The genetic classification of early Catalan and Occitan is uncertain. Some scholars place it within Ibero-Romance (hence it would be East Iberian), others place it within Gallo-Romance. * Further development into modern Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Asturian, Leonese, Mirandese, etc. (see languages of Iberia: languages of Spain, languages of Portugal and languages of Andorra) between the fifteenth and twentieth centuries. == Common traits between Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan == This list points to common traits of these Iberian subsets, especially when compared to the other Romance languages in general. Thus, changes such as Catalan vuit/huit and Portuguese oito vs. Spanish ocho are not shown here, as the change -it- > -ch- is exclusive to Spanish among the Iberian Romance languages. === Between Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan === ==== Phonetic ==== * The length difference between r/rr is preserved through phonetic means, so that the second consonant in words such as caro and carro are not the same in any of the three. * Latin U remains and is not changed to . === Between Spanish and Catalan, but not Portuguese === ==== Phonetic ==== * The length difference between n/nn is preserved through phonetic means, so that the last consonant in words such as a√±o (Latin anno) and mano are not the same. * The length difference between l/ll is preserved through phonetic means, so that the second consonant in words such as valle and vale are not the same. This also affects some initial L in Catalan. === Between Spanish and Portuguese, but not Catalan === ==== Phonetic ==== * Initial Latin CL/FL/PL are palatalized further than in Italian, and become indistinguishable (to CH in Portuguese and LL in Spanish). * Final e/o remains (although its pronunciation changed in Portuguese, and some dialects drop final E). ==== Grammatical ==== * The synthetic preterite, inherited from earlier stages of Latin, remains the main past tense. === Between Portuguese and Catalan, but not Spanish === ==== Phonetic ==== * Velarized L , which existed in Latin, is preserved at the end of syllables, and was later generalized to all positions in most dialects of both languages. * Stressed Latin e/o, both open and closed, is preserved so and does not become a diphthong. ==Statuses== Politically (not linguistically), there are four major officially recognised Iberian Romance languages: *Spanish (see names given to the Spanish language), is the national and official language of 21 countries, including Spain. Spanish is the fourth-most widely spoken language in the world, with over 570 total million speakers, and the second- most widely spoken native language.Ethnologue: Table 3. Languages with at least 3 million first-language speakers It has a number of dialects and varieties. * Portuguese, official language in nine countries including Portugal and Brazil. After Spanish, Portuguese is the second most widely spoken Romance language in the world with over 250 million speakers, currently ranked seventh by number of native speakers.See Ethnologue Various Portuguese dialects exist outside of the European standard spoken in Portugal. * Catalan is the official language in AndorraConstitution of Andorra (Article 2.1) and co-official in the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Valencian Community (where it is known as Valencian), and the Italian city of Alghero. It is also spoken in the French department of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales (Northern Catalonia) without official recognition. Catalan is closely related to Occitan,Bec, Pierre (1973), Manuel pratique d'occitan moderne, coll. Connaissance des langues, Paris: PicardSumien, Domergue (2006), La standardisation pluricentrique de l'occitan: nouvel enjeu sociolinguistique, d√©veloppement du lexique et de la morphologie, coll. Publications de l'Association Internationale d'√âtudes Occitanes, Turnhout: Brepols with the two languages having been treated as one in studies by Occitanist linguists (such as Pierre Bec, or more recently Domergue Sumien). When not treated as one, the two languages are widely classified together as Occitano-Romance languages, a group which is itself sometimes grouped with the Gallo-Romance languages. Catalan has two main dialectal branches (Eastern and Western Catalan) and several subdialects, and is spoken by about 10 million people (ranking the seventy-fifth most spoken language in the world),Ethnologue mostly in five variants: Central Catalan, Northern Catalan, Northwestern Catalan, Valencian and Balearic. * Galician, co-official in Galicia and also spoken in adjacent western parts of Asturias and Castile and Le√≥n. Closely related to Portuguese, with Spanish influence. It shares the same origin as Portuguese, from the medieval Galician-Portuguese. Modern Galician is spoken by around 3.2 million people and is ranked 160th by number of speakers. Additionally, the Asturian language, although not an official language, is recognised by the autonomous community of Asturias. It is one of the Astur-Leonese languages with Mirandese, which in Portugal has official status as minority language.See: Euromosaic report ==Family tree== Ibero- Romance languages around the world Ibero-Romance languages in Iberia and Southern France The Iberian Romance languages are a conventional group of Romance languages. Many authors use the term in a geographical sense although they are not necessarily a phylogenetic group (the languages grouped as Iberian Romance may not all directly descend from a common ancestor). Phylogenetically, there is disagreement about what languages should be considered within the Iberian Romance group; for example, some authors consider that East Iberian, also called Occitano-Romance, could be more closely related to languages of northern Italy (or also Franco-Proven√ßal, the langues d'o√Øl and Rhaeto-Romance). A common conventional geographical grouping is the following: *East Iberian *West Iberian Daggers (‚Ä†) indicate extinct languages *Iberian Romance languages **East Iberian (alternatively classified as Gallo-Romance languages) ***Catalan ***Judaeo-Catalan‚Ä† ***Occitan **West Iberian ***Asturleonese ****Asturian ****Cantabrian ****Extremaduran ****Leonese ****Mirandese ***Castilian ****Spanish ****Judaeo-Spanish ***Galician-Portuguese ****Fala ****Galician ****Judaeo-Portuguese‚Ä† ****Portuguese *** Pyrenean‚ÄìMozarabic ****Navarro-Aragonese‚Ä† *****Aragonese *****Judaeo-Aragonese‚Ä† ****Mozarabic‚Ä† ==See also== *Languages of Iberia *Barranquenho *Iberophone ==References== ==External links== *Spanish words of Latin origin Category:Languages of Spain Category:Languages of Portugal pl:Jƒôzyki zachodnioroma≈Ñskie ","title":"Iberian Romance languages"},{"id":"300253","text":"Patient zero may refer to: * In medical science, the index case or the first documented patient in a disease epidemic within a population ** Ga√´tan Dugas (1953‚Äì1984), once considered to be the initial source of AIDS in North America, and the origin of the term \\"patient zero\\" * Patient Zero (audio drama), based on the television series Doctor Who * Patient Zero (film), a 2018 fantasy-horror film * \\"Patient Zero\\" (The Outer Limits), a 2001 television episode * Patient Zero: A Joe Ledger Novel, a 2009 novel by Jonathan Maberry * Patient Zero, a demoscene production by Farbrausch *Patient 0Ã∏, an album by American deathcore band Enterprise Earth (together with the title track \\"Patient Zero\\") * \\"Patient Zero\\", a song from the album Infected by the metal band HammerFall == See also == * Zero Patience, a musical about AIDS ","title":"Patient zero"},{"id":"300257","text":"is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis home video game console. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. The game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the powerful Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button. Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \\"Sonic Team\\" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Yuji Naka. Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. ==Gameplay== level, Green Hill Zone Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling‚Äìplatform video game. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground. At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life. The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues. Scattered around each level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, all his rings will scatter. He can recollect some of them again before they disappear. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, bottomless pits, or running out of time, kill Sonic regardless of rings or other protection. The game is split into six principal zones, followed by a short 'Final Zone'. Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles. Each main zone is split into three acts, all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight. For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons. After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level \\"Final Zone\\" for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment. Destroying Robotnik's machine ends the game. A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik. Optionally, if Sonic reaches the end of any zone's Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a \\"special stage\\". In the Special Stages, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a number of continues for each multiple of 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze. Colliding with any of the blocks marked \\"GOAL\\" ends the level. ===Plot=== In an attempt to steal the six Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island inside aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the emeralds are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos Emeralds not collected by the player. == Development == === Background and character design === In 1990, Sega ordered its in-house development studio to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company. Sega president Hayao Nakayama wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse. Sega had competition with Nintendo, who was dominant at the time (particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 featuring their mascot Mario), and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry. Although the company had some limited success with Genesis ports of its arcade games, it knew this would not be enough. The team developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Originally, Sega used Alex Kidd as their mascot, but he was considered too similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory. Development emphasized speed, so Sega eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals, as well as fast creatures like kangaroos and squirrels. One idea, a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware. The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball, their idea for an attacking move. Designers then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough, so they focused on two animals with spikes: armadillos and hedgehogs. The hedgehog character, first proposed by Naoto Ohshima, prevailed, although the armadillo would later become the basis for Mighty the Armadillo, who later appeared in 1993's SegaSonic the Hedgehog. Ohshima has since admitted that he created Sonic's basic design by combining Felix the Cat's head with Mickey Mouse's body. Ohshima explained that his inspiration for creating Sonic was Sega wanting a game that would be successful in the United States and a new mascot concurrently. He was working with Naka with a prototype game, and Ohshima was thinking of design ideas with the toy and stationery department. Before Sonic was chosen, other characters, including a rabbit and a bearded man who would ultimately become Dr. Robotnik, were created. One summer, Ohshima went on vacation to New York, taking sketches with him. He went to Central Park and asked locals for their opinions on them, and Sonic was the favorite. Ohshima explained that this was because he wanted support for his ideas. Sonic was originally teal-colored, then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo. His shoes had buckles through the inspiration of Michael Jackson's boots on the album cover for Bad and the red and white color scheme of Santa Claus, whom Ohshima saw as the most \\"famous character in the world\\". Sonic's spikes were emphasized to make him look sleeker, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping (so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button). The new character was originally named \\"Mr. Needlemouse\\", but the eight-member team changed his name to \\"Sonic\\" and took the name Sonic Team. Ohshima stated that \\"Sonic\\" was chosen because it represented speed. Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full-scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes. The antagonist ended up being named \\"Dr. Eggman\\" in Japan and \\"Dr. Robotnik\\" in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega's American and Japanese divisions. === Concept and programming === With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them through his work on Phantasy Star and the Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game is because he ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow. Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just Naka and Ohshima. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name \\"Defeat Mario\\", Naka and Ohshima began work, but encountered problems: Ohshima's Rabbit proved hard to program. Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up. Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down. The gameplay originated with a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka's prototype was a platform game with a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara. Yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California. In designing the gameplay, Naka was inspired by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly. Naka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months. Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis' technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, which took over six months. According to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that had been considered impossible on the console. The team intended to add a two-player mode displayed via split-screen, but Naka's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement it. A two-player mode appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), whereby the second player controls Sonic's sidekick Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower. Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in Knuckles' Chaotix in 1995. The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \\"Se-ga!\\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound. Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \\"very interesting\\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. === Music === Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y≈´z≈ç Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. Nakamura said the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it \\"impossible\\". He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album Million Kisses. On October 19, 2011, over 20 years after the release, a three-disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Nakamura's demo recordings before they were programmed into the Genesis, and the third has songs by Dreams Come True and their associated Akon remixes. === Packaging and release === Game-package illustrator Akira Watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters \\"colorful\\", using clear lines and gradation to \\"finish them neatly\\". According to Watanabe, the developers asked him to create a package design \\"similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages\\" ‚Äì something \\"original\\" and \\"stylish\\". The game was not revealed until the January 1991 International Consumer Electronics Show because Sega wanted to wait until the right time and because they saw an opportunity to \\"steal the show\\". At the show, Sonic the Hedgehog was believed to be the most impressive game shown, and won the CES award for innovation. Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted reassurance that the character would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. It was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign, promoting Sonic as its mascot. == Other versions and rereleases == === 8-bit version === A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in late 1991 for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16-bit version, though some level themes and digital assets are different and Chaos Emeralds are scattered throughout levels rather than special stages. Gameplay as a whole is simplified; the level design is flatter and has a larger focus on exploration, with no vertical loops, and Sonic cannot re-collect his rings after being hit. The game has a different soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, which includes adaptations of music from the original version. It was the final game released for the Master System in North America. The Master System version was re- released for Wii's Virtual Console service in North America and Europe in August 2008. The Game Gear version was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on June 13, 2013, and included as an unlockable game in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut for GameCube and Windows and Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows. === Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis === To mark the game's fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was released on November 14, 2006. While the port is mostly identical to the original, it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, such as the ability to save game progress and the inclusion of the Spin Dash move. This version, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay. As a response to the poor reception and claims that the system could not handle the original game, Simon \\"Stealth\\" Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system. The unofficial version contains a complete Green Hill Zone and two special stages, as well as Tails and Knuckles as playable characters. === 2013 remaster === A remastered mobile port was released on iOS on May 15, 2013, with an Android version following the next day. This version was developed by Christian \\"Taxman\\" Whitehead and Simon Thomley of Headcannon from scratch using the Retro Engine, previously used in the 2011 remaster of Sonic CD. This port features several enhancements, such as widescreen graphics, the optional ability to Spin Dash, an additional special stage, a time attack mode, and the unlockable option to play as Tails or Knuckles; it additionally features a heavily expanded debug mode which allows for use of unused elements and elements from more recent games (such as the characters' super forms). The iOS version was updated in 2016, adding compatibility with Apple TV. ===3D Sonic the Hedgehog=== A Nintendo 3DS version, 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was released as part of the 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the code was restructured to take advantage of the 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start from any level. === Compilation releases === With its sequels for the Genesis, Sonic the Hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers through compilations. The first collection it appeared in was Sonic Compilation (1995) for the Genesis.Sonic Compilation instruction manual, p. 3. It has since appeared in Sonic Jam (1997) for the Sega Saturn, Sonic Mega Collection (2002) for the Nintendo GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus (2004) for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PSP, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Sonic Classic Collection (2010) for the Nintendo DS, Oculus Arcade for the Oculus Rift, and Sega Genesis Classics (2018) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. === Downloadable releases === Sonic the Hedgehog has been available for all three major seventh-generation video game consoles. It was part of the Wii Virtual Console at the service's 2006 introduction, and was released for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards. The game was released for the iPod Classic, iPod video, and video-capable iPod Nano models in 2007 and for Apple's iOS in April 2009. Sonic the Hedgehog became available on GameTap in September 2009. In October 2010, it was released on Windows via Steam. The game was ported to Android and released in December 2012. Additionally, it is an unlockable reward in the console versions of Sonic Generations. It was also made available on the Sega Forever service on iOS and Android in June 2017. A port for Nintendo Switch was released on September 20, 2018 as part of the Sega Ages line of rereleases. It adds features including the ability to use moves from Sonic 2 and Sonic Mania, a challenge mode, a time attack for the first stage, and features from the 3DS rereleases of the game and its sequel. ===Canceled versions=== U.S. Gold acquired the rights to make a version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST personal computers, but these went unreleased. Several screenshots exist, some of which resemble the 8-bit version. An enhanced port for the Sega CD was also planned, but was scrapped in favor of Sonic CD. == Reception == Sonic the Hedgehog was praised by critics, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings. It was considered Sega's answer to Nintendo's widely popular Mario series, as it was a platformer featuring the company's mascot. Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster, with brighter colors, and Super Mario World as having more \\"depth of play\\". Frank Ladoire of ' believed Sonic the Hedgehog was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Genesis is capable of \\"beautiful things\\" in the technical department. Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme \\"lively, but never garish\\", praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds \\"eye-popping\\" and \\"gorgeous\\", which was echoed by Mean Machines. The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of Dragon claimed the graphics made Sonic a possible contender for the best game of 1991 and GameZone called the animation \\"some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen\\". Julian Boardman of Raze praised the \\"colourful and highly detailed\\" backdrops and \\"fabulous\\" sprites. The music and sound effects were also well received; Dragon called them \\"great\\", and GameZone \\"amazing\\". Rand praised the \\"catchy\\" soundtrack, calling some of the sound effects \\"absolutely brilliant\\". Although Mean Machines called the songs \\"vaguely appealing\\", the sound effects were better appreciated. However, Boardman of Raze considered the music \\"a little boring\\". Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers. The difficulty was disputed, described as \\"impossible\\" by Rand and \\"average\\" by EGM. Rand said about the gameplay in general that it \\"plays like a dream\\"; according to GameZone it would enchant players for hours, and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping. Although EGM, Dragon, Paul of Mean Machines and Boardman of Raze praised the level design (especially the hidden rooms), Paul found losing all of one's rings frustrating. Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity, and has since been considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Frank Provo of GameSpot described the game as \\"one of the best platformers of all time\\", finding that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port \\"after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up\\". Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time. Writing in The Guardian, Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehogs emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players \\"learn through repetition rather than observation\\" as \\"the levels aren't designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough.\\" However, Stuart concluded that \\"sometimes in Sonic, when you get better, or through sheer luck, things take off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you're in the flow, sailing above the game's strange structure ... Sonic is incorrect game design and yet ... it's a masterpiece.\\" Mega ranked Sonic as its third- favorite Genesis game, and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th-greatest game of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success; the original Genesis version bundled with the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive hardware had sold over 15 million copies by February 2009, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008. Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible, and they later named it the best game available in 1991. == Legacy == Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console's popularity in North America. During October‚ÄìDecember 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market. Sonic the Hedgehog inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including Bubsy, Aero the Acro-Bat, James Pond 3, Earthworm Jim, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, and Radical Rex. \\"Animal with attitude\\" games carried over to the next generation of consoles, with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Sonic as a major inspiration. Sonic's success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released the following year. It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast. The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games, and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons comic books, novels, and toys. Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with over 140 million copies sold or downloaded worldwide across consoles, PC's, mobile phones and tablets by May 2014. The game's first level, Green Hill Zone, has been seen in later other games, such as Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Generations, Sonic Mania, Sonic Forces, and the Super Smash Bros. series. The game inspired a number of unofficial variants, including Somari, a pirated Nintendo Entertainment System conversion featuring Nintendo's Mario character in levels from the original Sonic game, Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix, a total conversion mod of the original game, and Sonic 1 Boomed, a ROM hack which implements Sonic's redesign from the Sonic Boom animated series. == Notes == == References == === Sources === * * == External links == * Official website Category:1991 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:IOS games Category:IPod games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Pack-in video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Sonic Team games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Tiger handheld games Category:Video games scored by Yuzo Koshiro Category:Video games set on fictional islands Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)"},{"id":"300258","text":"Bacolod is a highly urbanized city and the capital city of Negros Occidental, Philippines.

He served as the 39th Governor of Texas and as the 61st United States Secretary of the Treasury. He began his career as a Democrat and later became a Republican in 1973. Born in Floresville, Texas, Connally pursued a legal career after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin. During World War II, he served on the staff of James Forrestal and Dwight D. Eisenhower before transferring to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. After the war, he became an aide to Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. When Johnson assumed the vice presidency in 1961, he convinced President John F. Kennedy to appoint Connally to the position of United States Secretary of the Navy. Connally left the Kennedy Administration in December 1961 to run for Governor of Texas, and he held that position from 1963 to 1969. In 1963, Connally was riding in the presidential limousine during Kennedy's assassination, and was seriously wounded. During his governorship, he was a conservative Democrat. In 1971, Republican President Richard Nixon appointed Connally as his Treasury Secretary. In this position, Connally presided over the removal of the U.S. dollar from the gold standard, an event known as the Nixon shock. Connally stepped down from the Cabinet in 1972 to lead the Democrats for Nixon organization, which campaigned for Nixon's re-election. He was a candidate to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew after the latter resigned in 1973, but Nixon chose Gerald Ford instead. He sought the Republican nomination for president in the 1980 election, but withdrew from the race after the first set of primaries. Connally did not seek public office again after 1980 and died of pulmonary fibrosis in 1993. ==Early life and education== Connally was born on February 27, 1917, into a large family in Floresville, the seat of Wilson County, southeast of San Antonio. He was one of seven children born to Lela (n√©e Wright) and John Bowden Connally, a dairy and tenant farmer. His six siblings included four brothers: Golfrey, Merrill, Wayne and Stanford Connally, and sisters Carmen and Blanche. Connally attended Floresville High School and was one of the few graduates who attended college. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was the student body president and a member of the Friar Society. He subsequently graduated from the University of Texas School of Law and was admitted to the bar by examination. ==Military service== Connally served in the United States Navy during World War II, first as an aide to James V. Forrestal, then as part of the planning staff for the invasion of North Africa by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. He transferred to the South Pacific Theater, where he served with distinction. He was a fighter-plane director aboard the aircraft carrier USS Essex and was awarded the Bronze Star for bravery. He was shifted to another Essex-class aircraft carrier, the USS Bennington and was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was also involved in the campaigns in the Gilbert, Marshall, Ryukyu, and Philippine islands. He was discharged in 1946 at the rank of lieutenant commander.Charles Ashman, Connally: The Adventures of Big Bad John, New York: William Morrow & Company, 1974, p. 62 On his release from the navy, Connally practiced law in the Alvin Wirtz law firm, until Lyndon Baines Johnson, then a newly elected senator, persuaded him to return to Washington, D.C. to serve as a key aide. He had close ties with Johnson before his navy days and maintained them until the former president's death in 1973. ==Lawyer for Sid Richardson== Two of Connally's principal legal clients were the Texas oil tycoon Sid W. Richardson and Perry Bass, Richardson's nephew and partner, both of Fort Worth. Richardson's empire in the 1950s was estimated at $200 million to $1 billion. Under Richardson's tutelage, Connally gained experience in a variety of enterprises and received tips on real estate purchases. The work required the Connallys to relocate to Fort Worth. When Richardson died in 1959, Connally was named to the lucrative position of co-executor of the estate.Ashman, Connally, pp, 70‚Äì71 Connally was also involved in a reported clandestine deal to place the Texas Democrat Robert Anderson on the 1956 Republican ticket as vice president. Although the idea fell through when Dwight Eisenhower retained Richard Nixon in the second slot, Anderson received a million dollars for his efforts and a subsequent appointment as U.S. Treasury Secretary, the same position that Connally would fill for Nixon 14 years later in 1971. In another coincidence, Anderson had been Eisenhower's first Navy secretary, the post that Connally filled for John F. Kennedy in 1961.Ashman, Connally, pp. 70‚Äì71 ==From Navy secretary to governor== At the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles, Connally led supporters of Senator Lyndon Johnson. He claimed that John F. Kennedy, if nominated and elected, would be unable to serve as president for a full term because of Addison's disease and dependence on cortisone. Kennedy, however, had wrapped up the needed delegates for nomination before the convention even opened. Kennedy realized that he could not be elected without support of traditional Southern Democrats, most of whom had backed Johnson. Therefore, Johnson was offered the vice-presidential nomination.Ashman, Connally, p. 74 ===Secretary of the Navy=== At Johnson's request, in 1961 President Kennedy named Connally Secretary of the Navy. Connally resigned eleven months later to run for the Texas governorship. During Connally's secretaryship, the Navy had a budget of $14 billion and more than 1.2 million workers‚Äì600,000 in uniform and 650,000 civilian‚Äìstationed at 222 bases in the United States and 53 abroad.Ashman, Connally, p. 89 Connally directed the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea on a new kind of \\"gunboat diplomacy.\\" The landed in Naples, Italy, and brought gifts to children in an orphanage. Connally also ordered gifts for a hospital in Cannes, France that treated children with bone diseases, for poor Greek children on the island of Rhodes and for spastic children in Palermo, Italy. Presents were also sent to Turkish children in Cyprus and to a camp in Beirut for homeless Palestinian refugees.Ashman, Connally, pp. 90‚Äì01 The Bay of Pigs incident occurred under his watch. Connally fought hard to protect the Navy's role in the national space program, having vigorously opposed assigning most space research to the Air Force. Time termed Connally's year as Navy Secretary \\"a first-rate appointment.\\" Critics noted, however, that the brevity of Connally's tenure precluded any sustained or comprehensive achievements.Ashman, Connally, pp. 95‚Äì96 ===Running for governor=== Connally announced two weeks before Christmas of 1961 that he was leaving the position of Secretary of the Navy to return to Texas to seek the 1962 Democratic gubernatorial nomination. He would have to compete against the incumbent Marion Price Daniel, Sr., who was running for a fourth consecutive two-year term. Daniel was in political trouble following the enactment of a two-cent state sales tax in 1961, which had soured many voters on his administration. Daniel had let the tax become law without his signature but could have vetoed the measure. Former state Attorney General Will Wilson, who had run for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1961, also entered the gubernatorial campaign and was particularly critical of Johnson, who he claimed engineered Connally's candidacy. Other primary candidates were highway commissioner Marshall Formby of Plainview, another party conservative, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anti-communism the centerpiece of his campaign. Connally waged the most active campaign of any of the Democrats, traveling more than 22,000 miles across the state. He made 43 major speeches and appeared on multiple statewide and local telecasts. Connally ran as a conservative Democrat. He was placed in a primary runoff election against a liberal attorney from Houston favored by organized labor, Don Yarborough, no relation to Connally's long-term party nemesis U.S. Senator Ralph W. Yarborough. After winning the runoff against Yarborough by a close vote, Connally faced a determined bid by the conservative Republican and oilfield equipment executive Jack Cox, also of Houston. Cox, a former state representative from his native Stephens County, had run unsuccessfully two years earlier in the Democratic primary against Daniel. Connally received 847,036 ballots (54 percent) to Cox's 715,025 (45.6 percent). In the campaign, Connally made an issue of Cox having switched to the Republican party the previous year. Eleven years later, Connally made the same switch. Cox, as it turned out, was the strongest Republican gubernatorial candidate in Texas since 1924. Not until 1972, when Henry Grover carried the GOP banner, did the Republicans make a better showing for governor. Connally was a master campaign professional, having worked on several of Johnson's campaigns. He believed in the entourage and advance men, the practice of having staff aides checking out events and having press interviews on the run to demonstrate Connally's heavy schedule of commitments. Biographer Charles Ashman claims that Connally would have aides telephone airports which he would shortly visit and ask to page him for an urgent message. Such manipulation, he believed, impressed airport patrons, many of whom would also be Texas voters.Ashman, Connally, p. 228 ==Governor of Texas== Connally served as governor from 1963 until 1969. In the campaigns of 1964 and 1966, Connally defeated weak Republican challenges offered by Jack Crichton, a Dallas oil industrialist, and Thomas Everton Kennerly Sr. (1903‚Äì2000), of Houston, respectively. He prevailed with margins of 73.8 percent and 72.8 percent, respectively, giving him greater influence with the nearly all-Democratic legislature.Election Statistics, Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, Gubernatorial elections Connally was governor during a time of great expansion of higher education in Texas. He signed into law the creation of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. He appointed regents who backed the entry of women into previously all-male Texas A&M; University in College Station, having been prompted to take such action by State Senator William T. \\"Bill\\" Moore of Bryan, who in 1953 had first proposed the admission of women to the institution.Robert C. Borden, \\"Bull of the Brazos dies: Moore was champion of Texas A&M;,\\" Bryan-College Station Eagle, May 28, 1999, pp. 1‚Äì3 Governor Connally signing the bill that separated Arlington State College from the Texas A&M; University System in 1965 In 1965, Connally appointed Speaker Byron M. Tunnell to the Texas Railroad Commission, upon the retirement of 32-year veteran Ernest O. Thompson, a former mayor of Amarillo. This appointment enabled the future Connally business associate Ben Barnes of De Leon in Comanche County to succeed Tunnell and become the youngest Speaker in Texas history. As governor, Connally promoted HemisFair '68, the world's fair held in San Antonio, he believed would net the state an additional $12 million in direct taxes. A permanent Institute of Texan Cultures museum was an outgrowth of the fair. It was designed to be \\"a dramatic showcase, not only to Texans, but to all the world, of the host of diverse peoples from many lands whose blood and dreams built our state.\\"Quoted in Ashman, Connally, p. 109 There was some talk of Connally being selected as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, but the liberal Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine was instead chosen. Connally endorsed Humphrey and greeted the nominee at the Fort Worth airport and even reconciled for a month with intraparty rival Ralph Yarborough. Ashman, however, claims that Connally was \\"privately helping Nixon, recruiting a number of influential Texans, members of both parties, to work for the Republican candidate.\\"Quoted in Ashman, Connally, p. 167 Ben Barnes recounts a story that Connally shouted at Hubert Humphrey in a private meeting at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and accused the vice president of being disloyal to President Johnson by trying to soft-pedal Johnson's position regarding Vietnam. Barnes said that the \\"tongue-lashing\\" Connally gave Humphrey was \\"an epic... He orally spanked that man as hard as I've ever seen anyone chastised. He either strengthened Hubert's backbone, or gave him some, or scared him half to death.\\" Connally was succeeded as governor by Lieutenant Governor Preston Smith, a theater owner from Lubbock, who twice defeated the Republican attorney Paul Eggers in 1968 and 1970. Eggers, a friend and later associate of Republican Senator John G. Tower, served as general counsel in the Treasury Department from 1969‚Äì70, before Connally joined the Nixon Cabinet. ===Kennedy assassination=== Governor Connally, seated in front of President Kennedy, minutes before the assassination On November 22, 1963, Connally was seriously wounded while riding in President Kennedy's car at Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the president was assassinated. Connally, riding in the middle jump seat of the president's limousine in front of the president, recalled hearing the first shot, which he immediately recognized as a rifle shot. He said that he immediately feared an assassination attempt and turned to his right to look back to see the president. He looked over his right shoulder but did not catch the president out of the corner of his eye, so he said he began to turn back to look to his left when he felt a forceful impact to his back. He stated to the Warren Commission: \\"I immediately, when I was hit, I said, 'Oh, no, no, no.' And then I said, 'My God, they are going to kill us all.'\\" He looked down and saw that his chest was covered with blood and thought he had been fatally shot. Then he heard the third and reportedly final shot, which sprayed blood and brain tissue on the car's passengers.Warren Commission Hearings, 4 H 133. Connally suffered three broken ribs, a punctured lung and a shattered wrist and had a bullet lodged in his leg. He underwent four hours of surgery after the shooting and recovered from his wounds. In testimony before the Warren Commission, Connally said: \\"There were either two or three people involved, or more, in this ‚Äì or someone was shooting with an automatic rifle.\\"Testimony of Gov. John Bowden Connally, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, p. 133. The 10-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963‚Äì64 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by 24-year-old ex-Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally refused to accept the single-bullet theory, which suggested that one shot passed through President Kennedy's neck and caused all of Connally's wounds. He insisted that all three shots struck occupants of the limousine. Publicly, he agreed with the Warren Commission's conclusion that Oswald acted alone. Journalist Doug Thompson claimed that in 1982 he had a private conversation with Connally, and asked him whether he was convinced that Oswald had killed Kennedy. According to Thompson, Connally replied, \\"Absolutely not. I do not for one second believe the conclusions of the Warren Commission.\\"Kansas State University website ==Secretary of the Treasury== In 1971, Republican President Nixon appointed the then Democrat Connally as Treasury Secretary. Before agreeing to take the appointment, however, Connally told Nixon that the president must find a position in the administration for George H. W. Bush, the Republican who had been defeated in November 1970 in a hard-fought U.S. Senate race against Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen. Connally told Nixon that his taking the Treasury post would embarrass Bush, who had \\"labored in the vineyards\\" for Nixon's election as president, while Connally had supported Humphrey. Ben Barnes, then the lieutenant governor and originally a Connally ally, claims in his autobiography that Connally's insistence saved Bush's political career because the then former U.S. representative and twice-defeated Senate candidate relied on appointed offices to build a resume by which to seek the presidency in 1980 and again in 1988. Nixon hence named Bush as ambassador to the United Nations in order to secure Connally's services at Treasury. Barnes also said that he doubted George W. Bush could have become president in 2001 had Bush's father not first been given the string of federal appointments during the 1970s to strengthen the family's political viability. Shortly after taking the Treasury post, Connally famously told a group of European finance ministers worried about the export of American inflation that the dollar \\"is our currency, but your problem.\\"www.project-syndicate.org Connally's official Treasury Department portrait Secretary Connally defended a $50 billion increase in the debt ceiling and a $35 to $40 billion budget deficit as an essential \\"fiscal stimulus\\" at a time when five million Americans were unemployed. He unveiled Nixon's program of raising the price of gold and formally devaluing the dollar‚Äîfinally leaving the old gold standard entirely, a process begun in 1934 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Prices continued to increase during 1971, and Nixon allowed wage and price guidelines, which Congress had authorized on a stand-by basis, to be implemented. Connally later shied away from his role in recommending the failed wage and price controls, and announced guaranteed loans for the ailing Lockheed aircraft company. He also fought a lonely battle against growing balance-of-payment problems with the nation's trading partners, and undertook important foreign diplomatic trips for Nixon through his role as Treasury Secretary.Ashman, Connally, pp. 246‚Äì249 Historian Bruce Schulman wrote that Nixon was \\"awed\\" by the handsome, urbane Texan who was also a tough political fighter. Schulman added that Henry Kissinger, Nixon's National Security Advisor, noted that Connally was the only cabinet member whom Nixon did not disparage behind his back, and that this was high praise indeed.^ Bruce Schulman: The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and Politics, Da Capo Press ==Democrats for Nixon== Connally on August 15, 1971 Connally's signature, as used on American currency Connally stepped down as Treasury Secretary in 1972 to head \\"Democrats for Nixon\\", a group funded by Republicans. Connally's former mentor, Lyndon B. Johnson, stood behind Democratic presidential nominee George S. McGovern of South Dakota, although McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson had been on opposite sides of a general election campaign. Connally's brother, Golfrey Connally, an economics professor at a junior college in San Antonio, also endorsed McGovern.Ashman, John Connally, p. 271 Some evidence even suggests that Connally privately supported Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, not the Democratic candidate Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, for whom Johnson campaigned with considerable loyalty. During the war, Connally had served on Eisenhower's planning staff for the invasion of North Africa.Ashman, Connally, pp. 62, 70 In the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Texas, Connally endorsed Democrat Harold Barefoot Sanders, later a federal judge from Dallas, rather than the Republican incumbent John G. Tower, also of Dallas. Connally had considered running against Tower in 1966, but chose to run for a third term as governor. Tower then defeated a Connally ally, Texas Attorney General Waggoner Carr of Lubbock. Tower, Nixon's choice in the Senate race, won handily over Sanders, but the Republican candidate for governor, Henry Grover of Houston, a victim of intraparty maneuvering, fell short and lost to Democrat Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde, a city in South Texas. In January 1973, Johnson died of heart disease. He and Connally had been friends since 1938. Connally eulogized Johnson during interment services at the LBJ Ranch in Gillespie County, along with the Rev. Billy Graham, who officiated at the service. Millions around the world viewed Connally's eulogy as the most famous moment of the LBJ funeral, as it was a reminder that Connally was wounded in the assassination that made his mentor and fellow Texan president. ==Party switch== In May 1973, Connally joined the Republican party. When Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned five months later because of scandal, Connally was among Nixon's potential choices to fill the vacancy. However, Nixon tapped Gerald Ford, the House Minority Leader from Grand Rapids, Michigan, because he believed that the moderate Ford could be easily confirmed by both houses of Congress, as required by the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution. A Connally nomination presumably could have been blocked by liberal Democratic opposition. The weakened Nixon did not want a fight for the vice-presidential selection. Connally's party bolt left a sour taste in the mouth of at least one prominent Texas Democrat who stood with George McGovern in 1972: Bob Bullock, the Hillsboro native who served as Texas secretary of state, comptroller and lieutenant governor: \\"...I got some ideas on Mr. Connally. He ain't never done nothin' but get shot in Dallas. He got the silver bullet. He needs to come back here and get hisself shot once every six months. I attack Connally on his vanity. He's terribly bad vain, y'know...\\"Quoted in Ashman, Connally, pp. 284‚Äì285 ==Indictment, trial and acquittal== In July 1974, Connally was indicted for allegedly pocketing $10,000 for influencing a milk price decision by Texas lawyer Jake Jacobsen. At his April 1975 trial, Connally's defense called as character witnesses former First Ladies Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson, as well as Texas state senator Barbara Jordan (the first female, black state senator in Texas history), Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara and Billy Graham. According to a November 1979 profile by Paul Burka in Texas Monthly magazine, \\"The case turned first on whether Connally would simultaneously be tried for perjury‚Äîsome embarrassing inconsistencies had crept into his pretrial testimony‚Äîbut his lawyer was able to prevent it, and then the issue came down to whether John Connally or Jake Jacobsen was telling the truth.\\" On the strength of the defense's prominent character witnesses, Connally was acquitted.

He was considered a great orator and strong leader and was featured on the cover of Time with the heading \\"Hot on the Trail\\". His wheeler-dealer image remained a liability. Connally raised more money than any other candidate, but he was never able to overtake the popular conservative front-runner, Ronald Reagan of California. Connally spent his money nationally, while George H. W. Bush, who was from Houston like Connally, targeted his time and money in early states and won the Iowa caucus. The Houston political activist Clymer Wright rejected both Connally and Bush and served as Reagan's finance chairman in Texas. Bush's status as a challenger to Reagan was at first heightened by his victory in Iowa. Connally drew the backing of Republican state representative Fred Agnich of Dallas, former president of Texas Instruments.Ron Calhoun, \\"Agnich to head area Connally group,\\" Dallas Times-Herald, October 9, 1979 Connally focused on South Carolina, an early primary state in which he had the support of popular U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, but he lost there to Reagan 55 to 30 percent and withdrew from the contest. After spending $11 million during the campaign, Connally secured the support of only a single delegate, Ada Mills of Clarksville, Arkansas, who became nationally known for a brief time as the \\"$11 million delegate\\". Connally quickly endorsed Reagan, appeared with the former governor at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, fundraisers and other campaign events. He helped Reagan win a narrow primary victory over Bush in Texas. During a press conference, Connally was asked if he thought Reagan was the best man to be president. Connally naughtily replied: \\"I think he's the second best man I can think of.\\" Connally said that he and Bush despised each other.Connally said as much in a 1988 60 Minutes interview on CBS. The statement seemed to contradict Connally's earlier insistence that President Nixon name Bush to a post in the administration before Connally would accept appointment as Secretary of the Treasury. Rumors also abounded in 1964 that Connally voted for Bush for senator because of his greater dislike for Bush's then-opponent, Senator Ralph Yarborough. Bad feeling between Yarborough and both Connally and Vice President Johnson was evident in the early stages of President Kennedy's tour of Texas in November 1963. It was widely reported at the time that Yarborough had refused to travel in Johnson's car, although, after Kennedy's intervention and Connally's agreement to give Yarborough a more prominent role in functions planned for Austin, he did so during the fatal motorcade in Dallas.Robert A. Caro (2012) The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power Charles Keating once contributed to Connally's campaign for president.NEWSMEAT ‚ñ∑ Charles Keating's Federal Campaign Contribution Report . Newsmeat.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15. ==Later years== In 1986, Connally filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of business losses in Houston. In December 1990, Connally and Oscar Wyatt, chairman of the Coastal Oil Corporation, met with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Hussein had been holding foreigners as hostages (or \\"guests\\" as Hussein called them) at strategic military sites in Iraq. After the meeting, Hussein agreed to release the hostages. Connally was known as an immaculate dresser who wore expensive and stylish suits wherever he went. Biographer Charles Ashman related a story about Connally carrying a lighter in his pocket and lighting cigarettes as a courtesy only for very wealthy men who might be inclined to contribute to his political causes or to retain him as a consultant on business arrangements. The Connally Memorial Medical Center on U.S. Highway 181 in Floresville In one of his last political acts, Connally endorsed Republican congressman Jack Fields of Houston in the special election called in May 1993 to fill the vacancy left by U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Houston. Bentsen was appointed Treasury Secretary in the new administration of Bill Clinton. Fields finished fourth in the special election and left Congress thereafter. Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, for whom Connally's daughter had been employed in the state treasurer's office, won the seat by a wide margin in the special election runoff against the appointed Democratic senator, Robert Krueger. ==Death== Connally tombstone at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas Connally died on June 15, 1993 of pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive scarring of the lungs. His funeral was held at the First United Methodist Church of Austin where he and his wife, Nellie Connally, had been members since their days living one block to the south in the Texas Governors Mansion, 1963‚Äì69. Former President Nixon left the bedside of his wife, Pat Nixon, who died a week later, and flew to Austin to attend Connally's funeral. Connally's wife Nellie died in 2006. The Connallys are interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. When Connally died, forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht and the Assassination Archives and Research Center petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno to recover the remaining bullet fragments from Connally's body, contending that the fragments would disprove the Warren Commission's single-bullet, single-gunman conclusion. The Justice Department replied that it \\"...would have no legal authority to recover the fragments unless Connally's family gave [it] permission.\\" Connally's family refused permission. ==Legacy== Interstate 410 in San Antonio is named the Connally Loop in his honor. The John B. Connally Middle School, part of Northside ISD also in San Antonio, is also named in his honor. The Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville is named for John, Wayne, and Merrill Connally. The John B. Connally Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice south of Kenedy in Karnes County is named in his honor. The Connally Plaza, including a life-sized statue of Connally, in downtown Houston. The Texas A&M; University System Offices, located in College Station, are housed in a building named in his honor. John B. Connally High School, part of Pflugerville ISD in Austin, is also named in his honor. In January 1964, Connally donated the suit he wore on November 22, 1963, to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission (TSLAC). The suit was displayed to the public until March 1964. In 2000, TSLAC loaned the suit to the National Archives and Records Administration for examination purposes. From October 2013 to February 2014, the suit was featured as part of an exhibit at the TSLAC to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination. ==See also== *List of U.S. political appointments that crossed party lines ==References== ==External links== *The Handbook of Texas Online * *Photos of John Connally *Oral History Interviews with John Connally, from the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library *Photos of Jonn Connally from University of Houston Digital Library * **Booknotes interview with James Reston Jr. on The Lone Star: The Life of John Connally, December 17, 1989. - - - - Category:1917 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:20th-century American politicians Category:20th-century Methodists Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:American United Methodists Category:Ranchers from Texas Category:American shooting survivors Category:American victims of crime Category:Burials at Texas State Cemetery Category:Deaths from pulmonary fibrosis Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Governors of Texas Category:Military personnel from Texas Category:Nixon administration cabinet members Category:Politicians from Austin, Texas Category:People from Floresville, Texas Category:Politicians from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Politicians from Houston Category:Politicians from San Antonio Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas Republicans Category:Methodists from Texas Category:United States Navy officers Category:United States Secretaries of the Navy Category:United States Secretaries of the Treasury Category:Candidates in the 1980 United States presidential election Category:University of Texas at Austin alumni Category:University of Texas School of Law alumni Category:Witnesses to the assassination of John F.

Stephen ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù Kahng, a computer engineer best known for his design of the Leading Edge Model D, founded the company in November 1993. Power Computing started out with financial backing from Olivetti (US$5 million) and $4 million of Mr. Kahng's money. The first Mac-compatible (clone) PC shipped in May 1995. Like Dell Computer, Power Computing followed a direct, build-to-order sales model. In one year, Power Computing shipped 100,000 units with revenues of $250 million in the first year. Power Computing was the first company to sell $1,000,000 of products on the Internet. Power Computing released upgraded models until 1997 with revenues reaching $400 million a year. The Mac clone business was stopped after Steve Jobs returned as interim CEO of Apple in July 1997. In September, Apple bought the core assets of Power Computing for $100 million in Apple stock and terminated the Mac cloning business. ==History== Power Computing Corporation was founded in November 1993 in Milpitas, California, backed by $5 million from Olivetti and $4 million of Mr. Kahng's money. At the MacWorld Expo in January 1995, just days after receiving notice he had the license to clone Macintosh computers, Kahng enlisted Mac veteran Michael Shapiro to help build the company. Shapiro helped to develop the original logo and brand and worked with Kahng to build the initial management team. Power Computing opened manufacturing and operations offices in Austin, Texas at the recently abandoned facilities of CompuAdd and engineering offices in Cupertino, California, staffed largely by members of Apple's original Power Macintosh team. In 1997, PCC relocated its headquarters to a location directly across I-35 from Dell's main campus, and remained there until Apple acquired PCC's assets in 1997. Mr. Kahng set out to create a simplified Mac design that made it cheaper and faster to produce the machines. He then targeted the mail-order market, where Power Computing could get a quicker return on its money than it could by selling through distributors. : \\"With direct mail, you get your money back in days by credit card instead of the 30 to 60 days it takes for the resale channel to repay,\\" Mr. Kahng said. At that time, Apple was leaning towards giving licenses to big time computer makers. Initially, even with Mr. Kahng's reputation as a \\"master cloner\\", getting Apple to take him seriously was a challenge. He ended up bringing Olivetti people with him to meetings. Apple engineers gave him the help he needed to make a Mac prototype. The team reduced the size of the Apple main circuit board so that it could fit into a standard PC box. They also used off- the-shelf PC power supplies and monitors. A few days before the end of the year, it was announced that Apple Computer picked Power Computing to be its first Macintosh clone maker. Jim Gable, Apple's director of Mac licensing was quoted in The Wall Street Journal saying \\"[Mr. Kahng] is clever and fleet of foot. We want him to succeed.\\" Power Computing's goal was to have clones available for as little as $1,000 each starting in March or April 1995. John C. Dvorak, a computer columnist at MacUser magazine, remarked, \\"Apple is not going to know what hit them. Stephen Kahng is tenacious.\\" When the machine was released, Macworld's review said : ‚ÄúThe first clones work as well as Apple's Macs. That alone represents an auspicious start to Apple's reversal of its decade-long go-it-alone strategy. Although these first clones introduce no compelling new technologies, breathtaking features, or stunning industrial designs, they prove that Mac clones can be legitimate alternatives to Apple's own Macs.‚ÄùMacworld, Charles Piller (1 April 1995) === Initial machines === The initial clones were available in desktop and tower configurations, and were based on the PowerPC 601 80 MHz, 100 MHz and 110 MHz microprocessors. They were comparable to Apple Computer's Power Macintosh 7100 and 8100 class of computers. Pricing ranged from $1,995‚Äì2,899. : ‚ÄúPower Computing's system design (except for the clock-oscillator chip that controls the CPU and bus speed, the two models' motherboards are identical) suggests a thoughtful, sophisticated approach. This sophistication derives, in part, from help from Apple, as well as from the fact that two key Apple engineers recently joined Power Computing.‚ÄùMacworld (April 1995 based on prototype testing) Unlike Apple at the time, Power Computing pressed for direct sales. After a customer placed an order for a semi-customized configuration, the system was delivered the next day. Following the delivery of the system, Power Computing called the customer to surmise their needs and offer technical support and customer service. In addition, Power Computing set a goal of a 3-minute response time for all inquiries. In May 1995, shortly after the original clone announcement, Power Computing teamed up with Austin, Texas based Metrowerks to offer the Power Computing CodeStation. The CodeStation was a package consisting of the recently announced Power Series clone, rebranded and bundled with the latest PowerPC version of CodeWarrior (CW6 Gold which introduced Magic Cap support). CodeStations were sold through Metrowerks at discounted developer prices and it is unknown exactly how many units were sold. At the end of July 1995, Power Computing announced that it had successfully ramped the volume production capability of its Power 100 system. The efficiencies provided by volume production allowed Power Computing to lower the base configuration price of a \\"Power 100 Starter System\\" to $1,699. In addition, the company instigated a comprehensive quick-ship program that allowed popular configurations to ship the same day. Power Computing advertised models up to the \\"Power 120 XL\\", a $5,499 machine built around the PowerPC 601+ chip, a 2GB SCSI hard drive, 17 inch Sony monitor, 4X-speed CD-ROM, built-in Ethernet, and 32MB RAM. At the end of October 1995, Power Computing introduced the world's fastest Macintosh- compatible computer, the PowerWave, based on the PowerPC 604 microprocessor. Per an article in the Austin American-Statesman, Power Computing said its machine would far outperform Windows-compatible machines based on Intel's Pentium processors. At the early 1996 Macworld trade show in San Francisco, Power Computing found itself the star attraction because Apple was so preoccupied with its mounting financial woes that then-CEO Michael Spindler cancelled an appearance. PCC got another break when a computer firm that had spent $170,000 erecting an immense booth pulled out at the last moment, allowing Mr. Kahng to pick up the prime exhibiting space for $30,000. At that Macworld, the PowerCurve ‚Äî a line of mid-range, CPU-upgradeable Mac OS systems based on the PowerPC 601 and the industry-standard PCI expansion bus ‚Äî was introduced. Unique to the PowerCurve 601/120 was the native support of VGA‚Äìstyle monitors. === Market success === In May 1996, just one year after Power Computing started selling Mac clones, the company reached the 100,000 units sold milestone. The number of employees had grown to 300. And as noted in an article in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) by Jim Carlton, Power CEO Steve Kahng ‚Äústill hasn‚Äôt taken his (golf) clubs out of the bag‚Äù (he had vowed not to play another round of his beloved golf until he had shipped the first 30,000 Mac clones). That same WSJ article noted that one-half of Power Computings's customers represent people who would have otherwise purchased a computer from Apple. The others are people who might have bought a non-Mac computer. : There is no question Apple is losing sales to us, but we are also expanding the Mac market,\\" says Geoff Burr, Power Computing's vice president of sales and marketing. : Still, unless Apple can rapidly expand its cloning operations -- a goal of new Apple CEO Gilbert Amelio -- to boost flagging Mac market share and generate enough new licensing and software revenue to offset sales lost to cloners, Apple could see its belated cloning campaign backfire. In June 1996, Mr. Kahng persuaded a unit of Lockheed Martin Corp. to buy 3,000 of his computers rather than Apple's. Though a longtime Apple customer, Lockheed Martin said Power beat out Apple's bid by agreeing to such extras as loading in special engineering software before shipping the machines out, a request that Apple declined. This was the largest sale in the history of Macs or Mac-compatible computers at the time. Kahng was able to leverage his strong relationship with IBM to get access to the fastest PowerPC processors sooner than anyone else. As a result, starting in April 1996 and continuing through 1997, Power Computing regularly put out the fastest computer system in either platform (Mac OS or WinTel). * In April 1996, Power Computing unveiled the PowerTower, based on the 180 MHz and 166 MHz PowerPC 604 processor (announced by IBM on the same day). These were the fastest Mac OS personal computers available at the time. * Three months later, in July 1996, Power Computing was back with an even faster system ‚Äì the PowerTower Pro which marked the worldwide debut of the new PowerPC 604e microprocessor featuring clock speeds of up to 225 MHz, making the PowerTower Pro the fastest personal computer available. * May 27, 1997 ‚Äì PowerTower Pro 250 outperformed all comparable Pentium and Pentium II class Windows-based systems that were shipping at the time. * Aug. 4, 1997 ‚Äì PowerTower Pro G3 275 and PowerTower Pro G3 250 would have been the world's first desktop systems using the new PowerPC generation of processors except that they were never built. At Macworld Expo 1997, the company presented a military-themed campaign that urged the Mac faithful to ‚ÄúFight Back.‚Äù Power Computing employees were outfitted in camouflage. The video wall looped ‚Äúwhy we fight‚Äù propaganda. And ‚ÄúSteve Says‚Äù posters, flyers and T-shirts were ubiquitous inside the Moscone Center as well as in the streets surrounding the convention center (where Power Computing logoed Hummers, with bullhorns blazing, circled the center). However, the end was near. === Acquisition by Apple === In July, Apple's CEO Gil Amelio was ousted by Apple's Board of Directors, and Steve Jobs soon returned as interim CEO. Jobs believed that Apple had started to license clones too late to repeat the business model pioneered by Microsoft in the early 1980s. : \\"Apple has to let go of this ghost and invent the future,\\" Mr. Jobs said. Instead of expanding the share of the market that used computers based on the Macintosh system, the decision to license clones simply ate into Apple's own sales of hardware, he said.NY Times: Apple Decides Cloning Isn't Its Route Back To Profitability --By JOHN MARKOFF (3 September 1997) At MacWorld Boston in August, Power Computing President Joel Kocher unsuccessfully tried to convince attendees to rally against Apple's stiff new licensing policies. He and other executives resigned soon afterwards as Power Computing's board chose to be acquired instead. Apple Computer bought key assets of Power Computing for more than $100 million in Apple stock and roughly $10 million in cash. As part of the deal, Apple got back the license that allowed Power Computing to sell Macintosh-based machines. Power Computing originally announced plans to make Wintel clones but was forced to halt operations in December 1997. In January 1998, the last of Power Computing's physical assets were auctioned off, and Power Computing shareholders were mailed Apple Computer shares representing their pro rata share in the now-defunct corporation.Linzmayer, Owen W.

Introduced in the first novel of the series, 1965's Dune, the character was originally killed in Herbert's first version of the manuscript. At the suggestion of Analog magazine editor John Campbell, Herbert kept her alive in the final draft. Alia would next appear as a main character in both Dune Messiah (1969) and Children of Dune (1976). The character is brought back as a ghola in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson conclusion to the original series, Sandworms of Dune (2007). In the novels, Alia is the daughter of Duke Leto Atreides of Caladan and his Bene Gesserit concubine, Lady Jessica, and the younger sister to Paul Atreides. Born on the planet Arrakis eight months after her father's death, she possesses the full powers of an adult Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. Later known to her followers as St. Alia of the Knife, Alia is considered an Abomination by the Bene Gesserit because of the unique nature of her birth. As an adult, she becomes a devoted ally to Paul, and later regent for his children. She marries the ghola Duncan Idaho, but becomes possessed by the persona of her deceased maternal grandfather, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Alia is portrayed by Alicia Witt in David Lynch's 1984 film adaptation, by Laura Burton in the 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and by Daniela Amavia in its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert's Children of Dune. ==Description== The daughter of Duke Leto Atreides of Caladan and his Bene Gesserit concubine, Lady Jessica, Alia is the younger sister to Paul Atreides. During the events of Dune, Alia is born on the planet Arrakis in the year 10,191 A.G., eight months after her father's death. Later known to her followers as St. Alia of the Knife, Alia is considered an Abomination by the Bene Gesserit because of the unique nature of her birth, and as a result she possesses the consciousness of an adult Bene Gesserit. The Fremen woman Harah notices that four-year-old Alia \\"only pretends to be a little girl, that she has never been a little girl.\\" She seeks to explain Alia's unique nature to the superstitious and wary Fremen. In the later years of her regency, Alia's enemies and victims among the Fremen call her Coan-Teen, \\"the female death spirit who walks without feet.\\" An adult Alia is described by Herbert in Dune Messiah: Novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, describes Alia as a \\"virgin witch\\" archetype. William Touponce explains, \\"Alia is the archetypal virgin-harlot, a Reverend Mother without motherhood, virgin priestess, witch, and object of fearful veneration for the superstitious masses\\". ==Appearances== ===Dune=== In Dune (1965), Alia is born a full Reverend Mother when she is exposed to the Water of Life (the bile of a drowned sandworm) in the womb as Lady Jessica undergoes the spice agony. Children born this way, called Abominations, are killed by the Bene Gesserit whenever possible because they have little defense against the personalities contained in Other Memory, the Bene Gesserit ability to access ancestral egos and memories. Without the existence of a strong personal identity, a child awakened to consciousness in utero is highly susceptible to becoming possessed by one of their ancestors. Jessica, despite her awareness of this likelihood, brings her baby to term, and Alia slowly learns to control the powers she has been granted as Reverend Mother and sister of the Kwisatz Haderach. Alia is raised in a community of Fremen, led by her brother in an effort to control the planet and its production of melange. Alia is captured and the infant Leto killed in a Sardaukar raid on the sietch; she is presented to the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, who notes that she had been \\"in command of one of the attacking groups\\" of Fremen rebels (\\"mostly of women, children, and old men\\") that nearly decimated his raiding party. Mature far beyond her four years, Alia escapes during the final battle of Arrakeen, but not before poisoning her grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, with a deadly gom jabbar, also revealing her direct lineage to him in the process. Afterwards, she wanders the battlefield of Arrakeen killing fallen Sardaukar and Harkonnen soldiers with a crysknife, earning her the holy epithet \\"St. Alia of the Knife.\\" Alia uses her limited prescience in a unique way, projecting thoughts and images into the mind of the horrified Imperial Truthsayer, Gaius Helen Mohiam. Bene Gesserit Mohiam tells the Emperor that it is \\"Not telepathy. She's in my mind. She's like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!\\" Alia further explains that she cannot do this with everyone: \\"Unless I'm born as you, I cannot think as you.\\"This hints at the genetic link between Alia and Mohiam, later established in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999-2001). Alia soon communicates with Paul the same way: Touponce suggests that Herbert's depiction of larval sandworms (or sandtrout), which hold back water in the desert to maintain the arid conditions their sandworm vector requires to thrive, is \\"an analogy for a stage of consciousness Alia can feel. Some of the ancestral voices within her mind hold back dangerous forces that could destroy her.\\" ===Dune Messiah=== The character is further explored in 1969's Dune Messiah through her relationship with the ghola Hayt, who is Paul's teacher, Duncan Idaho, brought back from the dead by Tleilaxu means. Throughout the novel, there are hints of sexual tension between them as they work together to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. Hayt even steals a kiss from Alia, which upsets her; he responds by saying that he took nothing more than what was offered. Alia eventually agrees. When a blinded Paul departs into the desert, as is the Fremen custom for the blind, Alia is named Regent and the guardian of Paul's children: the heir, Leto II, and his sister, Ghanima. Shortly after, Alia marries Hayt, who has regained his full memory and is completely restored as Duncan. Alia gives the order to Fremen leader Stilgar to execute the Reverend Mother Mohiam and Spacing Guild Navigator Edric after the failure of their conspiracy (with the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale and the Princess Irulan of House Corrino) to seize the throne from Paul. Touponce notes that \\"Alia will come to sexual maturity in [Dune Messiah] and discover an ascendant desire for a mate and political power.\\" Hayt has been programmed by the Tleilaxu with three functions to be used against the Atreides, one of which is the seduction of Alia. ===Children of Dune=== In Children of Dune (1976), Alia becomes progressively more devious and power- hungry as she slowly succumbs to Abomination. Falling under the influence of the persona of her deceased grandfather, the Baron Harkonnen, Alia abuses her powers as Regent and becomes a ruthless tyrant. She allows the Baron access to her senses in exchange for his help fighting off the other personalities within her, but his sexual proclivities soon control her, compelling her to engage in sexual acts with one of her aides. During the exercise of his Mentat powers, Duncan comes to the realization that Alia has fallen into Abomination, and helps Jessica escape Alia's murderous plot. The Preacher, actually Paul Atreides, returns once more to the steps of the temple and exposes Alia's conversion to Abomination to the Fremen. Her priests soon murder him, as Alia's nephew Leto II returns from hiding, his sister Ghanima in tow. The twins offer Alia their help conquering her inner lives, as they had. Alia then loses all control over the other personalities within her and they all fight for dominance over her. Leto realizes that the Baron's hold over her is too strong, and provides two options: a Trial of Possession, an ancient ritual that would guarantee the Baron's undoing; and the open window, high above the temple steps. As a helpless Jessica looks on, Alia regains control of her body long enough to leap out the window to her death. ===Hunters of Dune=== In the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson novel Hunters of Dune (2006), the Face Dancer Khrone manages to restore the memories of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen ghola. The Baron is displeased to note that Alia's voice haunts him in his head, somehow in a reversal of the influence he had over her while she was in the throes of Abomination in Children of Dune. Although not possessing the body of the Baron, Alia taunts him mercilessly. ===Sandworms of Dune=== In Sandworms of Dune (2007), the voice of Alia continues to irk the Baron, driving him to frequent outbursts that confuse those around him. Alia is recreated as a ghola on the no-ship Ithaca; in an attempt to grow Alia exactly as she had been in life, the axlotl tank is flooded with a near-lethal dose of the spice melange. Although the Alia ghola shows a great deal more maturity than would be expected for her age, she does not display any Other Memory or signs of Abomination. The reincarnated Baron Harkonnen murders the four-year-old Alia ghola on the Ithaca, but is soon murdered himself by the Wellington Yueh ghola. ==In adaptations== Alia is portrayed by Alicia Witt in David Lynch's 1984 film adaptation, by Laura Burton in the 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and by Daniela Amavia in its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert's Children of Dune. Laura Fries of Variety wrote in 2003, \\"Amavia and [Julie] Cox as the tortured Alia and the put-upon Irulan offer layered performances\\". Emmet Asher-Perrin of Tor.com called Amavia's portrayal of Alia a \\"highlight\\" of the miniseries, and praised the attention paid to Alia's character development. Asher-Perrin praised the miniseries' departure from the novel in regard to Alia's fate: ==References== Category:Dune (franchise) characters Category:Child characters in literature Category:Fictional suicides Category:Literary characters introduced in 1965 ","title":"Alia Atreides"},{"id":"300278","text":"An integrated receiver/decoder (IRD) is an electronic device used to pick up a radio-frequency signal and convert digital information transmitted in it. ==Consumer IRDs== Consumer IRDs, commonly called set-top boxes, are used by end users and are much cheaper compared to professional IRDs.

It was acquired by International Paper in 2012. ==History== Inland Container Corporation was founded by Herman C. Krannert as Anderson Box Company in Anderson, Indiana in 1918. Kannert then founded Inland Box Company in Indianapolis in 1925; this was considered the founding date of the company. In 1973, Time, Inc. acquired Temple Industries, Inc., merging it with Eastex Pulp and Paper Company to form Temple-Eastex, Inc. Time Inc. had entered the forest products business in 1952 with the purchase of 500,000 acres of timberland in East Texas. In 1978, Inland was acquired by Time, Inc. in a deal worth about $280 million (). At the time, Inland was manufacturing corrugated shipping containers and container board at 28 plants in the United States and Puerto Rico. It also had 50% ownership, along with Mead paper Co., in Georgia Kraft Co. which produced 1.2 million tons of linerboard in 1977, and which owned 950,000 acres of timberland in the southeast U.S., and leased another 125,000 acres. In 1983, Temple-Eastex, Inc. and Inland were spun off and combined into Temple-Inland, Inc. At the time, the companies accounted for $1.1 billion () in revenues for Time, equivalent to 32 percent of Time Inc.'s consolidated revenues of $3.6 billion () in 1982. At the time it was reported that the Joe C. Denman Jr., chief executive of Temple-Eastex, and Clinton G. Ames Jr., chief executive of Inland Container, would continue as the chief executives of the entities under the new Temple-Inland which was headed up by Clifford J. Grum. Grum was executive vice president of Time Inc. and became the chief executive officer of the new company, which was based in Diboll, Texas In 2002, the company acquired the Gaylord Container Corporation. Gaylord engaged in the integrated production, conversion, and sale of brown paper- packaging products and manufactured corrugated containers, corrugated sheets, and containerboard. ==2007 spin-off== In November 2007, Temple-Inland announced that it planned to separate itself into three stand-alone public companies and sell its timberlands by the end of 2007. Shareholders in the company would eventually receive stock in all three companies depending on the amount owned on the day the company split-up. The three companies were: *Temple-Inland Inc. *Guaranty Financial Group Inc. *Forestar Real Estate Group Inc. ===Temple-Inland Inc.=== Temple-Inland Inc. became a manufacturing company focused on corrugated packaging and building products. The vertically integrated corrugated packaging operation consisted of five linerboard mills, one corrugated medium mill and sixty-four converting facilities. The mills produced 3.5 million tons of containerboard per year and the converting facilities produced 3.6 million tons of corrugated packaging per year. The building products operations manufactured a variety of building products for new home construction, commercial and repair and remodeling markets. ===Guaranty Financial Group Inc.=== Logo of the now defunct bankGuaranty Financial Group Inc. became a financial services holding company that operated in various business segments through its primary operating subsidiaries, \\"Guaranty Bank\\" and \\"Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc.\\" Guaranty Bank became a federally chartered savings bank with total assets in excess of $16 billion (consolidated) that conducted consumer and business banking activities through a network of approximately 150 bank branches located in Texas and California that provided commercial banking products and services to various geographic markets throughout the United States. Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc. became an insurance agency that focused on property and casualty insurance with fixed annuities and operated out of 17 offices located in Texas and California, as well as through branches of Guaranty Bank. In August 2009, Guaranty Bank was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. To protect the depositors, the FDIC sold all of the deposits of Guaranty Bank to BBVA Compass of Birmingham, Alabama. At the time of its collapse, the bank had 103 branches in Texas and 59 branches in California. ===Forestar Real Estate Group Inc.=== Forestar Real Estate Group Inc. became a dual business operating company focusing in two business segments: real estate and natural resources. The real estate segment owns directly or through ventures about 374,000 acres of real estate located in nine states and twelve markets in the U.S. The real estate segment has 24 real estate projects representing about 27,000 acres currently in the entitlement process and 75 active development projects in seven states and 11 markets encompassing approximately 17,000 acres. These are 30,000 residential lots and 1,900 commercial acres. The natural resources segment manages about 622,000 net acres of oil and gas mineral interests, sells wood fiber from its land primarily located in Georgia, and leases land for recreational uses. As of September 30, 2015 Forestar, either directly or through ventures, owned: *106,000 acres of low basis real estate located in 12 states and 15 markets (approximately) *9 commercial and residential (multi-family) properties *590,000 net mineral acres, principally in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia *324,000 net mineral acres in oil-rich basins (leasehold interest), including 9,000 net mineral acres in the core of the Bakken and Three Forks formations. In addition, they manage approximately 95,000 acres of land as timberland, generating fiber growth and sales. They also have approximately 1.5 million acres of water interests in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia. ==2012 sale== rightIn 2012, International Paper, through the merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Metal Acquisition Inc. with and into Temple-Inland, acquired Temple-Inland in a deal valued at $4.5 billion.

This colorless, volatile liquid with a chloroform-like, sweet odour is widely used as a solvent. Although it is not miscible with water, it is polar, and miscible with many organic solvents.Rossberg, M. et al. (2006) \\"Chlorinated Hydrocarbons\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . ==Occurrence== Natural sources of dichloromethane include oceanic sources, macroalgae, wetlands, and volcanoes. However, the majority of dichloromethane in the environment is the result of industrial emissions. ==Production== DCM is produced by treating either chloromethane or methane with chlorine gas at 400‚Äì500 ¬∞C. At these temperatures, both methane and chloromethane undergo a series of reactions producing progressively more chlorinated products. In this way, an estimated 400,000 tons were produced in the US, Europe, and Japan in 1993. :CH4 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí CH3Cl + HCl :CH3Cl + Cl2 ‚Üí CH2Cl2 \\\\+ HCl :CH2Cl2 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí CHCl3 \\\\+ HCl :CHCl3 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí CCl4 \\\\+ HCl The output of these processes is a mixture of chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride as well as hydrogen chloride as a byproduct. These compounds are separated by distillation. DCM was first prepared in 1839 by the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault (1810‚Äì1878), who isolated it from a mixture of chloromethane and chlorine that had been exposed to sunlight.Regnault, V. (1839) \\"De l'action du chlore sur les √©thers hydrochloriques de l'alcool et de l'esprit de bois, et de plusieurs points de la th√©orie des √©thers\\" (On the action of chlorine on the hydrochloric ethers of ethanol and methanol, and on several points of the theory of ethers), Annales de chimie et physique, series 2, 71 : 353‚Äì431; see especially: \\"Seconde partie. De l'action du chlore sur l'√©ther hydrochlorique de l'esprit de bois\\" (Second part. On the action of chlorine on the hydrochloric ether of methanol [i.e., chloromethane]), pages 377‚Äì380. Regnault gives dichloromethane the name √©ther hydrochlorique monochlorur√© (monochlorinated hydrochloric ether). Note: Regnault gives the empirical formula for dichloromethane as C2H4Cl4 because during that era, chemists used incorrect atomic masses. Reprinted in German in: * See p. 328. * See p. 210. ==Uses== DCM's volatility and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes it a useful solvent for many chemical processes. In the food industry, it has been used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavorings. Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams. ===Hydrogen bonding=== Methylene chloride is a Lewis acid that can hydrogen bond to electron donors. It is classified as a hard acid and is included in the ECW model. It is a solvent that has been used in many thermodynamic studies of donor-acceptor bonding. The donor hydrogen-bonding corrections of methylene chloride in these thermodynamic studies has been reported. The E&C; parameters used in this paper are older parameters. Improved E&C; parameters are listed in ECW model ===Specialized uses=== Near IR absorption spectrum of dichloromethane showing complicated overlapping overtones of mid IR absorption features. The chemical compound's low boiling point allows the chemical to function in a heat engine that can extract mechanical energy from small temperature differences. An example of a DCM heat engine is the drinking bird. The toy works at room temperature. It is also used as the fluid in Christmas lights that have the colored bubbling tube above a lamp as a source of heat and a small amount of rock salt to provide thermal mass and a nucleation site for the phase changing solvent. DCM chemically welds certain plastics. For example, it is used to seal the casing of electric meters. Often sold as a main component of plastic welding adhesives, it is also used extensively by model building hobbyists for joining plastic components together. It is commonly referred to as \\"Di-clo.\\" It is used in the garment printing industry for removal of heat-sealed garment transfers, and its volatility is exploited in novelty items: bubble lights and jukebox displays. DCM is used in the material testing field of civil engineering; specifically it is used during the testing of bituminous materials as a solvent to separate the binder from the aggregate of an asphalt or macadam to allow the testing of the materials. Dichloromethane extract of Asparagopsis taxiformis, a seaweed fodder for cattle, has been found to reduce their methane emissions by 79%. It is also the principal component of paint stripper, although replacements exist. ==Toxicity== Even though DCM is the least toxic of the simple chlorohydrocarbons, it has serious health risks. Its high volatility makes it an acute inhalation hazard. It can also be absorbed through the skin. Symptoms of acute overexposure to dichloromethane via inhalation include difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. More severe consequences can include suffocation, loss of consciousness, coma, and death. DCM is also metabolized by the body to carbon monoxide potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Acute exposure by inhalation has resulted in optic neuropathy and hepatitis. Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the fatty tissues in skin, resulting in skin irritation or chemical burns. It may be carcinogenic, as it has been linked to cancer of the lungs, liver, and pancreas in laboratory animals. Other animal studies showed breast cancer and salivary gland cancer. Research is not yet clear as to what levels may be carcinogenic. DCM crosses the placenta. Fetal toxicity in women who are exposed to it during pregnancy, however, has not been proven. In animal experiments, it was fetotoxic at doses that were maternally toxic but no teratogenic effects were seen. In people with pre-existing heart problems, exposure to DCM can cause abnormal heart rhythms and/or heart attacks, sometimes without any other symptoms of overexposure. People with existing liver, nervous system, or skin problems may worsen after exposure to methylene chloride. ===Regulation=== In many countries, products containing DCM must carry labels warning of its health risks. In February 2013, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned that at least 14 bathtub refinishers have died since 2000 from DCM exposure. These workers had been working alone, in poorly ventilated bathrooms, with inadequate or no respiratory protection, and no training about the hazards of DCM.OSHA QuickTakes, February 1, 2013; OSHA has since then issued a DCM standard.Methylene Chloride. Occupational Safety & Health Administration. osha.gov In the European Union, the European Parliament voted in 2009 to ban the use of DCM in paint-strippers for consumers and many professionals.\\"EU Banning Most DCM Paint Strippers,\\" PaintSquare News, retrieved 1/5/14. The ban took effect in December 2010. In Europe, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) recommends for DCM an occupational exposure limit (8 h time-weighted average) of 100 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 200 ppm. Concerns about its health effects have led to a search for alternatives in many of these applications. On March 15, 2019, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to prohibit the manufacture (including importing and exporting), processing, and distribution of methylene chloride in all paint removers for consumer use, effective in 180 days however it does not affect other products containing methylene chloride including many consumer products not intended for paint removal . ==Environmental effects== ===Ozone=== Dichloromethane is not classified as an ozone-depleting substance by the Montreal Protocol. The U.S. Clean Air Act does not regulate dichloromethane as an ozone depleter. According to the EPA, the atmospheric lifetime of dichloromethane is very short, such that the substance decomposes before reaching the ozone layer. Ozone concentrations measured at the midlatitudes from the ground up through the stratosphere from 1998 to 2016 have declined by 2.2 Dobson units. The reasons for this decline are unclear, but one unverified hypothesis is the presence of short-lived substances such as dichloromethane in the lower atmosphere. ==See also== *Chloromethane *Trichloromethane *Tetrachloromethane *List of chemical compounds *List of organic compounds *Carbon monoxide- releasing molecules ==References* National Pollutant Inventory ‚Äì Dichloromethane Fact Sheet * Dichloromethane at National Toxicology Program * IARC Summaries & Evaluations Vol. 71 (1999) * Canadian Environmental Protection Act Priority Substances List Assessment Report *Organic Compounds Database *Sustainable uses and Industry recommendations Category:Chloroalkanes Category:Halomethanes Category:Aerosol propellants Category:Hazardous air pollutants Category:Refrigerants Category:Halogenated solvents Category:IARC Group 2A carcinogens Category:Fetotoxicants Category:Testicular toxicants Category:Halogen-containing natural products Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Climate change mitigation ","title":"Dichloromethane"},{"id":"300298","text":"College rock (sometimes conflated with \\"jangle pop\\") was the alternative rock music played on student-run university and college campus radio stations located in the United States and Canada in the 1980s.

This memorial portrait was designed by his principal student, Kunisada II, and is one of the few known images of Kunisada. The Hours of the Yoshiwara, , from a well-known early bijin-ga series by Kunisada Utagawa Kunisada (; 1786 ‚Äì 12 January 1865), also known as Utagawa Toyokuni III ( ), was the most popular, prolific and commercially successful designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints in 19th-century Japan. In his own time, his reputation far exceeded that of his contemporaries, Hokusai, Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi. ==Evaluation of Kunisada in art history== Snow Scene At the end of the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), Hiroshige, Kuniyoshi and Kunisada were the three best representatives of the Japanese color woodcut in Edo (capital city of Japan, now Tokyo). However, among European and American collectors of Japanese prints, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, all three of these artists were actually regarded as rather inferior to the greats of classical ukiyo-e, and therefore as having contributed considerably to the downfall of their art. For this reason, some referred to their works as \\"decadent\\". Beginning in the 1930s and 1970s, respectively, the works of Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi were submitted to a re-evaluation, and these two are now counted among the masters of their art. Thus, from Kunisada alone was withheld, for a long time, the acknowledgment which is due to him. With a few exceptions, such as actor portraits (yakusha-e) and portraits of beautiful women (bijin-ga), at the beginning of his career, and some series of large-size actor head- portraits near the end, it was thought that he had produced only inferior works. It was not until the early 1990s, with the appearance of Jan van Doesburg's overview of the artistic development of Kunisada, and Sebastian Izzard's extensive study of his work, that this picture began to change, with Kunisada more clearly revealed as one of the \\"giants\\" of the Japanese print that he was. ==Biography== Although not much is known of the details of Kunisada's life, there are some well-established records of particular events. He was born in 1786 in Honjo, an eastern district of Edo. His given name was Sumida Sh≈çgor≈ç IX (ËßíÁî∞Â∫Ñ‰∫îÊúó), and he was also called Sumida Sh≈çz≈ç (ËßíÁî∞Â∫ÑËîµ). A small licensed and hereditary ferry-boat service belonged to his family, and the income derived from this business provided a certain basic financial security. His father, who was an amateur poet of some renown, died in the year after his birth. While growing up, he developed an early talent for painting and drawing. His early sketches at that time impressed Toyokuni, the great master of the Utagawa school and prominent designer of kabuki and actor-portrait prints. In the year 1800 or shortly thereafter Kunisada was accepted by Toyokuni I as an apprentice in his workshop. In keeping with a tradition of Japanese master-apprentice relations, he was then given the official artist name of \\"KUNI-sada\\", the first character of which was derived from the second part of the name \\"Toyo-KUNI\\". His first known print dates to the year 1807; however this seems to have been an exceptional design, and further full-sized prints appear starting only in 1809‚Äì1810. As of 1808 he had already begun work as an illustrator of e-hon (woodblock print illustrated books) and his popularity rapidly increased. In 1809 he was referred to in contemporary sources as the \\"star attraction\\" of the Utagawa school, and soon thereafter was considered as at least equal to his teacher Toyokuni in the area of book illustration. Kunisada's first actor portraits appeared in either 1808 or 1809. It is known that his first bijin-ga series and a series of pentaptychs of urban scenes of Edo, appear simultaneously in 1809. By 1813 he had risen as a \\"star\\" in the constellation of Edo's artistic world; a contemporary list of the most important ukiyo-e artists places him in second place behind Toyokuni I. Kunisada remained one of the \\"trendsetters\\" of the Japanese woodblock print until his death in early 1865. Beginning around 1810 Kunisada used the studio name \\"Gototei\\", which refers cryptically to his father's ferry-boat business. Until 1842 this signature appeared on nearly all of his kabuki designs. Around 1825 the studio name \\"Kochoro\\" appeared, and was often used on prints not related to kabuki. This name was derived from a combination of the pseudonyms of master painter Hanabusa Itcho, and that of his successor Hanabusa Ikkei, with whom Kunisada had studied a new style of painting around 1824‚Äì1825. In 1844, he finally adopted the name of his master Toyokuni I, and for a brief time used the signature \\"Kunisada becoming Toyokuni II\\". Starting in 1844‚Äì1845, all of his prints are signed \\"Toyokuni\\", partially with the addition of other studio names as prefixes, such as \\"Kochoro\\" and \\"Ichiyosai\\". Although Kunisada referred to himself as \\"Toyokuni II\\", he must be regarded, however, as \\"Toyokuni III\\". The question is unsettled as to why he intentionally ignored Toyoshige, a pupil and son-in-law of Toyokuni I and who had borne the name \\"Toyokuni\\", as legitimate head of the Utagawa school, from 1825 until his own death in 1835. The date of Kunisada's death was the 15th day of the 12th month of the First Year of Genji. Most sources erroneously report this as having been in the year 1864, though this date in the Japanese calendar corresponds to the date January 12, 1865, in the Gregorian calendar. Kunisada died in the same neighborhood in which he had been born. ==Artistic activity== Kunisada portrait of kabuki actor Kawarazaki Gonjuro I (1861) Almost from the first day of his activity, and even at the time of his death in 1865, Kunisada was a trendsetter in the art of the Japanese woodblock print. Always at the vanguard of his time, and in tune with the tastes of the public, he continuously developed his style, which was sometimes radically changed, and did not adhere to stylistic constraints set by any of his contemporaries. His productivity was extraordinary. About 14,500 individual designs have been catalogued (polyptych sets counted as a single design) corresponding to more than 22,500 individual sheets. It seems probable based on these figures that Kunisada actually produced between 20,000 and 25,000 designs for woodblock prints during his lifetime (i.e. 35,000 to 40,000 individual sheets). Dawn at Futamigaura, seascape print by Kunisada, c. 1830 Kunisada portrait of Nakamura Fukusuke as Hayano Kampei Following the traditional pattern of the Utagawa school, Kunisada's main occupation was kabuki and actor prints, and about 60% of his designs fall in this category. However he was also highly active in the area of bijin-ga prints (comprising about 15% of his complete works), and their total number was far higher than any other artist of his time. From 1820 to 1860 he likewise dominated the market for portraits of sumo wrestlers. For a long time (1835‚Äì1850) he had an almost complete monopoly on the genre of prints related to The Tale of Genji; it was only after 1850 that other artists began to produce similar designs. Noteworthy also are the number of his surimono, and although they were designed almost exclusively prior to 1844, few artists were better-known in this area. Sumo wrestling scene, triptych set of three prints by Kunisada, c. 1851 Kunisada's paintings, which were privately commissioned, are little- known, but can be compared to those of other masters of ukiyoe painting. His activity as a book illustrator is also largely unexplored. He was no less productive in the area of ehon than he was in full-sized prints, and notable among his book prints are shunga pictures, which appeared in numerous books. Due to censorship, they are signed only on the title page with his alias \\"Matahei\\". Landscape prints and musha-e (samurai warrior prints) by Kunisada are rare, and only about 100 designs in each of these genres are known. He effectively left these two fields to be covered by his contemporaries Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi, respectively. Shunga\\" erotic print by Kunisada The mid-1840s and early 1850s, were a period of expansion when woodblock prints were in high demand in Japan. During this time Kunisada collaborated with one of or both Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi in three major series as well as on a number of smaller projects. This co-operation was in large part politically motivated in order to demonstrate solidarity against the intensified censorship regulations of the Tenp≈ç Reforms. Also beginning around the mid-1850s there are series in which individual parts of designs (and sometimes complete sheets) are signed by Kunisada's students; this was done with the intention of promoting their work as individual artists. Notable students of Kunisada included Toyohara Kunichika, Utagawa Sadahide and Utagawa Kunisada II. ==Reception and legacy== Kunisada had a five-decade career, during which his work was always popular and sold in the thousands. Towards the end of his life he began recording his age with his signature on his prints. Later critics have been reluctant to declare merit in his work, particular of the later period. An example of the contempt early Western critics subjected Kusisada's work to: The majority of Kunisada's work was of actors portrayed in current popular plays; most of the rest was of women in the latest fashions. The works dated with quickly-changing fashions, and there was a constant demand for new prints to replace the outdated ones. == Collections == Recent Exhibits: * A Third Gender, Royal Ontario Museum & Japan Society, 2017 * Showdown!, MFA Boston, 2016 * Utagawa, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 2008 * Living for the Moment: Japanese Prints from the Collection of Barbara S.

They formed in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in 1986. Slint's first album Tweez was recorded by engineer Steve Albini in 1987 and released in obscurity on the Jennifer Hartman Records label in 1989. It was followed two years later by the critically acclaimed Spiderland, released on the independent label Touch and Go Records. They have reunited sporadically since 1990. ==History== ===Pre- Slint=== Walford and McMahan met in their pre-teens and attended the Brown School, a Louisville public school founded on a pedagogy of self-directed learning. They began performing music together at an early age, forming the Languid and Flaccid with Ned Oldham (later of The Anomoanoan) while still in middle school. In their teens Walford and McMahan played together in the seminal Louisville punk band Squirrel Bait. Walford left the band following their first recording session while McMahan went on to tour and record Squirrel Bait's two albums before the band's dissolution in 1987. Pajo and Walford (and, briefly, McMahan) were in the punk/prog-metal band Maurice with future members of Kinghorse. After being influenced by the music of the Minutemen, Pajo and Walford's musical direction became too obtuse for the other members of Maurice, who parted ways. Maurice's later material would form the basis of some of Slint's early compositions. === 1986: Founding === Slint formed in the summer of 1986. Walford and Pajo were joined by the slightly older Buckler (age 18 at the time) for a show for a Unitarian Universalist congregation on November 2; performing under the name Small Tight Dirty Tufts of Hair, most of the congregation left during the band's first two songs. They were soon joined by McMahan and named themselves Slint after one of Walford's pet fish. === 1987‚Äì1989: Tweez, singles, and Ethan Buckler's departure === Slint's first album Tweez was recorded in the fall of 1987 by Steve Albini, whom the band had chosen because they were fans of Albini's recently defunct group Big Black. Though Slint's members had composed the album's music during rehearsals in Walford's parents' basement, most of the lyrics were created in- studio, and included between-song sound effects and ad-libbed conversations with Albini. During mixdown, Walford requested that Albini \\"make the bass drum sound like a ham being slapped by a catcher's mitt,\\" and then spilled a cup of tea on Albini's mixing board. Without formal song titles, eight of the album's tracks were named for the band members' parents, and a ninth for Walford's dog, Rhoda. Once completed, Buckler was dissatisfied with the recordings and left Slint to form the group King Kong, initially made up of all of Slint's members taking up different instruments. All of Slint's original members recorded the single \\"Movie Star\\" as King Kong in Steve Albini's studio while he was away on a trip in 1989. Buckler was soon replaced by bass player Todd Brashear. Slint had hoped that Touch and Go Records would release Tweez, but the band did not hear back from the label. A friend of the group, Jennifer Hartman, paid for the album's release for a tiny run on the imprint Jennifer Hartman Records in 1989. By then the group had returned to the studio with Albini to record two instrumental tracks. Original copies of Tweez included a flyer advertising a 12\\" single of these songs to be released on Jennifer Hartman. But by now the band had succeeded in catching the ear of Touch & Go Records's founder Corey Rusk who agreed to release the group's next album. The master tapes to the proposed 12\\" were then shelved, making Tweez the sole release on the Jennifer Hartman label. === 1988‚Äì1991: Spiderland, Todd Brashear joins, and dissolution === By the time Tweez was released, most of the group had gone off to college and would return to Louisville during breaks to write and practice new material. Returning to the Walfords' basement, the group would spend hours repeating the same guitar riff and then adding in layers of nuance on top of it. After rehearsals, McMahan took practice tapes home and worked on vocals with the use of a 4-track tape recorder. Sitting in his parents' car made it possible to record softly spoken vocals over the band's loud music. After developing these new songs, Slint's members wanted a cleaner sound than that of their first LP, and approached Minneapolis producer Brian Paulson who had recorded two albums with McMahan's former bandmates' group Bastro. On a trip to visit Bastro and Paulson during the recording sessions for their final studio album, Sing the Troubled Beast, McMahan was in a near-fatal car accident. While in the ambulance, a paramedic called in \\"Code 138\\" and the immobilized McMahan regained consciousness singing the Misfits song \\"We are 138.\\" McMahan's brush with death left the young musician feeling depressed, a condition that would affect the recording and aftermath of Slint's next album. Paulson and Slint met over a weekend to record Spiderland in Chicago. All of the music was recorded live, with vocals overdubbed afterward in no more than two takes and with little to no rehearsal on the part of McMahan. The group used two different microphones to record vocals: one for softer, spoken voices, and one for louder, sung voices. During mixdown, Paulson and the group would try adding different effects, but all these were rejected, resulting in a very pared-down production sound. The day after Spiderland's recording session ended, McMahan checked himself into a mental hospital where he was diagnosed with depression, and subsequently left the band. Longtime friend of the band Will Oldham took numerous photos of the group as potential album covers. Some of these were taken in a nearby quarry and one was chosen with Slint's four members' heads bobbing above the surface of the water. Touch and Go released Spiderland in 1991. The album was unlike anything else that the label had released to date. Slint was to have gone on a European tour after its release, but with the band no longer together, there were no tours, interviews, photo or video shoots to promote the album. Despite this, the album's repute grew and it continued to sell several thousand copies annually in the years following its release, a considerable feat for an indie record by a defunct group and a mystique around the record, and the artists who made it, began to grow. Spiderland is considered a seminal work, characterized by dark, syncopated rhythms, sparse guitar lines and haunting subject matter. The record's impact was such that many fans and critics consider it a foundational post-rock album, helping to usher in a new wave of bands seeking a move away from the unfettered aggression of hardcore punk but not its underlying ethic. ===1992‚Äìpresent: Post-Slint=== The band briefly reformed in 1992, and again in 1994. During this time, Touch and Go Records reissued Tweez in 1993, and in 1994 an untitled 10\\" EP of the two songs from the shelved tapes recorded between their two albums‚Äîone a reinterpretation of \\"Rhoda\\" from Tweez, and the other a track called \\"Glenn\\". Members of Slint have since appeared in a number of bands. In 2009, former guitarist David Pajo performed with Yeah Yeah Yeahs as a live back-up musician. He briefly played in Stereolab, took up bass in Interpol, and performs under the moniker PAJO and occasionally with his band Papa M, also known as Ariel M, or just M. Pajo has also been a member of Dead Child, Tortoise, Palace, The For Carnation, Household Gods and the short-lived Billy Corgan-fronted rock band Zwan. Guitarist Brian McMahan formed The For Carnation in 1994 and also played with Will Oldham in Palace. Britt Walford played drums in Evergreen, and for The Breeders under the pseudonym Shannon Doughton on the album Pod, and as Mike Hunt on the Safari EP. Ethan Buckler has released several albums with his group King Kong featuring an ever-shifting cast of members who have occasionally included David Pajo. ====Reunions==== Nearly fifteen years after originally disbanding, three members of Slint‚ÄîBrian McMahan, David Pajo, and Britt Walford‚Äîreunited to curate the 2005 All Tomorrow's Parties (ATP) music festival in Camber Sands, England. Also in 2005, Slint played a number of shows in the U.S. and in Europe. Though they insisted the reunion was short- term, the band regrouped once again in 2007 to perform Spiderland in its entirety in Barcelona as part of the Primavera Sound Festival, in London as part of the ATP Don't Look Back series of shows, as well as at a handful of dates in Europe, the U.S. (at Chicago's Pitchfork Music Festival, the Showbox in Seattle, and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood), and Canada. In addition to performing the album and the EP Slint, they also debuted a new composition called \\"King's Approach\\", which remains unrecorded. In a September 2012 interview conducted with Northern Irish music publication AU Magazine, David Pajo hinted at more activity from the band in the coming months: \\"We still communicate regularly and we've got some surprises for next year that fans will be excited about. I know I am.\\" The band reunited in December 2013 to play as one of the headliners of the final All Tomorrow's Parties holiday camp festival in Camber Sands, England. In an August 2013 interview with Vish Khanna, former producer Steve Albini revealed that the band was working on remastering their second album Spiderland with producer Bob Weston. The deluxe Spiderland boxset was announced in January 2014. In 2014 Touch and Go released several live, demo, and practice sessions of songs recorded by the band between 1989 and 1990. These appeared as the LP Bonus Tracks, as well as in box set editions of Spiderland alongside the DVD Breadcrumb Trail, filmmaker Lance Bangs' 90-minute documentary about the band shot over the course of 12 years. In 2014, the band also performed at the Primavera Sound music festival in Spain and Portugal and Green Man Festival in Wales. The group has no plans to record new material and have since disbanded after their most recent reunions in 2013 and 2014. == Musical style == The band was noted for having syncopated guitar riffs, drastically altering dynamics, and complex song structures and time signatures. McMahan's and Walford's vocals ranged from hushed spoken words, singing, and strained screaming. ==Members== === Core members === *Brian McMahan ‚Äì guitar, vocals (1986‚Äì1990, 1992, 1994, reunions) *David Pajo ‚Äì guitar (1986‚Äì1990, 1992, 1994, reunions) *Britt Walford ‚Äì drums, guitar, vocals (1986‚Äì1990, 1992, 1994, reunions) *Ethan Buckler ‚Äì bass (1986‚Äì1987) *Todd Brashear ‚Äì bass (1988‚Äì1990, 1992) === Former Touring Members === *Michael McMahan ‚Äì guitar (2005, 2007, 2013‚Äì2014) *Todd Cook ‚Äì bass (2005, 2007) *Matt Jencik ‚Äì bass (2007, 2013‚Äì2014) === Session Musicians === * Tim Ruth ‚Äì bass (1994) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Tweez (1989) * Spiderland (1991) ==ReferencesSlint Touch and Go records band page Category:American post-hardcore musical groups Category:American post-rock groups Category:Indie rock musical groups from Kentucky Category:Math rock groups Category:Musical groups from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2007 Category:Touch and Go Records artists Category:1986 establishments in Kentucky Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2013 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2005 ","title":"Slint"},{"id":"300309","text":"Hawk, woodblock print Utagawa Kuniyoshi (; ; January 1, 1798 ‚Äì April 14, 1861) was one of the last great masters of the Japanese ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting.Nussbaum, Louis Fr√©d√©ric et al (2005). \\"Kuniyoshi\\" in He was a member of the Utagawa school.Nussbaum, \\"Utagawa-ry≈´\\" in The range of Kuniyoshi's subjects included many genres: landscapes, beautiful women, Kabuki actors, cats, and mythical animals. He is known for depictions of the battles of legendary samurai heroes.Lubow, Arthur. \\"Everything But the Robots: A Kuniyoshi Retrospective Reveals the Roots of Manga,\\" New York Magazine. March 7, 2010. His artwork incorporated aspects of Western representation in landscape painting and caricature. ==Life== Kuniyoshi was born on January 1, 1798, the son of a silk-dyer, Yanagiya Kichiyemon,Robinson (1961), p. 5 originally named Yoshisabur≈ç. Apparently he assisted his father's business as a pattern designer, and some have suggested that this experience influenced his rich use of color and textile patterns in prints. It is said that Kuniyoshi was impressed, at an early age of seven or eight, by ukiyo-e warrior prints, and by pictures of artisans and commoners (as depicted in craftsmen manuals), and it is possible these influenced his own later prints.Painting of the arhat Handaka (British Museum) Yoshisabur≈ç proved his drawing talents at age 12, quickly attracting the attention of the famous ukiyo-e print master Utagawa Toyokuni. He was officially admitted to Toyokuni's studio in 1811, and became one of his chief pupils. He remained an apprentice until 1814, at which time he was given the name \\"Kuniyoshi\\" and set out as an independent artist. During this year he produced his first published work, the illustrations for the kusaz≈çshi g≈çkan Gobuji Ch≈´shingura, a parody of the original Ch≈´shingura story. Between 1815 and 1817 he created a number of book illustrations for yomihon, kokkeibon, g≈çkan and hanashibon, and printed his stand-alone full color prints of \\"kabuki\\" actors and warriors. Despite his promising debut, the young Kuniyoshi failed to produce many works between 1818 and 1827, probably due to a lack of commissions from publishers, and the competition of other artists within the Utagawa school (Utagawa-ry≈´). However, during this time he did produce pictures of beautiful women ('bijin-ga') and experimented with large textile patterns and light-and-shadow effects found in Western art, although his attempts showed more imitation than real understanding of these principles. His economic situation turned desperate at one point when he was forced to sell used tatami mats. A chance encounter with his prosperous fellow pupil Kunisada, to whom he felt (with some justice) that he was superior in artistic talent, led him to redouble his efforts (but did not create any lingering ill-feeling between the two, who later collaborated on a number of series). During the 1820s, Kuniyoshi produced a number of heroic triptychs that show the first signs of an individual style. In 1827 he received his first major commission for the series, One hundred and eight heroes of the popular Suikoden all told (Ts≈´zoku Suikoden g≈çketsu hyakuhachinin no hitori), based on the incredibly popular Chinese tale, the Shuihu Zhuan. In this series Kuniyoshi illustrated individual heroes on single-sheets, drawing tattoos on his heroes, a novelty which soon influenced Edo fashion. The Suikoden series became extremely popular in Edo, and the demand for Kuniyoshi's warrior prints increased, gaining him entrance into the major ukiyo-e and literary circles. Tiger, woodblock print He continued to produce warrior prints, drawing much of his subjects from war tales such as Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari) and The rise and fall of the Minamoto and the Taira (Genpei Seisuiki). His warrior prints were unique in that they depicted legendary popular figures with an added stress on dreams, ghostly apparitions, omens, and superhuman feats. This subject matter is instilled in his works The ghost of Taira no Tomomori at Daimotsu bay (Taira Tomomori borei no zu) and the 1839 triptych The G≈çj≈ç bridge (G≈çj≈ç no bashi no zu), where he manages to invoke an effective sense of action intensity in his depiction of the combat between Yoshitsune and Benkei. These new thematic styles satisfied the public's interest in the ghastly, exciting, and bizarre that was growing during the time. The Tenp≈ç Reforms of 1841‚Äì1843 aimed to alleviate economic crisis by controlling public displays of luxury and wealth, and the illustration of courtesans and actors in ukiy≈ç-e was officially banned at that time. This may have had some influence on Kuniyoshi's production of caricature prints or comic pictures (giga), which were used to disguise actual actors and courtesans. Many of these symbolically and humorously criticized the shogunate (such as the 1843 design showing Minamoto no Yorimitsu asleep, haunted by the Earth Spider and his demons) and became popular among the politically dissatisfied public. Timothy Clark, curator of Japanese art at the British Museum, asserts that the repressive conventions of the day produced unintended consequences. The government- created limitations became a kind of artistic challenge which actually encouraged Kuniyoshi's creative resourcefulness by forcing him to find ways to veil criticism of the shogunate allegorically.Johnson, Ken. \\"Epics and Erotica From a Grandfather of Anime\\", New York Times. April 15, 2010. National Museum, Warsaw) During the decade leading up to the reforms, Kuniyoshi also produced landscape prints (f≈´keiga), which were outside the bounds of censorship and catered to the rising popularity of personal travel in late Edo Japan. Notable among these were Famous products of the provinces (Sankai meisan zukushi, c. 1828‚Äì30)‚Äîwhere he incorporated Western shading and perspective and pigments‚Äîand Famous views of the Eastern capital in the early 1830s, which was certainly influenced by Hokusai's early-1830s Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanj≈´rokkei). Kuniyoshi also produced during this time works of purely natural subject matter, notably of animals, birds and fish that mimicked traditional Japanese and Chinese painting. In the late 1840s, Kuniyoshi began again to illustrate actor prints, this time evading censorship (or simply evoking creativity) through childish, cartoon-like portraits of famous kabuki actors, the most notable being \\"Scribbling on the storehouse wall\\" (Nitakaragurakabe no mudagaki). Here he creatively used elementary, childlike script sloppily written in kana under the actor faces. Reflecting his love for felines, Kuniyoshi also began to use cats in the place of humans in kabuki and satirical prints. He is also known during this time to have experimented with wide composition, magnifying visual elements in the image for a dramatic, exaggerated effect (ex. Masakado's daughter the princess Takiyasha, at the old Soma palace). In 1856 Kuniyoshi suffered from palsy, which caused him much difficulty in moving his limbs. It is said that his works from this point onward were noticeably weaker in the use of line and overall vitality. Before his death in 1861, Kuniyoshi was able to witness the opening of the port city of Yokohama to foreigners, and in 1860 produced two works depicting Westerners in the city (Yokohama-e, ex. View of Honch≈ç and The pleasure quarters, Yokohama). He died at the age of 63 in April 1861 in his home in Genyadana. ==Pupils== Kuniyoshi was an excellent teacher and had numerous pupils who continued his branch of the Utagawa school. Among the most notable were Yoshitoshi, Yoshitora, Yoshiiku, Yoshikazu, Yoshitsuya, and Yoshifuji. Typically his students began an apprenticeship in which they worked primarily on musha-e in a style similar to that of their master. As they became established as independent artists, many went on to develop highly innovative styles of their own. His most important student was Yoshitoshi, who is now regarded as the \\"last master\\" of the Japanese woodblock print. Among those influenced by Kuniyoshi was Toyohara Chikanobu.\\"Y≈çsh≈´ Chikanobu [obituary],\\" Miyako Shimbun, No. 8847, October 2, 1912. p. 195.

The Mozarabs ( ; ; ; from ) are, in modern historical terms, the Iberian Christians who lived under Moorish rule in Al-Andalus. Although their descendants remained unconverted to Islam, they were mostly fluent in Arabic and adopted elements of Arabic culture. The local Romance vernaculars, heavily permeated by Arabic and spoken by Christians and Muslims alike, have also come to be known as the Mozarabic language. Mozarabs were mostly Roman Catholics of the Visigothic or Mozarabic Rite. Most of the Mozarabs were descendants of Hispanic Christians and were primarily speakers of Mozarabic (late Latin of Iberia) under Islamic rule. They also included those members of the former Visigothic ruling elite who did not convert to Islam or emigrate northwards after the Muslim conquest. Spanish Christians initially portrayed Muslims primarily as military or political enemies, but with time, Islam came to be seen as a religion and not merely a threat. Spanish Christians sought to discourage apostasy from Christianity and to defend Christian beliefs, but they increasingly became connected to the dar al-Islam (land of Islam), through shared culture, language, and regular interaction. A few were Arab and Berber Christians coupled with Muslim converts to Christianity who, as Arabic speakers, naturally were at home among the original Mozarabs. A prominent example of a Muslim who became a Mozarab by embracing Christianity is the Andalusian rebel and Anti-Umayyad military leader, Umar ibn Hafsun. The Mozarabs of Muslim origin were descendants of those Muslims who converted to Christianity following the conquest of Toledo, and perhaps also following the expeditions of king Alfonso I of Aragon. These Mozarabs of Muslim origin who converted en masse at the end of the 11th century, many of them Muladi (ethnic Iberians previously converted to Islam), are totally distinct from the Mud√©jars and Moriscos who converted gradually to Christianity between the 12th and 17th centuries. Some Mozarabs were even Converso Sephardi Jews who likewise became part of the Mozarabic milieu. Separate Mozarab enclaves were located in the large Muslim cities, especially Toledo, C√≥rdoba, Zaragoza, and Seville. ==Status== Christians and Jews were designated dhimmi under Sharia (Islamic law). Dhimmi were allowed to live within Muslim society, but were legally required to pay the jizyah, a personal tax, and abide with a number of religious, social, and economic restrictions that came with their status. Despite their restrictions, the dhimmi were fully protected by the Muslim rulers and did not have to fight in case of war, because they paid the jizyah. As the universal nature of Roman law was eroded and replaced by Islamic law in part of the Iberian Peninsula, Shariah law allowed most ethnic groups in the medieval Islamic world to be judged by their own judges, under their own law: Mozarabs had their own tribunals and authorities. Some of them even held high offices in the Islamic administration under some rulers. A prominent example being that of Rabi ibn Zayd, a palace official, who, sometime between 961 and 976, wrote the famous Calendar of C√≥rdoba McCluskey, Stephen C. Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe, Cambridge, p.170. for Abd ar-Rahman III, undertook various diplomatic missions in Germania and Byzantium, and was rewarded with the bishopric of Elvira (present-day Granada). Furthermore, in 1064 Emir Al-Muqtadir of Zaragoza sent Paternus, the Mozarabic bishop of Tortosa, as an envoy to king Ferdinand I of Le√≥n in Santiago de Compostela, while the Christian Abu Umar ibn Gundisalvus, a Saqaliba (a Slav), served the same taifa ruler as the Wazir (Vizier, or the equivalent to prime minister). Conversion to Islam was encouraged by the Ummayad Caliphs and Emirs of C√≥rdoba. Many Mozarabs converted to Islam to avoid the heavy jizyah tax which they were subjected to as Dhimmis. Conversion to Islam also opened up new horizons to the Mozarabs, alleviated their social position, ensured better living conditions, and broadened scope for more technically skilled and advanced work. Apostasy, however, for one who had been raised as a Muslim or had embraced Islam, was a crime punishable by death. Le√≥n Cathedral Until the mid-9th century, relations between Muslims and the majority Christian population of Al-Andalus, were relatively cordial. Christian resistance to the first wave of Muslim conquerors was unsuccessful. In Murcia, a single surviving capitulation document must stand for many such agreements to render tribute in exchange for the protection of traditional liberties; in it, Theodomirus (Todmir in Arabic), Visigothic count of Orihuela, agrees to recognize Abd al-Aziz as overlord and to pay tribute consisting of a yearly cash payment supplemented with specific agricultural products. In exchange, Theodomir received Abd al-Aziz' promise to respect both his property and his jurisdiction in the province of Murcia. There was no change in the composition of the people on the land, and in cases like this one, even their Visigothic lords remained. In the Moorish controlled region of Al-Garb Al-Andalus, an area to the west of Al-Andalus, which included the modern region of Algarve and most of Portugal, Mozarabs constituted the majority of the population. The Muslim geographer Ibn Hawqal, who visited the country in the middle of the 10th century, spoke of frequent revolts by Mozarab peasants employed on large estates, probably those of the ruling aristocracy. There is also substantial evidence that Mozarabs fought in the defence of the thaghr (front line fortress towns), participating in raids against Christian neighbours and struggles between Muslim factions. For instance, in 936, a significant number of Christians holed up in Calatayud with the rebel Mutarraf, only to be massacred in a desperate stand against the Caliphate forces. There is very little evidence of any Christian resistance at Al-Andalus in the 9th century. Evidence points to a rapid attrition in the North. For instance, during the 1st centuries of Muslim rule, the Mozarab community of Lleida was apparently ruled by a qumis (count) and had its own judiciary, but there is no evidence of any such administration in the later period. Although Mozarab merchants traded in Andalusi markets, they were neither influential nor numerous before the middle of the 12th century. This was owed to commercial disinterest and disorganization in the early Middle Ages rather than any specific or religious impediments set up by the Muslim rulers. Unlike Andalusi Muslims and Jews, Mozarabs had little interest in commerce because of their general perception of trade as lowly and despicable. This was in stark contrast to the greater respect accorded to merchants in Jewish and Muslim societies, where trade was frequently combined with other callings, such as politics, scholarship, or medicine. It is often mistakenly assumed that Mozarab merchants forged a vital commercial and cultural link between the north and south across the Iberian frontiers. Mozarab refugees may have had influence in northern Iberian trade at places like Toledo, but there is no reason to believe that they engaged in commerce with their abandoned homeland. Most traffic between Al-Andalus and Christian regions remained in the hands of Jewish and Muslim traders until the dramatic shifts initiated by European commercial expansion throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. With the development of Italian maritime power and southward expansion of the Christian Reconquista, Andalusi international trade came increasingly into the control of Christian traders from northern Iberia, southern France, or Italy and by the middle of the 13th century was an exclusively Christian concern. There were frequent contacts between the Mozarabs in Al-Andalus and their co-religionists both in the Kingdom of Asturias and in the Marca Hispanica, the territory under Frankish influence to the northeast. The level of literary culture among the northern Christians was inferior to that of their Mozarab brethren in the historic cities to the south, due to the prosperity of Al-Andalus. For that reason, Christian refugees from Al-Andalus were always welcomed in the north, where their descendants came to form an influential element. Though impossible to quantify, the immigration of Mozarabs from the south was probably a significant factor in the growth in the Christian principalities and kingdoms of northern Iberia. For most of the 9th and 10th centuries, Iberian Christian culture in the north was stimulated, probably dominated, by the learning of Mozarab immigrants, who helped to accentuate its Christian identity and apparently played a major role in development of Iberian Christian ideology. The Mozarab scholars and clergy eagerly sought manuscripts, relics and traditions from the towns and monasteries of central and southern Iberia that had been the heartland of Visigothic Catholicism. Many Mozarabs also took part in the many regional revolts that formed the great fitna or unrest in the late 9th century. The Caliphate of Cordoba The ability of the Mozarabs to assimilate into Moorish culture while maintaining their Christian faith has often caused them to be depicted by Western scholars as having a strong allegiance to Roman Catholicism and its cause. However, the historian Jaume Vicens Vives offers another view of the Mozarabs. He states that one of the Emperor Charlemagne's major offensives was to annihilate the Moorish frontier by taking Zaragoza, which was an important Mozarab stronghold. However, the offensive failed because the Mozarabs of the city refused to cooperate with the Catholic emperor. Vives concludes that the Mozarabs were primarily a self- absorbed group. They understood that they could gain a great deal by remaining in close contact with the Moors. There was a steady rate of decline among the Mozarab population of Al-Andalus towards the end of the Reconquista. This was mainly caused by conversions, emigration towards the northern part of the peninsula during the upheavals of the 9th and early 10th centuries and also by the ethno-religious conflicts of the same period. The American historian, Richard Bulliet, in a work based on the quantitative use of the onomastic data as furnished by scholarly biographical dictionaries, concluded that it was only in the 10th century when the Andalusi emirate was firmly established and developed into the greatest power of the western Mediterranean under Caliph Abd ar-Rahman III, that the numerical ratio of Muslims and Christians in Al- Andalus was reversed in favour of the former. Prior to the middle of this century, he asserts, the population of Al-Andalus was still half Christian.The legacy of Muslim Spain, Volume 2, ed. Salma Khadra Jayyusi, Manuela Mar√≠n, BRILL, 1992, p. 158. Although this assertion is denied by other sources,Videla, Ignacio Olag√ºe (1974), La Revoluci√≥n isl√°mica en Occidente. the expansion of the Caliphate had come primarily through conversion and absorption, and only very secondarily through immigration. The remaining Mozarab community shrank into an increasingly fossilized remnant. Relatively large numbers of Mozarab communities did, however, continue to exist up to the end of the taifa kingdoms; there were several parishes in Toledo when the Christians occupied the city in 1085, and abundant documentation in Arabic on the Mozarabs of this city is preserved. An apparently still significant Mozarab group, which is the subject of a number of passages in the Arabic chronicles dealing with El Cid's dominion over Valencia, was also to be found there during this same period. Similarly, the memoirs of the Emir of Granada clearly indicate the existence of a relatively large rural Christian population in some parts of the M√°laga region towards the end of the 11th century. Until the reconquest of Seville by the Christians in 1248, a Mozarab community existed there, though in the course of the 12th century Almoravid persecution had forced many Mozarabs in Al-Andalus to flee northward. ==Restrictions== Mozarab mural painting from San Baudelio de Berlanga, now in the Prado Museum Christians did not enjoy equal rights under Islamic rule, and their original guarantees, at first fairly broad, steadily diminished. They were still allowed to practice their own religion in private, but found their cultural autonomy increasingly reduced. Mozarabs inevitably lost more and more status, but they long maintained their dignity and the integrity of their culture, and they never lost personal and cultural contact with the Christian world. In the generations that followed the conquest, Muslim rulers promulgated new statutes clearly disadvantageous to dhimmi. The construction of new churches and the sounding of church bells were eventually forbidden. But when Eulogius of C√≥rdoba recorded the martyrology of the Martyrs of C√≥rdoba during the decade after 850, it was apparent that at least four Christian basilicas remained in the city, including the church of Saint Acisclus that had sheltered the only holdouts in 711, and nine monasteries and convents in the city and its environs;Wolf, Kenneth Baxter (1988) \\"The Martyrs of C√≥rdoba\\", Christian Martyrs in Muslim Spain, Cambridge University Press. nevertheless, their existence soon became precarious. It is supposed that the Mozarabs were tolerated as Dhimmis and valued taxpayers, and no Mozarab was condemned to death until the formation of the party led by the Christian leaders Eulogius (beheaded in 859) and Alvaro of C√≥rdoba, whose intense faith led them to seek martyrdom by insulting Muhammad, and criticizing Islam. The Arabization of the Christians was opposed by Eulogius himself, who called for a more purely Christian culture stripped of Moorish influences. To this end, he led a revolt of the Mozarabs at C√≥rdoba in which Christians martyred themselves to protest against Muslim rule. However, Kenneth Baxter Wolf concludes that Eulogius was not the instigator of these persecutions but merely a hagiographer. This is consistent with other historical records of two Christians executed in 860, and shortly after a third one. The subsequent executions were in 888‚Äì912 and 913‚Äì920. Still more executions were recorded in C√≥rdoba in 923 (Eugenia), a boy Pelagius in 925 (for refusal to convert to Islam and submit to Caliph's sexual advances), and Argentea in 931. According to Wolf, there is no reason to believe that they stopped even then. Pelagius is depicted in the 1660 Martyrs Mirror. Eulogius's writings documenting stories of the C√≥rdoba martyrs of 851‚Äì59, encouraged by him to defy Muslim authorities with blasphemies and embrace martyrdom, contrast these Christians with the earlier official Christianity of the Visigoths, by Reccared, the previous bishop of C√≥rdoba, who counseled tolerance and mutual forbearance with the Muslim authorities. However, since then Christians became increasingly alienated not only because they could not build new churches or ring church bells, but primarily because they were excluded from most positions of political, military, or social authority and suffered many other indignities as unequals under the Islamic law. By the mid-9th century, as the episode of the C√≥rdoba martyrs reveals, there was a clear Christian opposition against the systematic pressure by a variety of legal and financial instruments of Islam, resisting their conversion and absorption into Muslim culture. The initial official reaction to the C√≥rdoba martyrs was to round up and imprison the leaders of the Christian community. Towards the end of the decade of the martyrs, Eulogius's martyrology begins to record the closing of Christian monasteries and convents, which to Muslim eyes had proved to be a hotbed of disruptive fanaticism rather than a legitimate response against a slow but systematic elimination of Christianity. As previously with the Muslims, so as the Reconquista advanced, the Mozarabs integrated into the Christian kingdoms, where the kings privileged those who settled the frontier lands. They also migrated north to the Frankish kingdom in times of persecution. Significantly large numbers of Mozarabs settled in the Ebro valley. King Alfonso VI of Castile induced Mozarab settlers by promising them lands and rewards. His importation of Mozarab settlers from Al-Andalus was very unusual because of its startling nature. According to the Anglo-Norman historian, Orderic Vitalis, some 10,000 Mozarabs were sent by Alfonso for settlement on the Ebro. Mozarabs were scarce in Tudela or Zaragossa, but were more common in a place such as Calahorra, conquered by the Kingdom of Navarre in 1045. ==Language== During the early stages of Romance language development in Iberia, a set of closely related Romance dialects was spoken in Muslim areas of the Peninsula by the general population. These are known as the Mozarabic language, though there never was a common standard. This archaic Romance language is first documented in writing in the Peninsula in the form of choruses (kharjas) in Arabic and Hebrew lyrics called muwashshahs. As they were written in Arabic and Hebrew alphabets the vowels have had to be reconstructed. Mozarab had a significant impact in the formation of Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan, transmitting to these many words of Andalusi Arabic origin. The northward migration of Mozarabs explains the presence of Arabic toponyms in places where the Muslim presence did not last long. The cultural language of Mozarabs continued to be Latin, but as time passed, young Mozarabs studied and even excelled at Arabic. The implantation of Arabic as the vernacular by the Moorish conquerors led the Christian polemicist Petrus Alvarus of C√≥rdoba to famously lament the decline of spoken Latin among the local Christians. The use of Arabic cognomens by the Mozarab communities of Al-Andalus is emblematic of the adoption by the Christians of the outward manifestations of Arab-language Islamic culture. The Mozarabs employed Arabic- style names such as Zaheid ibn Zafar, Pesencano ibn Azafar, Ibn Gafif, Ibn Gharsiya (Garcia), Ibn Mardanish (Martinez), Ibn Faranda (Fernandez), in purely Christian contexts. This demonstrates that they had acculturated thoroughly and that their Arabic names were not mere aliases adopted to facilitate their movement within Muslim society. Conversely, some Christian names such as Lope and Fortun entered the local Arabic lexicon (Lubb and Fortun), and others were adopted in translated form (such as Sa'ad for Felix). In the witness lists, Mozarabs identified themselves with undeniably Arabic names such as al-Aziz, and Ibn Uthman. Several Mozarabs also used the name Al- Quti (The Goth), and some may have been actual descendants from the family of the Pre-Islamic Visigothic Christian king, Wittiza. ==Culture and religion== Beatus of Facundus: Judgement of Babylon. Originally from the Basilica of San Isidoro of Le√≥n. Now in Madrid. There are but few remains of Christian scholarly discourse in Muslim Iberia. What remains in Arabic are translations of the Gospels and the Psalms, anti-Islamic tracts and a translation of a church history. To this should be added literary remains in Latin which remained the language of the liturgy. There is evidence of a limited cultural borrowing from the Mozarabs by the Muslim community in Al-Andalus. For instance, the Muslims' adoption of the Christian solar calendar and holidays was an exclusively Andalusi phenomenon. In Al-Andalus, the Islamic lunar calendar was supplemented by the local solar calendar, which were more useful for agricultural and navigational purposes. Like the local Mozarabs, the Muslims of Al-Andalus were notoriously heavy drinkers. Muslims also celebrated traditional Christian holidays sometimes with the sponsorship of their leaders, despite the fact that such fraternisation was generally opposed by the Ulema. The Muslims also hedged their metaphysical bets through the use of Roman Catholic sacraments. In the earliest period of Muslim domination of Iberia, there is evidence of extensive interaction between the two communities attested to by shared cemeteries and churches, bilingual coinage, and the continuity of late Roman pottery types. Furthermore, in the peninsula the conquerors did not settle in the amsar, the self-contained and deliberately isolated city camps set up alongside existing settlements elsewhere in the Muslim world with the intention of protecting Muslim settlers from corrupting indigenous influences. The Arab and mostly Berber immigrants who settled in the existing towns were drawn into broad contact with natives. Their immigration, though limited in numbers, introduced new agricultural and hydraulic technologies, new craft industries, and Levantine techniques of shipbuilding. They were accompanied by an Arabic-language culture that brought with it the higher learning and science of the classical and post-classical Levantine world. The Emir of C√≥rdoba, Abd ar-Rahman I's policy of allowing the ethnic Arab politico-military elite to practise agriculture further encouraged economic and cultural contact and cohesion. Moreover, the interaction of foreign and native elements, fostered by intermarriage and contact in day-to- day commercial and social life rapidly stimulated acculturation between the two groups. The heterodox features of Mozarabic culture inevitably became more prominent. However, Christian women often married Muslim men and their children were raised as Muslims. Even within Mozarab families, legal divorce eventually came to be practised along Islamic lines. Ordination of the clergy ultimately drifted far from canonical norms, breaking apostolic succession, and various Muslim sources claim that concubinage and fornication among the clergy was extremely widespread. The four riders, ca. 1086, from the Beatus d'Osma. Some Christian authorities (√Ålvaro and Eulogius of C√≥rdoba) were scandalized at the treatment of Christians, and began encouraging the public declarations of the faith as a way to reinforce the faith of the Christian community and protest the Islamic laws that Christians saw as unjust. Eulogius composed tractates and martyrologies for Christians during this time. The forty-eight Christians (mostly monks) known as the Martyrs of C√≥rdoba were martyred between the years 850 and 859, being decapitated for publicly proclaiming their Christian beliefs. Dhimmis (non Muslims living under Muslim rule) were not allowed to speak of their faith to Muslims under penalty of death. Wolf points out that it is important to distinguish between the motivations of the individual martyrs, and those of Eulogius and Alvarus in writing the Memoriale. Jessica A. Coope says that while it would be wrong to ascribe a single motive to all forty-eight, she suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation. They demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity.Coope, Jessica A., The Martyrs of C√≥rdoba: Community and Family Conflict in an Age of Mass Conversion\\", p. 14, University of Nebraska Press, 1995 The Mozarab population was badly affected by the hardening of relations between the Christians and the Muslims during the Almoravid period. In 1099, the people of Granada, by order of the Almoravid Emir, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, acting on the advice of his Ulema, destroyed the main Mozarab church of the Christian community. The Mozarabs remained apart from the influence of French Catholic religious orders, such as the Cistercians ‚Äì highly influential in northern Christian Iberia, and conserved in their masses the Visigothic rite, also known as the Mozarabic rite. The Christian kingdoms of the north, though, changed to the Latin Rite and appointed northerners as bishops for the reconquered sees. Nowadays, the Mozarabic rite is allowed by a papal privilege at the Mozarab Chapel of the Cathedral of Toledo, where it is held daily. Poor Clare Nuns church in Madrid, La Inmaculada y San Pascual, also holds weekly Mozarabic masses. A Mozarab brotherhood is still active in Toledo. Since Toledo was the most deeply rooted centre where they remained firm, the Gothic rite was identified and came to be known as the \\"Toledan rite\\". In 1080, Pope Gregory VII called the council of Burgos, where it was agreed to unify the Latin rite in all Christian lands. In 1085, Toledo was reconquered and there was a subsequent attempt to reintroduce the ecumenical standards of Rome. The reaction of the Toledan people was such that the king refused to implement it, and in 1101 enacted the \\"Fuero (Code of laws) of the Mozarabs\\", which awarded them privileges. He specified that it applied only to the Castilians, Mozarabs, and Franks of the city. During both his first marriage to Agnes of Aquitaine and his second marriage to Constance of Burgundy, both of whom were devout Roman Catholics, king Alfonso VI of Castile was under constant pressure to eradicate the Mozarab rite. A popular legend states that Alfonso VI submitted the Mozarab liturgy and its Roman counterpart to ordeal by fire, putting the fix in for the Catholic rite. Hence, the Mozarab liturgy was abolished in 1086. In 1126, a great number of Mozarabs were expelled to North Africa by the Almoravids. Other Mozarabs fled to Northern Iberia. This constituted the end of the Mozarabic culture in Al- Andalus. For a while, both in North Africa and in Northern Iberia, the Mozarabs managed to maintain their own separate cultural identity. However, in North Africa, they were eventually Islamized. Over the course of the 12th and 13th centuries, there unrolled a steady process of the impoverishment of Mozarab cultivators, as more and more land came under control of magnates and ecclesiastical corporations. The latter, under the influence of the Benedictine bishop of Cluny Bernard, and the Archbishop of Toledo Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada, who was himself the principal buyer of Mozarab property in the early 13th century fomented a segregationalist policy under the cloak of religious nationalism. Jim√©nez de Rada's bias is symbolized in his coining of the semi-erudite etymology of the word Mozarab from Mixti Arabi, connoting the contamination of this group by overexposure to infidel customs, if not by migration. At Toledo, king Alfonso VI of Castile did not recognize the Mozarabs as a separate legal community, and thus accentuated a steady decline which led to the complete absorption of the Mozarabs by the general community by the end of the 15th century. As a result, the Mozarabic culture had been practically lost. Cardinal Cisneros, aware of the Mozarabic liturgy historical value and liturgical richness, undertook the task of guaranteeing its continuation, and to this end gathered all the codices and texts to be found in the city. After they had been carefully studied by specialists, they were classified and in 1502 the Missal and Breviary were printed. They revitalised the faith and a Chapel was instituted at the Cathedral, with its own priests which still exists today. The Mozarab Missal of Silos is the oldest Western manuscript on paper, written in the 11th century. The Mozarab community in Toledo continues to thrive to this day. It is made of 1,300 families whose genealogies can be traced back to the ancient Mozarabs. == Debates on the preponderance of Mozarabs in Al-Andalus == Mappa mundi as depicted in the Beatus d'Osma, ca. 1086 There is a long-running debate about how much of the population of Al-Andalus was Mozarabs. Some maintain that the Mozarabs were part of a historical continuum of Latinised Christians that represented the majority of the population of Al-Andalus, while others argue that the Christian population was relatively small in the areas under Muslim rule. The former camp bases their position on the work of Francisco Javier Simonet, whose works Glosario de voces ib√©ricas y latinas usadas entre los moz√°rabes (1888) and Historia de los moz√°rabes de Espa√±a supported the idea that the indigenous Christian community of Al-Andalus formed the majority of the population. Other historians argue that the work of Simonet and those who preceded him in studying this question did not use sources properly, and that there is no historical evidence that can be used to make a definitive pronouncement on the ethnic composition of Al-Andalus society. ==See also== *Mozarabic art and architecture *Muladi *Musta'arabi Jews ==References== ==Further reading== *Burman, Thomas E.

One of the haloalkanes, it is a colorless, odorless, flammable gas. Methyl chloride is a crucial reagent in industrial chemistry, although it is rarely present in consumer products. ==Occurrence== Chloromethane is an abundant organohalogen, anthropogenic or natural, in the atmosphere. ===Marine=== Laboratory cultures of marine phytoplankton (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Phaeocystis sp., Thalassiosira weissflogii, Chaetoceros calcitrans, Isochrysis sp., Porphyridium sp., Synechococcus sp., Tetraselmis sp., Prorocentrum sp., and Emiliana huxleyi) produce CH3Cl, but in relatively insignificant amounts. An extensive study of 30 species of polar macroalgae revealed the release of significant amounts of CH3Cl in only Gigartina skottsbergii and Gymnogongrus antarcticus. ===Biogenesis=== The salt marsh plant Batis maritima contains the enzyme methyl chloride transferase that catalyzes the synthesis of CH3Cl from S-adenosine-L-methionine and chloride. This protein has been purified and expressed in E. coli, and seems to be present in other organisms such as white rot fungi (Phellinus pomaceus), red algae (Endocladia muricata), and the ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), each of which is a known CH3Cl producer. ===Sugarcane and the emission of methyl chloride=== In the sugarcane industry, the organic waste is usually burned in the power cogeneration process. When contaminated by chloride, this waste burns, releasing methyl chloride in the atmosphere. ===Interstellar detections=== Chloromethane has been detected in the low-mass Class 0 protostellar binary, IRAS 16293‚Äì2422, using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). It was also detected in the comet 67P/Churyumov‚ÄìGerasimenko (67P/C-G) using the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument on the Rosetta spacecraft. The detections reveal that chloromethane can be formed in star- forming regions before planets or life is formed. Freon-40 has been detected in space. ==Production== Chloromethane was first synthesized by the French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot in 1835 by boiling a mixture of methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium chloride. This method is similar to that used today. Chloromethane is produced commercially by treating methanol with hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride, according to the chemical equation: :CH3OH + HCl ‚Üí CH3Cl + H2O A smaller amount of chloromethane is produced by treating a mixture of methane with chlorine at elevated temperatures. This method, however, also produces more highly chlorinated compounds such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. For this reason, methane chlorination is usually only practiced when these other products are also desired. This chlorination method also cogenerates hydrogen chloride, which poses a disposal problem. ==Dispersion in the environment == Most of the methyl chloride present in the environment ends up being released to the atmosphere. After being released into the air, the life of this substance in the atmosphere varies from one to three years. On the other hand, when the methyl chloride emitted is released to water, it will be rapidly lost by volatilization. The [half-life] of this substance in terms of volatilization in the river, lagoon and lake is 2.1 h, 25 h and 18 days, respectively. The amount of methyl chloride in the stratosphere is estimated to be 2 x 106 tonnes per year, representing 20-25% of the total amount of chlorine that is emitted to the stratosphere annually. ==Uses== Large scale use of chloromethane is for the production of dimethyldichlorosilane and related organosilicon compounds. These compounds arise via the direct process. The relevant reactions are (Me = CH3): :x MeCl + Si ‚Üí Me3SiCl, Me2SiCl2, MeSiCl3, Me4Si2Cl2, ... Dimethyldichlorosilane (Me2SiCl2) is of particular value (precursor to silicones, but trimethylsilyl chloride (Me3SiCl) and methyltrichlorosilane (MeSiCl3) are also valuable. Smaller quantities are used as a solvent in the manufacture of butyl rubber and in petroleum refining. Chloromethane is employed as a methylating and chlorinating agent, e.g. the production of methylcellulose. It is also used in a variety of other fields: as an extractant for greases, oils, and resins, as a propellant and blowing agent in polystyrene foam production, as a local anesthetic, as an intermediate in drug manufacturing, as a catalyst carrier in low-temperature polymerization, as a fluid for thermometric and thermostatic equipment, and as a herbicide. ===Obsolete applications=== Chloromethane was a widely used refrigerant, but its use has been discontinued. Chloromethane was also once used for producing lead-based gasoline additives (tetramethyllead). ==Safety== Inhalation of chloromethane gas produces central nervous system effects similar to alcohol intoxication. The TLV is 50 ppm and the MAC is the same. Prolonged exposure may have mutagenic effects. ==References*Data sheet at inchem.org *Toxicological information *Information about chloromethane *Concise International Chemical Assessment Document 28 on chloromethane *IARC Summaries & Evaluations Vol. 71 (1999) *Ohligschl√§ger et al.

Retrieved March 2, 2018.The Village of Bronxville (\\"Although nearby Sarah Lawrence College, founded in 1926 by William Lawrence to honor his wife, has a Bronxville postal address, it is actually located in Yonkers.\\") Retrieved March 29, 2014. The college models its approach to education after the Oxford/Cambridge system of one-on-one student-faculty tutorials, which are a key component in all areas of study. Sarah Lawrence emphasizes scholarship, particularly in the humanities, performing arts, and writing, and places high value on independent study. ==History== William Van Duzer Lawrence Sarah Lawrence College was established by real-estate mogul William Van Duzer Lawrence (1842‚Äì1927) on the grounds of his estate in Westchester County and was named in honor of his wife, Sarah Bates Lawrence (1846‚Äì1926). The college was originally intended to provide instruction in the arts and humanities for women. A major component of the college's early curriculum was \\"productive leisure\\", wherein students were required to work for eight hours weekly in such fields as modeling, shorthand, typewriting, applying makeup, and gardening. Its pedagogy, modeled on the tutorial system of Oxford University, combined independent research projects, individually supervised by the teaching faculty, and seminars with low student-to-faculty ratio‚Äîa pattern it retains to the present, despite its cost. Sarah Lawrence was the first liberal arts college in the United States to incorporate a rigorous approach to the arts with the principles of progressive education, focusing on the primacy of teaching and the concentration of curricular efforts on individual needs. Sarah Lawrence Harold Taylor, President of Sarah Lawrence College from 1945 to 1959, greatly influenced the college. Taylor, elected president at age 30, maintained a friendship with educational philosopher John Dewey, and worked to employ the Dewey method at Sarah Lawrence. Taylor spent much of his career calling for educational reform in the United States, using the success of Sarah Lawrence as an example of the possibilities of a personalized, modern, and rigorous approach to higher education. Sarah Lawrence became a coeducational institution in 1968. Prior to this transition, there were discussions about relocating the school and merging it with Princeton University, but the administration opted to remain independent. ===Alleged abuse by Larry Ray, 2010 ‚Äì 2020=== In February 2020, Brooklyn native Lawrence V. \\"Larry\\" Ray, born Lawrence Grecco, who had resided in his daughter's on-campus apartment in 2010 after his release from prison, was charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with conspiracy, extortion, sex trafficking, forced labor, and other related offenses, following nearly 10 years of alleged transgressions with students and former students. At a bail hearing held March 2, 2020, an Assistant U.S. Attorney disclosed to the Manhattan federal court that Ray had been arrested while in bed with one of his victims. Bail was denied. ===College presidents=== The first president of the college was Marion Coats from 1924 to 1929. She was a friend of Vassar College president Henry MacCracken and of Sarah Lawrence founder William Van Duzer Lawrence. Coats had traditional views of women's role in society that were at odds with her progressive approach to women's education. Cristle Collins Judd was introduced as president in 2017. ==Academics== At the undergraduate level, Sarah Lawrence offers an alternative to traditional majors. Students pursue a wide variety of courses in four different curricular distributions: the Creative Arts (writing, music, dance, theatre, film, and the plastic arts, such as painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture); history and the social sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology); the humanities (e.g., Asian studies, art history, film studies, languages, literature, philosophy, and religion); and natural science and mathematics (biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and mathematics). Classes are structured around a seminar- conference system through which students learn in small, highly interactive seminars and private tutorials with professors. Each student is assigned to a faculty advisor, known as a \\"don\\", who helps the student plan a course of study and provides ongoing academic guidance. Most courses, apart from those in the performing arts, consist of two parts: the seminar, limited to 15 students, and conferences, which is a meeting with a seminar professor. In these conferences, students develop individual projects that extend the course material and link it to their personal interests. Sarah Lawrence has no required courses, and traditional examinations have largely been supplanted by research papers. Additionally, grades are recorded only for transcript purposes‚Äînarrative evaluations are given in lieu of grades. The College sponsors international programs in Florence, at Wadham College, Oxford, at Reid Hall in Paris, and at the British American Drama Academy in London. Sarah Lawrence also has the longest-running study abroad program in Havana, Cuba. Sarah Lawrence also offers Master's-level programs in Writing, the Art of Teaching, Child Development, Theatre, Dance, and Dance/Movement Therapy and is home to the nation's oldest graduate program in Women's History and the nation's first master's degree programs in Human Genetics and Health Advocacy. Sarah Lawrence offers a program for people wishing to seek a B.A., or a Master's and have been out of school for any period. ===Exchange programs=== * Eugene Lang College Exchange Program: In 1996 the college began its exchange program with Eugene Lang College, the undergraduate division of the New School in New York City. Eugene Lang has particular strengths in the social sciences. Qualified students may cross-register in courses in other divisions of the New School, including the graduate divisions. Students must have strong academic records and have completed the first and sophomore years. Qualified students also have the opportunity to participate in Lang's exchange program at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. * Spelman College Exchange Program: Beginning in spring 2007, female SLC students began participating in an exchange program with Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. * Pitzer College Exchange Program * California Institute of the Arts Exchange Program * Kansai Gaidai University (Asian Studies Program) Osaka, Japan * Tsuda University (Private Women's University) Tokyo, Japan ===International programs=== The college has a number of international programs in four countries. Sarah Lawrence makes all practical efforts to preserve its most characteristic elements, such as one-on-one interaction with professors, small classes, and an emphasis on qualitative comprehension, in its programs overseas. * Havana: In place since 2000, this program is the longest-running in Cuba by an American university. The course offerings at the University of Havana include Afro-Cuban culture, art history, Cuban or Latin American cinema, Cuban history, Latin American studies, literature, psychology, urban and rural sociology, U.S.-Cuban relations, and women's studies. All courses are taught by Cuban faculty and are attended by Cuban students. Each student is also required to enroll in an advanced Spanish course. The most distinctive feature is an affiliation with Centro de Estudios Demogr√°ficos (CEDEM), one of the research centers at the University of Havana. At CEDEM students meet with experts whose research and professional expertise focus on developments in contemporary Cuban society. Students select a research topic and are paired with a professor from CEDEM with whom they meet on a regular basis, much like the regular conference structure. * London: Jointly sponsored by the British American Drama Academy and Sarah Lawrence College, the program expands Sarah Lawrence's long-standing and vibrant tradition in the performing arts by exposing students to the rigors of professional British training in acting. The faculty includes some of Britain's most distinguished actors and directors. The heart of each student's program is scene study in classical and modern works. Students also take courses in voice, movement, and stage fighting and participate in fully staged performances at the end of each term. * Oxford: Since 1985, Sarah Lawrence College has been associated with Wadham College, one of the undergraduate colleges of Oxford University in England. This program is open to select juniors and seniors. Students are best prepared to undertake the demands of Oxford if their coursework in their first and sophomore years have included significant analytical and written work. * Leeds: Students who are admitted into the University of Leeds program have access to a variety of disciplines and academic strengths. The academic year runs from September through the end of May and is made up of two semesters. Students will take a combination of lectures, seminars, and tutorials, with additional time for private study, labs (sciences) and fieldwork. Students will meet with a Sarah Lawrence program advisor in determining their course of study each semester. * Dartington: A highly competitive, music based exchange with Dartington College of the Arts in southern England. The program is open to qualified students with interest in experimental music and media. * Paris: Centered at historic Reid Hall in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris, the program is Sarah Lawrence's oldest and focuses on the humanities and creative arts. The program is conducted entirely in French and includes one required French-language class and three other courses of the student's choosing. Classes may be taken at the University of Paris, Institut d'Etudes Politiques, the Ecole du Louvre, and the Institut Catholique, or other, more specialized institutions. * Catania: Open to students who have an advanced comprehension of Italian, the Catania program takes advantage of its Sicilian setting to provide students with an experience in cultural immersion. Students enroll directly at the University of Catania and choose courses offered by the Humanities department, including: Medieval History, Modern Italian Literature, History of Philosophy, Archaeology, Greek and Roman Art History, History of Theatrical Arts, Comparative Literature, Byzantine History, and the History of Europe. ===Graduate programs=== Sarah Lawrence offers nine graduate programs, each of which confers the Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts, or Master of Science degree upon its graduates. In contrast to highly specialized, research-oriented doctoral study, these programs reflect the emphasis on interdisciplinary studies and the close student-teacher relationship that have come to be characteristic of the college's undergraduate program. Intensive work with faculty members, small seminars, and one-on-one conferences form the foundation of the curricular model. According to their own literature, the programs make an effort to balance the \\"theoretical (usually discussed in seminars and conferences) with the practical (in the form of fieldwork, practicums, research or creative work). This experiential work is most often conducted not in isolation, but in the midst of a community. Interdisciplinary work and ideas are encouraged, as is an ethic of social responsibility.\\" There are approximately 298 graduate students at Sarah Lawrence. ====Art of Teaching==== The Sarah Lawrence College Art of Teaching Program offers training in education in both degree-track and continuing education formats. One component of the program is the Empowering Teachers Program, which was established in 1989 as a forum for the support of teachers and educational administrators, and has since expanded into a resource and network for more than 250 beginning and experienced professionals from 25 school districts in Westchester County and adjacent areas of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. ===Rankings=== In 2007, criticism of rankings of U.S. colleges and universities, particularly their perceived impact on the college admissions process, gained national prominence due in part to the March 11, 2007, Washington Post article \\"The Cost of Bucking College Rankings\\" by Michele Tolela Myers, a former president of Sarah Lawrence College. As Sarah Lawrence College dropped its SAT test score submission requirement for its undergraduate applicants in 2003, thus joining the SAT optional movement for undergraduate admission, SLC does not have SAT data to send to U.S. News for its national survey. Of this decision, Myers states, \\"We are a writing- intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions.\\" At the time, Sarah Lawrence was the only American college that completely disregarded SAT scores in its admission process. As a result of this policy, in the same The Washington Post article, Dr. Myers stated that she was informed by the U.S. News & World Report that if no SAT scores were submitted, U.S. News would \\"make up a number\\" to use in its magazines. She further argues that if SLC were to decide to stop sending all data to U.S. News & World Report, their ranking would be artificially decreased. Sarah Lawrence College now maintains a test-optional policy, with typically over half of applicants submitting their scores. On June 19, 2007, following a meeting of the Annapolis Group, which represents over 100 liberal arts colleges, Sarah Lawrence announced that it would join others who had previously signed the letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the \\"reputation survey\\" section of the U.S. News & World Report survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). Despite this public stance opposing these rankings, the 2019 edition ranked Sarah Lawrence tied for the 65th best liberal arts college in the nation. In 2018, Forbes rated it 133rd overall in its America's Top Colleges ranking, which includes 660 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. That same year, Washington Monthly rankings ranked Sarah Lawrence 144th in the liberal arts college category. ==Political involvement and activism== Political activism has played a crucial role in forming the spirit of the Sarah Lawrence community since the early years of the college. As early as 1938, students were volunteering in working-class sections of Yonkers, New York to help bring equality and educational opportunities to poor and minority citizens, and the Sarah Lawrence College War Board, organized by students in the fall of 1942, sought to aid troops fighting in World War II. During a time when the college's enrollment consisted of only 293 students, 204 signed up as volunteers during the first week of the War Board. During the so-called McCarthy Years, a number of Sarah Lawrence's faculty members were accused by the American Legion of being sympathetic to the Communist Party, and were called before the Jenner Committee. Since that time, activism has played a central role in student life, with movements for civil rights and against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and for student and faculty diversity in the 1980s. Also in the 1960s, students established an Upward Bound program for students from lower-income and poverty areas to prepare for college.United States. United States Congress. Joint Committee. A Directory of Urban Research Study Centers. Washington: United States Congress, 1977. Theatre Outreach, the Child Development Institute, the Empowering Teachers Program, the Community Writers program, the Office of Community Partnership, and the Fulbright High School Writers Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community. In the late 1980s, students occupied Westlands, the main administrative building for the campus, in a sit-in for wider diversity. Students occupied Westlands again in 2016, in a sit-in supporting improved wages and safer working conditions for the college's recently unionized facilities workers. For many years, the college has been considered as being at the vanguard of the sexual rights movement and many progressive causes. ==Campus== Westlands House Much of the Sarah Lawrence campus was originally a part of the estate of the college's founder, William Van Duzer Lawrence, though the college has more than doubled its size since Lawrence bequeathed his estate to the college in 1926. The terrain is characterized by dramatic outcroppings of exposed bedrock shaded by large oak and elm trees. Many of the older buildings are in the Tudor Revival architecture style that was popular in the area during the early 20th century, and many of the college's newer buildings attempt an updated interpretation of the same style. The campus is divided into two distinctive sections, the \\"Old Campus\\" and the \\"New Campus\\": the first is roughly contained within the boundaries of the former Lawrence estate, and the area of the second was acquired sometime after the college's earliest years. The area outside the original Lawrence estate holds the college's newer facilities. Several stately, century-old, Tudor-style mansions will be found among these newer additions, including Andrews, Tweed, Lynd, Marshall Field, and Slonim House: each was once a private estate, purchased by the college during periods of growth and expansion. The more modest Tudor houses along Mead Way, which also had been private residences, now serve as dormitories for students at the college. \\"Slonim Woods\\" is a group of newer, townhouse-style dormitories, built on the grounds of Slonim House. The Campbell Sports Center was constructed in 1998 in response to an increased focus on physical fitness and sports. This facility includes an indoor pool, gymnasium, track, squash courts, and weight rooms. In 2004, the College completed construction of a modern visual arts facility, the Monika A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center, with sleek architecture and environmentally friendly aspects which earned the College national press attention. Just down the road is Hill House, a six-story apartment building purchased by the college in the late 1990s that now lodges students. Across the street from Hill House is the large Wrexham house, also in the Tudor style, which the College purchased from the government of Rwanda in 2004; this building, once home to the Rwandan consul, has been renovated and is used for various postgraduate programs. At the opposite end of the campus stands the Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994. ===Buildings=== ====Academic facilities==== * The Barbara Walters Campus Center is the newest building on campus. Finished in the fall of 2019, the building is named for alumna Barbara Walters. The building boasts a flexible multipurpose space which is used for dances, speeches, class gatherings, etc. On the second floor is the Barbara Walters Reading Room. It includes a rotating exhibition, but currently holds artifacts from Barbara Walters' life. The building has a green roof energy efficient LED lighting. * Bates Center for Student Life is one of the original campus buildings. A huge facility designed in the English Tudor style that is common in the area, it has housed not just offices and classrooms, but everything from maids' quarters to dining halls to laboratories and arts facilities. At one time, it was home to a miniature basketball court that is now a faculty dining room, though the lines of the court can still be seen on the floors. Over the years, programs in science, visual arts, and physical education have grown to the point that they have spilled over elsewhere on the campus, requiring three buildings of their own. Bates has always been home to the college's main dining facility and also houses the popular \\"Health Food Bar.\\"SLC Campus ‚Äì Bates * The Esther Raushenbush Library, designed in 1974 by Walter, Burns, Toan & Lundein an architectural style meant to interpret in a more modern and sleek fashion the implied buttresses and strong features of its much older neighbor, Andrews House. The Raushenbush Library houses over 300,000 volumes.SLC.edu ‚Äì Library * The Alice Stone Ilchman Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994, is situated on the far north end of the campus. It houses science laboratories in addition to classrooms and faculty offices. The building is named for former president Alice Stone Ilchman.SLC Campus ‚Äì Science Center * The Marshall Field Music Building was originally created as part of William Lawrence's residential neighborhood, Lawrence Park West. Built in the Georgian Colonial style, it was situated on of landscaped land when the college purchased it in 1960 to house the music department and to provide additional student housing. Prior to the purchase, President Harold Taylor played his clarinet in several of the rooms to test the acoustics.SLC Campus ‚Äì Marshall Field Building * The Monica A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center The building was designed by Polshek Partnership Architects. Completed in 2004, the building has garnered national press for its 'green' design. Relating to the college's stated goals, the building engages the landscape and existing campus circulation patterns, promotes student engagement through transparency, and takes a leadership role in sustainable design. The jury applauded its inventive use of materials; consistent development of the project in relation to the original concept; well-integrated plan/section; and exemplary use of building siting, solar orientation, daylighting, and locally quarried fieldstone to achieve LEED certification. The American Institute of Architects awarded a special 'Sustainable Architecture Honor Award' to the project as well as First Honor Awards at its 2005 \\"Celebration of Architecture\\".SLC Campus ‚Äì Visual Arts Center Heimbold Center ‚Äì Historic Campus Architecture Project * The Campbell Sports Center One of the newest buildings on campus, the Sports Center was completed in 1997 and houses a swimming pool, a rowing tank, a weight room and exercise center, an indoor running track, squash courts, a basketball court, classrooms, locker rooms, and administrative offices.SLC Campus ‚Äì Sports Center * The Charles DeCarlo Performing Arts Center, remodeled and greatly expanded in 1974, is a large facility on the western end of the South Lawn. Named for former College president Charles DeCarlo, the complex comprises the Bessie Sch√∂nberg Dance Theatre, the 200-seat Suzanne Werner Wright Theatre, the 400-seat Reisinger Auditorium, the 117-seat Cannon Workshop Theatre modeled after Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, and rehearsal spaces and work areas. The College bookstore is located in the PAC.SLC Campus ‚Äì Performing Arts Center * The Ruth Leff Siegel Center, which is almost exclusively referred to as \\"The Pub\\", was originally constructed as a gardener's cottage on the Lawrence estate, then used as an infirmary and later as a faculty house. When the college began admitting male students in 1968, it became temporary housing for men. During the 1970s, the space was remodeled and christened \\"The Pub\\" for use as an informal dining hall and as a space for student activities. During the 1980s, it was renamed \\"Charlie's Place\\", honoring former President DeCarlo. In 1998, the entire structure was renovated, an addition was built by the architects Buttrick White & Burtis, and the new complex took on its current official name. Today, it houses primarily a caf√© serving on-the-go food, as well as two TV lounges.SLC Campus ‚Äì Siegel Center * The Tea House, also known as the \\"Tea Haus\\", because its fa√ßade evokes German architectural motifs, was originally a gazebo built by the Lawrence family on a small rocky hill on the north lawn of their estate. After being saved by a student petition from a demolition that was called for by architect Philip Johnson in 1960, it was converted to an enclosed building with large windows and a fireplace that now houses a caf√© selling a variety of teas and baked goods. While it is a fact that the building housed the office of history faculty member Charles Trinkaus from the 1950s through 1970, there seems to be no evidence to support the persistent campus rumor that the Tea House was once the office of long-time faculty member Joseph Campbell. ====Administration buildings==== * Andrews Annex, built in the 1990s adjacent to Andrews House, houses a number of administrative offices. * Lyles House is home to the college's Health Services Center. * The President's House, built in 1921 and designed by architect Louis Bowman of McKim, Mead & White, is an example of 16th century Tudor-style architecture. Its living room features restored carved beams, representing the various trades, from a 16th-century Tudor mansion in England. Additionally, above the mantel a Christian creation story is told in intricate wood carving. Campus legend dictates that a secret panel exists in the living room leading to a wine cellar, which was built during Prohibition. The President's House has housed the college's presidents since 1954, when the first President's House, located north of campus, was demolished to make way for the Sprain Brook Parkway.Presidents House ‚Äì Historic Campus Architecture Project * Robinson House on Mead Way is home to the college's communications department. Until 1952, it housed \\"The Caf\\", a student coffee shop, on its main floor. * Westlands is primarily an administrative building, but its top floor houses a number of student living spaces. Completed in 1917, it is the oldest building on campus and was home to Sarah Bates Lawrence and William Van Duzer Lawrence before being given to the college.A Yonkers Locale, a Bronxville Pedigree, The New York Times Dynamically situated at the highest point of elevation on the campus, it is another example of English Tudor architecture by Bates & How.Westlands House ‚Äì Historic Campus Architecture Project When completed the home was pictured on the front page of the New York Times. It has been the heart of the campus throughout the history of the College and, owing to its massive size, it now houses the president's offices, the Office of Admission, the Office of Financial Aid, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of International Programs, the Career Counseling Office, the offices of all of the college's deans, and a number of meeting spaces in addition to the top- floor dorms. * The Wrexham Road Property, acquired by the college in 2004, is a large manor house that once belonged to the government of Rwanda and used as a home for its consul. The building currently houses various graduate-level programs. ====Housing==== * Andrews House, a former manor house purchased for $200,000 by the college in 1935 from Arthur Lawrence, a son of the college's founders, is known for its high ceilings, fireplaces, and its spiraling main staircase. The house is designed in the Germantown Colonial Style by architect Penrose Scott. The majority of the building houses students, but it is also the home of the college's Department of Operations and Facilities and to the offices of Writing faculty. * Andrews Court refers to the twelve cottage-style buildings to the south of Andrews House. Built in 1974, the buildings have, on average, about eight units each in addition to full kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms. * Tweed, a former manor house, is home to a number of large dorm rooms in addition to a pair of classrooms. * Curtis is home to a number of dorms, and is also part of the Early Childhood Education complex. * Lynd House, another former mansion, is home to mostly living spaces. The building's adjacent carriage house has been converted into student housing. * Hill House, bought by the college in the late 1990s, is a seven-story apartment building on the extreme southern end of the campus. At present, the majority of the apartments in the building are occupied by students, but a number of them remain in the possession of the original tenants who occupied them when the building was purchased by Sarah Lawrence. Most of the apartments are quite large and each has a full kitchen. Apartments on the upper floors with south- facing windows have, on clear days, a view of the Empire State Building. * Kober is home to dorm rooms, but is also a part of the Early Childhood Education complex. It was donated to the college in 1951 by Otto Frohnknecht in memory of his daughter, Margaret Frohnknecht Kober, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1935. There was once a bowling alley in its basement. * Morrill is the former maid's quarters to the President's House, and now is home to faculty offices. * Slonim House was formerly a manor house that is now occupied by dorms and by the college's Center for Continuing Education and Office of Graduate Studies. * Slonim Woods is the group of 10 purpose-built living facilities constructed in 1977. They consist of eight single person dorm rooms arranged around a central communal living space. Old dorms The \\"Old dorms\\" refer to four original purpose-built student housing structures to the immediate north of Westlands in what is frequently referred to as the \\"central campus\\". Dudley Lawrence, one of the sons of William and Sarah Lawrence, achieved the remarkable feat of constructing three of these buildings in one year (1926‚Äì1927). The halls were designed by William Augustus Bates, who repeated the Neo-Tudor style of Westlands through the use of stone and timber materials, and mansard roofs. The interiors are also in keeping with the English Tudor architectural style found on most of the older buildings in the area, with thick plaster walls, hardwood floors, and leaded windows (since replaced with more energy-efficient double-pane windows). MacCracken, built a few years later than the other three, is situated to the south of Dudley Lawrence. The original elegant living rooms that were found in each building, excepting MacCracken, are now used as classrooms.Central Campus ‚Äì \\"old dorms\\" ‚Äì Historic Campus Architecture Project * Dudley Lawrence, houses two classrooms in addition to living spaces. It is named for William Lawrence's son, who oversaw the construction of the Old Dorms. * OSilas, originally named Gilbert for one of the college's original trustees, is the northernmost building of the four and is known for being quiet and populated with the college's more studious set. * MacCracken, named for Vassar College president Henry Noble MacCracken, is a few years younger than its neighbors and has, at various times, housed the college library, the bookstore, and a number of other facilities in addition to living spaces. Although it still serves as a dormitory, it now also houses dance studios, meeting spaces, and administrative offices. * Titsworth is an all-girls dorm and was also named for one of the college's founding trustees. It occupies the space between Gilbert and Dudley Lawrence and is also home to the Titsworth Lecture Hall. New dorms Rothschild, Garrison, and Taylor (left to right) Designed by the renowned architect Philip Johnson in the sparse modernist style of the time, the \\"New Dorms\\" were completed in 1960. The architectural style of the buildings is meant to be a modernist reflection of the three older dorms (Gilbert, Titsworth, and Dudley Lawrence) that stand on the opposite side of the North Lawn. The three buildings that comprise the New Dorms are connected by two glass atria in which the buildings' primary stairwells are found. With the exception of the large apartments in Rothschild, these dorms typically house first-year students. * Rothschild comprises apartment style, air- conditioned dorm spaces with kitchens, living rooms, and an elevator.

The college sponsors intercollegiate teams in crew (rowing), men's and women's cross country, equestrian, men's basketball, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's volleyball, men's and women's soccer, women's softball, and men's and women's swimming. In March 2011, the college announced that it would seek membership as a Division III member of the NCAA.SLC Registers as NCAA Exploratory Member The college began competing as a full member of Division III in the 2015‚Äì16 academic year after receiving a waiver to the required four-year 'provisional' period. The college left the Hudson Valley conference after the 2013‚Äì14 season and joined the Skyline Conference beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 season. The Skyline Conference contains several schools including SUNY Purchase and Yeshiva University which have played against Sarah Lawrence regularly over the past few years. The college's official mascot is a Gryphon by the name of Godric. It was chosen in the 1990s to represent the college's athletic teams after a long period of fielding sports teams without one. Unofficially, the student body had long adopted the large resident population of 'Black Squirrels' as a de facto mascot to the college. The position of silent mascot that the 'Black Squirrel' occupied was financially endorsed by the college itself with the production of various Black Squirrel merchandise (including Sarah Lawrence clothing branded with the Black Squirrel image) and plush toys. It is only recently (post-2003) that efforts on the behalf of the college to establish the Gryphon as the icon of Sarah Lawrence have begun to take root. ==Notable people== === Faculty === Among the prominent current or recent faculty of the college are fine art photographer Joel Sternfeld, poet Suzanne Gardinier, novelist Melvin Jules Bukiet, novelist William Melvin Kelley, novelist Tao Lin, poet Marie Howe, film historians Gilberto Perez and Malcolm Turvey, puppet-theatre artist Dan Hurlin, dancer/choreographer Sara Rudner, Jewish historian Glenn Dynner, philosopher Michael Peter Davis, and economist Franklin Delano Roosevelt, III.

She was featured in the short story \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", published in July 1891. She is one of the most notable female characters in the Sherlock Holmes series, despite appearing in only one story. In derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle's novels, in which he harbors a platonic admiration for her wit and cunning. ==Fictional character biography== Holmes (in disguise) at the wedding of Irene Adler and Godfrey Norton, 1891 illustration by Sidney Paget According to \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", Adler was born in New Jersey in 1858. She had a career in opera as a contralto, performing at La Scala in Milan, Italy, and a term as prima donna in the Imperial Opera of Warsaw, Poland, indicating that she was a talented singer. It was there that she became the lover of Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and King of Bohemia (then only the Crown Prince), who was staying in Warsaw for a period. The King describes her as \\"a well-known adventuress\\" (a term widely used at the time in ambiguous association with \\"courtesan\\") and also says that she had \\"the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men\\". She also claims to have been trained as an actress and \\"often\\" disguised herself as a man to \\"take advantage of the freedom which it gives\\". The King eventually returned to his court in Prague, while Adler, then in her late twenties, retired from the opera stage and moved to London. In 1888, the 30-year-old King intends to marry Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia; the marriage would be threatened if his prior relationship with Adler were to come to light. On 20 March, the King makes an incognito visit to Holmes in London. He asks the famous detective to secure possession of a previously taken photograph depicting Adler and the King together. The King hired burglars to attempt to retrieve it twice, had Adler herself waylaid, and her luggage stolen, to no avail. The King explains the situation to Holmes, telling him that Adler had promised to send a photograph proving their relationship to his fiance's family if he announced his betrothal. A disguised Holmes traces Adler's movements, learning of her private life and, notably, stands witness to her marriage to Godfrey Norton, an English lawyer. Holmes describes her as \\"a lovely woman, with a face a man might die for\\". Holmes disguises himself as an elderly cleric and sets up a faked incident to cause a diversion that is designed to gain him access to Adler's home and to trick her into revealing where the picture is hidden. Adler treats him kindly as the supposed victim of a crime outside her home. At the moment she gives away the location of the photograph, she realises she has been tricked. She tests her theory that it is indeed Holmes, of whom she had been warned, by disguising herself as a young man and wishing him good night as he and Watson return to 221B Baker Street. Holmes visits Adler's home the next morning with Watson and the King to demand the return of the photograph. He finds Adler gone, along with her new husband and the original photo, which has been replaced with a photograph of her alone as well as a letter to Holmes. The letter explains how she had outwitted him, but also that she is happy with her new husband, who has more honourable feelings than her former lover. Adler adds that she will not compromise the King and has kept the photo only to protect herself against any further action the King might take. In the face of this and the King's statement that it was a \\"pity that she was not on my level\\", Holmes then decides that Adler was the wronged party rather than the King and asks, when offered a reward by the King, only for the photograph that Adler had left. In the opening paragraph of the short story, Watson calls her \\"the late Irene Adler\\", suggesting she is deceased. It has been speculated, however, that the word \\"late\\" might actually mean \\"former\\". She married Godfrey Norton, making Adler her former name. (Doyle employs this same usage in \\"The Adventure of the Priory School\\" in reference to the Duke's former status as a cabinet minister.) ==Character sources== Lillie Langtry, one possible model for Irene Adler Adler's career as a theatrical performer who becomes the lover of a powerful aristocrat had several precedents. One is Lola Montez, a dancer who became the lover of Ludwig I of Bavaria and influenced national politics. Montez is suggested as a model for Adler by several writers. Another possibility is the singer Lillie Langtry, the lover of Edward, the Prince of Wales. Julian Wolff, founder of the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of academics specializing in Doyle's writing, points out that it was well known that Langtry was born in Jersey (she was called the \\"Jersey Lily\\") and Adler is born in New Jersey. Langtry had later had several other aristocratic lovers, and her relationships had been speculated upon in the public press in the years before Doyle's story was published. Another suggestion is the singer Ludmilla Stubel, the alleged lover and later wife of Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria. ==Appearances== Irene Adler appears only in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". Her name is briefly mentioned in \\"A Case of Identity\\", \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\\", and \\"His Last Bow\\". In \\"The Five Orange Pips\\", Holmes says he has \\"been beaten four times ‚Äì three times by men and once by a woman\\". If this woman is Adler, this contradicts the timeline of the stories. \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" takes place \\"on the twentieth of March, 1888\\"; \\"The Five Orange Pips\\" takes place before this in \\"the year '87\\". ==Holmes' relationship to Adler== Adler earns Holmes's unbounded admiration. When the King of Bohemia says, \\"Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my level?\\" Holmes drily replies that Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King. The beginning of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" describes the high regard in which Holmes held Adler: This \\"memory\\" is kept alive by a photograph of Irene Adler, which had been deliberately left behind when she and her new husband took flight with the embarrassing photograph of her with the King. Holmes had then asked for and received this photo from the King, as payment for his work on the case. In derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle's novels where he only admired her for her wit and cunning. In his Sherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes \\"the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.\\" ==Adaptations== ===Books=== In his fictional biographies Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street (1962) and Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street (1969), William S. Baring-Gould puts forth an argument that Adler and Holmes meet again after the latter's supposed death at Reichenbach Falls. They perform on stage together incognito, and become lovers. According to Baring- Gould, Holmes and Adler's union produces one son, Nero Wolfe, who would follow in his father's footsteps as a detective. In two novels by John Lescroart published in 1986 and 1987, it is stated that Adler and Holmes had a son, Auguste Lupa, and it is implied that he later changes his name to Nero Wolfe. A series of mystery novels written by Carole Nelson Douglas (1990‚Äì2004) features Irene Adler as the protagonist and sleuth, chronicling her life shortly before (in the novel Good Night, Mr. Holmes) and after her notable encounter with Sherlock Holmes and which feature Holmes as a supporting character. The series includes Godfrey Norton as Irene's supportive barrister husband; Penelope \\"Nell\\" Huxleigh, a vicar's daughter and former governess who is Irene's best friend and biographer; and Nell's love interest Quentin Stanhope. Historical characters such as Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Alva Vanderbilt and Consuelo Vanderbilt, and journalist Nellie Bly, among others, also make appearances. In the books, Douglas strongly implies that Irene's mother was Lola Montez and her father possibly Ludwig I of Bavaria. Douglas provides Irene with a back story as a pint-size child vaudeville performer who was trained as an opera singer before going to work as a Pinkerton detective. Irene Adler appears as an opera singer in the 1993 pastiche The Canary Trainer, where she encounters Holmes during his three-year 'death' while he is working as a violinist in the Paris Opera House, and asks him to help her protect her friend and unofficial protege, Christine Daa√©, from the 'Opera Ghost'. In the 2009 novel The Language of Bees by Laurie R. King, it is stated that Irene Adler, who is deceased when the book begins, once had an affair with main character Sherlock Holmes and gave birth to a son, Damian Adler, an artist now known as The Addler. Sherlock Holmes: The Golden Years, a 2014 collection of Sherlock Holmes pastiches, includes the story \\"A Bonnie Bag of Bones\\" wherein Adler and Holmes are eventually reunited. ===Films=== In the 1946 film Dressed to Kill, Adler is mentioned early in the film when Holmes and Watson discuss the events of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". She is portrayed by Rachel McAdams in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes. In that film, she is a femme fatale. A skilled professional thief, as well as a divorc√©e, Adler is no longer married to Godfrey Norton and needs Holmes' help for the case. She and Holmes are depicted as having a deep and mutual infatuation, even while she is employed by Professor Moriarty. McAdams reprised the role in the 2011 sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows in which Moriarty, deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes, poisons and (possibly) kills her. Moriarty taunts Holmes about murdering Adler, and Holmes swears revenge, leading to their climactic battle at Reichenbach Falls. ===Radio=== Margaret Ward voiced Irene Adler in a radio dramatisation of the short story \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" in 1954. The character was played by Gudrun Ure in a 1966 radio dramatisation of the same story. Both radio dramas aired on the BBC Light Programme. In 1977, Marian Seldes played Irene Adler in the CBS Radio Mystery Theater radio adaptation of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". Sarah Badel portrayed Irene Adler in the 7 November 1990 BBC Radio 4 broadcast of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" opposite Clive Merrison's Holmes. Ellen McLain played Irene Adler in the Imagination Theatre radio dramatisation of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", which aired on 17 June 2012. ===Stage=== Irene Adler was portrayed by Inga Swenson in the Broadway musical, Baker Street which also starred Fritz Weaver as Sherlock Holmes. According to the liner notes of the original cast album, the story makes extensive use of the story \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". The play opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York City, on 16 February 1965 and ran for 313 performances. The show's book was by Jerome Coopersmith and the music and lyrics were by Marian Grudeff and Raymond Jessel; the production was directed by Harold Prince. ===Television series=== Irene Adler was played by Olga Edwardes in the episode \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" in the 1951 TV series Sherlock Holmes. In the 1984 Granada Television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett, the first episode is \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", in which Adler is played by Gayle Hunnicutt. In \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", the first episode of the 2012 second series of the BBC Sherlock, Irene was portrayed by Lara Pulver opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes. She is initially sought to recover incriminating photos she possesses of a liaison between her and a female member of the Royal Family, along with various other incriminating documents kept in a password-protected phone. In many ways this version of Irene Adler is the polar opposite of Doyle's original tale: In this version, she is not American, but English; while the original was a victim of prosecution falsely accused of being a courtesan, this one is a culprit and a known dominatrix who serves high-end clientele; unlike the original, she is intensely attracted to Sherlock; most importantly, unlike the original, she consistently fails to best Sherlock and eventually ends up in his mercy. At the episode's conclusion, she is presumed killed by those she failed to provide with the information, but is secretly saved by Sherlock. She makes a cameo appearance as a figment of Sherlock's imagination in the episode \\"The Sign of Three\\", and sends Sherlock a card when he was shot in \\"His Last Vow\\" (seen only in the deleted scenes). In \\"The Lying Detective\\", Holmes receives a text that, from the text alert, John identifies as having come from Irene. Sherlock admits that Irene is alive, but states that he doesn't text back. John suggests that he do so, but Sherlock responds only in the last episode of season 4. In the CBS series, Elementary, Adler is initially an unseen character in the first season, mentioned first in \\"Flight Risk\\" (2012) as a former love interest of Holmes. It is later explained that she apparently died at the hands of a serial killer Holmes was investigating known as \\"M\\", an event that fueled Sherlock's descent into heroin addiction. In \\"M\\", Sherlock confronts M, revealed to be Sebastian Moran, and is told that Irene was not killed by Moran, but by his employer: Moriarty. In \\"Risk Management\\", it is explained that Irene was an American art restorer living in London. Holmes discovers Irene is alive, having been kept as Moriarty's prisoner in a dilapidated house. After rescuing Irene, Holmes is confronted with a final plot twist in \\"The Woman\\" and \\"Heroine\\": Irene Adler is his nemesis, Jamie Moriarty (gender- swapped from her literary counterpart). Moriarty created the Irene identity to seduce Holmes, and subsequently faked her own death to distract him from possibly uncovering her criminal activities. Natalie Dormer played Adler/Moriarty in the final three episodes of the season. In the 2013 Russian drama Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler takes a major role in the series and is portrayed by Lyanka Gryu. In the 2014 Japanese puppetry television show, Sherlock Holmes, broadcast on NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai, Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Irene Adler is a school nurse of a fictional boarding school Beeton School. At first she has an affair with Headmaster Ormstein but takes up with another man Godfrey Norton who teaches art and sees through the plot of Holmes and Watson in \\"The Adventure of the Headmaster with Trouble\\" based on \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". She is voiced by Rie Miyazawa. Irene Adler appears in the original anime television series Case File n¬∫221: Kabukicho (2019‚Äì2020), voiced by Maaya Sakamoto. ===Television films=== In the 1976 film Sherlock Holmes in New York, Adler (Charlotte Rampling) helps Holmes and Watson to solve a bank robbery organised by Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty, after he takes her son hostage to prevent Holmes from investigating the case. Holmes and Watson later rescue the boy, with a final conversation between Holmes and Adler at the conclusion of the case implying that Holmes is in fact the boy's father. This version of Irene Adler is not an opera singer, but an actress. Irene Adler is featured in Soviet director Igor Maslennikov's made-for-TV 5-part film series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. She appears in the fourth part, The Treasures of Agra (1983), based upon The Sign of the Four (main storyline) and A Scandal in Bohemia (flashback), in which Holmes and Watson, while waiting for the new information on his current case, remember their encounter with Irene Adler (played by Larisa Solovyova). In the 1984 made-for-TV film The Masks of Death, a widowed Irene Adler, played by Anne Baxter, is a guest at Graf Udo Von Felseck (Anton Diffring)'s country house where Holmes (Peter Cushing) and Watson (John Mills) are investigating the supposed disappearance of a visiting prince. Although Holmes initially considers her a suspect, she proves her innocence and becomes an ally. In the 1991 television film Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady, Irene Adler (Morgan Fairchild) reunites with an aging Holmes (Christopher Lee) when a murder happens during her performance in Vienna. Holmes and Adler, whose flirtatious relationship with Sherlock is similar to Sherlock Holmes in New York‚Äòs portrayal, briefly refer to past confrontations, including a rather confusing case where Adler had posed as a young boy to retrieve something hidden in Holmes's safe. Adler also explains that she was married for several years (Holmes having last seen her at the wedding previous to the film), only for her husband to die of illness two years before the film's events. Liliana Komorowska portrayed Adler as a Polish opera singer in The Hallmark Channel's 2001 made-for-TV film The Royal Scandal opposite Matt Frewer's Holmes. In 2007's BBC Television production Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars, Irene Adler (portrayed by Anna Chancellor) is the main villain of the piece and one of Sherlock Holmes' archenemies instead of a potential love interest. ===TV episodes of unrelated series=== In an episode of the PBS Kids show Wishbone, actress Sally Nystuen Vahle portrays Irene Adler for the adaptation of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" entitled \\"A Dogged Espose\\" (1995). In the television series House, James Wilson tells a story about a patient named Irene Adler, with whom Gregory House was obsessed and fell in love, in the 2008 episode \\"Joy to the World\\". In \\"The 10 Li'l Grifters Job\\" (2011), the season 4 episode 2 of Leverage, the character Sophie portrays Irene Adler at the Murder Mystery Masquerade. In the season five episode of The Flash entitled \\"Goldfaced\\" (2019), detective Sherloque Wells meets Renee Adler (portrayed by Kimberly Williams-Paisley), the Earth-1 doppelg√§nger of his five ex-wives. She is later shown to be a metahuman with possible telekinetic powers; upon seeing this, Sherloque vows to protect her from metahuman-serial killer Cicada. During the episode, Sherloque also has an encounter with four of his ex-wives, all of whom are variants of Adler. Now that they know which Earth he is on, they demand their back alimony payments be met within a month, or they will have a multiverse-traveling bounty hunter come and collect the payments for them. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * \\"A Few Words about theatres in Warsaw, or where Sang Irene Adler\\" by Joanna Polatynska with Catharina Polatynska * \\"Irene Adler: Sherlock, Lupin And I\\" Category:Female characters in film Category:Female characters in literature Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Literary characters introduced in 1891 Category:Fictional professional thieves Category:Fictional opera singers Category:Fictional singers Category:Sherlock Holmes characters Category:Crime film characters ","title":"Irene Adler"},{"id":"300333","text":"Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (; also named Taiso Yoshitoshi ; 30 April 1839 ‚Äì 9 June 1892) was a Japanese artist.Nussbaum, Louis Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Tsukoka K≈çgy≈ç\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 1000. He is widely recognized as the last great master of the ukiyo-e genre of woodblock printing and painting. He is also regarded as one of the form's greatest innovators. His career spanned two eras ‚Äì the last years of Edo period Japan, and the first years of modern Japan following the Meiji Restoration. Like many Japanese, Yoshitoshi was interested in new things from the rest of the world, but over time he became increasingly concerned with the loss of many aspects of traditional Japanese culture, among them traditional woodblock printing. By the end of his career, Yoshitoshi was in an almost single-handed struggle against time and technology. As he worked on in the old manner, Japan was adopting Western mass reproduction methods like photography and lithography. Nonetheless, in a Japan that was turning away from its own past, he almost singlehandedly managed to push the traditional Japanese woodblock print to a new level, before it effectively died with him. His life is perhaps best summed up by John Stevenson: His reputation has only continued to grow, both in the West, and among younger Japanese, and he is now almost universally recognized as the greatest Japanese artist of his era. ==Biography: The early years== 100 Aspects of the Moon No. 7, \\"Inaba Mountain Moon\\" The young Toyotomi Hideyoshi leads a small group assaulting the castle on Inaba Mountain (1885). Yoshitoshi was born in the Shimbashi district of old Edo, in 1839. His original name was Owariya Yonejiro. His father was a wealthy merchant who had bought his way into samurai status. At the age of three years, Yoshitoshi left home to live with his uncle, a pharmacist with no son, who was very fond of his nephew. At the age of five, he became interested in art and started to take lessons from his uncle. In 1850, when he was 11 years old, Yoshitoshi was apprenticed to Kuniyoshi, one of the great masters of the Japanese woodblock print. Kuniyoshi gave his apprentice the new artist's name \\"Yoshitoshi\\", denoting lineage in the Utagawa School. Although he was not seen as Kuniyoshi's successor during his lifetime, he is now recognized as the most important pupil of Kuniyoshi. Tokaido Meisho no Uchi, \\"Maisaka\\", early Yoshitoshi seascape design from a collaborative series (1863). During his training, Yoshitoshi concentrated on refining his draftsmanship skills and copying his mentor‚Äôs sketches. Kuniyoshi emphasized drawing from real life, which was unusual in Japanese training because the artist‚Äôs goal was to capture the subject matter rather than making a literal interpretation of it. Yoshitoshi also learned the elements of western drawing techniques and perspective through studying Kuniyoshi‚Äôs collection of foreign prints and engravings. Yoshitoshi's first print appeared in 1853, but nothing else appeared for many years, perhaps as a result of the illness of his master Kuniyoshi during his last years. Although his life was hard after Kuniyoshi's death in 1861, he did manage to produce some work, 44 prints of his being known from 1862. In the next two years he had sixty-three of his designs, mostly kabuki prints, published. He also contributed designs to the 1863 Tokaido series by Utagawa School artists organized under the auspices of Kunisada. ==The \\"Bloody Prints\\": capturing the public imagination== Many of Yoshitoshi's prints of the 1860s are depictions of graphic violence and death. These themes were partly inspired by the death of Yoshitoshi's father in 1863 and by the lawlessness and violence of the Japan surrounding him, which was simultaneously experiencing the breakdown of the feudal system imposed by the Tokugawa shogunate, as well as the effect of contact with Westerners. In late 1863, Yoshitoshi began making violent sketches, eventually incorporated into battle prints designed in a bloody and extravagant style. The public enjoyed these prints and Yoshitoshi began to move up in the ranks of ukiyo-e artists in Edo. With the country at war, Yoshitoshi‚Äôs images allowed those who were not directly involved in the fighting to experience it vicariously through his designs. The public was attracted to Yoshitoshi‚Äôs work not only for his superior composition and draftsmanship, but also his passion and intense involvement with his subject matter. Besides the demands of woodblock print publishers and consumers, Yoshitoshi was also trying to exorcise the demons of horror that he and his fellow countrymen were experiencing. Eimei nij≈´hassh≈´ku (Twenty-eight famous murders with verse, 1867) As he gained notoriety, Yoshitoshi was able to have ninety-five more of his designs published in 1865, mostly on military and historical subjects. Among these, two series would reveal Yoshitoshi‚Äôs creativity, originality, and imagination. The first series, Ts≈´zoku saiy≈´ki (\\"A Modern Journey to the West\\"), is about a Chinese folk-hero. The second, Wakan hyaku monogatari (\\"One Hundred Stories of China and Japan\\"), illustrates traditional ghost stories. His imaginative prints set him apart from any other artist of the time. \\"Seiriki Tamigor≈ç committing suicide\\" from Kinsei ky≈çgiden series (1865) Between 1866 and 1868 Yoshitoshi created some extremely disturbing images, notably in the series Eimei nij≈´hassh≈´ku (\\"Twenty-eight famous murders with verse\\"). These prints show killings in very graphic detail, such as decapitations of women with bloody handprints on their robes.Forbes, Andrew; Henley, David (2012). 28 Famous Murders. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B00AGHJVOS Other examples can be found in the strange figures of the 1866 series Kinsei ky≈çgiden, (\\"Biographies of Modern Men\\"), which depicted the power struggle between two gambling rings, and the 1867 series Azuma no nishiki ukiyo k≈çdan. In 1868, following the Battle of Ueno, Yoshitoshi made the series Kaidai hyaku sens≈ç in which he portrays contemporary soldiers as historical figures in a semi-western style, using close-up and unusual angles, often shown in the heat of battle with desperate expressions. It is said that Yoshitoshi's work of the \\"bloody\\" period has influenced writers such as Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki (1886‚Äì1965) as well as artists including Tadanori Yokoo and Masami Teraoka. Although Yoshitoshi made a name for himself in this manner, the \\"bloody\\" prints represent only a small portion of his work. They tend to be over-emphasized by critics, which has led to an inaccurate perception that overlooks the true variety, subtlety and insight of Yoshitoshi's art. ==The middle years: hard times and resurrection== From Yoshitoshi's series of beautiful women Shinryu nijushi toki (1880). By 1869, Yoshitoshi was regarded as one of the best woodblock artists in Japan. However, shortly thereafter, he ceased to receive commissions, perhaps because the public were tired of scenes of violence. By 1871, Yoshitoshi became severely depressed, and his personal life became one of great turmoil, which was to continue sporadically until his death. He lived in appalling conditions with his devoted mistress, Okoto, who sold off her clothes and possessions to support him. At one point they were reduced to burning the floor-boards from the house for warmth. It is said that in 1872 he suffered a complete mental breakdown after being shocked by the lack of popularity of his recent designs. In the following year his fortunes turned, when his mood improved, and he started to produce more prints. Prior to 1873, he had signed most of his prints as \\"Ikkaisai Yoshitoshi\\". However, as a form of self-affirmation, he at this time changed his artist name to \\"Taiso\\" (meaning \\"great resurrection\\"). Newspapers sprung up in the modernization drive, and Yoshitoshi was recruited to produce \\"news nishikie\\". These were woodblock prints designed as full-page illustrations to accompany articles, usually on lurid and sensationalized subjects such as \\"true crime\\" stories. Yoshitoshi's financial condition was still precarious, however, and in 1876, his mistress Okoto, in a gesture of devotion, sold herself to a brothel to help him. Design from Yoshitoshi's well-known series of beautiful women Fuzoku Sanjuniso (1888). With the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, in which the old feudal order made one last attempt to stop the new Japan, newspaper circulation soared, and woodblock artists were in demand, with Yoshitoshi earning much attention. In late 1877, he took up with a new mistress, the geisha Oraku; like Okoto, she sold her clothes and possessions to support him, and when they separated after a year, she too hired herself out to a brothel. Yoshitoshi's works gave him more public recognition, and the money was a help, but it was not until 1882 that he was secure. The Lonely House on Adachi Moor (1885) A series of bijin-ga designed in 1878 entitled Bijin shichi yoka caused political trouble for Yoshitoshi because it depicted seven female attendants to the Imperial court and identified them by name, it may be that the Empress Meiji herself was displeased with this fact and with the style of her portrait in the series. In 1880, he met another woman, a former geisha with two children, Sakamaki Taiko. They were married in 1884, and while he continued to philander, her gentle and patient temperament seems to have helped stabilize his behaviors. One of Taiko's children, adopted as a son, became Yoshitoshi's student, and was thence known as Tsukioka K≈çgyo. Yoshitoshi's notorious, yet compelling, ‚ÄúOshu adachigahara hitotsuya no zu‚Äù (The Lonely House on Adachi Moor) appeared in 1885. This macabre work is iconic in its own right, and influential in the history of modern kinbaku, in that Itoh Seiu was fascinated by Yoshitoshi's accurate depiction of sakasa zuri (upside down suspension). An 1885 issue of the art and fashion magazine \\"Tokyo Hayari Hosomiki\\" ranked Yoshitoshi as the number-one ukiyo-e artist, ahead of his Meiji contemporaries such as Utagawa Yoshiiku and Toyohara Kunichika. Thus he had achieved great popularity and critical acclaim. By this point, the woodblock industry was in severe straits. All the great woodblock artists of the early part of the century, Hiroshige, Kunisada, and Kuniyoshi, had died decades earlier, and the woodblock print as an art form was dying in the confusion of modernizing Japan. Yoshitoshi insisted on high standards of production, and helped save it temporarily from degeneracy. He became a master teacher and had notable pupils such as Toshikata Mizuno, Toshihide Migita, and others. ==Later years: the eclipse of ukiyo-e== His last years were among his most productive, with his great series One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (1885‚Äì1892), and New Forms of Thirty-Six Ghosts (1889‚Äì1892), as well as some masterful triptychs of kabuki theatre actors and scenes. From Yoshitoshi's Tsuki hyakushi (\\"One hundred aspects of the moon\\") During this period he also cooperated with his friend, the actor Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç, and others, in an attempt to preserve some of the traditional Japanese arts. In his last years, his mental problems started to recur. In early 1891 he invited friends to a gathering of artists that did not actually exist, but rather turned out to be a delusion. His physical condition also deteriorated, and his misfortune was compounded when all of his money was stolen in a robbery of his home. After more symptoms, he was admitted to a mental hospital. He eventually left, in May 1892, but did not return home, instead renting rooms. He died three weeks later in a rented room, on June 9, 1892, from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 53 years old. A stone memorial monument to Yoshitoshi was built in Mukojima Hyakkaen garden, Tokyo, in 1898. ==Retrospective observations== Design from Yoshitoshi's series Shinkei Sanjurokuten (36 Ghosts), \\"Priest Raigo of Mii Temple\\" (1891) During his life he produced many series of prints, and a large number of triptychs, many of great merit. Two of his three best-known series, the One Hundred Aspects of the Moon and Thirty-Six Ghosts, contain numerous masterpieces. The third, Thirty-Two Aspects of Customs and Manners, was for many years the most highly regarded of his work, but does not now have that same status. Other less- common series also contain many fine prints, including Famous Generals of Japan, A Collection of Desires, New Selection of Eastern Brocade Pictures, and Lives of Modern People. While demand for his prints continued for a few years, eventually interest in him waned, both in Japan, and around the world. The canonical view in this period was that the generation of Hiroshige was really the last of the great woodblock artists, and more traditional collectors stopped even earlier, at the generation of Utamaro and Toyokuni. However, starting in the 1970s, interest in him resumed, and reappraisal of his work has shown the quality, originality and genius of the best of it, and the degree to which he succeeded in keeping the best of the old Japanese woodblock print, while pushing the field forward by incorporating both new ideas from the West, as well as his own innovations. ==Print series== Here is a partial list of his print series, with dates: * One Hundred Stories of Japan and China (1865‚Äì1866) * Biographies of Modern Men (1865‚Äì1866) * Twenty-Eight Famous Murders with Verses (1866‚Äì1869) * One Hundred Warriors (1868‚Äì1869) * Biographies of Drunken Valiant Tigers (1874) * Mirror of Beauties Past and Present (1876) * Mirror of Famous Generals of Great Japan (1876‚Äì1882) * A Collection of Desires (1877) * Eight Elements of Honor (1878) * Twenty-Four Hours with the Courtesans of Shimbashi and Yanagibashi (1880) * Warriors Trembling with Courage (1883‚Äì1886) * Yoshitoshi Manga (1885‚Äì1887) * One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (1885‚Äì1892) * Personalities of Recent Times (1886‚Äì1888) * Thirty-Two Aspects of Customs and Manners (1888) \\"Fuzoku sanjuniso ‚Äì Aitasou\\" * New Forms of Thirty-Six Ghosts (1889‚Äì1892) ==One Hundred Aspects of the Moon== File:Tsuki no yotsu no o.jpg File:Yoshitoshi - 100 Aspects of the Moon - 43.jpg File:Yoshitoshi - 100 Aspects of the Moon - 50.jpg File:Lune a Kasuga Yoshitoshi.jpg File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg File:Yoshitoshi - 100 Aspects of the Moon - 11.jpg File:Yoshitoshi - 100 Aspects of the Moon - 26.jpg File:Lune Ishiyama Yoshitoshi.jpg File:Yoshitoshi_-_100_Aspects_of_the_Moon_-_97.jpg File:Kinto picks a plum branch in the moonlight.jpg Yoshitoshi's series One Hundred Aspects of the Moon consists of one hundred woodblocks, published in his later years, between 1885 -1892.

Susann's manuscript, too long for the Journal, was cut, but the excised material was restored for the book publicationSeaman, Lovely Me, p. 439. on July 8, 1976.

Hawes Publications [n.d.]. Retrieved January 6, 2017. and became the third highest-selling novel of 1976. Yargo, Susann's romantic science fiction novel written during the 1950s, was published in February 1979 as a paperback original by Bantam Books. The novel is a radical departure from the works which made her famous. During the 1970s, Susann had spoken of future works. They included a novel about brothers who have their show business start in vaudeville, to be called The Comedy Twins; a novel about a poetess, The Heroine; a continuation of the story of Neely O'Hara's sons; and her autobiography.Ventura.

Despite persistent rumors of infidelity on Susann's part, she and Mansfield were devoted to each other,Seaman, Lovely Me, p. 222. and remained married until her death in 1974. On December 6, 1946, Susann gave birth to their only child, a son whom they named Guy Hildy Mansfield, \\"Hildy\\" being for cabaret singer Hildegarde, who was the boy's godmother. At the age of three, Guy was diagnosed as severely autistic, and eventually had to be institutionalized; Susann and Mansfield did not reveal the true reason for his absence from home, fearing that he would be stigmatized should he eventually recover. Reportedly, Susann and Mansfield rarely missed a week visiting their son.Kahn, Toby. Widower Irving Mansfield Reveals the Family Secrets of Wife Jacqueline Susann. People. March 23, 1983.

Josephine became the subject of Susann's first published book, and was to be the subject of a sequel, Good Night, Sweet Princess, which Susann did not live to write. Josephine died on January 6, 1970, just days before her sixteenth birthday. In 1962, at the age of 44, Susann was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent a radical mastectomy.Lehrman, Karen.

During her recuperation, she made a pact with God: if she were given ten more years of life, she would prove herself to be the best-selling writer in the world. With her diagnosis, Susann felt an urgency to make money as quickly as possible, so as to ensure that her son would be properly cared for the rest of his life. ==Death== After suffering from a persistent cough, Susann, who was concerned about her upcoming book tour in support of Once Is Not Enough, checked into Doctors Hospital on January 11, 1973.Mansfield and Block.

On January 18, she received a diagnosis of lung cancer, and immediately began cobalt treatments and daily chemotherapy injections.Seaman, Lovely Me, p. 434. According to Irving Mansfield, there was some disagreement between doctors as to whether this was a metastatic breast cancer or an original lung cancer; accurate evaluation would determine the plan of treatment and subsequent prognosis.Mansfield and Block. Life with Jackie, p. 191. Despite the grueling treatment, Susann's cancer spread, and she entered Doctors Hospital for the last time, on August 20, 1974, her 56th birthday. After days lapsing in and out of a coma, she died on September 21.Susann's age at her death was 56, but it was widely reported to be 53.

He was a member of the Democratic Party. Prior to his death, he was counsel at the Washington, D.C. office of law firm Arent Fox LLP, where his clients included Riceland Foods and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. ==Background== Bumpers was born August 12, 1925, in Charleston in Franklin County, in west central Arkansas, near the larger city of Fort Smith, the son of William Rufus Bumpers (1888‚Äì1949), who served in the Arkansas House of Representatives in the early 1930s, and the former Lattie Jones (1889‚Äì1949). Bumpers' brother, Raymond J. Bumpers (1912‚Äì1916), died of dysentery. Another older brother, Carroll Bumpers, was born in 1921. He has a sister named Margaret. Bumpers' parents died five days apart in March 1949 of injuries sustained in an automobile accident; the couple is interred at Nixon Cemetery in Franklin County. Bumpers attended public schools and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in Washington County. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1943 to 1946 during World War II. Bumpers graduated from Northwestern University Law School in Chicago, Illinois, in 1951. From his time in Illinois, he became a great admirer of Adlai Stevenson, II, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1952 and 1956. Bumpers was admitted to the Arkansas bar in 1952 and began practicing law in his hometown that same year. He was from 1952 to 1970 the Charleston city attorney. He served as of the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1968. Bumpers lost his 1962 bid for the same state House seat once represented by his father, who had wanted to run for the United States House of Representatives but could not amass the funding to do so. ==Governor of Arkansas== Bumpers was virtually unknown when he announced his campaign for governor in 1970. Despite his lack of name recognition, his oratorical skills, personal charm, and outsider image put him in a runoff election for the Democratic nomination with former governor Orval Faubus. Two other serious candidates were Attorney General Joe Purcell of Benton in Saline County and the outgoing Speaker of the Arkansas House, Hayes McClerkin of Texarkana. Bumpers barely edged out Purcell for the runoff berth but then easily defeated Faubus. In the general election, he swamped the incumbent moderate Republican Governor Winthrop Rockefeller. It was a Democratic year nationally, and the tide benefited Bumpers. Like Jimmy Carter of Georgia, Reubin O. Askew in Florida and John C. West of South Carolina, Bumpers was often described as a new kind of Southern Democrat who would bring reform to his state and the Democratic Party. His victory over Rockefeller ushered in a new era of youthful reform-minded governors, including two of his successors, David Pryor (who would later serve alongside Bumpers in the Senate) and future U.S. President Bill Clinton. In the 1972 Democratic primary, Bumpers easily defeated two opponents, including the highly regarded State Senator Q. Byrum Hurst of Hot Springs. In the general election, he defeated the Republican Len E. Blaylock of Perry County even as Richard M. Nixon was handily winning Arkansas in the presidential race. ==U.S. Senate elections== Bumpers was elected to the United States Senate in 1974. He unseated the incumbent James William Fulbright in the Democratic primary by a wide margin and then overwhelmed the Republican lawyer and banker John Harris Jones (born 1922) of Pine Bluff. In the 1974 Senate race, Jones accused Bumpers of excessive spending as governor, citing the construction of a $186 million state office complex. Bumpers not only ignored Jones but instead campaigned mostly for the young Democrat Bill Clinton, who failed in that heavily Democratic year to unseat Republican U.S. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt in Arkansas's 3rd congressional district. Bumpers polled 461,056 votes (84.9 percent) to Jones's 82,026 (15.1) percent, the weakest Republican showing since the insurance executive Victor M. Wade of Batesville lost to Fulbright in 1944. Senator Dale Bumpers Time magazine wrote that \\"many to their sorrow have had trouble taking Bumpers seriously ... Dandy Dale, the man with one speech, a shoeshine, and a smile.\\" In 1980, Bumpers comfortably survived, 477,905 votes (59.1 percent) to 330,576 (40.9 percent),Arkansas Secretary of State, Election Statistics, November 4, 1980 the Ronald W. Reagan victory in Arkansas by defeating the Republican candidate, William P. \\"Bill\\" Clark (born 1943), a Little Rock investment banker who filed for the Senate only one hour prior to the deadline. (This William Clark is unrelated to the Reagan confidante William P. Clark, Jr. (1931‚Äì2013)). In his unsuccessful 1976 race as a Democrat for Arkansas' 2nd congressional district seat, \\"Bill\\" Clark had passed out twenty thousand Clark candy bars but received fewer votes and was saddled with an unpaid campaign debt exceeding $30,000. Clark accused Bumpers of being \\"fuzzy on the issues\\" and challenged Bumpers' support for gasoline rationing during the energy crisis.Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, October 11, 1980, p. 2990 Clark criticized Bumpers for having voted against defense appropriations twenty-three times between 1975 and 1978 and noted, \\"Only this year [when seeking reelection] he has voted for a couple of defense items.\\"Arkansas Gazette, November 1, 1980 Clark questioned Bumpers' opposition to school prayer and support for the Panama Canal Treaties of 1978, an issue which Reagan had used against President Jimmy Carter as well. Clark further claimed that Bumpers had derided citizens of Newton County, a frequent Republican stronghold in Arkansas, as \\"stupid hill people\\".Arkansas Gazette, November 2, 1980 Newton County in turn cast 57.2 percent of its votes for Clark, who prevailed in twelve of the state's seventy-five counties, mostly those in the northwestern section of the state. Clark also carried Bumpers' home county of Franklin. The Republican hopeful asked voters, \\"If Dale Bumpers doesn't vote for you, why should you vote for him?\\"Arkansas Outlook, Republican Party newsletter, August 1980 Unlike Bumpers, Bill Clinton lost in the Reagan electoral vote landslide, temporarily sidelined by the Republican Frank D. White. In 1986, Bumpers defeated his Republican opponent, later U.S. Representative for Arkansas' 3rd congressional district and Governor Asa Hutchinson. In 1992, after besting state Auditor Julia Hughes Jones with 64 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary, he defeated future governor Mike Huckabee in the general election. The next year, Jones switched to the GOP and unsuccessfully ran for secretary of state in 1994. In 1998, when Bumpers retired, the Democratic choice, former U. S. Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas's 1st congressional district, comfortably defeated the Republican nominee, Fay Boozman, a state senator who was later the Arkansas Department of Health director under Governor Huckabee. ===Senate tenure=== Bumpers with First Lady Rosalynn Carter at the White House Bumpers was elected to the Senate four times, beginning with his huge victory over Fulbright, the veteran chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Bumpers chaired the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship from 1987 until 1995, when the GOP took control of the Senate for a dozen years following the 1994 elections. Bumpers served as ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 1997 until his retirement in 1999. In the Senate, Bumpers was known for his oratorical skills and for his prodigious respect for the Constitution of the United States. He never supported any constitutional amendment. Bumpers decided not to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, despite support from many colleagues, including Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, who ultimately also contested the 1988 nomination won by Michael Dukakis. Initially named as one of Walter Mondale's top potential choices for his vice presidential running mate in 1984, he took his name out of the running early in the process. Bumpers stated that his main reason for not running was fear of \\"a total disruption of the closeness my family has cherished.\\" Many observers felt that Bumpers perhaps lacked the obsessive ambition required of a presidential candidate, especially one who would have started out the process with low name identification. Another factor often mentioned was Bumpers' key vote in killing labor law reform in 1978, a vote that angered organized labor and had clearly not been forgotten by labor leaders nearly a decade later.Barone, Michael and Ujifusa, Grant (1985), The Almanac of American Politics 1986, National Journal Inc., pp 66 ===Clinton impeachment=== After his retirement from the Senate, Bumpers, a self-declared close friend of President Clinton, acted as defense attorney during Clinton's impeachment trial. He gave an impassioned closing argument during the Senate trial. Betty and President Bill Clinton, 1999 Quotes from the closing argument of the White House presentation, January 21, 1999: ==Honors== In 1995, the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville founded the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences in his honor. In 2014, the White River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas was renamed \\"Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge\\". At a dedication ceremony, Daniel M. Ashe, director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said: > The Service is proud to recognize the many contributions Senator Bumpers has > made to give many future generations the same opportunity to enjoy Arkansas' > natural beauty as we have had. He is a giant among conservationists and a > visionary who followed an unconventional path to set aside some of Arkansas' > last wild places. It is fitting that he will be forever linked with the > White River. ==Causes== Bumpers and his wife Betty were both known for their dedication to the cause of childhood immunization. The Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institutes of Health was established by former president Clinton to facilitate research in vaccine development. Early in his legal career, the Charleston School Board asked his advice on how it should respond to the United States Supreme Court decision in the 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, which found the segregation of public schools on the basis of race to be unconstitutional. Bumpers advised the school board to comply with the decision immediately. In July 1954, the board voted to desegregate its schools, and on August 23, 1954, the school year began with eleven African-American children attending schools in Charleston. This prompt action to desegregate public schools was rare: The Charleston School District was the first in the eleven states that comprised the former Confederacy to integrate their public schools following the Supreme Court decision. Bumpers opposed constitutional amendments throughout his Senate tenure and was critical of his Republican colleague, Jesse Helms of North Carolina for attempting that route to enact conservative policy proposals. However, Bumpers said that he worked well with Republican leaders Howard Baker and Bob Dole. ==Death== After a period of failing health, Bumpers died on January 1, 2016, at his home in Little Rock at the age of 90. He had Alzheimer's disease and had sustained a broken hip shortly before his death. ==Bumpers in fiction== In Jeffrey Archer's 1977 novel Shall We Tell the President?, Bumpers was elected as the Vice President of the United States in a ticket headed by Ted Kennedy, defeating Ronald Reagan during the 1984 election. In the 1986 revised edition of the novel, Archer replaced Kennedy with the fictional character of Florentyna Kane, and Bumpers with the real- life Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. ==Electoral history of Dale Bumpers== 1970 Democratic primary for governor Orval Faubus 36% Dale Bumpers 20% Joe Purcell 19% Hayes McClerkin 10% Bill Wells 8% Robert Compton 4% James M.

It is divided into two subgroups; the single-unit (unitary) and multiunit smooth muscle. Within single-unit cells, the whole bundle or sheet contracts as a syncytium. Smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of hollow organs, including the stomach, intestines, urinary bladder and uterus, and in the walls of passageways, such as the arteries and veins of the circulatory system, and the tracts of the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems. In the eyes, the ciliary muscle, a type of smooth muscle, dilate and contract the iris and alter the shape of the lens. In the skin, smooth muscle cells cause hair to stand erect in response to cold temperature or fear. ==Structure== The dense bodies and intermediate filaments are networked through the sarcoplasm, which cause the muscle fiber to contract. A series of axon-like swelling, called varicosities or \\"boutons\\", from autonomic neurons form motor units through the smooth muscle. Most smooth muscle is of the single-unit variety, that is, either the whole muscle contracts or the whole muscle relaxes, but there is multiunit smooth muscle in the trachea, the large elastic arteries, and the iris of the eye. Single unit smooth muscle, however, is most common and lines blood vessels (except large elastic arteries), the urinary tract, and the digestive tract. However, the terms single- and multi-unit smooth muscle represents an oversimplification. This is due to the fact that smooth muscles for the most part are controlled and influenced by a combination of different neural elements. In addition, it has been observed that most of the time there will be some cell to cell communication and activators/ inhibitors produced locally. This leads to a somewhat coordinated response even in multiunit smooth muscle.Berne & Levy. Physiology, 6th Edition Smooth muscle is fundamentally different from skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in terms of structure, function, regulation of contraction, and excitation-contraction coupling. 350px Smooth muscle cells known as myocytes, have a fusiform shape and, like striated muscle, can tense and relax. However, smooth muscle tissue tends to demonstrate greater elasticity and function within a larger length- tension curve than striated muscle. This ability to stretch and still maintain contractility is important in organs like the intestines and urinary bladder. In the relaxed state, each cell is spindle-shaped, 20‚Äì500 micrometers in length. ===Molecular structure=== A substantial portion of the volume of the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells are taken up by the molecules myosin and actin,p. 174 in: The vascular smooth muscle cell: molecular and biological responses to the extracellular matrix.

Each of these heavy chains contains the N-terminal head domain, while the C-terminal tails take on a coiled-coil morphology, holding the two heavy chains together (imagine two snakes wrapped around each other, such as in a caduceus). Thus, myosin II has two heads. In smooth muscle, there is a single gene (MYH11) that codes for the heavy chains myosin II, but there are splice variants of this gene that result in four distinct isoforms. Also, smooth muscle may contain MHC that is not involved in contraction, and that can arise from multiple genes. * Myosin II also contains 4 light chains (MLC), resulting in 2 per head, weighing 20 (MLC20) and 17 (MLC17) kDa. These bind the heavy chains in the \\"neck\\" region between the head and tail. ** The MLC20 is also known as the regulatory light chain and actively participates in muscle contraction. Two MLC20 isoforms are found in smooth muscle, and they are encoded by different genes, but only one isoform participates in contraction. ** The MLC17 is also known as the essential light chain. Its exact function is unclear, but it's believed that it contributes to the structural stability of the myosin head along with MLC20. Two variants of MLC17 (MLC17a/b) exist as a result of alternative splicing at the MLC17 gene. Different combinations of heavy and light chains allow for up to hundreds of different types of myosin structures, but it is unlikely that more than a few such combinations are actually used or permitted within a specific smooth muscle bed. In the uterus, a shift in myosin expression has been hypothesized to avail for changes in the directions of uterine contractions that are seen during the menstrual cycle. ====Actin==== The thin filaments that are part of the contractile machinery are predominantly composed of Œ±- and Œ≥-actin. Smooth muscle Œ±-actin (alpha actin) is the predominant isoform within smooth muscle. There is also a lot of actin (mainly Œ≤-actin) that does not take part in contraction, but that polymerizes just below the plasma membrane in the presence of a contractile stimulant and may thereby assist in mechanical tension. Alpha actin is also expressed as distinct genetic isoforms such as smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle specific isoforms of alpha actin. The ratio of actin to myosin is between 2:1 and 10:1 in smooth muscle. Conversely, from a mass ratio standpoint (as opposed to a molar ratio), myosin is the dominant protein in striated skeletal muscle with the actin to myosin ratio falling in the 1:2 to 1:3 range. A typical value for healthy young adults is 1:2.2.Aguilar_2010 (above reference) \\"In skeletal or striated muscle, there is 3-fold more myosin than actin.\\"Trappe S, Gallagher P, et al.

In striated muscle, tropomyosin serves to block actin‚Äìmyosin interactions until calcium is present, but in smooth muscle, its function is unknown. *Calponin molecules may exist in equal number as actin, and has been proposed to be a load-bearing protein. *Caldesmon has been suggested to be involved in tethering actin, myosin and tropomyosin, and thereby enhance the ability of smooth muscle to maintain tension. Also, all three of these proteins may have a role in inhibiting the ATPase activity of the myosin complex that otherwise provides energy to fuel muscle contraction. ====Other tensile structures==== The myosin and actin are the contractile parts of continuous chains of tensile structures that stretch both across and between smooth muscle cells. The actin filaments of contractile units are attached to dense bodies. Dense bodies are rich in Œ±-actinin, and also attach intermediate filaments (consisting largely of vimentin and desmin), and thereby appear to serve as anchors from which the thin filaments can exert force. Dense bodies also are associated with Œ≤-actin, which is the type found in the cytoskeleton, suggesting that dense bodies may coordinate tensions from both the contractile machinery and the cytoskeleton. Dense bodies appear darker under an electron microscope, and so they are sometimes described as electron dense.Ultrastructure of Smooth Muscle, Volume 8 of Electron Microscopy in Biology and Medicine, Editor P. Motta, Springer Science & Business Media, 2012, . (p. 163 ) The intermediate filaments are connected to other intermediate filaments via dense bodies, which eventually are attached to adherens junctions (also called focal adhesions) in the cell membrane of the smooth muscle cell, called the sarcolemma. The adherens junctions consist of large number of proteins including Œ±-actinin, vinculin and cytoskeletal actin. The adherens junctions are scattered around dense bands that are circumfering the smooth muscle cell in a rib-like pattern. The dense band (or dense plaques) areas alternate with regions of membrane containing numerous caveolae. When complexes of actin and myosin contract, force is transduced to the sarcolemma through intermediate filaments attaching to such dense bands. During contraction, there is a spatial reorganization of the contractile machinery to optimize force development. part of this reorganization consists of vimentin being phosphorylated at Ser56 by a p21 activated kinase, resulting in some disassembly of vimentin polymers. Also, the number of myosin filaments is dynamic between the relaxed and contracted state in some tissues as the ratio of actin to myosin changes, and the length and number of myosin filaments change. Isolated single smooth muscle cells have been observed contracting in a spiral corkscrew fashion, and isolated permeabilized smooth muscle cells adhered to glass (so contractile proteins allowed to internally contract) demonstrate zones of contractile protein interactions along the long axis as the cell contracts. Smooth muscle- containing tissue needs to be stretched often, so elasticity is an important attribute of smooth muscle. Smooth muscle cells may secrete a complex extracellular matrix containing collagen (predominantly types I and III), elastin, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. Smooth muscle also has specific elastin and collagen receptors to interact with these proteins of the extracellular matrix. These fibers with their extracellular matrices contribute to the viscoelasticity of these tissues. For example, the great arteries are viscolelastic vessels that act like a Windkessel, propagating ventricular contraction and smoothing out the pulsatile flow, and the smooth muscle within the tunica media contributes to this property. ====Caveolae==== The sarcolemma also contains caveolae, which are microdomains of lipid rafts specialized to cell signaling events and ion channels. These invaginations in the sarcoplasm contain a host of receptors (prostacyclin, endothelin, serotonin, muscarinic receptors, adrenergic receptors), second messenger generators (adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C), G proteins (RhoA, G alpha), kinases (rho kinase-ROCK, protein kinase C, protein Kinase A), ion channels (L type calcium channels, ATP sensitive potassium channels, calcium sensitive potassium channels) in close proximity. The caveolae are often close to sarcoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, and have been proposed to organize signaling molecules in the membrane. ==Excitation-contraction coupling== A smooth muscle is excited by external stimuli, which causes contraction. Each step is further detailed below. ===Inducing stimuli and factors=== Smooth muscle may contract spontaneously (via ionic channel dynamics) or as in the gut special pacemakers cells interstitial cells of Cajal produce rhythmic contractions. Also, contraction, as well as relaxation, can be induced by a number of physiochemical agents (e.g., hormones, drugs, neurotransmitters ‚Äì particularly from the autonomic nervous system). Smooth muscle in various regions of the vascular tree, the airway and lungs, kidneys and vagina is different in their expression of ionic channels, hormone receptors, cell- signaling pathways, and other proteins that determine function. ====External substances==== For instance, blood vessels in skin, gastrointestinal system, kidney and brain respond to norepinephrine and epinephrine (from sympathetic stimulation or the adrenal medulla) by producing vasoconstriction (this response is mediated through alpha-1 adrenergic receptors). However, blood vessels within skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle respond to these catecholamines producing vasodilation because they possess beta-adrenergic receptors. So there is a difference in the distribution of the various adrenergic receptors that explains the difference in why blood vessels from different areas respond to the same agent norepinephrine/epinephrine differently as well as differences due to varying amounts of these catecholamines that are released and sensitivities of various receptors to concentrations. Generally, arterial smooth muscle responds to carbon dioxide by producing vasodilation, and responds to oxygen by producing vasoconstriction. Pulmonary blood vessels within the lung are unique as they vasodilate to high oxygen tension and vasoconstrict when it falls. Bronchiole, smooth muscle that line the airways of the lung, respond to high carbon dioxide producing vasodilation and vasoconstrict when carbon dioxide is low. These responses to carbon dioxide and oxygen by pulmonary blood vessels and bronchiole airway smooth muscle aid in matching perfusion and ventilation within the lungs. Further different smooth muscle tissues display extremes of abundant to little sarcoplasmic reticulum so excitation-contraction coupling varies with its dependence on intracellular or extracellular calcium. Recent research indicates that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling is an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle contraction. When transmural pressure increases, sphingosine kinase 1 phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P, which binds to the S1P2 receptor in plasma membrane of cells. This leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium, and activates Rac and Rhoa signaling pathways. Collectively, these serve to increase MLCK activity and decrease MLCP activity, promoting muscle contraction. This allows arterioles to increase resistance in response to increased blood pressure and thus maintain constant blood flow. The Rhoa and Rac portion of the signaling pathway provides a calcium-independent way to regulate resistance artery tone. ===Spread of impulse=== To maintain organ dimensions against force, cells are fastened to one another by adherens junctions. As a consequence, cells are mechanically coupled to one another such that contraction of one cell invokes some degree of contraction in an adjoining cell. Gap junctions couple adjacent cells chemically and electrically, facilitating the spread of chemicals (e.g., calcium) or action potentials between smooth muscle cells. Single unit smooth muscle displays numerous gap junctions and these tissues often organize into sheets or bundles which contract in bulk. ===Contraction=== Smooth muscle contraction is caused by the sliding of myosin and actin filaments (a sliding filament mechanism) over each other. The energy for this to happen is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP. Myosin functions as an ATPase utilizing ATP to produce a molecular conformational change of part of the myosin and produces movement. Movement of the filaments over each other happens when the globular heads protruding from myosin filaments attach and interact with actin filaments to form crossbridges. The myosin heads tilt and drag along the actin filament a small distance (10‚Äì12 nm). The heads then release the actin filament and then changes angle to relocate to another site on the actin filament a further distance (10‚Äì12 nm) away. They can then re-bind to the actin molecule and drag it along further. This process is called crossbridge cycling and is the same for all muscles (see muscle contraction). Unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not contain the calcium- binding protein troponin. Contraction is initiated by a calcium-regulated phosphorylation of myosin, rather than a calcium-activated troponin system. Crossbridge cycling causes contraction of myosin and actin complexes, in turn causing increased tension along the entire chains of tensile structures, ultimately resulting in contraction of the entire smooth muscle tissue. ====Phasic or tonic==== Smooth muscle may contract phasically with rapid contraction and relaxation, or tonically with slow and sustained contraction. The reproductive, digestive, respiratory, and urinary tracts, skin, eye, and vasculature all contain this tonic muscle type. This type of smooth muscle can maintain force for prolonged time with only little energy utilization. There are differences in the myosin heavy and light chains that also correlate with these differences in contractile patterns and kinetics of contraction between tonic and phasic smooth muscle. ====Activation of myosin heads==== Crossbridge cycling cannot occur until the myosin heads have been activated to allow crossbridges to form. When the light chains are phosphorylated, they become active and will allow contraction to occur. The enzyme that phosphorylates the light chains is called myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), also called MLC20 kinase. In order to control contraction, MLCK will work only when the muscle is stimulated to contract. Stimulation will increase the intracellular concentration of calcium ions. These bind to a molecule called calmodulin, and form a calcium-calmodulin complex. It is this complex that will bind to MLCK to activate it, allowing the chain of reactions for contraction to occur. Activation consists of phosphorylation of a serine on position 19 (Ser19) on the MLC20 light chain, which causes a conformational change that increases the angle in the neck domain of the myosin heavy chain, which corresponds to the part of the cross-bridge cycle where the myosin head is unattached to the actin filament and relocates to another site on it. After attachment of the myosin head to the actin filament, this serine phosphorylation also activates the ATPase activity of the myosin head region to provide the energy to fuel the subsequent contraction. Phosphorylation of a threonine on position 18 (Thr18) on MLC20 is also possible and may further increase the ATPase activity of the myosin complex. ====Sustained maintenance==== Phosphorylation of the MLC20 myosin light chains correlates well with the shortening velocity of smooth muscle. During this period there is a rapid burst of energy utilization as measured by oxygen consumption. Within a few minutes of initiation the calcium level markedly decrease, MLC20 myosin light chains phosphorylation decreases, and energy utilization decreases and the muscle can relax. Still, smooth muscle has the ability of sustained maintenance of force in this situation as well. This sustained phase has been attributed to certain myosin crossbridges, termed latch-bridges, that are cycling very slowly, notably slowing the progression to the cycle stage whereby dephosphorylated myosin detaches from the actin, thereby maintaining the force at low energy costs. This phenomenon is of great value especially for tonically active smooth muscle. Isolated preparations of vascular and visceral smooth muscle contract with depolarizing high potassium balanced saline generating a certain amount of contractile force. The same preparation stimulated in normal balanced saline with an agonist such as endothelin or serotonin will generate more contractile force. This increase in force is termed calcium sensitization. The myosin light chain phosphatase is inhibited to increase the gain or sensitivity of myosin light chain kinase to calcium. There are number of cell signalling pathways believed to regulate this decrease in myosin light chain phosphatase: a RhoA-Rock kinase pathway, a Protein kinase C-Protein kinase C potentiation inhibitor protein 17 (CPI-17) pathway, telokin, and a Zip kinase pathway. Further Rock kinase and Zip kinase have been implicated to directly phosphorylate the 20kd myosin light chains. ====Other contractile mechanisms==== Other cell signaling pathways and protein kinases (Protein kinase C, Rho kinase, Zip kinase, Focal adhesion kinases) have been implicated as well and actin polymerization dynamics plays a role in force maintenance. While myosin light chain phosphorylation correlates well with shortening velocity, other cell signaling pathways have been implicated in the development of force and maintenance of force. Notably the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the focal adhesion adapter protein-paxillin by specific tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated to be essential to force development and maintenance. For example, cyclic nucleotides can relax arterial smooth muscle without reductions in crossbridge phosphorylation, a process termed force suppression. This process is mediated by the phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein, hsp20, and may prevent phosphorylated myosin heads from interacting with actin. ===Relaxation=== The phosphorylation of the light chains by MLCK is countered by a myosin light- chain phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the MLC20 myosin light chains and thereby inhibits contraction. Other signaling pathways have also been implicated in the regulation actin and myosin dynamics. In general, the relaxation of smooth muscle is by cell-signaling pathways that increase the myosin phosphatase activity, decrease the intracellular calcium levels, hyperpolarize the smooth muscle, and/or regulate actin and myosin muscle can be mediated by the endothelium-derived relaxing factor-nitric oxide, endothelial derived hyperpolarizing factor (either an endogenous cannabinoid, cytochrome P450 metabolite, or hydrogen peroxide), or prostacyclin (PGI2). Nitric oxide and PGI2 stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase and membrane bound adenylate cyclase, respectively. The cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) produced by these cyclases activate Protein Kinase G and Protein Kinase A and phosphorylate a number of proteins. The phosphorylation events lead to a decrease in intracellular calcium (inhibit L type Calcium channels, inhibits IP3 receptor channels, stimulates sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium pump ATPase), a decrease in the 20kd myosin light chain phosphorylation by altering calcium sensitization and increasing myosin light chain phosphatase activity, a stimulation of calcium sensitive potassium channels which hyperpolarize the cell, and the phosphorylation of amino acid residue serine 16 on the small heat shock protein (hsp20)by Protein Kinases A and G. The phosphorylation of hsp20 appears to alter actin and focal adhesion dynamics and actin-myosin interaction, and recent evidence indicates that hsp20 binding to 14-3-3 protein is involved in this process. An alternative hypothesis is that phosphorylated Hsp20 may also alter the affinity of phosphorylated myosin with actin and inhibit contractility by interfering with crossbridge formation. The endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor stimulates calcium sensitive potassium channels and/or ATP sensitive potassium channels and stimulate potassium efflux which hyperpolarizes the cell and produces relaxation. ==Invertebrate smooth muscle== In invertebrate smooth muscle, contraction is initiated with the binding of calcium directly to myosin and then rapidly cycling cross-bridges, generating force. Similar to the mechanism of vertebrate smooth muscle, there is a low calcium and low energy utilization catch phase. This sustained phase or catch phase has been attributed to a catch protein that has similarities to myosin light-chain kinase and the elastic protein-titin called twitchin. Clams and other bivalve mollusks use this catch phase of smooth muscle to keep their shell closed for prolonged periods with little energy usage. ==Specific effects== Although the structure and function is basically the same in smooth muscle cells in different organs, their specific effects or end-functions differ. The contractile function of vascular smooth muscle regulates the lumenal diameter of the small arteries- arterioles called resistance vessels, thereby contributing significantly to setting the level of blood pressure and blood flow to vascular beds. Smooth muscle contracts slowly and may maintain the contraction (tonically) for prolonged periods in blood vessels, bronchioles, and some sphincters. Activating arteriole smooth muscle can decrease the lumenal diameter 1/3 of resting so it drastically alters blood flow and resistance. Activation of aortic smooth muscle doesn't significantly alter the lumenal diameter but serves to increase the viscoelasticity of the vascular wall. In the digestive tract, smooth muscle contracts in a rhythmic peristaltic fashion, rhythmically forcing foodstuffs through the digestive tract as the result of phasic contraction. A non-contractile function is seen in specialized smooth muscle within the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which secretes renin in response to osmotic and pressure changes, and also it is believed to secrete ATP in tubuloglomerular regulation of glomerular filtration rate. Renin in turn activates the renin‚Äìangiotensin system to regulate blood pressure. ==Growth and rearrangement== The mechanism in which external factors stimulate growth and rearrangement is not yet fully understood. A number of growth factors and neurohumoral agents influence smooth muscle growth and differentiation. The Notch receptor and cell-signaling pathway have been demonstrated to be essential to vasculogenesis and the formation of arteries and veins. The proliferation is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is inhibited by nitric oxide. The embryological origin of smooth muscle is usually of mesodermal origin, after the creation of muscle fibers in a process known as myogenesis. However, the smooth muscle within the Aorta and Pulmonary arteries (the Great Arteries of the heart) is derived from ectomesenchyme of neural crest origin, although coronary artery smooth muscle is of mesodermal origin. == Related diseases == \\"Smooth muscle condition\\" is a condition in which the body of a developing embryo does not create enough smooth muscle for the gastrointestinal system. This condition is fatal. Anti- smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) can be a symptom of an auto-immune disorder, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or lupus. Tumors of smooth muscle are most commonly benign, and are then called leiomyomas. They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Malignant smooth muscle tumors are called leiomyosarcomas. Leiomyosarcomas are one of the more common types of soft-tissue sarcomas. Vascular smooth muscle tumors are very rare. They can be malignant or benign, and morbidity can be significant with either type. Intravascular leiomyomatosis is a benign neoplasm that extends through the veins; angioleiomyoma is a benign neoplasm of the extremities; vascular leiomyosarcomas is a malignant neoplasm that can be found in the inferior vena cava, pulmonary arteries and veins, and other peripheral vessels.

Other sources indicate that he may have been born in northern New Jersey, near the Delaware River, and that his parents moved to the Schoharie County area when he was a boy. His parents were Dutch immigrants Andreas Phillip Bakeman and Catarien Miller, and his name sometimes appears in written records as \\"Bochman\\". He was baptized in Schenectady on November 27, 1773. ==American Revolution== According to Bakeman's later testimony, during the American Revolution, he served as a private in the Tryon County militia for the last four years of the war, and was a member of the company commanded by a captain named Van Arnum during the period when the county militia was commanded by Marinus Willett. Daniel Bakeman reports according to family records he served in 1st Tyron County Militia RegimentAccording to an obituary, Bakeman took part in the 1781 Battle of Johnstown, and served as a teamster for the militia following his time in the ranks. Though no captain named Van Arnum (possibly Van Aernam,A Captain Jacob Ven Aernam did serve in the New York Militia a prominent family in Cattaraugus County in Bakeman's later life) or anything approximating it appears in the rolls of the Tryon County militia, and though no soldier named Bakeman or Bochman appears in the roll; the descriptions Bakeman provided of his Revolutionary service in the pension application he submitted later in life were judged to be credible.; Interestingly the US Department of the Interior had one listing of \\"Bakeman\\": \\"Bakeman, Henry of Granbry, Oswego\\" [County] with the following remarks: \\"Suspended for evidence of identity of the service credited to a soldier of the same name of Colonel Willett's regiment, Captain Peter B. Teare's company.\\"Rejected Or Suspended Applications for Revolutionary War Pensions US Department of the Interior 1852 ==Post-war== After the war, Bakeman farmed in the Mohawk Valley. In 1782, he married Susan Brewer, and they were the parents of eight children: Philip, Richard, Christopher, Betsey, Margaret, Susan, Mary, and Christine. Records show that in 1825 the Bakeman family settled in Arcade, New York, where they owned a home on the north side of the County Line Road. In 1845 they moved to Freedom, New York, and they later moved to Stark. Bakeman appeared in the 1860 United States Census as \\"Frederick Bakeman\\" living in Freedom with his wife, his daughter Susan, and a grandchild, Jacob N. Bakeman (born 1838). In Bakeman's later years, he was often called upon by local leaders to take part in important ceremonies, and on Independence Day he was known to march around Freedom firing salutes with his musket. ==Later life== Bakeman was victimized by house fires at least three times in his life, including once while on a four-day trip from central New York to Albany to buy wheat and other farm supplies. In the mid-1860s, he applied for a pension, and stated that the records of his service burned in one of his house fires. As with many veterans who could not provide discharge certificates or other verifying documents, Bakeman's application included affidavits from friends and neighbors, who attested that he had a reputation for honesty, and that they had previously heard him describe his military service. The testimony of these individuals and Bakeman's own affidavit were judged to be credible, and on February 14, 1867, the United States Congress passed a special act which granted Bakeman a pension of $500 per year. At the time, the longest surviving veterans who were on the pension rolls were Lemuel Cook of Clarendon, New York (died May 20, 1866), and Samuel Downing of Edinburgh, New York (died February 19, 1867).Reverend E.B. Hillard, The Last Men of the Revolution (1864), republished 1968 with additional notes by Wendell Garrett. George Fruits (died August 6, 1876) also claimed to be the last surviving veteran of the Revolutionary War, but he was never on the pension rolls, and research by A. Ross Eckler in the 1970s indicated that Fruits was 17 years younger than he claimed, and was not a veteran of the Revolution. ==Death and burial== Bakeman died in Freedom on April 5, 1869, and is buried in Freedom's Sandusky Cemetery.

He continued to produce large quantities of prints, but the quality as a rule did not match that of his earlier days. Occasional prints from this period, however, show his old brilliance.Waterhouse 1975, 200 He died in Edo in 1825 aged 57, surrounded by many of his pupils.Waterhouse 1975, 200 ==Names== Like most Edo period Japanese artists, Toyokuni was known by several names throughout his lifetime, some sequentially and some concurrently. * Family name (Âßì - sei): Kurahashi (ÂÄâÊ©ã)Tazawa 1981, 347 * Childhood name (ÂπºÂêç - y≈çmy≈ç): Kumakichi (ÁÜäÂêâ)Tazawa 1981, 347 * Nickname (ÈÄöÁß∞ - ts≈´sh≈ç): Kumaemon (ÁÜäÂè≥Ë°õÈñÄ)Tazawa 1981, 347 * Art names (Âè∑ - g≈ç): Utagawa Toyokuni (Ê≠åÂ∑ùË±äÂõΩ), Utagawa Ichiy≈çsai (Ê≠åÂ∑ù ‰∏ÄÈôΩÊñé), Ichiy≈çsai Toyokuni (‰∏ÄÈôΩÊñé Ë±äÂõΩ)ULAN 2004 * Posthumous Buddhist name (ÊàíÂêç - kaimy≈ç / Ê≥ïÂêç - h≈çmy≈ç): Tokumy≈çin Jissaireig≈ç ShinjiMarks 2010, 96 In addition, the name 'Toyokuni' has been transcribed through several kanji character combinations, both by the artist himself and by those writing about him. * Characters used to write Toyokuni: Ë±äÂõΩ, Ë±äÂúã, Ë±äÂúÄ, Ë±êÂúã, Ë±êÂúÄULAN 2004 Today, Toyokuni is almost universally written using the characters Ë±äÂõΩ. Each of the other kanji are no longer in common usage. ==Pupils== Matsumoto Koshiro V; circa 1800s Toyokuni's two major pupils were the woodblock print masters Kunisada and Kuniyoshi, but he had a host of students in his school. Indeed, so powerful was the Utagawa school after Toyokuni's time that almost every Japanese print artist of note either had one of these two characters in his g≈ç, or, like Yoshitoshi, was a student of one who did.Chiappa 2013 His g≈ç, \\"Toyokuni\\", was initially used after his death by his son-in-law, Toyoshige, who is therefore known to us as Toyokuni II. Thereafter, it was handed down and used by each head of the Utagawa school in turn. Kunisada is thus also known as Toyokuni III.From his accession to the name Toyokuni in 1844, Kunisada consistently signed his works Toyokuni II, refusing to accept the legitimacy of his predecessor, Toyokuni II. He is, however, always referred to as Toyokuni III (Marks 2010, 120). ==Retrospective observations== Evaluations of him as an artist are somewhat mixed. Indeed, he himself is reported to have once said: : \\"My pictures ‚Äì they are merely something that I draw, and nothing more than that!\\"Newland 2005, 502 The main criticisms of his works relate to his \\"predominantly imitative\\" style,Lane 1978, 151 and to the \\"marked decline\\" in the quality of works from later in his career.Waterhouse 1975, 200 However, Toyokuni's style is admired for characteristics such as \\"decorative bombast\\",Lane 1978, 152 and \\"bold, taut designs\\".Newland 2005, 502 He is also credited with such innovations as diptych, triptych and polytych formats,Percival 1978, 32 and with training future masters of ukiyo-e.Tazawa 1981, 346 His work captured the world around him, particularly the kabuki theatre, with great clarity, and his style was a step forward. In addition, it was commercially successful, and thus freed woodblock prints from many of the restrictive canons which had limited previous generations of artists. ==Print series== Here is a very incomplete list of his print series, with dates: * Views of Actors on Stage (ca. 1793) * Sketches of Seven Elegant Paragons of Beauty (ca. 1800) * Views of Elegant Geisha in Characteristic Poses (ca. 1801) * Tomimoto the Geisha (ca. 1830-1844) ==Collections and museums== * Udinotti Museum of Figurative Art ==Images== Image:UtagawaToyokuniLoveSuicideKabukiWoodcutCA1800.jpgKabuki actors, ca. 1800 File:Kinokuniya.jpgKinokuniya Sawamura Sojuro III as Ogishi Kurando, 1794 ==See also== * List of Utagawa school members * Ichikawa Omez≈ç as a Pilgrim and Ichikawa Yaoz≈ç as a Samurai (Toyokuni I) ==References== ==Further reading== * Sadao Kikuchi, (translated Roy Andrew Miller), Utagawa Toyokuni (1769-1825) (Charles E.

Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print. The term is mainly applied to microorganisms. Organisms that prefer extreme environments are known as extremophiles. Mesophiles have diverse classifications, belonging to two domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and to kingdom Fungi of domain Eucarya. Mesophiles belonging to the domain Bacteria can either be gram-positive or gram-negative. Oxygen requirements for mesophiles can be aerobic or anaerobic. There are three basic shapes of mesophiles: coccus, bacillus, and spiral. ==Habitat== The habitats of mesophiles can include cheese and yogurt. They are often included during fermentation of beer and wine making. Since normal human body temperature is 37 ¬∞C, the majority of human pathogens are mesophiles, as are most of the organisms comprising the human microbiome. ==Mesophiles vs. extremophiles== Mesophiles are the opposite of extremophiles. Extremophiles that prefer cold environments are termed psychrophilic, those preferring warmer temperatures are termed thermophilic or thermotropic and those thriving in extremely hot environments are hyperthermophilic. A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic. ==Adaptations== All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive. Many factors are responsible for a given organism's optimal temperature range, but evidence suggests that the expression of particular genetic elements (alleles) can alter the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the organism. A study published in 2016 demonstrated that mesophilic bacteria could be genetically engineered to express certain alleles from psychrophilic bacteria, consequently shifting the restrictive temperature range of the mesophilic bacteria to closely match that of the psychrophilic bacteria. Due to the less stable structure of mesophiles, it has reduced flexibility for protein synthesis.Vijayabaskar, Mahalingam S. et al. \\"Construction of Energy Based Protein Structure Networks: Application in the Comparative Analysis of Thermophiles and Mesophiles\\" Biophysical Journal, Volume 98 , Issue 3 , 387a Mesophiles are not able to synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the fatty acid composition of the membrane does not allow for much fluidity. Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37 ¬∞C to 0 ¬∞C to 8 ¬∞C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. Cold-induced proteins (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows cold-shock proteins (CSPs) to synthesize. The shift back to the optimal temperature sees an increase, indicating that mesophiles are highly dependent on temperature.Perrot, F., H√©braud, M., Junter, G.-A. and Jouenne, T. \\"Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli at 4¬∞C. Electrophoresis.\\" 2000, 21: 1625‚Äì1629. doi:10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000501)21:8<1625::AID-ELPS1625>3.0.CO;2-4 Oxygen availability also affects microorganism growth.Sinclair, N. A. ; Stokes, J. L. \\" ROLE OF OXYGEN IN THE HIGH CELL YIELDS OF PSYCHROPHILES AND MESOPHILES AT LOW TEMPERATURES.\\" The Journal of Bacteriology, 1963, Vol. 85(1), p.164 [Peer Reviewed Journal] There are two explanations for thermophiles being able to survive at such high temperatures whereas mesophiles can not. The most evident explanation is that thermophiles are believed to have cell components that are relatively more stable than the cell components of mesophiles which is why thermophiles are able to live at higher temperatures than mesophiles. \\"A second school of thought, as represented by the writings of Gaughran (21) and Allen (3), believes that rapid resynthesis of damaged or destroyed cell constituents is the key to the problem of biological stability to heat.\\" ==Oxygen requirements== Due to the diversity of mesophiles, oxygen requirements greatly vary. Aerobic respiration requires the use of oxygen and anaerobic does not. There are three types of anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes grow in the absence of oxygen, using fermentation instead. During fermentation, sugars are converted to acids, alcohol, or gases. If there is oxygen present, it will use aerobic respiration instead. Obligate anaerobes cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. Aerotolerant anaerobes can withstand oxygen. ==Roles== Microorganisms play an important role in decomposition of organic matter and mineralization of nutrients. In aquatic environments, the diversity of the ecosystem allows for the diversity of mesophiles. The functions of each mesophile rely on the surroundings, most importantly temperature range.Ferroni, G.D., Kaminski, J.S. \\"Psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, and mesophiles in an environment which experiences seasonal temperature fluctuations.\\" Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 1980, 26:1184-1191, 10.1139/m80-198 Bacteria such as mesophiles and thermophiles are used in the cheesemaking due to their role in fermentation. \\"Traditional microbiologists use the following terms to indicate the general (slightly arbitrary) optimum temperature for the growth of bacteria: psychrophiles (15‚Äì20 ¬∞C), mesophiles (30‚Äì37 ¬∞C), thermophiles (50‚Äì60 ¬∞C) and extreme thermophiles (up to 122 ¬∞C)\\".Johnson, Mark. \\"Mesophilic and Thermophilic Cultures Used in Traditional Cheesemaking.\\" Cheese and Microbes. Washington: ASM Publishing. 2014. Web. Both mesophiles and thermophiles are used in cheesemaking for the same reason; however, they grow, thrive and die at different temperatures. Psychrotrophic bacteria contribute to dairy products spoiling, getting mouldy or going bad due to their ability to grow at lower temperatures such as in a refrigerator. ==Examples== Some notable mesophiles include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Other examples of species of mesophiles are Clostridium kluyveri, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Thiobacillus novellus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above. ===Listeria monocytogenes=== Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to Bacillus and Staphylococcus. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous flagella. L. monocytogenes motility is limited from 20 ¬∞C to 25 ¬∞C. At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis which derives from contaminated food.Magalh√£¬£Es, R. (2014). Listeria monocytogenes. 450-461. ===Staphylococcus aureus=== Staphylococcus aureus was first identified in 1880. It is responsible for different infections stemming from an injury. The bacterium overcomes the body's natural mechanisms. Long lasting infections of S. aureus includes pneumonia, meningitis, and osteomyelitis. S. aureus is commonly contracted in hospital settings.Todd, E. (2014). Staphylococcus Aureus. 530-534 ===Escherichia coli=== Escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacterium that does not produce spores. The bacterium is a member of Enterobacteriaceae. It is capable of producing enterotoxins which are thermolabile or thermostable.Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt0051LGG3/encyclopedia- food-microbiology/escherichia-coli Other characteristics of E. coli are that it is oxidase-negative, citrate-negative, methyl-red positive, and Voges- Proskauer-negative. To sum up E. coli, it is a coliform. It is able to use glucose and acetate as a carbon source for fermentation. E. coli is commonly found in the gut of living organisms. E. coli has many capabilities such as being a host for recombinant DNA and being a pathogen.Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier.

The exact form may vary from country to country. Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance. A housing development is \\"often erected on a tract of land by one builder and controlled by one management.\\" In the British Isles, the term is quite broad and can include anything from high-rise government-subsidised housing right through to more upmarket, developer-led suburban tract housing. Such estates are usually designed to minimise through-traffic flows and provide recreational space in the form of parks and greens. Popular throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, they are often areas of high-density, low-impact residences of single-family detached homes and often allow for separate ownership of each housing unit, for example through subdivision. In major Asian cities such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Singapore, Seoul, and Taiwan, an estate may range from detached houses to high-density tower blocks with or without commercial facilities; in Europe and America, these may take the form of town housing, high-rise housing projects, or the older-style rows of terraced houses associated with the industrial revolution, detached or semi- detached houses with small plots of land around them forming gardens, and are frequently without commercial facilities and such. In Central and Eastern Europe, living in housing estates is a common way of living. Most of these housing estates originated during the communist era because the construction of large housing estates was an important part of building plans in communist countries in Europe. They can be located in suburban and urban areas. ==Etymology== The use of the term may have arisen from an area of housing being built on what had been a country estate as towns and cities expanded in and after the 19th century. It was in use by 1901.. Note the example in a 1923 book by Francis Longstreth Thompson, Site planning in practice; an investigation of the principles of housing estate development. Reduction of the phrase to mere \\"estate\\" is common in the United Kingdom and Ireland (especially when preceded by the specific estate name), but not in the United States. == Housing types == There are several different housing types: Each of the different housing types will have their distinctive characteristics, density ranges, number of units, and floors. *Single Detached:This type of housing will be detached from other housing types. This type of unit houses lower densities. Lawns are an option for this kind of design, with distinctive public and private spaces. A single detached can have up to three floors. Some of the common names for a singled detached housing type is \\"House, Cottage, Villa, Bungalow\\". *Duplex, Triplex: This type of housing can have two or three dwelling units in a detached building. The units could be together or separate depending on the location of the duplex. A duplex will also have an option for a yard in order to keep their private space. This type of housing will allow for higher density housing compared to the single detached units. Duplex, and Triplex can account for 2-3 units, and have up to 3 floors. Some of the common names for Duplex, Triplex are \\"Semi-detached, Double House, Accessory unity, Ancillary unit, Carriage unit, Twin Home.\\" *Big house, Multiplex: Big house, Multiplex can come in many forms, it can have a single or muli-level unit. Just like the duplex, it can have multiple floors, up to 3 floors. It can account for up to 5 units as well. This type of housing will have a higher density than single detached housing. Some of the common names for the big house, multiplex are Quadruplex, Mansion townhomes, back to back semi- detached, Grand house, ==Asia== ===Hong Kong=== Due to dense population and government control of land use, the most common form of residential housing in Hong Kong is the high-rise housing estate, which may be publicly owned, privately owned, or semi-private. Due to the oligopoly of real-estate developers in the territory, and the economies of scale of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private tower block developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30-to-70-storeys high. Public housing provides affordable homes for those on low incomes, with rents which are heavily subsidised, financed by financial activities such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the estates. They may vary in scale, and are usually located in the remote or less accessible parts of the territory, but urban expansion has put some of them in the heart of the urban area. Although some units are destined exclusively for rental, some of the flats within each development are earmarked for sale at prices which are lower than for private developments. Private housing estates are usually characterised by a cluster of high-rise buildings, often with a shopping centre or market of its own in the case of larger developments. Mei Foo Sun Chuen, built by Mobil, is the earliest (1965) and largest (99 blocks) example of its kind. Since the mid-1990s, private developers have been incorporating leisure facilities which incorporate clubhouse facilities: namely swimming pools, tennis courts, function rooms in their more up-market developments. The most recent examples would also be equipped with cinemas, dance studios, cigar-rooms. There is currently some controversy over the \\"wall effect\\" caused by uniform high-rise developments which adversely impact air circulation. In- fill developments will tend to be done by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect. ===Pakistan=== Given the security situation and Power shortages in the South Asia 'Gated communities' with Self power generation and modern amenities (24-hour armed security, schools, hospitals, a fire department, retail shopping, restaurants and entertainment centres ) such as Bahria Town and DHA have been developed in all major cities Pakistan. Bahria Town is the largest private housing society in Asia. Bahria has been featured by international magazines and news agencies such as GlobalPost, Newsweek, Los Angeles Times and Emirates 24/7, referred to as the prosperous face of Pakistan. Gated communities in Pakistan are targeted towards upper middle class and upper class, and are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement.

In the former Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic and Slovakia) during the communist era in Czechoslovakia, a construction of large housing estates (Czech: s√≠dli≈°tƒõ, Slovak: s√≠dlisko) was an important part of building plans in the former Czechoslovakia. The government wanted to provide large quantities of fast and affordable housing and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a \\"collectivist nature\\" in people. People living in these housing estates can either usually own their apartments or rent them, usually through a private landlord. There's usually a mix of social classes in these housing estates. Most buildings in Czech and Slovakian housing estates are so called \\"panel√°ks\\", a colloquial term in Czech and Slovak for a panel building constructed of pre-fabricated, pre-stressed concrete, such as those extant in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and elsewhere in the world. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings (panel√°ks) now dominate the streets of Prague, Bratislava and other towns. The largest housing estate central Europe and Slovakia can be found in Petr≈æalka (population about 130,000), a part of the Slovak capital of Bratislava. ===United Kingdom and Ireland=== Broadwater Farm Estate in London. Civil unrest in 1985 left two dead. Redcastle Furze, Thetford, Norfolk In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, housing estates have become prevalent since World War II, as a more affluent population demanded larger and more widely spaced houses coupled with the increase of car usage for which terraced streets were unsuitable. Housing estates were produced by either local authorities (more recently, housing associations) or by private developers. The former tended to be a means of producing public housing leading to monotenure estates full of council houses often known as \\"council estates\\". The latter can refer to higher end tract housing for the middle class and even upper middle class. The problems incurred by the early attempts at high density tower-block housing turned people away from this style of living. The resulting demand for land has seen many towns and cities increase in size for relatively moderate increases in population. This has been largely at the expense of rural and greenfield land. Recently, there has been some effort to address this problem by banning the development of out-of-town commercial developments, and encouraging the reuse of brownfield or previously developed sites for residential building. Nevertheless, the demand for housing continues to rise, and in the UK at least has precipitated a significant housing crisis. ==United States== Forms of housing estates in the United States include tract housing, apartment complexes, and public housing. ==See also== * Bahria Town * Danchi (Japan) * Ghost estate (Ireland) * Khrushchyovka (Former Soviet Union) * Panel√°k and S√≠dlisko (Czech Republic and Slovakia) * Plattenbau (Germany) * Panelh√°z (Hungary) * Public housing * Affordable housing * Subsidized housing * Subsidized housing in the United States * Section 8 (USA) * Residential area * Subdivision (land) * Tract housing * Social welfare * Welfare state ==References== Category:Human habitats ","title":"Housing estate"},{"id":"300433","text":"SoHo April 2013 The SoHo (Chinese: ; also and Ëç∑ÂçóÁæéÈ£üÂçÄ; formally ‰∏≠Áí∞ËòáË±™ÂçÄ) district in Hong Kong is an entertainment zone located in Central. It borders Lan Kwai Fong and Sheung Wan districts. The name is derived from its location: South of Hollywood Road. ==History== The Central-Mid-Levels escalator was built in 1993; the now vibrant character of SoHo is attributed to the creation of the escalator system, which at the time was the longest escalator system in the world. Prior to the escalator construction, the area was populated by many elderly locals, old go-downs and porcelain shops. The area now consists of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, art galleries and antique stores of Staunton Street and Elgin Street. SoHo also is home to the first full-time comedy club in Asia, The TakeOut Comedy Club Hong Kong. Hong Kong taxi drivers usually regard \\"SoHo\\" to mean either Staunton Street or Elgin Street. Buildings in the SoHo area are a mix of commercial/residential, with the commercial businesses on the lower floors, and residential above the First Floors. Around the same time the Mid Levels Escalator was built, a few foreigners started to move into the area, taking up both commercial premises and renting flats. At the time the flats were cheaper than other expat areas in Hong Kong, and only a few minutes' walk from the business district. The name SoHo was first mentioned in a 1996 article in the South China Morning Post newspaper attributed to Elgin Street restaurant owner Thomas Goetz, who came up with the acronym. Goetz was also instrumental in forming SoHo's first business group, and The SoHo Association Limited (TSAL) was established in 1998 to represent its members in relation to difficulties they were experiencing with the local government departments in relation to licensing, and to collectively promote the area. The first Chairman was Jean-Paul Gauci, who had opened many businesses in the area. However, in 2000, Democratic Party member Kam Nai-wai wanted to see SoHo formally renamed the \\"Elgin/Staunton Street Themed Dining Area\\", and Kam and some long-term residents associated the name SoHo with being a place of disrepute, with red light district associations. The irony is Elgin Street was known in the 1860s as \\"Hung Mo Giu Gai,\\" or \\"Foreign Girls Street,\\" due to the vast number of European-staffed brothels. It was renamed after Lord Elgin, British envoy to China, during the Second Opium War (1857‚Äì1860). For several years the Democratic Party fought an ongoing battle against the new bars and restaurants in the area, and also against formal adoption of the name \\"SoHo\\", preferring instead the descriptive \\"Staunton/Elgin Street Themed Dining Area\\" so as not to associate the area with alcohol consumption. The name \\"SoHo\\" could also cause association with the London area of the same name. Like much of Hong Kong, this district treads a precarious balance between preserving the Chinese and colonial culture that shaped it, and recent modern developments. The escalator is a quintessential symbol of modernity which has encroached on the residential neighbourhood, bringing with it expats and the bars, cafes and boutiques which help cocoon some from Cantonese traditions. The contrast between the past and present enriches the area and makes for great sightseeing on foot. The newly signposted Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail guides visitors along 16 points of historical interest from The University of Hong Kong to Central, taking in century old steps and leafy residential lanes. Unfortunately, most of the sites from Dr Sun's past have long been razed, replaced by concrete skyscrapers that are characteristic of 21st century Hong Kong. Even the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum's grandiose facade off Caine Road is easy to miss, perched as it is upon Castle Road which turns up through Mid- levels, surrounded by modern blocks. Nowhere is the contrast more apparent than on the northern edge of SoHo, on Hollywood Road itself where the brand new multistorey Centre Stage upscale residential complex towers alongside the historic Man Mo Temple. ==See also== *List of areas of Hong Kong *Mid-levels *Tourism in Hong Kong ==References== ==External links== *I Love SoHo Category:Central, Hong Kong Category:Sheung Wan Category:Places in Hong Kong Category:Tourist attractions in Hong Kong Category:Restaurant districts and streets in Hong Kong ","title":"SoHo, Hong Kong"},{"id":"300441","text":"The area is home to many bars catering to expats. Lan Kwai Fong in 2011 Lan Kwai Fong in 2015 Lan Kwai Fong (often abbreviated as LKF) is a small square of streets in Central, Hong Kong. The area was dedicated to hawkers before the Second World War, but underwent a renaissance in the mid-1980s. It is now a popular expatriate haunt in Hong Kong for drinking, clubbing and dining. The street Lan Kwai Fong is L-shaped with two ends joining with D'Aguilar Street. ==Location== Lan Kwai Fong as an area is defined by D'Aguilar Street and the smaller lane, Lan Kwai Fong, an L-shaped, cobble-stoned lane. Both streets turn 90 degrees to form a rectangle. It is near the Mid-Levels. Its eating and drinking establishments are considered upmarket in price and the area is also considered a tourist spot. From the west side of the rectangle, Wo On Lane and Wing Wah Lane extend to host several more spots for drinks and food. The area arguably extends to Wellington Street and Wyndham Street, through to the Hong Kong Fringe Club. It is also home to a small number of art galleries. ==History== Before the Second World War, Lan Kwai Fong was dedicated to hawkers. In early days, the square housed many mui yan (Â™í‰∫∫), or marriage arrangers, a role exclusively held by females. Mui yan were marriage intermediaries between two families in traditional times. It was thus known as Mui Yan Hong or Hung Leung Hong. Between 2011 and 2015, a massive change was underway, following Zeman's decision to replace his block in Lan Kwai Fong.

The title comes from a Cantonese term that Clavell loosely translates as \\"supreme leader\\", and Struan is the Tai-pan or head of his own trading company in China, Struan & Company. In Clavell's literary universe, moreover, Struan is presented as the Tai-pan, and his company as the Noble House, the greatest private trading company in nineteenth-century Asia. A Scotsman, \\"the devil Struan\\" is portrayed as a tough and resourceful rogue, endowed with vision and determination. A man of extremity, he is capable of tremendous love and terrible hate. He will stop at nothing to protect his home, his family, and the Noble House. In 1805, at the age of seven, Dirk Struan began his nautical adventures as a powder monkey on a King's ship at the Battle of Trafalgar, and becomes bound to the sea for life. Struan was 12 years old (1809) when he found service on the East India Company merchant ship Vagrant Star to China. Under the command of Tyler Brock, third mate and future nemesis, Dirk Struan was whipped mercilessly. Dirk Struan vowed to someday destroy Brock. In 1811 a fateful night in the Malacca Strait, Vagrant Star ran aground on a reef and sank. At the age of fourteen, Struan swam ashore and found his way to Singapore. Later, Dirk Struan discovered that Tyler Brock survived as well. By 1817, Dirk Struan was a Captain-Owner of his own ship on the opium run. Tyler Brock was his chief rival. Also this year, Dirk Struan married Ronalda in Scotland, but immediately traveled to Macau. Within a few years, Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock dominated the opium trade. In 1821, Culum Struan was born. He was the son of Dirk Struan and Ronalda. Shortly after his birth, Ronalda and Culum were sent to Glasgow. Ronalda would never return to China. Also this year, Gordon Chen was born. He was the illegitimate son of Dirk Struan and his mistress, Chen Kai Sung. In 1826, the British East India Company decided to make an example of Struan and Brock. The Company withdrew their licenses and the two men were financially wiped out. Brock was left with his ship, Struan with nothing. Brock entered a secret agreement with another opium trader. Dirk Struan pilfered a lorcha from pirates in Macau. He became a clandestine opium smuggler for other China traders. He relentlessly confiscated more pirate ships. Using them to make dangerous illicit opium runs up the China coast, he made even greater profits. In 1834, free trade reform advocates succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the Charter Act of 1833. Finally, British trade opened to private entrepreneurs. With the freedom to legally trade, Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock became merchant princes. Their armed fleets expanded and bitter rivalry honed their enmity even keener. In 1837, Jin-Qua arranged for May-may, his favorite granddaughter, to become Dirk Struan's mistress. She was secretly assigned the task of teaching \\"the green- eyed devil\\" Struan \\"civilized\\" (Chinese) ways. By 1838, Dirk Struan was considered the Tai-pan of all tai-pan. Struan & Company was recognized as the Noble House. Business concerns of the Noble House included smuggling opium from India into China, trading spices and sugar from the Philippines, importing Chinese tea and silk into England, handling cargo papers, cargo insurance, renting of dockyard facilities and warehouse space, trade financing, and other numerous lines of business and trade. The company possessed nineteen intercontinental clipper ships. A close rival, Brock & Sons Trading Company, possessed thirteen. Additionally, Struan & Company possessed hundreds of small ships and lorchas for upriver coastal smuggling. In 1839, Gordon Chen was remarkably intelligent and a very skilled businessman. However, he longed for recognition from his biological father, Dirk Struan. To achieve this objective, he decided to become indispensable to Dirk Struan and the Noble House. From January to July 1841, events detailed in Clavell's novel Tai-Pan unfold. The Noble House was on the brink of financial collapse and about to be destroyed by rival Tyler Brock. In desperation and upon prompting by Mary Sinclair, Dirk Struan turned to Jin Qua. In exchange for a series of favours and promises, Dirk Struan received a loan of \\"40 Lac\\" (approximately ¬£1,000,000) in silver bullion from Jin Qua. The first part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to certain trade concessions. The second part of the arrangement, Struan agreed that a member of the Chen family would forever be comprador of the Noble House. The third part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to sell Jin Qua a sizable plot of land in Hong Kong with the deed to be recorded in the name of Gordon Chen. The fourth part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to the \\"coin debt\\". Four bronze coins were split in half. Four halves were given to Dirk Struan and the other four halves were kept by Jin Qua. Anyone who presented a half coin to the tai-pan of the Noble House must be granted whatever he asked, whether legal or illegal. All future tai-pan of the Noble House must swear to keep this bargain. This served as repayment for the loan of silver. Tess Brock and Culum Struan fell in love and married. The couple condemned their fathers' hatred for each other. Tyler Brock disowned his little Tess, a grudging act that has terrible consequences. Due to the bargain struck between Dirk Struan and Jin Qua, Gordon Chen managed Jin Qua's financial interests in Hong Kong, investing in land and money lending. Gordon Chen seized leadership of the Hong Kong triad. Partly due to assistance from his father and partly due to running protection rackets, Gordon Chen quickly became the wealthiest Chinese man in Hong Kong. Gordon Chen concealed this information from his father. When his status as Dragon Head of the triad was revealed, his position was nearly ruined. Fortunately, facts were dismissed as lies. Although, Dirk Struan was not entirely convinced. As part of his efforts to protect his father, Gordon Chen arranged the assassination of Gorth Brock and sought a cure for May-may's malaria. The first half-coin of Jin Qua was presented to Dirk Struan by the pirate warlord Wu Fang Choi. On July 21, 1841, Dirk Struan was killed in a typhoon before he can fulfil his oath to destroy Brock. Culum Struan became the second tai-pan of the Noble House. Gordon Chen began placing spies on Struan & Company's ships. Gordon Chen raised Duncan and Kate Struan, the children of Dirk Struan and May-may. The enmity between Struan and Brock is a prominent theme in Clavell's Asian Saga. Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock left many children, legitimate and illegitimate, who take up their respective fathers' mantles and continue the battle. Tess Brock Struan takes control of the Noble House after the death of Culum Struan and brings about the personal bankruptcy and death of her father but the battle between the two companies continues for several more generations. The last descendant of Tyler Brock, Quillan Gornt, dies in a boating accident over 120 years later. After this accident there is no one from the Brock line left to threaten the Noble House. The romance between Dirk and his Chinese mistress, May-may, developed within the conventions of the genre as a basis for the novel's optimistic theme of cross-cultural fusion.Gina Macdonald, James Clavell: A Critical Companion (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood, 1996), pp. 64-69. Dirk Struan has several children who feature in the story, including Culum Struan, Gordon Chen, Winifred Dunross Struan, Duncan Struan, and Kate Struan. Clavell's hero was inspired by the historical William Jardine,John Makinson, \\"Books: Jardine story ‚Äì The Thistle and the Jade: A Celebration of Jardine, Matheson & Co. edited by Maggie Keswick\\", Financial Times (16 October 1982), p. 12.\\"Book (1966): Tai-Pan, James Clavell\\", South China Morning Post (29 March 2009), p. 7. and the Noble House of Struan's is modelled on the real-life \\"Princely House\\" of Jardine, Matheson & Company of Hong Kong.Robyn Meredith, \\"Sailing From Old to New Asia; Jardine Matheson is ever more a play on its traditional region\\", Forbes Asia, Volume 4, Issue 15 (15 September 2008), p. 88. ==Depictions in Film== Patrick McGoohan was announced to play Dirk Struan in a film version of Tai Pan in 1968 but this was never made due to budget issues. In the late 1970s Steve McQueen signed to play the role for a reported $10 million fee in an adaptation written by George MacDonald Fraser (who thought Sean Connery would have made ideal casting); however he later dropped out of the project; Roger Moore became briefly attached, but the movie was never made.George MacDonald Fraser, The Light's On at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p198-212 Eventually Australian actor Bryan Brown played Struan in the movie Tai Pan (1986), which was a box office flop. ==References== Category:Asian Saga characters Category:Characters in British novels Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Literary characters introduced in 1966 Category:Fictional Scottish people ","title":"Dirk Struan"},{"id":"300447","text":"An art name (pseudonym or pen name), also known by its native names hao (in Mandarin) (), g≈ç (in Japanese), ho (in Korean), and hi·ªáu (in Vietnamese), is a professional name used by East Asian artists. The word and the concept originated in China, then became popular in other East Asian countries (especially in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and the former Kingdom of Ryukyu). In some cases, artists adopted different pseudonyms at different stages of their career, usually to mark significant changes in their life. Extreme practitioners of this tendency were Tang Yin of the Ming dynasty, who had more than ten hao, and Hokusai of Japan, who in the period 1798 to 1806 alone used no fewer than six. ==History== ===China=== In Chinese culture, the h√†o (Traditional Ëôü; Simplified Âè∑) originally refers to any name a person gives oneself, as opposed to a birth name (which is given by the parents or other elders). The use of this name as a nom de plume or artistic name, however, appears to have begun only during the Six Dynasties period, with Tao Yuanming and Ge Hong among the first literati to have given themselves h√†o. Art names came into vogue during the Tang dynasty, during which time they could either be coined by the persons themselves, or given to them as a name by others. Most h√†o can be placed within a few categories: * H√†o derived from the locations or characteristics of the person's residence. For instance, Tao Yuanming was Wuliu Xiansheng, \\"Mister Five-Willows\\", while Su Shi was Dongpo Jushi, \\"Householder of the Eastern Slope\\", after his residence while exiled in Huangzhou. These were mostly self-coined. * H√†o derived from certain well known sayings by the person. For example, Ouyang Xiu was known as Liuyi Jushi, \\"Householder of the Six Ones\\", after his self description as \\"One myriad books, one thousand inscriptions, one qin, one game of chess, one flask of wine and one old man\\". * H√†o derived from one's famous poetic lines or images. These were most often given by others in admiration. Li Bai, for his free- spirited behaviour, was known as Zhe Xianren, \\"Banished Immortal\\"; while the poet He Zhu was known as He Meizi, \\"He the Plum\\", after an acclaimed line about yellow plums. * H√†o derived from one's official posts, birthplace, or a place where they served as officials. Du Fu was known as Du Gongbu, \\"Du of the Ministry of Works\\", having briefly been a senior officer in that ministry. Tang Xianzu was called \\"Tang of Nanhai\\" for his birthplace. By the Song Dynasty, the majority of literati called each other by their art names, which in turn often changed; this situation continued up to the 20th century.http://tieba.baidu.com/p/658776377 ===Japan=== In early modern Japan, a woodblock print artist's first g≈ç was usually given to them by the head of the school (a group of artists and apprentices, with a senior as master of the school) in which they initially studied; this g≈ç usually included one of the characters of the master's g≈ç. For example, one of Hokusai's earliest pseudonyms was Shunr≈ç; his master Katsukawa Shunsh≈ç having granted him the character 'shun' from his own name. One can often trace the relationship among artists with this, especially in later years, when it seems to have been fairly (although not uniformly) systematic (particularly in the Utagawa school) that the first character of the pupil's g≈ç was the last of the master's g≈ç. Thus, an artist named Toyoharu had a student named Toyohiro, who, in turn, had as a pupil the famous landscape artist Hiroshige. Another figure who studied under Toyoharu was the principal head of the Utagawa school, Toyokuni. Toyokuni had pupils named Kunisada and Kuniyoshi. Kuniyoshi, in turn, had as a student Yoshitoshi, whose pupils included Toshikata. ==Reused names== In some schools, in particular the main Utagawa school, the g≈ç of the most senior member was adopted when the master died and the chief pupil assumed his position. Perhaps as a sign of respect, artists might take the g≈ç of a previous artist. This makes attribution difficult. The censors' seal helps determine a particular print's date. Style also is significant. For example, Kunisada, once he changed his g≈ç to Toyokuni, initiated the practice of signing prints with a signature in the elongated oval toshidama ('New Year's Jewel') seal of the Utagawa school, an unusual cartouche with the zig- zag in the upper right-hand corner. His successors continued this practice. In modern scholarship on the subject, a Roman numeral identifies an artist in the sequence of artists using a g≈ç. Thus, Kunisada I is also known as Toyokuni III, since he was the third artist to use that g≈ç. ==See also== *Courtesy name ==References== *Frederic, Louis (2002). \\"G≈ç\\". Japan Encyclopedia.

The Utagawa school () was one of the main schools of ukiyo-e, founded by Utagawa Toyoharu. It was the largest ukiyo-e school of its period. The main styles were bijin-ga and uki-e (perspective picture). His pupil, Toyokuni I, took over after Toyoharu's death and led the group to become the most famous and powerful woodblock print school for the remainder of the 19th century.

ASIN: B00HR3RHUY Kunisada, Kuniyoshi and Yoshitoshi were Utagawa students. The school became so successful and well known that today more than half of all surviving ukiyo-e prints are from it. Founder Toyoharu adopted Western-style deep perspective, an innovation in Japanese art. His immediate followers, Utagawa Toyohiro and Utagawa Toyokuni adopted bolder, more sensuous styles than Toyoharu and specialized in different genres -- Toyohiro in landscapes and Toyokuni in kabuki actor prints. Later artists in the school specialized in other genres, such as warrior prints and mythic parodies.Johnson, Ken, \\"Fleeting Pleasures of Life In Vibrant Woodcut Prints\\", art review in The New York Times, March 22, 2008. Retrieved March 26, 2008 ==Utagawa school and inherited art-names== It was a Japanese custom for successful apprentices to take the names of their masters. In the main Utagawa school, there was a hierarchy of g≈ç (art-names), from the most senior to junior. As each senior person died, the others would move up a step. The head of the school generally used the g≈ç (and signed his prints) as Toyokuni. When Kunisada I proclaimed himself head of the school (c. 1842), he started signing as Toyokuni, and the next most senior member, Kochoro (a name also previously used by Kunisada I, but not as his chief g≈ç), started signing as Kunisada (Kunisada II, in this case). The next most senior member after him, in turn, began signing as Kunimasa (Kunimasa IV, in this case), which had been Kochoro's g≈ç before he became Kunisada II. (The original Kunimasa I had been a student of Toyokuni I.) Following is a list of some members of the main Utagawa school, giving the succession of names, along with the modern numbering of each: * Toyokuni (I) * Toyoshige -> Toyokuni (II) * Kunisada (I) -> Toyokuni (III) * Kochoro -> Kunimasa (III) -> Kunisada (II) -> Toyokuni (IV) * Kochoro (II) -> Kunimasa (IV) -> Kunisada (III) -> Toyokuni (V) See here for a more extensive list. ==Two different Toyokuni IIs== An additional complexity is the fact that there are two different artists who are sometimes referred to as Toyokuni II; and similarly for the later-numbered artists called \\"Toyokuni\\". The first Toyokuni II was Toyoshige, a mediocre pupil and son-in-law of Toyokuni I who became head of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I died. Kunisada I (Toyokuni III) apparently despised Toyoshige, and refused to acknowledge him as head of the Utagawa school. Apparently, this was because he felt that as the best pupil, he should have been named head after the old master died, and was upset with Toyoshige, who apparently got the position because of his family connection. When Kunisada I took the art-name Toyokuni (c. 1842), he effectively removed Toyokuni II from house history and for a period actually signed as Toyokuni II. However, he is now numbered, Toyokuni III. There are prints which signed Toyokuni II which are by the artist now known as Toyokuni III. This numbering persisted, so when Kochoro became head of the Utagawa school, he signed as Toyokuni III, although he would be the fourth Toyokuni. Likewise Kochoro II eventually signed as Toyokuni IV, and is now numbered Toyokuni V. == Family == According to the encyclopedia of Ukiyo-e in the late 1980s, the Utagawa school had 151 students,147 workers from Kuniyoshi, and 173 people from Kuniyoshi. Students who studied at the Utagawa school would gain the chance to receive the Utagawa name if their skill is approved. The master would give out the Utagawa surname, and the use of ‚ÄúToshinomaru‚Äù, which is Utagawa's own family crest that is only found within the Utagawa family to the best students. The ‚ÄúYearball‚Äù, rounded design, was the symbol of the Utagawa family. This symbol was easy to recognize, so the people who wore the Utagawa crested kimono did not need the ticket to the Edo theater at that time. The ‚ÄúTatsunori no Maru‚Äù crest of the same shape with an added line, was used only by the master of Muneya and his workers. The next master was decided at a convention of the very large Utagawa Ichimon family. The master was mainly decided by personality and their Ukiyo-e skills. However, the higher the rank, the better chance that they would be chosen. There were gifts such as crests from the shogunate in the house using this family crest. Utagawa Kazumon did not only pay attention to the aesthetic of the picture, but also tried to maintain a close relationship with the masses, calling himself ‚Äúpainter‚Äù. == Shita-e == Shita-e drawings are still used in the present time, with rough sketches and more refined brush paintings, on different kinds of paper with and without corrections, depending on the artist. Moreover, since the final drawing will be carved away, the drawings that would remain would be either sketches or copies of the final shita-e. It is still uncertain who produced the final shita-e, however the clues that remain are the series of sketches and corrections in red ink. More research remains to be done in this area, yet one reason for the vast success of the Utagawa School and its ability to support so many artists was the studio setup of printmaking in the nineteenth century. Paradoxically, the focus on a limited number of great printmakers of the day actually increased their standing and sales, and so supported the pupils beneath them. == See also == * List of Utagawa school members * Schools of ukiyo-e artists ==References== ==External links== * Kuniyoshi Project *Chazen Museum of Art at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has a collection of more than 4,000 Japanese prints in its E.

The League allied with the Grey League and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions in 1471 to form the Three Leagues. The League of God's House, together with the two other Leagues, was allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. After the Napoleonic wars the League of God's House became a part of the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden. ==Before the League== The region that would become the League of God's House has always been heavily influenced by the Diocese of Chur. The Bishop of Chur is first mentioned in 451 when its Bishop St. Asimo attended the Synod of Milan,Mansi, IV, 141; but probably existed a century earlier. During the 5th and 6th centuries there is evidence of an extensive Romanisation and conversion to Christianity in the region around Chur. In 536 the region was conquered by the Merovingian Kingdom, but due to distance and isolation it quickly fell back into de facto independence. During this time the region was known as Churr√§tien or Churwalchen and occupied politically virtually the same territory that the Bishopric of Chur spiritually led. In 773 the political and spiritual power in the region was consolidated into a single family. However this situation only lasted until 806 when Charlemagne split the political and spiritual power into two. This split and the resulting conflicts let to the collapse of Churr√§tien and the creation of numerous small independent communities, with the power center of Chur in the middle. For centuries after the split, the Bishops of Chur wished to expand their power both politically and spiritually. ==Foundation of the League== In the 14th century the core communities of the Bishopric of Chur lay along the north-south road on the Septimer-Julier route. The bishop ruled the region around Chur and had the right of high judgement in the F√ºnf D√∂rfer, Chur, Oberhalbstein, Oberengadin, Bergell, Schams, Rheinwald, Unterengadin and Vinschgau. After 1363 relationships between the bishop of Chur and his subjects worsened. Austrian dukes from the House of Habsburg had acquired the County of Tyrol which included M√ºnstertal and Unterengadin and were trying to expand into the Bishopric of Chur. The foreign and frequently absent bishop Peter Gelyto von B√∂hmen, who had driven the bishopric deep into debt, was willing to sell the political leadership of the area in exchange for a yearly salary. As a first step, in 1366 he rented out the F√ºrstenburg fortress at Burgeis in the Vinschgau. In response to this development representatives from the cathedral church of St. Luzius, the valley communities and the city of Chur met in 1365 in Wildenberg Castle in Zernez. On 29 January 1367 they met again in Chur, with revolution in mind. The meeting represented the three sources of power in the area: first, the spiritual community, represented by personnel from the bishop's cathedral; second, representatives of the large valley communities (six representatives each from Domleschg, Schams, and Bergell; four from Oberhalbstein; three from Oberengadin; and two from Unterengadin); and third, representatives of the citizens of Chur. The group met without the bishop and voted to limit his power sharply and to demand authority over financial matters. The decision of 1367 was not a formal federation or alliance, but represented a desire to stick together in a crisis. However the decision included a desire to hold future assemblies and to closely monitor the power of the bishop. These future meetings set the stage for closer alliances between the individual communities. In 1409 they established a standing council and appointed a Vogt or bailiff over the bishop. In the spring of 1468 Bishop Ortlieb von Brandis angered the League. They assembled an army, attacked several of the Bishop's estates, including Riom and Greifenstein, and occupied them. The Bishop was forced to ask the city of Z√ºrich to intervene. Z√ºrich negotiated with the League and convinced them to return the castles to the Bishop. Between 1524 and 1526 the Ilanzer Article removed the last vestiges of the bishop's political power. ==Expansion of the League== Throughout the 15th century the League continued to expand. The vier D√∂rfer (the four villages, the rest of the five or f√ºnf D√∂rfer) joined the League, along with Avers and the uppermost part of the Albula valley. The M√ºnster valley (M√ºnstertal) and Puschlavs valley joined about 1498. During the mid-15th century the League of God's House began to pursue a common foreign policy with the other two Leagues (Grey League and League of the Ten Jurisdictions). In 1499 during the Swabian War the League together with the other two Leagues defeated a Habsburg army at the Battle of Calven and took the Vinschgau from the Bishopric of Chur. Over time the power of the Bishop of Chur weakened, but Chur became the center of the League of God's House. After about 1700, the mayor of Chur automatically became the leader of the League of God's House. ==Three Leagues== After about 1471 the three separate Leagues were allied together as the Three Leagues. The Bundesbrief of September 23, 1524 created a constitution for the Three Leagues that would remain until the Napoleonic dissolution of the League. However the League was not a unified state in the modern sense. The Three Leagues worked together as a federation of three states and virtually all affairs of the League were settled by referendum. The Three Leagues were also unique in early modern Europe for practicing a form of communalism, in which each League was founded, governed and defended through collective decisions. The Three Leagues were normally allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy. Initially this was a response to the expansion of the Habsburgs. The Musso war against the Duchy of Milan in 1520 pushed the League closer to the Swiss Confederacy.

She was the second (and oldest surviving) child of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. In 414, the fifteen-year old Pulcheria became the chief guardian of her younger brother Theodosius IIHolum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1982. p. 97 and was also proclaimed \\"augusta\\". Pulcheria had significant, though changing, influence and political power during her brother's reign. When Theodosius II died on 26 July 450, Pulcheria married Marcian on 25 November 450, while simultaneously not violating her vow of virginity. She died three years later, in July 453. Pulcheria greatly influenced the Christian Church and its theological development by guiding two of the most important ecumenical councils in ecclesiastical history, namely those of Ephesus and Chalcedon, in which the Church ruled on christological issues. The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church subsequently recognized her as a saint.Women in World History: A biographical encyclopedia. Edited by Anne Commire and Deborah Klezmer. Waterford, Connecticut: Yorkin Publications. 1999‚Äì2002. ==Early life== Pulcheria was born into the royal House of Theodosius, a dynasty of the later Roman Empire, ruling in Constantinople. Her parents were eastern Roman emperor Arcadius and empress Aelia Eudoxia. Pulcheria's older sister, Flaccilla, was born in 397 but probably died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia (born in 400), Theodosius II, the future emperor (born in 401) and Marina (born in 401).Jones, A.H.M, J.R. Martindale, and J. Morris. The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971. Arcadius' reign was marked by the conflict between his imperious wife and the Archbishop of Constantinople John Chrysostom.‚ÄúAlthough his reign (Arcadius) was short, it is remembered in part for the controversial conflicts Eudoxia encountered with John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople from 398 to 404.\\" ‚Äì Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. p.37 Sozomen reports that much of the rivalry was based on a silver statue set up in honour of Eudoxia outside the cathedral of Constantinople, Hagia Sophia, which Chrysostom condemned: \\"The silver statue of the empress ‚Ä¶ was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing ‚Ä¶ John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the [C]hurch.\\"Sozomen. The Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen: Comprising a History of the Church from A.D. 324 to A.D. 440. Translated by Edward Walford. London: Henry G. Bohn. 1855. p.391 Also according to Sozomen, Chrysostom had condemned the empress for her grandiose style in his sermons, which enraged her and resulted in Chrysostom's immediate deposition. Later in life, Pulcheria returned the relics of John Chrysostom and installed them for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1982. p.184 ==Sister of the Emperor== Eudoxia died in 404, and Emperor Arcadius in 408. They left behind four young children, including Theodosius II, then 7 years of age, who had been his father's nominal co-Emperor since 402 and was now Emperor himself. Two praetorian prefects named Anthemius and Antiochus at first handled government affairs. Upon coming of age at 15 years, Pulcheria deemed her family no longer in need of Antiochus, and Theodosius consequently dismissed him from office; thereafter she acted as her brother's guardian:\\"In 412 Pulcheria quarreled with Antiochus, who like Anthemius had served the dynasty faithfully for a number of years, and induced her brother to dismiss him from the duties of praepositus. She then took personal charge of the imperial family, directing its affairs with such authority that she became known in society at large as the emperor's guardian.\\" Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 91 Theodosius proclaimed Pulcheria Augusta on July 4, 414, Pulcheria was a deo coronata and possessed basileia. At the same time, Pulcheria made a vow of virginity, probably to keep off potential suitors. After this, the imperial palace assumed a monastic tone in comparison with her mother's palace. Sozomen describes the pious ways of Pulcheria and her sisters in his Ecclesiastical History: > \\"They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their > attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards > strangers and the poor‚Ä¶and pass their days and their nights together in > singing the praises of God.\\"Sozomen. The Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen: > Comprising a History of the Church from A.D. 324 to A.D. 440. Translated by > Edward Walford. London: Henry G. Bohn. 1855. p. 410 Rituals within the imperial palace included chanting and reciting passages of sacred scripture and fasting twice per week.Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 91 The sisters relinquished luxurious jewelry and apparel which most women of the imperial court wore. Pulcheria also provided all the instruction necessary for Theodosius to be a successful emperor when he would come of age. > \\"Although the empire was technically to be ruled by Theodosius II when he > would come of age, his older sister Pulcheria exercised such profound > influence over him all his life that she must be considered the co-regent of > the empire until her death in 453. In fact it can be said without > exaggeration that Pulcheria gave the identity to her brother's > reign.\\"Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation > of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. p. 42 Pulcheria's training of Theodosius included > \\"... how an Emperor must walk, and ride his horse, alone or in procession; > how he should sit upon his throne: how to wear his Imperial armor and robes; > and how to speak with dignity. By no means must he yield to loud laughter > ‚Ä¶\\"Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from East and West. Ann Arbor: The > University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 123 Not only did Pulcheria train her brother in the duties and customs of imperial office, but she also ensured that Theodosius was trained to become a pious Christian leader. According to many historians, upon coming of age to rule as sole Emperor, Theodosius ignored the teachings of his sister. > \\"He was by nature kind, affable, easily led ‚Ä¶ Not only was he foolishly > kind; he was careless, and often he was to neglect his duty in the > administration of his Empire.\\" Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from > East and West. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 125 The lack of determined leadership by Theodosius motivated Pulcheria to assume greater authority and influence over the Empire. ==Vow of virginity== At the time Pulcheria proclaimed herself guardian of her brother, in an act of piety she also took a vow of virginity, and her sisters followed her example. Sozomen explains that: > \\"She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do > likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she > permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she > took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses > ‚Ä¶\\"Sozomen. The Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen: Comprising a History of > the Church from A.D. 324 to A.D. 440. Translated by Edward Walford. London: > Henry G. Bohn. 1855. In a letter from Pope Leo I, a contemporary of Pulcheria, he complimented her great piety and despisal of the errors of heretics.\\"In it you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.\\" ‚Äì Pope St. Leo the Great. St. Leo the Great: Letters. Translated by Brother Edmund Hunt, C.S.C., New York: Fathers of the Church, Inc. 1957. p. 132 It is possible that Pulcheria may have had another motive to remain unmarried: she would have had to relinquish her power to a potential husband. In addition, the husbands of Pulcheria and her sisters could have wielded overbearing influence on their young brother, or even posed a threat to him.Sozomen, The Ecclesiastical History 9.1.3.; Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 93-94 ==Role as Augusta== In 414, the Roman Senate gave Pulcheria the title of Augusta. Although a woman, Pulcheria was treated as an equal among men at court. In the Byzantine Senate a bust was erected in her honour along with those of other Augusti.Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. ===Church and Judaism=== Many important events occurred during her time as Augusta and her brother's reign as Emperor; however, Pulcheria's influence was mostly ecclesiastical. Pulcheria and her brother were known to have harboured anti-Jewish sentiments, and both enacted laws against Jewish worship in the capital. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were treated as private property and protected by the imperial government. Theodosius enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues and required the destruction of those in existence. Pulcheria and Theodosius also ordered the execution of a group of Jews after strife among Christians emerged in Palestine.Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 98 Kenneth Holum writes \\"Pulcheria had long nursed a special hatred for Jews, and the Nestorian heresy, which appeared to contemporaries to be of Jewish origin, no doubt served to confirm that hatred.\\"Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 188 Pulcheria was also famous for her philanthropy. She erected many churches and buildings for the poor in and around Constantinople.\\"Sozomen writes that it would take too much time to describe all the churches Pulcheria built, as well as hospitals and inns for the poor.\\" ‚Äì Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. p. 49 Pulcheria's building projects in Constantinople were so vast that a whole district was named the Pulcherianai in her honour.\\"Some of these establishments were extensive enough to give the names of their proprietors to entire quarters of the city such as the 'Marina quarter' in the second region and the Pulcherianai in the eleventh.\\" ‚Äì Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 132 As well as contributing new churches and districts to the City, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the Christian Church by reinstating bishops who were unjustly dismissed and returning the remains of others, such as Flavian, as relics of the church.\\"‚Ä¶the entire Roman Church is most grateful to you for all the works of your faith, whether having assisted envoys in every way with devoted affection and for having brought back the Catholic bishops who were ejected from their churches by an unjust sentence, or for having brought back with fitting honor to the church he governed so well the remains of Flavian of holy memory, an innocent and Catholic bishop.\\" Pope St. Leo the Great. St. Leo the Great: Letters. Translated by Brother Edmund Hunt, C.S.C., New York: Fathers of the Church, Inc., 1957. p. 145. ===War with Persia=== Pulcheria's time as Augusta also was marked by war and ongoing conflict with Sassanid Persia. Pulcheria called for war against Persia when Persian King Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who had destroyed a Zoroastrian altar.Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 102 Under the influence of Pulcheria, Theodosius sent troops into battle with fanatical fervour, described by Sozomen as \\"ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.\\" Pulcheria and Theodosius were victorious and, according to historians, Theodosius credited his sister's vow of virginity as the reason for victory.Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. pp. 110‚Äì111 Theodosius thus made his sister's virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God, the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia. Pulcheria's power would become even greater after the death of her brother, Theodosius II. ==Relationship with Aelia Eudocia== The relationship between Pulcheria and Aelia Eudocia, Theodosius II's wife, was strained. The two women over the years had developed a rivalry based on their different backgrounds and religious beliefs. Eudocia was originally named Athenais and was born in Athens to a Greek philosopher and professor of rhetoric. When her father died, he left her with little means, only \\"one hundred gold coins\\".Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from East and West. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 125. She visited her aunt in Constantinople out of desperation. On 7 June 421, Theodosius married Athenais, but her name was changed to Eudocia.Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from East and West. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 126 The rivalry between the two women was motivated by Eudocia's envy of Pulcheria's power in court.\\"She had always felt jealous of her sister-in-law, Pulcheria, who for many years had held greater influence at Court then she herself had enjoyed, as Empress, as wife.\\" ‚Äì Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from East and West. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 146 Together Eudocia and the chief minister, the eunuch Chrysaphius, convinced Theodosius to rely less on the influence of his sister and more on that of his new wife. This caused Pulcheria to leave the imperial palace and live in \\"‚Ä¶Hebdomon, a seaport seven miles from Constantinople.\\"Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from East and West. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 146 The rivalry of Eudocia and Pulcheria came to a head when Eudocia departed for the Holy Land and, for a time, openly supported monastic Miaphysitism.\\"But she had been brought up in Athens in pagan ways; she had ever been devoted to the literature of her native Greece.\\" ‚Äì Duckett, Eleanor. Medieval Portraits from East and West. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1972. p. 164 Eudocia's open opposition to the doctrine of the \\"Theotokos\\" of the Blessed Virgin Mary was an open opposition to Pulcheria as well, after the death of Aelia Eudocia, she returned to the Imperial Palace and regained her command power. ==Empress== While hunting on horseback in 450, Theodosius II fell from his horse and injured his spine; he died 2 days later from the injury. Pulcheria then went to court and openly fought Chrysaphius. What exactly happened in government during the interregnum is unclear. It is speculated by some that she reigned over the Empire alone for about one month after the death of Theodosius, which may have primarily consisted of arranging the public funeral of Theodosius.Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 208 As the deceased emperor lacked surviving male children, Pulcheria could bestow dynastic legitimacy on an outsider by marrying them. Regarding her vow of virginity, she performed the religious rituals necessary to both honour her vow and enter a legitimate marriage. She married Marcian, who was a tribune and close associate of the Germanic general Aspar, probably at the general's suggestion.R.W. Burgess, 'The Accession of Marcian in the Light of Chalcedonian Apologetic and Monophysite Polemic', Byzantinische Zeitschrift 86/87 (1993/1994), 47‚Äì68. Marcian's origins were quite civilian in comparison to those of previous emperors: \\"Marcian was a man of little substance, with no ancient aristocratic or imperial blood. He was Roman, however, and thus the bond of kedeia at once communicated eligibility for basileia.\\" One condition of the marriage was that Marcian obey and respect Pulcheria's vow of virginity, and he complied with it. In order for the marriage to not seem scandalous to the Roman state, the church proclaimed that \\"Christ himself sponsored the union and it therefore should not provoke shock or unjustified suspicions.\\"Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 209 After their marriage, Pulcheria and Marcian had Chrysaphius killed.Marcellinus Comes, Chronicle a. 450; John Malalas, Chronographia 14.32 ==Ecclesiastical conflicts== The First Council of Ephesus, held in 431 in Theodosius's reign, involved two rival bishops: Nestorius, who was Archbishop of Constantinople, and Cyril, the Patriarch of Alexandria.Cameron, Averil. The Mediterranean World In Late Antiquity AD 395‚Äì600 London: Routledge, 1993. pp. 22‚Äì23 The historian Averil Cameron described the conflict between them thus: > \\"The issue was whether, and, if so, how, Christ had two natures; the > Monophysites held that he had only a divine nature, while Nestorius, and > 'Nestorians' after him, emphasized the human.\\"Cameron, Averil. The > Mediterranean World In Late Antiquity AD 395‚Äì600 London: Routledge, 1993. p. > 23 Nestorius advocated diminishing the influence of the doctrine of the \\"Theotokos\\", i.e., \\"the one who gives birth to the One Who is God\\" or \\"Mother of God\\", in the church. This conflicted with the religious beliefs of Pulcheria, as she was a virgin empress, and a rivalry between them ensued, during which Nestorius launched a smear campaign against her: > \\"Nestorius took specific action against Pulcheria. He implied that she > enjoyed illicit sexual relations with at least seven lovers. He also would > not accede to her demand that she be remembered in prayers as the 'bride of > Christ' since she had been 'corrupted by men'. Most egregious of all, he > effaced her image which he had removed from above the altar; and he refused > to use her robe as an altar cover.\\"Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The > Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New > York: Routledge, 1994. p. 54 Nestorius greatly underestimated Pulcheria's power, because she had him deposed and her ally, Eusibius, a court official, produced an anonymous document declaring that Nestorius was a heretic. Meanwhile, Cyril had already publicly condemned Nestorius and wrote to the imperial court stating that the doctrine of the \\"Theotokos\\" was correct. Nestorius then called for an ecclesiastical council. The Council was dominated by Cyril.\\"The council was weighted heavily in favor of the Cyrillians, since they had 'planted' uncouth Alexandrians to heckle the Nestorians. They drove the emperor's ambassador and the Nestorian bishops out of the session, and then declared Nestorius a heretic.\\" ‚Äì Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. p. 56 With the Council at a standstill, Theodosius intervened to decide for it. Influenced by Pulcheria, the Emperor ruled in favor of Cyril, decreeing that the title of \\"Theotokos\\" was orthodox. He also deposed Nestorius and banished him to a monastery in Antioch.\\"Under such public pressure Theodosius succumbed to Pulcheria's demands and had Cyril's decree deposing Nestorius read in the Great Church. Nestorius was sent back to his monastery in Antioch‚Ä¶\\" ‚Äì Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. pp. 56‚Äì57. In 449, christological debates flared up again. Theodosius summoned another council to Ephesus, to resolve the disputes. At this council, Pope Leo I was the primary advocate for Pulcheria's claims of the doctrine; he > \\"‚Ä¶forcefully intervened, sending a long letter to Archbishop Flavian of > Constantinople, in which he argued for the two natures, but questioned the > legality of the recent condemnation of a certain Eutyches for denying them. > At this the party of Dioscorus, Cyril's successor in Alexandria, having > believed that Eutyches had renounced his heresy earlier,The story of the > Copts by Iris Habib el Masri ‚Äì XVIII. The Rupture between the churches of > the east and west was able to overturn the situation, whereupon Leo asked > for a second council, calling that [council in] Ephesus the 'Robber > Council.\\"Cameron, Averil. The Mediterranean World In Late Antiquity AD > 395‚Äì600 London: Routledge, p. 23. During this council, Flavian was beaten and died from his injuries. He was later declared a saint and martyr. Two years later, Pulcheria and Marcian summoned the Council of Chalcedon, attended by 452 bishops. It condemned the doctrines of both Nestorius and Eutyches, developed the doctrines of Cyril and Pope Leo I into one, and it declared the doctrine of the \\"Theotokos\\" orthodox. Historian Averil Cameron explains what the Council of Chalcedon meant in greater detail: \\"It developed and clarified the creed of Nicaea, according to which God was Father, Son and Holy Spirit, by further proclaiming that Christ was at all times after the Incarnation fully God and fully human.\\" Pulcheria and Marcian were both hailed as the \\"new Constantine\\" and \\"new Helena\\" at the council. Pulcheria devoted the last years of her life to the \\"Theotokos\\", and had three churches in Constantinople dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary: the Monastery of the Panagia Hodegetria, the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae, and the Chalkoprateia.Limberis, Vasiliki. Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary and the Creation of Christian Constantinople. London and New York: Routledge, 1994. p. 57 ==Death and veneration== On what day in 453 Pulcheria died is unknown. She probably died in Constantinople. Her death shocked the people of Constantinople: > \\"Mention of her death in the chronicles confirms that her passing, like that > of Flacilla [her grandmother], struck like an earthquake in the dynastic > city. Unlike Eudocia [wife of the late Theodosius], she lived out her life > in Constantinople and its suburbs, forming a bond with its people which even > death could not sever.\\" Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and > Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of > California Press, 1982. p. 226. Even in her last days Pulcheria thought of ways to help the poor of Constantinople, for \\"in her will she reinforced that bond by instructing that all of her remaining wealth be distributed among the poor‚Ä¶\\" After her death, she was declared a saint by the imperial church, which is today the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.\\"She became a saint of the church, both in West and in the East, where centuries later the faithful of Constantinople celebrated her memorial each year on September 10, bearing in mind her piety and virginity, her works of philanthropy and construction and especially her greatest triumph: 'she caused the holy synod to take place at Chalcedon'.\\" Holum, Kenneth G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 227 ==Sacred art== The Trier Ivory, representing a procession with royal figures theorized to depict Theodosius II and Pulcheria. Pulcheria brought many holy relics to churches in Constantinople. The Trier Adventus Ivory, now housed in the treasury of Trier Cathedral, Germany, has been interpreted as depicting the installation of one of these relics. Historian Kenneth Holum describes the Ivory thus: > \\"On the Ivory Theodosius wears distinctive costume and inclines slightly > forward, but essentially he remains only part of the cortege and thus of the > ceremonial context. The direction of the wagon's movement inexorably toward > the scene at the right, toward the diminutive woman clothed in the rich > costume of an Augusta ‚Ä¶ in it she deposited the holy relics.\\"Holum, Kenneth > G. Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity. > Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982. p. 107 However, this interpretation is disputed, and one recent opinion is that the ivory shows the later Empress Irene of the eighth century, who sponsored renovation of the church. ==See also== * Icon of the Hodegetria * List of Byzantine emperors * List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses * Monastery of the Panaghia Hodegetria ==Notes== ==References== * Cameron, Averil.

In a healthy, young human adult, tidal volume is approximately 500 mL per inspiration or 7 mL/kg of body mass.Beardsell, I et al: MCEM Part A:MCQs, page 33, Royal Society of Medicine Press, 2009 ==Mechanical ventilation== Tidal volume plays a significant role during mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate ventilation without causing trauma to the lungs. Tidal volume is measured in milliliters and ventilation volumes are estimated based on a patient's ideal body mass. Measurement of tidal volume can be affected (usually overestimated) by leaks in the breathing circuit or the introduction of additional gas, for example during the introduction of nebulized drugs. Ventilator-induced lung injury such as ALI/ARDS can be caused by ventilation with very large tidal volumes in normal lungs, as well as ventilation with moderate or small volumes in previously injured lungs, and research shows that the incidence of ALI increases with higher tidal volume settings in nonneurologically-impaired patients. . Similarly A 2018 systematic review by The Cochrane Collaboration provided evidence that low tidal volume ventilation reduced post operative pneumonia and reduced the requirement for both invasive and non invasive ventilation after surgery Initial settings of mechanical ventilation: ===For patient without preexisting lung disease=== Protective lung Ventilation strategies should be applied with VT 6ml/kg to 8ml/kg with RR = 12 to 20 and an average starting target minute ventilation of 7 l/min. ===For patients with chronic obstructive lung disease=== Protective lung volumes apply 6ml/kg to 8ml/kg with a rate high enough for proper alveolar ventilation but does not create or aggravate intrinsic peep ===Acute respiratory distress syndrome=== Protective Lung Ventilation Strategies apply.

It involves extra urine production in the kidneys as part of the body's homeostatic maintenance of fluid balance. In healthy people, the drinking of extra water produces mild diuresis to maintain the body water balance. Many people with health problems such as heart failure and kidney failure need diuretic medications to help their kidneys deal with the fluid overload of edema. These drugs help the body rid itself of extra water via the extra urine. The concentrations of electrolytes in the blood are closely linked to fluid balance, so any action or problem involving fluid intake or output (such as polydipsia, polyuria, diarrhea, heat exhaustion, starting or changing doses of diuretics, and others) can require management of electrolytes, whether through self-care in mild cases or with help from health professionals in moderate or severe cases. Sometimes a connotative difference is felt between diuresis in the sense of appropriate increase (as in successful diuretic therapy that is controlling symptoms well) and polyuria in the sense of inappropriate increase, that is, excess (as in failed oral antihyperglycemic therapy that must be stepped up to achieve control). However, sometimes the words are simply synonymous. == Osmotic diuresis == Osmotic diuresis is the increase of urination rate caused by the presence of certain substances in the small tubes of the kidneys. The excretion occurs when substances such as glucose enter the kidney tubules and cannot be reabsorbed (due to a pathological state or the normal nature of the substance). The substances cause an increase in the osmotic pressure within the tubule, causing retention of water within the lumen, and thus reduces the reabsorption of water, increasing urine output (i.e. diuresis). The same effect can be seen in therapeutics such as mannitol, which is used to increase urine output and decrease extracellular fluid volume. Substances in the circulation can also increase the amount of circulating fluid by increasing the osmolarity of the blood. This has the effect of pulling water from the interstitial space, making more water available in the blood, and causing the kidney to compensate by removing it as urine. In hypotension, often colloids are used intravenously to increase circulating volume in themselves, but as they exert a certain amount of osmotic pressure, water is therefore also moved, further increasing circulating volume. As blood pressure increases, the kidney removes the excess fluid as urine. Sodium, chloride and potassium are excreted in osmotic diuresis, originating from diabetes mellitus (DM). Osmotic diuresis results in dehydration from polyuria and the classic polydipsia (excessive thirst) associated with DM. ==Forced diuresis== Forced diuresis (increased urine formation by diuretics and fluid) may enhance the excretion of certain drugs in urine and is used to treat drug overdose or poisoning of these drugs and hemorrhagic cystitis.Chemotherapy and biotherapy guidelines and recommendations for practice. Oncology Nursing Society - Professional Association. 2001 (revised 2005 May; republished 2005 Dec). NGC:004665 ===Diuretics=== Renal diuretics Most diuretic drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. When urine is made alkaline, elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs. This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the pK value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the pK value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross a plasma membrane so cannot re-enter blood from kidney tubules. This method is ineffective for drugs that are strongly protein bound (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) or which have a large apparent volume of distribution (e.g. paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants). For forced alkaline diuresis, sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with alkalinization of the urine. Forced alkaline diuresis has been used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone, and is recommended for rhabdomyolysis. For forced acid diuresis, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is sometimes used. Ammonium chloride has also been used for forced acid diuresis but it is a toxic compound. Usually however, this technique only produces a slight increase in the renal clearance of the drug. Forced acid diuresis is rarely done in practice, but can be used to enhance the elimination of cocaine, amphetamine, quinine, quinidine, atropine and strychnine when poisoning by these drugs has occurred. ==Rebound diuresis== An example of the pattern of urine flow and plasma creatinine levels following acute tubular necrosis Rebound diuresis refers to the sudden resurgence of urine flow that occurs during convalescence from acute kidney injury. In acute kidney injury, particularly acute tubular necrosis, the tubules become blocked with cellular matter, particularly necrotic sloughing of dead cells. This debris obstructs the flow of filtrate, which results in reduced output of urine. The arterial supply of the nephron is linked to the filtration apparatus (glomerulus), and reduced perfusion leads to reduced blood flow; usually this is the result of pre-renal pathology. The kidney's resorptive mechanisms are particularly energetic, using nearly 100% of the O2 supplied. Thus, the kidney is particularly sensitive to reduction in blood supply. This phenomenon occurs because renal flow is restored prior to the normal resorption function of the renal tubule. As you can see in the graph, urine flow recovers rapidly and subsequently overshoots the typical daily output (between 800 mL and 2L in most people). Since the kidney's resorption capacity takes longer to re- establish, there is a minor lag in function that follows recovery of flow. A good reference range for plasma creatinine is between 0.07 - 0.12 mmol/L. ==Immersion diuresis== Immersion diuresis is caused by immersion of the body in water (or equivalent liquid). It is mainly caused by lower temperature and by pressure. The temperature component is caused by water drawing heat away from the body and causing vasoconstriction of the cutaneous blood vessels within the body to conserve heat. The body detects an increase in the blood pressure and inhibits the release of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)), causing an increase in the production of urine. The pressure component is caused by the hydrostatic pressure of the water directly increasing blood pressure. Its significance is indicated by the fact that the temperature of the water does not substantially affect the rate of diuresis. Partial immersion of only the limbs does not cause increased urination. Thus, the hand in warm water trick (immersing the hand of a sleeping person in water to make him/her urinate) has no support from the mechanism of immersion diuresis. On the other hand, sitting up to the neck in a pool for a few hours clearly increases the excretion of water, salts, and urea. ==Cold-induced diuresis== Cold-induced diuresis, or cold diuresis, is a phenomenon that occurs in humans after exposure to a hypothermic environment, usually during mild to moderate hypothermia. It is currently thought to be caused by the redirection of blood from the extremities to the core due to peripheral vasoconstriction, which increases the fluid volume in the core. Overall, acute exposure to cold is thought to induce a diuretic response due to an increase mean arterial pressure. The arterial cells of the kidneys sense the increase in blood pressure and signal the kidneys to excrete superfluous fluid in an attempt to stabilize the pressure. The kidneys increase urine production and fill the bladder; when the bladder fills, the individual may then feel the urge to urinate. This phenomenon usually occurs after mental function has decreased to a level significantly below normal. Cold diuresis has been observed in cases of accidental hypothermia as well as a side effect of therapeutic hypothermia, specifically during the induction phase. == See also == == References == == Further reading == * * Category:Nephrology Category:Kidney diseases it:Diuresi ","title":"Diuresis"},{"id":"300467","text":"The Mogollon Rim northeast of Payson, Arizona View from the east Rim View of Mogollon Rim, east of Pine, Arizona View from Mogollon Rim near Payson, Arizona The Mogollon Rim ( or or ) is a topographical and geological feature cutting across the northern half of the U.S. state of Arizona. It extends approximately , starting in northern Yavapai County and running eastward, ending near the border with New Mexico.The Mogollon Rim is not to be confused with the Mogollon Mountains in New Mexico located somewhat east of the eastern end of the Rim. The official estimate of the eastern end is near Show Low, although some sources extend it farther east. See It forms the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau in Arizona. ==Description== The Rim is an escarpment defining the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Its central and most spectacular portions are characterized by high cliffs of limestone and sandstone, namely the Kaibab Limestone and Coconino Sandstone cliffs. The escarpment was created by erosion and faulting, cutting dramatic canyons into it, including Fossil Creek Canyon and Pine Canyon. The name Mogollon comes from Don Juan Ignacio Flores Mogoll√≥n, the Spanish Governor of New Mexico from 1712 to 1715. Much of the land south of the Mogollon Rim lies above sea level, with the escarpment rising to about . Extensive Ponderosa pine forests are found both on the slopes of the Rim and on the plateau north of it. The Mogollon Rim is a major floristic and faunal boundary, with species characteristic of the Rocky Mountains living on the top of the plateau, and species native to the Mexican Sierra Madre Occidental on the slopes below and in the Madrean Sky Islands (high, isolated mountain ranges) further south. The Mogollon Rim's limestones and sandstones were formed from sediments deposited in the Carboniferous and Permian Periods. Several of the Rim's rock formations are also seen on the walls of the Grand Canyon. In many places, the Rim is capped or even buried by the extensive basaltic lava flows. The uppermost sandstone stratum of the Mogollon Rim, called the Coconino Sandstone, forms spectacular white cliffs, sometimes several hundred feet high. This formation of the Permian Period is of aeolian (windblown) origin and is one of the thickest sand-dune-derived sandstones on earth. Site of Zane Grey's lodge Cities and towns near the Mogollon Rim include Payson, Sedona, Show Low, Alpine and Pinetop-Lakeside. The Mogollon Rim is practically bisected by Interstate 17 which runs north-to-south between Flagstaff and Phoenix. In June 2002, the eastern portion of the Mogollon Rim was the site of Arizona's second-largest wildfire, the Rodeo‚ÄìChediski Fire. The Mogollon Rim was also the site of the Dude fire that started on June 25, 1990. This fire grew to cover over and killed six wildland firefighters. Other large fires have burned along the Mogollon Rim since 1990, and the area's Ponderosa pine forests remain vulnerable because of past fire-suppression efforts and the buildup of available dry fuel. Western novel author Zane Grey built a hunting cabin on the slopes of the Mogollon Rim just northeast of Payson, above Tonto Creek. The cabin was restored by the Phoenix air-conditioning magnate William Goettl during the late 1960s, but it was destroyed by the Dude Fire in 1990.

She was born and raised in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia (now Serbia) to an ethnic Hungarian family. She became a naturalized American citizen in 1994 and also received Hungarian citizenship in June 2007. A former world no. 1, she won nine Grand Slam singles titles, eight of them as a teenager while representing Yugoslavia, and the final one while representing the United States. In 1990, Seles became the youngest ever French Open champion at the age of 16. She went on to win eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday and was the year-end world no. 1 in 1991 and 1992. However, on April 30, 1993, she was the victim of an on-court attack, when a man stabbed her in the back with a long knife. Seles did not return to tennis for over two years. Though she enjoyed some success after rejoining the tour in 1995, including a fourth Australian Open title in 1996, she was unable to consistently reproduce her best form. She played her last professional match at the 2003 French Open, but did not officially retire until February 2008. Regarded by many in the sport as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Seles was named one of the \\"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\\" by Time. Several players and historians have stated that Seles had the potential to become the most accomplished female player of all time had she not been stabbed. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009. ==Early life and career== Seles was born in Yugoslavia to an ethnic Hungarian family. Her parents are Ester and Karolj (Eszter and K√°roly in Hungarian) and she has an older brother, Zolt√°n. She began playing tennis at age five, coached by her father, a professional cartoonist employed for decades at the Dnevnik and Magyar Sz√≥ newspapers,Najbolja jugoslovenska teniserka Monika Sele≈° (1.deo) ‚Äì Na≈°a Mala Mo!;Studio, 1990 who drew pictures for her to make her tennis more fun. He is responsible for developing her two-handed style for both the forehand and backhand.Seles, Monica with Nancy Ann Richardson (1996) Monica From Fear to Victory Later, her coach was Jelena Genƒçiƒá. In 1985, at the age of 11, she won the Junior Orange Bowl tournament in Miami, Florida, catching the attention of tennis coach Nick Bollettieri. In early 1986, Seles and her brother Zolt√°n moved from Yugoslavia to the United States, and Seles enrolled at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, where she trained for two years and continued to practice until March 1990. Nine months after their arrival at the Academy, Seles' mother and father joined her and Zolt√°n in Florida. Seles played her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988 at age 14. The following year she turned professional on February 13, 1989, and joined the professional tour full-time, winning her first career title at Houston in May 1989, where she beat the soon-to-retire Chris Evert in the final. A month later, Seles reached the semifinals of her first Grand Slam singles tournament at the French Open, losing to then-world no. 1 Steffi Graf. Seles finished her first year on the tour ranked world no. 6. ==Tennis career== ===1990‚Äì92=== After a slow start at the beginning of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player's Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships (San Antonio, Texas), the Eckerd Open (Tampa, Florida), the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Steffi Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 1990 French Open. Facing world no. 1 Steffi Graf in the final, Seles saved four set points in a first-set tiebreaker, which she won 8‚Äì6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months. Her winning streak was stopped by Zina Garrison at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, where Seles had a match point before Garrison eventually won 9‚Äì7 in the 3rd set. Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year- end Virginia Slims Championships, defeating Gabriela Sabatini in five sets (in the first five-set women's match since 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships. She finished the year ranked world no. 2. 1991 was the first of two years in which Seles dominated the women's tour. She started out by winning the Australian Open in January, beating Jana Novotn√° in the final. In March, she replaced Graf as the world no. 1. She then successfully defended her French Open title, beating the former youngest-ever winner, Arantxa S√°nchez Vicario, in the final. Unable to play at Wimbledon, suffering from shin splints, Seles took a six-week break. But she was back in time for the US Open, which she won by beating Martina Navratilova in the final, her third Grand Slam title of the year, to cement her position at the top of the world rankings. She also won the year-end Virginia Slims Championships for the second consecutive time, defeating Navratilova in four sets. At the end of season, Seles had won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the final of every tournament that she entered that year). She ended the year as the no. 1 ranked player in the world. U.S. Women's Hard Court Championships in San Antonio 1992 was an equally dominant year. Seles successfully defended her titles at the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. She also reached her first- ever final at Wimbledon, but lost to Graf. During Wimbledon, Seles encountered difficulty because of her habit of grunting or shrieking loudly when hitting shots. Her quarterfinal opponent Nathalie Tauziat was the first to complain to the chair umpire about it. During the third set of her semi-final match against Martina Navratilova, Navratilova also complained to the chair umpire about the grunting after Seles went up a break at 4‚Äì2. Seles ended up losing the game and the break, but broke back and closed out the match. From January 1991 through February 1993, Seles won 22 titles and reached 33 finals out of the 34 tournaments she played. She compiled a 159‚Äì12 win-loss record (92.9% winning percentage), including a 55‚Äì1 win-loss record (98%) in Grand Slam tournaments. In the broader context of her first four years on the circuit (1989‚Äì1992), Seles had a win-loss record of 231‚Äì25 (90.2%) and collected 30 titles. She once again ended the year as the #1 ranked player in the world. ===1993 stabbing attack=== Seles was the top ranked women's player heading into 1993, having won the French Open for three consecutive years and both the US Open and Australian Open in consecutive years. In January 1993, Seles defeated Graf in the final of the Australian Open, which to date was her third win in four Grand Slam finals against Graf. She then won the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova in three sets. This was the last title that Seles won before the attack in Hamburg, Germany. On April 30 during a quarterfinal match with Magdalena Maleeva in Hamburg in which Seles was leading, G√ºnter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, ran from the middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a boning knife between her shoulder blades, to a depth of 1.5 cm (0.59 inches). She was quickly taken to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the Yugoslav Wars. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed. Parche was charged following the incident, but only spent less than 6 months in pre- trial detention. In his trial, he was found to be psychologically abnormal, and was sentenced to two years' probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted a significant increase in the level of security at tour events. At that year's Wimbledon, the players' seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying \\"From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed\\". Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the German legal system. \\"What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it ... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening.\\" In a later article, Tennis.com reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems. Graf visited Seles while she was hospitalized. Young Elders, a band from Melbourne, Australia, sent their song called \\"Fly Monica Fly\\" to Seles while she was recuperating from the stabbing incident. She later said that the song provided inspiration to her at that time, and subsequently met the band (who later changed their name to the Monicas) following her victory at the Australian Open in 1996. The stabbing incident is the subject of Dan Bern's 1998 tribute to Seles, \\"Monica\\". Additionally, American band Majesty Crush paid tribute with \\"Seles\\" from the 1993 album Love-15. The WTA suggested that Seles' No. 1 ranking be preserved during her absence, but did not do so. According to Seles' autobiography, all active tour players opposed the idea except Gabriela Sabatini, who abstained. A vote was held at a tournament in Rome in 1993, and 16 of the 17 top players who voted rejected the proposal ‚Äì Graf did not participate in the tournament and was thus absent from voting. Of those who did vote, only Sabatini did not reject the idea of freezing Seles' ranking until her return. ===Comeback=== After becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Seles returned to the tour in August 1995. In the runup to her comeback, then-WTA president Martina Navratilova proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Steffi Graf as joint number one. The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including Arantxa S√°nchez Vicario and Gigi Fern√°ndez, whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles. Graf supported Seles' co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles' co-ranking not be determined by the minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required of everyone else. Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings. Seles won her first comeback tournament, the Canadian Open, beating Amanda Coetzer in the final and setting a tournament record for the fewest games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14). The following month at the US Open, Seles reached the final defeating world No.10 Anke Huber, No. 4 Jana Novotn√°, and No. 3 Conchita Mart√≠nez (all in straight sets), but lost to Graf in the final. In January 1996, Seles won her fourth Australian Open, beating Anke Huber in the final. Her pivotal match was the semifinal vs rising American star Chanda Rubin who led her 5‚Äì3 in the final set, and had 2 break points to lead 5‚Äì1. Seles came back from 2 points from defeat to triumph and reach the final. This was to be Seles' last Grand Slam title, as she struggled to recapture her best form on a consistent basis. Seles was the runner-up at the US Open to Steffi Graf again in 1996. Seles' last Grand Slam final came at the French Open in 1998, just a few weeks after the death of her father and former coach, Karolj, from cancer. In the run to the final she had defeated world no. 3 Jana Novotn√° in three sets and world no. 1 Martina Hingis in straight sets, but lost to S√°nchez Vicario in the three-set final. While she did not reach another Grand Slam singles final, she did consistently reach the quarterfinal and semifinal stages in those tournaments and was a fixture in the WTA Tour's top 10. In 2002, her last full year on the tour, she finished the year ranked world no. 7, defeated Venus Williams, Martina Hingis, Jennifer Capriati, Justine Henin, Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, and Lindsay Davenport, and reached at least the quarterfinals at each Grand Slam tournament. Seles competed at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where she beat Sabatini in a third round match before losing to Jana Novotn√° in the quarterfinals. Four years later, at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Seles captured her first Olympic medal, a bronze in singles. She defeated Jelena Dokic in the bronze medal match, after pushing eventual gold medalist Venus Williams to a tough 3 setter in the semis, losing 6‚Äì3 in the final set. Seles helped the U.S. team win the Fed Cup in 1996, 1999, and 2000. ===Hiatus and retirement=== Seles in the 2007 exhibition against Martina Navratilova in New Orleans, Louisiana In the spring of 2003, Seles sustained a foot injury. She was forced to withdraw during the second set of a match against Nadia Petrova at the Italian Open. Then, a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the 2003 French Open. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.Monica Seles playing activity WTA Tour website In February 2005, Seles played two exhibition matches in New Zealand against Navratilova. Despite losing both matches, she played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so. She played three exhibition matches against Navratilova in 2007. On April 5, she defeated Navratilova in Houston, Texas, on clay.Seles Sighting: Monica plays Martina in exhibition On September 14, Seles defeated Navratilova on an indoor court in New Orleans, Louisiana. On September 16, she beat her on clay in Bucharest. In December 2007, Seles told the press that Lindsay Davenport's successful return to the tour had inspired her to consider her own limited comeback to play Grand Slam tournaments and the major warm-up events for those tournaments. However, on February 14, 2008, Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis. In January 2009, Seles was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. ===Assessment=== Seles' outfit at the Tennis Hall of Fame Museum at the Newport Casino, Newport, Rhode Island Seles is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. In 2012, Tennis Channel created a list of the 100 greatest tennis players. Seles was listed at #19. Seles won eight Grand Slam titles during her teenage years. However, her career was greatly affected by the stabbing incident. Some involved with the sport have declared that Seles could have become the most accomplished female player. In an article written 20 years after Seles was stabbed, Jonathan Scott of Tennis.com stated, \\"Would Monica Seles have been the greatest female tennis player ever? The world will never know.\\" In a 2013 interview, Martina Navratilova theorized that if Seles had not been stabbed, \\"We'd be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] Margaret Court or Steffi Graf.\\" Mary Joe Fernandez declared that Seles would have at least doubled her Grand Slam championship tally, had she not been attacked. Tim Adams of The Guardian stated that Seles would have become \\"the greatest female tennis player ever to pick up a racket.\\" During the height of her career (the 1990 French Open through the 1993 Australian Open), she won eight of the 11 Grand Slam singles tournaments she contested. With eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday, Seles holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a teenager in the Open Era. Until her loss to Martina Hingis at the 1999 Australian Open, Seles had a perfect record at the event (33‚Äì0), which is the longest undefeated streak for this tournament (although Margaret Court won 38 consecutive matches there from 1960 to 1968 after losing a match in 1959). It also marked her first defeat in Australia, having won the Sydney tournament in 1996. Seles was the first female tennis player to win her first six Grand Slam singles finals: 1990 French Open, 1991 Australian Open, 1991 French Open, 1991 US Open, 1992 Australian Open, and 1992 French Open. Seles was also the first female player since Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling in 1937 to win the women's singles title three consecutive years at the French Open, a feat subsequently achieved by Justine Henin in 2005‚Äì7. (Also, Chris Evert won the title in four consecutive appearances in 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980). Shortly after her retirement, Sports Illustrated writer Jon Wertheim summed up her later career: She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on July 11, 2009. In 2011, Seles was named one of the \\"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\\" by Time. ==Playing style== Seles was a baseline player who was known for her highly aggressive playing style. Her unconventional double-handed forehand and backhand were both hit flat, with relentless speed, power, and depth. As a result of her two-handed groundstrokes, she could create sharp angles around the court, and hit winners at will. She was an aggressive return player, and would stand within the baseline to return serves. Her serve speed peaked at 109 mph (174 km/h), allowing her to dictate points from the first stroke. Further strengths included her fitness, speed, and court coverage, allowing her to be an excellent retriever, and hit winners from any position on the court. Prior to her stabbing, Seles‚Äô greatest strength was her confidence, self-belief, and mental toughness, with her being described as one of the toughest players to beat on the WTA tour. Following her return to the tour, she became a more tentative player, who was nowhere near as confident as she was prior to her stabbing, with her nerves failing her in crucial moments. Seles accompanied her shots with loud grunting, and was the first player in the women‚Äôs game to do so, and was frequently criticised for doing so. Due to her aggressive power game, strong serve, and grunting, she is considered the inspiration for modern WTA players such as Serena and Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Victoria Azarenka. ==Coaches, equipment and endorsements== Seles had many coaches through the years. These included: Karoly Sele≈° (1979‚Äì1996), Jelena Genƒçiƒá (1980‚Äì1986), Nick Bollettieri (1986‚Äì1990), Sven Groeneveld (1991‚Äì1992), Gavin Hopper (1997‚Äì1998), Bobby Banck (1999‚Äì2001), Mike Sell (2001‚Äì2002), and David Nainkin (2003). In the early 1990s, Seles signed a $4-million endorsement contract with Fila to promote its footwear and tennis apparel. She used a Prince original graphite racquet on court. In August of the 1990 season, Seles switched to a Yonex racquet. When she returned to the tour in 1995 after the stabbing sabbatical, Seles wore apparel by Nike and used a Yonex racquet on court. In the 2000s, Seles wore apparel by Yonex and used Yonex SRQ Ti-800 Pro Long racquet on court. ==Personal life== On April 21, 2009, Seles released her memoir Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self which chronicles her bout with depression and binge eating disorder (BED) after her stabbing, her father's cancer diagnosis and eventual death, her journey back to the game and a life beyond tennis. Seles is married to businessman Tom Golisano, who is 32 years her senior. They began dating in 2009. The two announced their engagement on June 5, 2014. As of 2015, Seles is a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat BED, to raise awareness of the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal amounts of food at meals, and then secretly eat large amounts of junk food when she was alone. ==In popular culture== In 1994, Seinfeld featured an episode in which the creators fictionalized Monica's return to the US Open after her stabbing. In 1996, Seles made a guest appearance in the TV sitcom The Nanny. She also appeared in 2008 in the TV series Dancing with the Stars as one of the contestants. ==Career statistics== ===Grand Slam singles finals: 13 finals (9 titles, 4 runner-ups)=== {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% - !Result !Year !width=200Tournament !Surface !width=200Opponent !style=\\"width:125px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score - ebc2af;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1990 French Open Clay  Steffi Graf 7‚Äì6(8‚Äì6), 6‚Äì4 - ffc;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1991 Australian Open Hard  Jana Novotn√° 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì1 - ebc2af;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1991 French Open (2) Clay  Arantxa S√°nchez Vicario 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 - ccf;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1991 US Open Hard  Martina Navratilova 7‚Äì6(7‚Äì1), 6‚Äì1 - ffc;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1992 Australian Open (2) Hard  Mary Joe Fern√°ndez 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì3 - ebc2af;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1992 French Open (3) Clay  Steffi Graf 6‚Äì2, 3‚Äì6, 10‚Äì8 - cfc;\\" bgcolor=FFA07ALoss 1992 Wimbledon Grass  Steffi Graf 2‚Äì6, 1‚Äì6 - ccf;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1992 US Open (2) Hard  Arantxa S√°nchez Vicario 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3 - ffc;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1993 Australian Open (3) Hard  Steffi Graf 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2 - ccf;\\" bgcolor=FFA07ALoss 1995 US Open Hard  Steffi Graf 6‚Äì7(6‚Äì8), 6‚Äì0, 3‚Äì6 - ffc;\\" bgcolor=98FB98Win 1996 Australian Open (4) Hard  Anke Huber 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì1 - ccf;\\" bgcolor=FFA07ALoss 1996 US Open Hard  Steffi Graf 5‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6 - ebc2af;\\" bgcolor=FFA07ALoss 1998 French Open Clay  Arantxa S√°nchez Vicario 6‚Äì7(5‚Äì7), 6‚Äì0, 2‚Äì6 } ===Singles performance timeline=== {class= style=text-align:center;font-size:96% -  colspan=\\"1\\"   colspan=\\"7\\" Yugoslavia  colspan=\\"9\\" United States  colspan=\\"2\\"  - !Tournament!!1988!!1989!!1990!!1991!!1992!!1993!!1994!!1995!!1996!!1997!!1998!!1999!!2000!!2001!!2002!!2003!!style=\\"width:40px;\\"SR!!width=40W‚ÄìL -  colspan=\\"19\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Grand Slam tournaments - align=leftAustralian Open A A A bgcolor=limeW bgcolor=limeW bgcolor=limeW A A bgcolor=limeW A A  style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF A bgcolor=ffebcdQF  style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF bgcolor=afeeee2R 4 / 8 43‚Äì4 - align=leftFrench Open A  style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF bgcolor=limeW bgcolor=limeW bgcolor=limeW A A A bgcolor=ffebcdQF  style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF bgcolor=D8BFD8F  style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF bgcolor=ffebcdQF A bgcolor=ffebcdQF bgcolor=afeeee1R 3 / 11 54‚Äì8 - align=leftWimbledon A bgcolor=afeeee4R bgcolor=ffebcdQF A bgcolor=D8BFD8F A A A bgcolor=afeeee2R bgcolor=afeeee3R bgcolor=ffebcdQF bgcolor=afeeee3R bgcolor=ffebcdQF A bgcolor=ffebcdQF A 0 / 9 30‚Äì9 - align=leftUS Open A bgcolor=afeeee4R bgcolor=afeeee3R bgcolor=limeW bgcolor=limeW A A bgcolor=D8BFD8F bgcolor=D8BFD8F bgcolor=ffebcdQF bgcolor=ffebcdQF bgcolor=ffebcdQF bgcolor=ffebcdQF bgcolor=afeeee4R bgcolor=ffebcdQF A 2 / 12 53‚Äì10 - style=\\"font-weight:bold; background:#efefef;\\" style=text-align:leftWin‚ÄìLoss 0‚Äì0 11‚Äì3 13‚Äì2 21‚Äì0 27‚Äì1 7‚Äì0 0‚Äì0 6‚Äì1 17‚Äì3 11‚Äì3 14‚Äì3 16‚Äì4 12‚Äì3 7‚Äì2 17‚Äì4 1‚Äì2 9 / 40 180‚Äì31 } Note: A walkover does not count as a win.

Mach bands is an optical illusion named after the physicist Ernst Mach. It exaggerates the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray, as soon as they contact one another, by triggering edge-detection in the human visual system. ==Explanation== The Mach bands effect is due to the spatial high-boost filtering performed by the human visual system on the luminance channel of the image captured by the retina. Mach reported the effect in 1865, conjecturing that filtering is performed in the retina itself, by lateral inhibition among its neurons. This conjecture is supported by observations on other (non-visual) senses, as pointed out by von B√©k√©sy. The visual pattern is often found on curved surfaces subject to a particular, naturally-occurring illumination, so the occurrence of filtering can be explained as the result of learnt image statistics. The effect of filtering can be modeled as a convolution between a trapezoidal function that describes the illumination and one or more bandpass filters. A tight approximation is obtained by a model employing 9 even-symmetric filters scaled at octave intervals. The effect is independent of the orientation of the boundary. ==In radiology== This visual phenomenon is important to keep in mind when evaluating dental radiographs for evidence of decay, in which grayscale images of teeth and bone are analyzed for abnormal variances of density. A false- positive radiological diagnosis of dental caries can easily arise if the practitioner does not take into account the likelihood of this illusion. Mach bands manifest adjacent to metal restorations or appliances and the boundary between enamel and dentin.Devlin, Hugh. Operative Dentistry: A Practical Guide to Recent Innovations, Springer 2006 page 11 Mach bands may also result in the misdiagnosis of horizontal root fractures because of the differing radiographic intensities of tooth and bone.Nielsen, Christen J.; \\"Effect of Scenario and Experience on Interpretation of Mach Bands,\\" Journal of endodontics Volume 27, Issue 11, Pages 687‚Äì691 Mach effect can also lead to an erroneous diagnosis of pneumothorax by creating a dark line at the lung periphery (whereas a true pneumothorax will have a white pleural line). ==In computer graphics== Example of Mach bands at the ends of gradients where the derivative of the luminance is discontinuous 1\\\\.

His philological works include Wen Shi (ÊñáÂßã \\"The Origin of Writing\\"), the first systematic work of Chinese etymology. He also made contributions to historical Chinese phonology, proposing that \\"the niang (Â®ò) and ri (Êó•) initials [in Middle Chinese] come from the ni (Ê≥•) initial [in Old Chinese]\\" (known as niang ri gui ni Â®òÊó•Ê≠∏Ê≥•). He developed a system of shorthand based on the seal script, called jiyin zimu (Ë®òÈü≥Â≠óÊØç), later adopted as the basis of zhuyin. Though innovative in many ways, he was skeptical of new archaeological findings, regarding the oracle bones as forgery. An activist as well as a scholar, he produced many political works. Because of his outspoken character, he was jailed for three years by the Qing Empire and put under house arrest for another three by Yuan Shikai. ==Life== Zhang was born with the given name Xuecheng (Â≠∏‰πò) in Yuhang (now a district in Hangzhou), Zhejiang to a scholarly family. In 1901, to demonstrate his hatred of the Manchu rulers of the Qing state, he changed his name to ‚ÄòTaiyan‚Äô after two scholars who had resisted the Qing takeover 250 years before: ‚ÄòTai‚Äô came from Taichong, the pen name of Huang Zongxi, and ‚ÄòYan‚Äô from Gu Yanwu. When he was 23, he began to study under the great philologist Yu Yue (1821‚Äì1907), immersing himself in the Chinese classics for seven years. After the First Sino-Japanese War, he went to Shanghai, becoming a member of the Society for National Strengthening (Âº∑Â≠∏ÊúÉ) and writing for a number of newspapers, including Liang Qichao's Shi Wu Bao (ÊôÇÂãôÂ†±). In September 1898, after the failure of the Wuxu Reform, Zhang escaped to Taiwan with the help of a Japanese friend and worked as a reporter for and wrote for Qing Yi Bao (Ê∏ÖË≠∞Â†±) produced in Japan by Liang Qichao. In May of the following year, Zhang went to Japan and was introduced to Sun Yat-sen by Liang Qichao. He returned to China two months later to be a reporter for the Shanghai-based Yadong Shibao (‰∫ûÊù±ÊôÇÂ†±), and later published his most important political work, Qiu Shu (Ë®ÑÊõ∏). In 1901, under the threat of arrest from the Qing Empire, Zhang taught at Soochow University for a year before he escaped to Japan for several months. Upon return, he was arrested and jailed for three years until June 1906. He began to study the Buddhist scriptures during his time in jail. After his release, Zhang went to Japan to join Tongmeng Hui and became the chief editor of the newspaper Min Bao (Ê∞ëÂ†±) which strongly criticized the Qing Empire's corruption. There, he also lectured on the Chinese classics and philology for overseas Chinese students. His students in Japan include Lu Xun, Zhou Zuoren and Qian Xuantong. His most important student was Huang Kan. In 1908, Min Bao was banned by the Japanese government. This caused Zhang to focus on his philological research. He coined the phrase \\"Zhonghua Minguo\\" (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúã, literally \\"People's State of China\\") which became the Chinese name of the Republic of China. Because an ideological conflict with Sun Yat-sen and his Three Principles of the People, Zhang established the Tokyo branch of Guangfu Hui in February 1909. After Wuchang Uprising, Zhang returned to China to establish the Republic of China Alliance (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãËÅØÂêàÊúÉ) and chief-edit the Dagonghe Ribao (Â§ßÂÖ±ÂíåÊó•Â†±). After Yuan Shikai became the President of the Republic of China in 1913, Zhang was his high-ranking advisor for a few months until the assassination of Song Jiaoren. After criticizing Yuan for possible responsibility of the assassination, Zhang was put under house arrest, in Beijing's Longquan Temple, until Yuan's death in 1916. After release, Zhang was appointed Minister of the Guangzhou Generalissimo (Â§ßÂÖÉÂ∏•Â∫úÁßòÊõ∏Èï∑) in June 1917. In 1924, Zhang left Kuomintang, entitled himself a loyalist to the Republic of China, and became critical of Chiang Kai-shek. Zhang established the National Studies Society (ÂúãÂ≠∏Ë¨õÁøíÊúÉ) in Suzhou in 1934 and chief- edited the magazine Zhi Yan (Âà∂Ë®Ä). He died two years later at 67 and was buried in a state funeral. On April 3, 1955, the People's Republic of China moved his coffin from Suzhou to Nanping Mountain, Hangzhou. The People's Republic established a museum devoted to him beside the West Lake. He had three daughters with his first wife. With Cai Yuanpei as witness, he married again in 1913, with Tang Guoli (ÊπØÂúãÊ¢®), an early Chinese feminist. They had two sons, Zhang Dao (Á´†Â∞é) and Zhang Qi (Á´†Â•á). ==Philosophical Beginnings== Originally, Zhang Binglin was firmly rooted in \\"Old Text\\" philology, which emphasized \\"the diversity of China's intellectual heritage led to a serious erosion of the paramount position of Confucius as upheld by the unwavering guardians of orthodoxy\\" (Kurtz 302). Zhang shared the views of his contemporary, Liu Yiqing, that the Confucian classics should be read as history, not sacred scripture. However, he firmly rejected Liu's suggestion to put Chinese intellectual heritage into the matrix of Western philosophy. Joachim Kurtz writes: > Zhang Binglin did not oppose radical reconceptualizations per se but only > those that uncritically mirrored European taxonomies.

Zhang replaced conventional sense of mingjia (which was the name of one of the nine philosophical schools pre-Qin) with a new understanding‚Äîthe methodology of debate similar to European logic and Buddhist dialectic. Zhang's thoughts on religion went through multiple phases. Originally, in his pre-imprisonment days, he was highly critical of religion, and wrote several essays that criticized religious concepts: \\"Looking at Heaven\\", \\"The Truth about Confucianism\\", and \\"On Bacteria\\".Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self-Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 103. In these essays, he emphasized that the scientific world could be reconciled with classical Chinese philosophy. However, his thoughts on religion significantly changed following his imprisonment. ===Imprisonment (1903-1906)=== Zhang's interest and studies in Buddhism only became serious during the three years he spent in prison for \\"publishing anti-Manchu propaganda and insulting the Qing emperor as a 'buffoon' in 1903\\".Kurtz, Joachim. \\"Heritage Unearthed: The Discovery of Chinese Logic\\". The Discovery of Chinese Logic (Leiden, NL:Brill Press, July 1, 2011), 305. During this time, he read the Yogacara-bhumi, the basic texts of Weishi \\"Consciousness Only\\" school, and the foundational work of Chinese Buddhist logic (the Nyayapravesa). These texts were given to him by members of the Chinese Society of Education (Zhongguo jiaoyuhui).Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self-Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 107. He later claimed that \\"it was only through reciting and meditating on these sutras that he was able to get through his difficult jail experience\\". His experiences with Buddhist philosophical texts gave him a framework to reassess the significance of his pain and suffering and view it in a different light.Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self- Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 108. In 1906, after he was released from prison, Zhang went to Japan to edit The People's Journal (Minbao) and developed a new philosophical framework that critiqued the dominant intellectual trend of modernization theory. He emerged from jail as devout Yogacarin. His attitude towards religion‚Äînamely Buddhism‚Äîchanged after his time spent in prison. This is made apparent in \\"Zhang Taiyan's Notes on Reading Buddhist Texts\\", in which he is concerned with the concepts of \\"freedom, constraints, sadness, and happiness\\".Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self-Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 109. After 1906, Buddhist terms became more prevalent in his writing, especially in his interpretation of Zhuangzi's \\"Discourse on Making Things Equal\\". ===Time in Japan (1906-1910)=== Zhang was further exposed to Yogacara Buddhism during his time in Japan (1906-1910), when he was actively involved in nationalist, anti-Manchu politics. During his time there, he edited the Tokyo-based The People's Journal (Minbao), where he first expressed a \\"Buddhist voice\\".Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self- Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 90. While he was in Japan, he joined Tong Meng Hui, a party that was primarily made up of anti-Manchu exiles (including Sun Yat-sen) seeking the cultural and political regeneration of China. Upon his return to China, Zhang worked on the commission \\"convened by the new Nationalist government's Ministry of Education in 1913 to establish a national language and helped develop the Chinese phonetic symbol system still used today in Taiwan, among other places.\\"Hurst, Cecily. The Origin of Language in Chinese Thought, Anthropoetics 6(2): Spring/Summer 2000 The terminology used by Zhang is not common in earlier Chinese philosophical discussions of symbol, language, and the sacred‚Äîbefore the 20th century, Chinese philosophical texts were in classical Chinese (wenyanwen), which uses monosyllabic style. The vernacular (baihua) began to be more commonly used after the May 4th Movement in 1919. Compound words like yuyen were rarely used in pre-20th-century Chinese writings. Zhang was exposed to these linguistic approaches during his time in Japan following his imprisonment. ==Yogacara and Zhang== ===Zhang‚Äôs Buddhist-Daoist Approach to History=== In a time when most Chinese intellectuals favored modernization ideologies and endorsed history as a progressive movement, Zhang Taiyan (Binglin) drew on Buddhism and Daoism to express his critiques. Social and intellectual life during the Qing Dynasty was primarily influenced by \\"widely circulating discourses of modern philosophy and the concrete forces of the global capitalist system of nation- states\\". Following a string of defeats in the late 19th century, Chinese intellectuals began to focus on how China could be improved in order to compete in the global capitalist system. This marked a clear departure from previous Chinese thought, which had primarily focused on the teachings of traditional classical Chinese texts. This was thought to effectively prepare bureaucrats for their positions in the imperial government. However, a national crisis‚Äîthe loss of several armed conflicts‚Äîspurred Chinese philosophers towards modernization thinking. Zhang was particularly revolutionary, as he \\"mobilized Buddhism for politics\\"Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self-Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 91. and combined elements of Yogacara thought with concepts he had developed himself in his pre-revolutionary years. Zhang understood the conditions of possibility (Kant) in Buddhist terms, ‚Äúnamely as the karmic fluctuations of the seeds in alaya consciousness (the storehouse consciousness)‚Äù. Zhang saw history as an ‚Äúunconscious process of drives‚Äù and drew on Yogacara Buddhism. The storehouse consciousness, which is defined as the highest level of consciousness, contains seeds that initiate historical process. He believed that \\"karmic experiences develop from unseen roots, which stem from seeds. As we act in these experiences, we unconsciously plant new karmic seeds and so a cycle of the interplay between past, present and future continues\\". In his essay On Separating the Universal and Particular in Evolution, Zhang utilizes this framework to explain Hegel's philosophy of history. What Hegel describes as \\"a triumphant march of spirit\\" is actually \\"a degenerative disaster created by karmic seeds\\" according to Zhang. ===Yogacara Buddhism and Chinese Philosophy=== Yogacara (or Weishi) primarily focuses on cognitive processes that could be used to overcome ignorance that prevented one from escaping the karmic rounds of birth and death. Practicers/proponents of Yogacara stress attention to the issues of cognition, consciousness, perception, and epistemology. Yogacara Buddhism is based on the following concepts: three self-natures, storehouse consciousness, overturning the basis, and the theory of eight consciousnesses.Dan Lusthaus, \\"Buddhist Philosophy, Chinese\\" http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G002 Zhang viewed the teachings and principles of Yogacara as \\"a sophisticated knowledge system which could serve as an authoritative alternative to the knowledge systems being introduced from the West.\\"Makeham, John. \\"Zhang Taiyan, Yogacara Buddhism, and Chinese Philosophy\\". in Makeham., ed., Learning to Emulate the Wise, 103. Yogacara focuses on meditative practice, epistemology and logic. This strain of Buddhism ceased to be popular in China by the time period of the Yuan dynasty (1206-1368). Yogacara principles and writings were reintroduced to China during the 19th century from Japan, where they had been flourishing for centuries. This revival was primarily led by Liang Qichao, Yang Wenhui, Tan Sitong, Zhang Taiyan and many other prominent intellectuals of the late Qing period. Yogacara was popular with the intellectuals of this period because it was characterized by structured and organized thoughts and concepts. Zhang found Weishi easy to understand ‚Äúbecause it was essentially concerned with mingxiang (definitions of terms), matters in which he had been well grounded due to his rigorous training in the evidential learning techniques associated with Han Learning approaches to Classical Studies (jingxue).‚ÄùMakeham, John. \\"Zhang Taiyan, Yogacara Buddhism, and Chinese Philosophy\\". in Makeham., ed., Learning to Emulate the Wise, 105. Zhang wrote: > There is good reason for my singular respect for faxiang (an alternate name > for Weishi). Modern scholarship [in China] has gradually followed the path > of 'seeking verification in actual events.' Of course the detailed analysis > carried out by Han Learning scholars was far superiod to that which scholars > in the Ming were able to achieve.

It is for this reason that faxiang learning was > inappropriate to the situation in China during the Ming but most appropriate > in modern times. This was brought about by the trends that have informed the > development of scholarship.Zhang Taiyan, \\"Da Tiezheng\\" [Reply to Tiezheng], > in Zhang Taiyan ji [Collected writings of Zhang Taiyan], edited by Huang > Xia'nian (Beijing: Zhongguo shehuikexue chubanshe, 1995), p. 19 Zhang wanted to promote Yogacara Buddhism as a philosophy, not a religion. Buddhism was thought to be a form of scientific philosophy superior to religion, science and philosophy. Zhang based his philosophical vision on the doctrine of three natures. He believed that the third nature‚Äîthe nature of existence being perfectly accomplished‚Äîwas suitable to serve as the foundation for Chinese philosophy and religion. Zhang was not the only one who believed this‚Äîthe late Qing discussion of religion became a philosophical project designed to modernize China so it could compete \\"as a nation-state in an increasingly rationalized and reified world.\\"Murthy, Viren. \\"Buddhist Epistemology and Modern Self-Identity: Zhang Taiyan's 'On Establishing Religion'\\". The Political Philosophy of Zhang Taiyan (Leiden, NL: Brill, 2011), 89. He used this belief to critique Western philosophers Kant, Hegel and Plato, who he felt only represented the first and second doctrines of Yogacara. Zhang felt that yinming, or the knowledge of reasons, enabled people to recover the true meaning of Mohist and Confucian tests in ways that Western philosophy could not. Zhang‚Äôs decision to frame his comparative inquiry in terms of yinming demonstrates his belief in yinming as a more effective 'art of reasoning' than either the 'Mohist Canons' or European logic. In his essay Discussion on the Equalization of Things, Zhang uses Yogacara Buddhist concepts to make sense of Zhuangzi, an ancient Daoist philosopher. He claims that Zhuangzi's notion of equality entails making distinctions without the use of concepts: > 'Equalizing things‚Äô (qiwuzhe) refers to absolute equality (pingdeng). If we > look at its meaning carefully, it does not simply refer to seeing sentient > beings as equal...One must speak form (xiang, laksana) without words, write > of form without concepts (ming) and think form without mind. It is ultimate > equality. This accords with the 'equalization of things.'Zhang Taiyan, > \\"Qiwulun shi,\\" in Zhang Taiyan quanji (Shanghai: Shanghai renmin chubanshe, > 1980) vol. 6, 1-59, 4. Zhang tried to render equality without contradiction between the particular and the universal. Zhang believed that conceptual framework is generated through our karmic actions. When compared to his contemporary Liu Shipei's attempt to extract logic from the masters of the Zhou dynasty, Zhang's writings and thoughts display a higher level of theoretical sophistication as he had a firmer grasp of the purposes and limitations of European logic as well as knowledge of yinming principles and thinking. This enabled him to draw more convincing parallels between the notions he gleaned from his plethora of sources.Kurtz, Joachim. ‚ÄúHeritage Unearthed: The Discovery of Chinese Logic‚Äù, The Discovery of Chinese Logic, (Leiden, Netherlands: Brill (July 1, 2011)), 311-312. ==Legacy== During previous decades, Chinese thinkers have institutionalized history‚Äîfor example, many claimed that communism represented China‚Äôs failure to fully modernize. However, recently, thinkers are beginning to develop a critical version of history based on Zhang‚Äôs writings in order to question the legitimacy of contemporary capitalist society. The current notion of Chinese philosophy as an academic field of study first appeared during the 20th century. In 1918, Hu Shih published \\"An Outline of the History of Chinese philosophy\\". In the preface of this book, Chinese educator Cai Yuanpei wrote: > There has been no systematic recording of classical Chinese learning. All we > have are very pedestrian accounts. If we wish to compose a systemic account > of classical learning, the studies :of Antiquity are of no help, and we have > no other way but follow the criteria of histories of philosophy in the West. > In other words, only those who have studied the history of western > :philosophy can determine the appropriate form of exposition.Hu Shih, \\"An > Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy\\" (in Chinese), Vol. I, p. 1 Ultimately, Zhang's most important contribution to the field of Chinese philosophy was \\"to show that it was possible, at least on an elementary level, to assert the validity of a 'traditional', namely Chinese Buddhist conceptual framework while simultaneously redefining individual notions, such as the boundaries of the logical realm, in accordance with a Western-derived understanding\\".Kurtz, Joachim. \\"Heritage Unearthed: The Discovery of Chinese Logic\\", The Discovery of Chinese Logic, (Leiden, Netherlands: Brill (July 1, 2011)), 312. Zhang ultimately showed students and contemporary intellectuals that ancient Chinese ideas could be brought back to life through the dialectic of Yogacara Buddhism. He also used ancient Chinese philosophic thought and Yogacara Buddhism as a framework to critique the political climate of his contemporary world. His deep understanding of Yogacara concepts allowed him to go beyond a critique of nationalistic politics and question the very foundations of the principles of modernity. ==References== ==Additional Sources== *He Jiuying ‰Ωï‰πùÁõà (1995).

The word first appears in writing in approximately 1709, and is derived from the term maroon, a word for a fugitive slave, which could be a corruption of Spanish cimarr√≥n, meaning a household animal (or slave) who has run \\"wild\\". The practice was a penalty for crewmen, or for captains at the hands of a crew in cases of mutiny. Generally, a marooned man was set on a deserted island, often no more than a sand bar at low tide. He would be given some food, a container of water, and a loaded pistol so he could commit suicide if he desired. The outcome of marooning was usually fatal, but William Greenaway and some men loyal to him survived being marooned, as did pirate captain Edward England. The chief practitioners of marooning were 17th and 18th century pirates, to such a degree that they were frequently referred to as \\"marooners\\". The pirate articles of captains Bartholomew Roberts and John Phillips specify marooning as a punishment for cheating one's fellow pirates or other offenses. In this context, to be marooned is euphemistically to be \\"made governor of an island\\". During the late-18th century in the American South, \\"marooning\\" took on a humorous additional meaning describing an extended camping-out picnic over a period of several days (Oxford English Dictionary). As a result of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Sombrero island passed into the hands of the British. Captain Warwick Lake of Recruit marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner Adams from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. A court- martial later dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy. A Dutch sailor, Leendert Hasenbosch, was marooned on the deserted Ascension Island in 1725 as a punishment for sodomy. He is believed to have died there of thirst later that year. In 1726 his tent and diary were discovered by passing British sailors, and his diary was later translated and published in London. ==In literature== The most famous literary reference to marooning probably occurs in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island in which Ben Gunn is left marooned on the island for three years. A famous real-life marooning, only partly for punishment, was leaving the sailor Alexander Selkirk on Juan Fern√°ndez Island off the coast of Chile, in the Pacific Ocean. Selkirk, a sailor with the Dampier expedition, was worried about the unseaworthy condition of his ship, the Cinque Ports, and had argued with the captain until he left him ashore on the island where they had briefly stopped for water and food supplies. The Cinque Ports later sank with the loss of most of her crew. Selkirk was not rescued until four years later, by Woodes Rogers. Selkirk's travails provided the inspiration for Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe. Today, one of the islands on the Chilean coast is named Alejandro Selkirk Island and another one Robinson Crusoe Island. ==In television== In 2012, Ed Stafford marooned himself on an uninhabited island off Fiji as an experiment for 60 days. He took with him no food, water, or survival equipment of any kind. What he did take were cameras to film the ordeal for Discovery Channel. Stafford completed the task and documents the psychological repercussions in his book Naked and Marooned. ==See also== * Castaway * Exile * Ostracism * Walking the plank ==References== Category:Execution methods Category:Pirate customs and traditions Category:Mutinies Category:Castaways ","title":"Marooning"},{"id":"300490","text":"Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert The Pimer√≠a Alta (Upper Pima Land) was an area of the 18th century Sonora y Sinaloa Province in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, that encompassed parts of what are today southern Arizona in the United States and northern Sonora in Mexico.

During World War II, he fought in the Battle of Moscow and later was captured attempting to lift the siege of Leningrad. After being captured, he defected to Nazi Germany and headed the Russian Liberation Army (Russkaya osvoboditel'naya armiya (ROA)). At the war's end, he changed sides again and ordered the ROA to aid the Prague uprising against the Germans. He and the ROA then tried to escape to the Western Front, but were captured by Soviet forces. Vlasov was tried for treason and hanged. ==Early career== Born in Lomakino, Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, Russian Empire, Vlasov was originally a student at a Russian Orthodox seminary. He quit the study of divinity after the Russian Revolution, briefly studying agricultural sciences instead, and in 1919 joined the Red Army fighting in the southern theatre in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the Crimea. He distinguished himself as an officer and gradually rose through the ranks of the Red Army. Vlasov joined the Communist Party in 1930. Sent to China, he acted as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek from 1938 to November 1939. Upon his return, Vlasov served in several assignments before being given command of the 99th Rifle Division. After just nine months under Vlasov's leadership, and an inspection by Semyon Timoshenko, the division was recognized as one of the best divisions in the Army in 1940.–ö–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤ –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤. ¬´–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è. –ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–º—ã. –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å¬ª ‚Äî –ú.; –ñ—É–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π: –ö—É—á–∫–æ–≤–æ –ø–æ–ª–µ, 2005. Timoshenko presented Vlasov with an inscribed gold watch, as he \\"found the 99th the best of all\\". The historian John Erickson says of Vlasov at this point that [he] \\"was an up-and-coming man\\".John Erickson, The Soviet High Command, MacMillan, 1962, p.558 In 1940, Vlasov was promoted to major general, and on June 22, 1941, when the Germans and their allies invaded the Soviet Union, Vlasov was commanding the 4th Mechanized Corps. As a lieutenant general, he commanded the 37th Army near Kiev and escaped encirclement. He then played an important role in the defense of Moscow, as his 20th Army counterattacked and retook Solnechnogorsk. Vlasov's picture was printed (along with those of other Soviet generals) in the newspaper Pravda as that of one of the \\"defenders of Moscow\\". Vlasov was decorated on January 24, 1942, with the Order of the Red Banner for his efforts in the defence of Moscow. Vlasov was ordered to relieve the ailing commander Klykov after the Second Shock Army had been encircled.Bellamy, Absolute War, pg 384 After this success, Vlasov was put in command of the 2nd Shock Army of the Volkhov Front and ordered to lead the attempt to lift the Siege of Leningrad‚Äîthe Lyuban-Chudovo Offensive Operation of January‚ÄìApril 1942. On January 7, 1942, Vlasov's army had spearheaded the Lyuban Offensive Operation to break the Leningrad encirclement. Planned as a combined operation between the Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts on a 30 km frontage, other armies of the Leningrad Front (including the 54th) were supposed to participate at scheduled intervals in this operation. Crossing the Volkhov River, Vlasov's army was successful in breaking through the German 18th Army's lines and penetrated 70‚Äì74 km deep inside German rear area.Meretskov, On the service of the nation, Ch.6 However, the other armies (the Volkhov Front's 4th, 52nd, and 59th Armies, 13th Cavalry Corps, and 4th and 6th Guards Rifle Corps, as well as the 54th Army of the Leningrad Front) failed to exploit Vlasov's advances and provide the required support, and Vlasov's army became stranded. Permission to retreat was refused. With the counter-offensive in May 1942, the Second Shock Army was finally allowed to retreat, but by now, too weakened, it was surrounded and in June 1942 virtually annihilated during the final breakout at Myasnoi Bor.Erickson, Road to Stalingrad, 2003, p.352. See also p.381, where Erickson describes 2 Shock after this operation as 'an army brought back from the dead.' ==Defection== Signal After Vlasov's army was surrounded, he himself was offered an escape by aeroplane. The general refused and hid in German-occupied territory; ten days later, on July 12, 1942, a local farmer exposed him to the Germans. Vlasov's opponent and captor, Nazi general Georg Lindemann, interrogated him about the surrounding of his army and details of battles, then \\"had Vlasov imprisoned in occupied Vinnytsia.\\" Vlasov claimed that during his ten days in hiding he affirmed his anti- Bolshevism, believing Joseph Stalin was the greatest enemy of the Russian people, and there is evidence that suggests Vlasov may have changed sides in a bid to give his countrymen a better life than the one they had under Stalin.http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story;_id=5830 His critics, including Marshal Kirill Meretskov (who had endorsed Vlasov's promotion to executive officer of the Volkhov front) and most Soviet historians, argued that Vlasov adopted a pro-Nazi German stance in prison out of opportunism, careerism, and survival, fearing Stalinist retribution for losing his last battle and his army. In 2016, in his habilitation thesis, Russian historian Kirill Alexandrov analyzed the careers of 180 Soviet generals and officers who joined the Vlasov army. He concluded that most of them personally experienced atrocities committed by the NKVD during the Great Purge and previous purges in the Red Army, which made them disillusioned with the leadership of Stalin and motivated them to defect to the Nazis. Alexandrov's work was reported to the FSB by Russian nationalists as \\"inciting hatred\\" but his university, regardless of the political pressure, voted in favor of its scientific value. ==German prisoner== Vlasov (left) and Gen. Shilenkov (center) meeting Joseph Goebbels (February 1945) While in prison, Vlasov met Captain Wilfried Strik- Strikfeldt, a Baltic German who was attempting to foster a Russian Liberation Movement. Strik-Strikfeldt had circulated memos to this effect in the Wehrmacht. Strik-Strikfeldt, who had been a participant in the White movement during the Russian Civil War, persuaded Vlasov to become involved in aiding the German advance against the rule of Joseph Stalin and Bolshevism. With Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Boyarsky, Vlasov wrote a memo shortly after his capture to the German military leaders suggesting cooperation between anti- Stalinist Russians and the German Army. Vlasov was taken to Berlin under the protection of the Wehrmacht's propaganda department. While there, he and other Soviet officers began drafting plans for the creation of a Russian provisional government and the recruitment of a Russian army of liberation under Russian command. Vlasov founded the Russian Liberation Committee, in hopes of creating the Russian Liberation Army--known as ROA (from Russkaya Osvoboditel'naya Armiya). In the spring of 1943, Vlasov wrote an anti-Bolshevik leaflet known as the \\"Smolensk Proclamation\\", which was dropped from aircraft by the millions on Soviet forces and Soviet-controlled soil. In March of the same year, Vlasov also published an open letter titled \\"Why Have I Taken Up the Struggle Against Bolshevism\\". Even though no Russian Liberation Army yet existed, the Nazi propaganda department issued Russian Liberation Army patches to Russian volunteers and tried to use Vlasov's name in order to encourage defections. Several hundred thousand former Soviet citizens served in the German army wearing this patch, but never under Vlasov's own command. Vlasov talking to volunteers on November 18, 1944 Adolf Hitler was very wary of Vlasov and his intentions. On April 3, 1943, Hitler made clear in a speech to his high command that such an army would never be created, then issued directives to dismantle any such efforts and to sequester all of Vlasov's supporters in the German army. He worried that Vlasov might succeed in overthrowing Stalin, which would halt Hitler's dreams of expanding Greater Germany to the Urals. Hitler began taking measures against Eastern Volunteer units, especially Russian ones, arranging for their transfer to the West. Vlasov was permitted to make several trips to Nazi-occupied Russia: most notably, to Pskov, where Russian pro-German volunteers paraded. The populace's reception of Vlasov was mixed. While in Pskov, Vlasov dealt himself a nearly fatal political blow by referring to the Germans as mere \\"guests\\" during a speech, which Hitler found belittling. Vlasov was even put under house arrest and threatened with being handed over to the Gestapo. Despondent about his mission, Vlasov threatened to resign and return to the POW camp, but was dissuaded at the last minute by his confidants. According to Shalamov,see his tale: The last battle of major Pugachov Vlasov emissaries lectured to the Russian prisoners of war, explaining to them that their government had declared them all traitors, and that escaping was pointless. As Vlasov proclaimed, even if the Soviets succeeded, Stalin would send them to Siberia. Only in September 1944 did Germany ‚Äî at the urging of Heinrich Himmler, initially a virulent opponent of Vlasov ‚Äî finally permit Vlasov to raise his Russian Liberation Army. Vlasov formed and chaired the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, proclaimed by the Prague Manifesto on 14 November 1944. Vlasov also hoped to create a Pan-Slavic liberation congress, but Nazi political officials would not permit it. ==Commander of the ROA== Vlasov with ROA soldiers Vlasov's order no. 65 to prevent dedovshchina in the Russian Liberation Army, April 3, 1945. Vlasov's only combat against the Red Army took place on February 11, 1945, on the river Oder. After three days of battle against overwhelming forces, the First Division of the ROA was forced to retreat and marched southward to Prague, in German-controlled Bohemia. On May 6, 1945, Vlasov received a request from the commander of the first ROA division, General Sergei Bunyachenko, for permission to turn his weapons against the Nazi SS forces and aid Czech resistance fighters in the Prague uprising. Vlasov at first disapproved, then reluctantly allowed Bunyachenko to proceed. Some historians maintain it was the bitterness of the ROA against the Germans which caused them to switch sides once again, while other historians believe the sole purpose of this action was to win favor from the western Allies and possibly even the Soviet side, in the light of the nearly completed military annihilation of the German Reich. Two days later, the first division was forced to leave Prague as Communist Czech partisans began arresting ROA soldiers in order to hand them over to the Soviets for execution. Vlasov and the rest of his forces, trying to evade the Red Army, attempted to head west to surrender to the Allies in the closing days of the war in Europe. ==Capture by Soviet forces and trial== Vlasov's division, commanded by General Sergei Bunyachenko, was captured southeast of Plze≈à by the Soviet 25th Tank Corps, after he refused to surrender to the US troops. Vlasov was found hiding wrapped in two blankets in a motor car and was identified with the help of his own driver. Captain M. I. Yakushev of the 162nd Tank Brigade had Vlasov dragged out of his car, put on a tank and driven straight to the Soviet 13th Army HQ. Vlasov was then transported from the 13th Army HQ to Marshal Ivan Konev's command post in Dresden, and from there sent immediately to Moscow. Vlasov was confined in Lubyanka prison where he was interrogated. A trial was held beginning 30 July 1946 and was presided over by Viktor Abakumov who sentenced him and eleven other senior officers from his army to death for high treason. ==Death== Monument dedicated to Andrey Vlasov and the combatants of the Russian Liberation Army in New York Vlasov was executed by hanging on 2 August 1946. His was among the last death sentences in the Soviet Union carried out by hanging, after which the Soviet death penalty was conducted only by shooting. ==Memorial== A memorial dedicated to General Vlasov and the participants in the Russian Liberation Movement was erected at the Novo- Diveevo Russian Orthodox convent and cemetery in Nanuet, New York, USA. Twice annually, on the anniversary of Vlasov's execution and on the Sunday following Orthodox Easter, a memorial service is held for Vlasov and the combatants of the Russian Liberation Army. ==Review of his case== In 2001, a Russian Federation-based social organization, \\"For Faith and Fatherland\\", applied to the Russian Federation's military prosecutor for a review of Vlasov's case,Valeria Korchagina and Andrei Zolotov Jr. It's Too Early To Forgive Vlasov The St. Petersburg Times. 6 Nov 2001. saying that \\"Vlasov was a patriot who spent much time re-evaluating his service in the Red Army and the essence of Stalin's regime before agreeing to collaborate with the Germans\\". The military prosecutor concluded that the law of rehabilitation of victims of political repressions did not apply to Vlasov and refused to consider the case again. However, Vlasov's Article 58 conviction for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda was vacated. ==See also== *Bronislaw Kaminski *Constantine Kromiadi *Engelen des doods (Angels of death) *Operation Keelhaul *Russian Liberation Army *Russian Liberation Movement ==References== ==Literature and film== Books: *Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt: Against Stalin and Hitler.

The role combined characteristics of the Zanni (servant) and the Capitano (masked henchman), with some assortment of villainous traits. Usually attired in black Spanish dress and burlesquing a Don, he was often beaten by Harlequin for his boasting and cowardice. ==History== Although Tiberio Fiorillo (1608‚Äì1694) was not the first to play the role, he greatly developed and popularized it. He removed the mask, used white powder on his face, and employed grimaces. He had a small beard, long mustache, and wore a predominantly black costume with a white ruff. In France he became known as scaramouche.Hartnoll 1983, pp. 282 (\\"Fiorillo, Tiberio\\"), 735 (\\"Scaramuccia\\"). Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche by Pietro Paolini In the 19th century the English actor Joseph Grimaldi and his son J. S. Grimaldi made numerous appearances as Scaramouche. ==Character== Scaramouche entertains the audience by his \\"grimaces and affected language\\". Salvator Rosa says that Coviello (like Scaramouche) is \\"sly, adroit, supple, and conceited\\". In Moli√®re's The Bourgeois Gentleman, Coviello disguises his master as a Turk and pretends to speak Turkish. Both Scaramouche and Coviello can be clever or stupid‚Äîas the actor sees fit to portray him. In Blaise Pascal's Pens√®es Section 1 Article 12, Scaramouche is described as a person \\"who only thinks of one thing. The doctor, who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.\\" ==In puppetry== Scaramouche is one of the great characters in the Punch and Judy puppet shows (a performative art with roots in commedia dell'arte). In some scenarios, he is the owner of The Dog, another stock character. During performances, Punch frequently strikes Scaramouche, causing his head to come off his shoulders. Because of this, the term scaramouche has become associated with a class of puppets with extendable necks. ==Scaramouche in popular culture== J. S. Grimaldi as Scaramouche, * The hero of Rafael Sabatini's historical novel Scaramouche, and its film adaptations, is a similar swashbuckling character who goes incognito in the theatrical role of Scaramouche. * Several films were named Scaramouche, among other past films and TV series, include: ** Scaramouche (1923), silent movie by Rex Ingram ** Scaramouche (1952), directed by George Sidney with Stewart Granger, Janet Leigh, Eleanor Parker, and Mel Ferrer. ** ' (1963), a French-Italian-Spanish feature film, directed by Antonio Isasi-Isasmendi, starring G√©rard Barray, Mich√®le Girardon, Gianna Maria Canale. ** The Loves and Times of Scaramouche (1976), an Italian comedy film, directed by Enzo G. Castellari, stars Michael Sarrazin, Ursula Andress, Aldo Maccione, about the adventures of a cad in Napoleonic times. * Scaramouche is the name of a suite by the French composer Darius Milhaud for two pianos and some other combinations. Milhaud first composed the piece as an amalgam of music he wrote for theatre. * In the 1975 song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", by the popular British rock band Queen, Scaramouche is asked if he would like to perform the dance known as a fandango. * Inspired by \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", Scaramouche is the name of the lead female role in the jukebox musical play We Will Rock You. * Scaramouche Jones (2002) is a solo play by Justin Butcher, which was premiered in its full form by Pete Postlethwaite. In this 100-minute monologue, an aging clown recounts, at the turn of the millennium, the picaresque story of his life, from his early childhood in Trinidad at the start of the 20th century, the son of a gypsy prostitute and an Englishman, through his harsh misadventures in the slave trade and in wartime Poland, where as a gravedigger he found his vocation as a clown while striving to keep children amused by parodying their imminent slaughter. * In the opening chapter of the book Phule's Company by Robert Asprin, the main character Willard Phule uses Scaramouche as his alias. (\\"Scaramouche?\\" Major Joshua said with a frown. \\"Aside from the obvious reference to the character from the novel\\".)Asprin, Robert 1990.

Rough Crossing and On the Razzle, 1st ed., Faber and Faber Ltd. p. 86. * Investor Anthony Scaramucci was named the White House communications director in July 2017 and removed later that same month. His very public presence in news media prompted an 8,185% increase in searches for Scaramouche, according to Merriam- Webster. Cartoonist Ruben Bolling hinted at some striking congruities between Anthony Scaramucci's conduct in office and the defining traits of the theatrical figure. * Scaramouche is the name of a comedic villain henchman in season 5 of the US animated series Samurai Jack. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Category:Stock characters Category:Clever Zanni class characters Category:Italian fiction Category:Fictional Italian people Category:Male characters in literature ","title":"Scaramouche"},{"id":"300513","text":"Rb or RB may stand for: ==Arts and entertainment== * Rebecca Black, an American pop singer * Richard Blackwood, a British rapper * Rhythm and blues, a music genre combining blues, gospel and jazz influences * Rock Band, a music video game series * Rock Band (video game), the game of the same name *Ultraman R/B, a Japanese television series Det st√•r for \\"r√∏vbillede\\" ;) ==Businesses== * Rankin/Bass, an American production company, known for its seasonal television specials * Ray-Ban, a sunglasses company * Reckitt Benckiser, a company in the United Kingdom * Syrian Arab Airlines (IATA airline code RB) ==Government and politics== * Radio Bremen, a public broadcaster for the German state of Bremen * Parti de la Renaissance du B√©nin or Benin Rebirth Party, a political party in Benin * Rep√∫blica Bolivariana, Spanish-language phrase for the type of government in Venezuela * Rupiah Banda, President of Zambia ==Science and technology== ===Vehicles=== * Hyundai RB (buses), a series of Korean buses * SJ Rb, a Swedish locomotive * Nissan RB engine, a gasoline engine made by Nissan * Re-entry body, the US Air Force term for a re-entry vehicle * Regionalbahn, a type of train in Germany * R√©seau Breton, a French railway network in Brittany ===Other uses in science and technology=== * .rb, the file extension for documents created in Ruby or in REAL Basic * Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), used in reinforced concrete structures * Retinoblastoma, a childhood cancer of the eyes caused by a mutation in the retinoblastoma protein * Retinoblastoma protein, a tumor suppressor protein * Rubidium, a chemical element * Reflected binary code, Gray code ==Sport== * Running back, a position in North America football * Right back, a defensive position in association football ==Other uses== * R.

It was sold in Japan as the Citro√´n Chanson, because Honda had registered the \\"Saxo\\" name. It shared many engine and body parts with the Peugeot 106 (which itself was a development of the Citro√´n AX), the major difference being interiors and body panels. Production ended in 2004, when it was replaced with the Citro√´n C2 and Citro√´n C3. ==Overview== ===Engines and performance=== All engines were from the PSA TU engine series that powered the Peugeot 205 from 1988 and the Citro√´n AX, and had their roots before that with the OHC PSA X engine various other PSA cars used, such as the Citro√´n Visa, Peugeot 104 and early Peugeot 205. The range included five petrol engines and one diesel engine, all naturally aspirated. Although the quoted power outputs are low in comparison to modern small hatchbacks, or even to other hatchbacks of the time, the kerb weight was generally very low, with even the range- topping VTS having a kerb weight of just , with other smaller engine models (except the diesel) being around 100 kg lighter than this. Pre-facelift Saxo 1.0 3-door This meant a high power to weight ratio resulting in decent acceleration and made the car suitable for city driving. Aside from the VTS which had 16 valves, all engines were the older SOHC units which meant relatively low city MPG figures. Even the popular 1.1i engine would struggle to achieve more than 35 to 40mpg in town when driven carefully. The real world consumption between the smaller engines and the nippy 1.4i Westcoast/Furio variant was hardly noticeable, however the insurance premiums were. The early 1.0i was quite under powered, with the 1.1i being considered much better, since it was nearly 200cc larger and had roughly 30% more torque. There were three sport models of the Saxo: * The Westcoast, later replaced by the Furio which featured a 1.4I 8V 55 kW (75PS/75BHP) engine with a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph), and a 0-62.5 mph (0‚Äì100 km/h) time of 11.2 seconds. * The VTR MK1 (1997‚Äì1999) featured a 1.6I 8V 66 kW (90PS/89BHP) engine with a top speed of 187 km/h (116 mph) and a 0-62.5 mph (0‚Äì100 km/h) time of 10.0 seconds. The VTR MK2 (1999‚Äì2003) featured a 1.6I 8V 72 kW (98PS/97BHP) engine with a top speed of 193 km/h (120 mph) and a 0-62.5 mph (0‚Äì100 km/h) time of 9.4 seconds. * The VTS 16V featured a 1.6I 88 kW (120PS/118BHP) engine with a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph), and a 0 to 60 mph time of 7.8 seconds. The VTS MK1 (1997‚Äì1999) and MK2 (1999‚Äì2003) shared similar performance, although the MK2 was slightly slower due to it being marginally heavier. These models included vented front brake discs, with the VTR and VTS also having rear brake discs (solid discs). Also, a different style of control arms and struts was used for the suspension. The VTS had a master brake cylinder, and the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a . The VTS had a front anti roll bar and rear anti roll bar, while the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a front and or sometimes rear antiroll bar. In addition, all the sports models featured a unique bodykit to the other models, commonly known as the \\"VT\\" bodykit. In 1997 the Saxo's three speed automatic gearbox was combined with the 1.6i 8V 66 kW (90PS/89BHP) engine which was available on the Saxo SX and VSX. Then, in the end of 1997, the 1.6i automatic was replaced with a 1.4i 55 kW (75PS/74BHP) engine. The 1.6i was more powerful with a top speed of 176 km/h (109MPH) compared with the 1.4's top speed of . Rear view (pre-facelift) 1998 Citro√´n Saxo VTS Citro√´n carried on using the 1.4i engine on the facelift Saxo Automatic in 1999. Due to the C3 having a 1.4i automatic gearbox, the Saxo Automatic came to an end in March 2002, whilst the manual models were still sold right up to the end of 2003. * 1.0 L (954 cc) TU9 I4, 50 PS (49 hp/36 kW) and 54 lb¬∑ft (73 N¬∑m) * 1.1 L (1124 cc) TU1 I4, 60 PS (59 hp/44 kW) and 69 lb¬∑ft (89 N¬∑m) * 1.4 L (1360 cc) TU3 I4, 75 PS (74 hp/55 kW) and 89 lb¬∑ft (121 N¬∑m) * 1.5 L (1527 cc) TUD5 diesel I4, 58 PS (57 hp/42 kW) and 86 lb¬∑ft (117 N¬∑m) * 1.6 L (1587 cc) TU5 I4, 90 PS (89 hp/66 kW) and 95 lb¬∑ft (135 N¬∑m) * 1.6 L (1587 cc) TU5 I4, 96 PS (98 hp/70 kW) and 97 lb¬∑ft (135 N¬∑m) (later VTR models) * 1.6 L (1587 cc) TU5 I4, 120 PS (118 hp/88 kW) and 107 lb¬∑ft (145 N¬∑m) ===Interior and equipment=== Interior The equipment list was generally sparse, with budget models having drivers airbag, seat belt pre tensioners, cassette player, heated rear screen and tinted windows, and early Mark Ones with keypad immobilisers and a clock in place of a tachometer and three stud wheels, much like the AX. Further up the list sunroofs, PAS, Electric windows, ultrasonic alarm, passenger airbag, CD player, tachometer, front fog lights, bodykits, colour coded mirror caps and alloy wheels were added, to name a few. Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other small hatchbacks of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older model of the Citro√´n AX. The 1.6L VTR and VTS Saxos were the best equipped, with both gaining rear disc brakes as opposed to drum brakes, and ABS as standard for the VTS and an optional extra on all other 1.6-liter models. Few special models were released throughout the Saxo's life, most notably the \\"Open Scandal\\", a Saxo with a full length sliding canvas roof. Other special editions added certain extras to the lower end model, such as sunroofs or PAS. Notable models are the Westcoast up to 1999 and the Furio to 2003, as they incorporated the standard Saxo bodykit found on the VTR and VTS with a more insurance friendly 1.4-liter engine. The Westcoast is not to be confused with the Eastcoast, which was only available in the 1.0L and later 1.1L engines. The Eastcoast also did not incorporate the \\"VT\\" bodykit. Air conditioning was never an option on right hand drive Saxos because the blower motor was mounted in the bulk head on the driver's side. As a result, there was insufficient space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the passenger's side and then at the expense of the glove box. Although an after market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The blower motor could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in the passenger's side space. ===Facelift=== In September 1999, the Saxo received a style makeover, commonly branded as a Mark II, with the major differences being more modern styled headlights, bonnets and grilles to replace the square style on the MK1 and multipoint injection replacing the single point on the 1.1-liter engines. In September 2000, it was a EuroNCAP sufferer of poor results, along with its twin, the 106. Power steering became standard on all but the very basic models. More subtle changes were alterations to the rear lights (the indicator sections are more \\"white\\") and the engine control unit moved from a single plug to three plugs. The old three-stud wheel layout, as used on the Citro√´n AX, was also dropped. There was also a minor facelift, during the first phase of the car's production, in line with the then current releases by Citro√´n, moving towards a rounder look. While the exterior was markedly altered, little changed inside the vehicle. The dashboard and glovebox arrangement remained the same with the possibility of installing a passenger-side airbag in some high range models. By 2003, some buyers were more attracted to the spacious, and practical five-door C3. However, the 1.6 VTR and VTS models remained popular. The Saxo finally finished production in September 2003, when the three-door C2 was launched. Its twin, the Peugeot 106, also ceased production at this time. By the end of the Saxo's production life, its design was seven years old. ===Drag coefficient=== The Saxo has a drag coefficient of . In addition its frontal area is 1.83 m2, giving it a CdA ft¬≤ of 6.68. ==See also== *Peugeot 205 ==References== ==External links== Category:2000s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1996 Saxo Category:City cars Category:Euro NCAP superminis Category:Front- wheel-drive vehicles Category:Hatchbacks Category:Hot hatches ","title":"Citro√´n Saxo"},{"id":"300531","text":"Eugene Andrew Cernan (; March 14, 1934 ‚Äì January 16, 2017) was an American astronaut, naval aviator, electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, and fighter pilot. During the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan became the eleventh person to walk on the Moon. As he re-entered the Apollo Lunar Module after Harrison Schmitt on their third and final lunar excursion, he was the last person to walk on the Moon. Before becoming an astronaut, Cernan graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University and joined the U.S. Navy. After flight training, he received his naval aviator wings and served as a fighter pilot. In 1963 he received a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976. Cernan traveled into space three times and to the Moon twice; as pilot of Gemini 9A in June 1966, as lunar module pilot of Apollo 10 in May 1969, and as commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the final Apollo lunar landing. Cernan was also a backup crew member of the Gemini 12, Apollo 7 and Apollo 14 space missions. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Cernan was born on March 14, 1934, in Chicago, Illinois; he was the son of Rose (n√©e Cihlar; 1898‚Äì1991) and Andrew George Cernan (1904‚Äì1967). His father was of Slovak descent and his mother was of Czech ancestry. Cernan grew up in the Illinois towns of Bellwood and Maywood. He was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Second Class. After attending McKinley Elementary School in Bellwood, and graduating from Proviso East High School in Maywood in 1952, he studied at Purdue University where he became a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, serving as a treasurer. At Purdue, Cernan was also president of the Quarterdeck Society and the Scabbard and Blade, and a member of the Phi Eta Sigma honor society and Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society. He was on the military ball committee and was a member of the Skull and Crescent leadership honor society.Eugene Andrew Cernan (14 March 1934‚Äì16 January 2017) After his sophomore year, he accepted a partial Navy ROTC scholarship that required him to serve aboard between his junior and senior years. In 1956, Cernan received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering; his final GPA was 5.1 out of 6.0. === Navy service === Cernan was commissioned a U.S. Navy Ensign through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at Purdue, and was initially stationed on the . Cernan changed to active duty and attended flying training at Whiting Field, Barron Field, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and Naval Air Station Memphis. Following flight training on the T-28 Trojan, T-33 Shooting Star, and F9F Panther, Cernan became a Naval Aviator, flying FJ-4 Fury and A-4 Skyhawk jets in Attack Squadrons 126 and 113. Upon completion of his assignment in Miramar, California, he finished his education in 1963 at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School with a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering. During his naval career, Cernan logged more than 5,000 hours of flying time, including 4,800 hours in jet aircraft. Cernan also made 200 landings on aircraft carriers. ===NASA career=== In October 1963, NASA selected Cernan as one of the third group of astronauts to participate in the Gemini and Apollo space programs. ====Gemini program==== Cernan aboard Gemini 9A Cernan was originally selected with Thomas Stafford as backup pilot for Gemini 9. When the prime crew of Elliot See and Charles Bassett was killed in the crash of NASA T-38A \\"901\\" (USAF serial 63-8181) at Lambert Field on February 28, 1966, the backup crew became the prime crew‚Äîthe first time in NASA history this happened. Gemini 9A encountered a number of problems; the original target vehicle exploded during launch and the planned docking with a substitute target vehicle was made impossible by the failure of a protective shroud to separate after launch. The crew, however, performed a rendezvous that simulated procedures that would be used in the Apollo 10 mission; the first optical rendezvous and a lunar-orbit-abort rendezvous. Cernan performed the second American EVA, the third-ever spacewalk, but overexertion caused by a lack of limb restraints prevented testing of the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit and forced the early termination of the spacewalk. Cernan was also a backup pilot for the Gemini 12 mission. ====Apollo program==== Cernan and Snoopy during Apollo 10 press conference Cernan in the LM after EVA 3 on Apollo 17 Astronauts Cernan and Schmitt singing \\"The Fountain in the Park\\" on the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission Cernan at the beginning of EVA 3 The Blue Marble, an iconic photograph of Earth, is credited to the three crewmen of Apollo 17. Apollo 10 Cernan was selected for the lunar module pilot position on the backup crew for Apollo 7‚Äîalthough that flight carried no lunar module. Standard crew rotation put him in place as the Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 10‚Äîthe final dress rehearsal mission for the first Apollo lunar landing‚Äîon May 18‚Äì26, 1969. During the Apollo 10 mission, Cernan and his commander, Tom Stafford, piloted the Lunar Module Snoopy in lunar orbit to within of the lunar surface, and successfully executing every phase of a lunar landing up to final powered descent. This provided NASA planners with critical knowledge of technical systems and lunar gravitational conditions to enable Apollo 11 to land on the Moon two months later. Apollo 10 holds the record for the highest speed attained by any crewed vehicle at during its return from the Moon on May 26, 1969. Apollo 17 Cernan turned down the opportunity to walk on the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight for the opportunity to command his own mission. Cernan moved back into the Apollo rotation as commander of the backup crew of Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and Joe Engle for Apollo 14, putting him in position through normal crew rotation to command his own crew on Apollo 17. Escalating budget cutbacks for NASA, however, brought the number of future lunar missions into question. After the cancellation of Apollo 15 in its original H class profile and Apollo 19 in September 1970, pressure from the scientific community to shift Harrison Schmitt, the sole professional geologist in the active Apollo roster of astronauts, to the crew of Apollo 17, the final scheduled Apollo mission, mounted. In August 1971, NASA named Schmitt as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 17, which meant the original LM pilot Joe Engle never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; given the choice of flying with Schmitt as LMP or seeing his entire crew removed from Apollo 17, Cernan chose to fly with Schmitt. Cernan eventually came to have a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities; he concluded that Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot while Engle‚Äînotwithstanding his outstanding record as an aircraft test pilot‚Äîwas merely an adequate one. Cernan's role as commander of Apollo 17 closed out the Apollo program's lunar exploration mission with a number of record-setting achievements. During the three days of Apollo 17's surface activity (Dec. 11‚Äì14, 1972), Cernan and Schmitt performed three EVAs for a total of about 22 hours of exploration of the Taurus‚ÄìLittrow valley. Their first EVA alone was more than three times the length astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent outside the LM on Apollo 11. During this time Cernan and Schmitt covered more than using the Lunar Roving Vehicle and spent a great deal of time collecting geologic samples (including a record 34 kilograms (75 lb) of samples, the most of any Apollo mission) that would shed light on the Moon's early history. Cernan piloted the rover on its final sortie, recording a maximum speed of , giving him the unofficial lunar land speed record. As Cernan prepared to climb the ladder for the final time, he spoke these words, currently the last spoken by a human being standing on the lunar surface: Cernan's status as the last person to walk on the Moon means Purdue University is the alma mater of both the first person to walk on the Moon‚ÄîNeil Armstrong‚Äîand the most recent. Cernan is one of only three astronauts to travel to the Moon on two occasions; the others being Jim Lovell and John Young. He is also one of only twelve people to have walked on the Moon. ===Post-NASA activities=== Eugene Cernan at a memorial service for Neil Armstrong September 13, 2012 In 1976, Cernan retired from the Navy with the rank of captain and went from NASA into private business, becoming Executive Vice President of Coral Petroleum Inc. before starting his own company, The Cernan Corporation, in 1981. In 1981 and 1982 Cernan joined Frank Reynolds and Jules Bergman on the extensive ABC coverage of the first 3 space shuttle launches. Many hours of these ABC broadcasts have been uploaded to YouTube in recent years. From 1987 he was a contributor to ABC News and the weekly segment of its Good Morning America program titled \\"Breakthrough\\", which covered health, science, and medicine. In 1999, with co- author Donald A. Davis, he published his memoir The Last Man on the Moon, which is about his naval and NASA career. He is featured in the space exploration documentary In the Shadow of the Moon in which he said, \\"truth needs no defense\\" and \\"nobody can take those footsteps I made on the surface of the Moon away from me\\". Cernan also contributed to the book of the same name. Cernan and Neil Armstrong testified before U.S. Congress in 2010 in opposition to the cancellation of the Constellation program, which had been initiated during the George W. Bush administration as part of the Vision for Space Exploration with the aim of returning humans to the Moon and eventually Mars, but was deemed underfunded and unsustainable by the Augustine Commission in 2009. Cernan paired his criticism of the cancellation of Constellation with expressions of skepticism about Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) and Commercial Crew Development (CCDev), NASA's planned replacements for that program's role in supplying cargo and crew to the International Space Station. Such companies, Cernan warned, \\"do not yet know what they don't know.\\" Cernan's view of commercial space companies‚Äîin particular SpaceX, which participates in both programs‚Äîunderwent a positive shift after being debriefed by SpaceX venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson as part of his effort to obtain the signatures of nine Apollo astronauts on a photograph meant as a gift to SpaceX founder Elon Musk to commemorate the first successful SpaceX cargo mission to the ISS in 2012. Eventually, Cernan was won over and signed the photograph; \\"As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning.\\" Jurvetson wrote; \\"He found a reconciliation: 'I never read any of this in the news. Why doesn't the press report on this?'\\" In 2014, Cernan appeared in the documentary The Last Man on the Moon, made by British filmmaker Mark Craig and based on Cernan's 1999 memoir of the same title. The film received the Texas Independent Film Award from Houston Film Critics Society and the Movies for Grownups Award from AARP The Magazine. ===Personal life=== Cernan was married twice and had one daughter. His first wife was Barbara Jean Atchley, a flight attendant for Continental Airlines, whom he married in 1961. They had one daughter, Tracy (born in 1963). The couple separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981. They remained friends. His second marriage was to Janis Nanna Cernan, which lasted for nearly 30 years from 1987 until his death. Cernan gained two step-daughters, Kelly and Danielle. ====Death==== Cernan died in a hospital in Houston on January 16, 2017, at the age of 82. His funeral was held at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston. He was buried with full military honors at Texas State Cemetery, the first astronaut to be buried there, in a private service on January 25, 2017. ==Organizations== Cernan was a member of several organizations: Fellow, American Astronautical Society; member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots; member, Tau Beta Pi (National Engineering Society), Sigma Xi (National Science Research Society), Phi Gamma Delta (National Social Fraternity), and The Explorers Club. ==Awards and honors== * Naval Aviator Astronaut Insignia * Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Gold star device in lieu of second award * Distinguished Flying Cross * National Defense Service Medal * NASA Distinguished Service Medal * NASA Exceptional Service Medal * Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, 2007 * U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame * : Grand Officer (or 2nd Class) of the Order of the White Double Cross (September 25, 1994).Slovak republic website, State honours : 2nd Class (click on \\"Holders of the Order of the 2nd Class White Double Cross\\" to see the holders' table) * Great American Award, The All-American Boys Chorus, 2014 * Cernan was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum in 2007. * Orbital ATK announced the naming of its Cygnus CRS OA-8E Cargo Delivery Spacecraft the S.S.

Cernan, along with nine of his Gemini astronaut colleagues, was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982. ==In popular culture== lunar space suit on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. On July 2, 1974, Cernan was a roaster of Don Rickles on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast. At the end of the roast, Rickles‚Äîwho attended the Apollo 17 launch‚Äîpaid tribute to Cernan as a \\"delightful, wonderful, great hero\\". In the 1998 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, Cernan was portrayed by Daniel Hugh Kelly. Cernan was featured in the Discovery Channel's 2008 documentary miniseries When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions, talking about his involvement and missions as an astronaut. A popular belief is that Cernan wrote his daughter's initials on a rock on the Moon, Tracy's Rock. The story, and Cernan's relationship with his daughter, was later adapted into \\"Tracy's Song\\" by pop-rock band No More Kings. The story is inaccurate, as Cernan wrote her initials in the dust, not on a rock. He states in the 2014 documentary The Last Man on the Moon that he wrote them in the lunar dust as he left the rover to return to the LEM and Earth. The true story of leaving the initials on the lunar surface was prominently mentioned in \\"The Last Walt\\", a 2012 episode of Modern Family. A recording of Cernan's voice during the Apollo 17 mission was sampled by Daft Punk for \\"Contact\\", the last track on their 2013 album Random Access Memories. Cernan's last words from the lunar surface, along with Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt's recollections, were used by the band Public Service Broadcasting for the song Tomorrow, the final track of their 2015 album The Race for Space. ==See also== * List of spaceflight records * Cernan Earth and Space Center, a public planetarium on the campus of Triton College in River Grove, Illinois named in Cernan's honor. * The Astronaut Monument ==References== ==External links== *Interview with Gene Cernan for NOVA series: To the Moon WGBH Educational Foundation, raw footage, 1998 *Gene Cernan flies the Windows-based \\"Eagle Lander 3D\\" Simulator *Cernan at Encyclopedia of Science *Check-Six.com - The 1971 Crash of Gene Cernan's Helo * * Category:1934 births Category:2017 deaths Category:1966 in spaceflight Category:1969 in spaceflight Category:1972 in spaceflight Category:Apollo 10 Category:Apollo 17 Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:American aerospace engineers Category:American astronauts Category:American autobiographers Category:American electrical engineers Category:American people of Czech descent Category:American people of Slovak descent Category:Apollo program astronauts Category:Aviators from Illinois Category:Grand Officers of the Order of the White Double Cross Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:Naval Postgraduate School alumni Category:People from Bellwood, Illinois Category:People from Maywood, Illinois Category:People who have walked on the Moon Category:Purdue University alumni Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the NASA Exceptional Service Medal Category:United States Astronaut Hall of Fame inductees Category:United States Naval Aviators Category:United States Navy astronauts Category:United States Navy officers Category:Engineers from Illinois Category:Project Gemini astronauts ","title":"Gene Cernan"},{"id":"300534","text":"In transition from non-breeding to breeding plumage The Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva) is a medium-sized plover.

The species name fulva is Latin and refers to a tawny colour. The 23‚Äì26 cm long breeding adult is spotted gold and black on the crown, and back on the wings. Its face and neck are black with a white border, and it has a black breast and a dark rump. The legs are black.

The Pacific golden plover is smaller, slimmer and relatively longer-legged than the European golden plover, Pluvialis apricaria, which also has white axillary (armpit) feathers. Overall, the Pacific golden plover is found to be more similar to the American golden plover, Pluvialis dominica, with which it was once considered conspecific as \\"lesser golden plover\\".Sangster, George; Knox, Alan G.; Helbig, Andreas J. & Parkin, David T. (2002): Taxonomic recommendations for European birds . Ibis 144(1): 153‚Äì159. The Pacific golden plover is slimmer than the American species, has a shorter primary projection, longer legs, and is usually found to have more yellow on the back. This wader forages for food on tundra, fields, beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. It eats insects and crustaceans and some berries. The breeding habitat of Pacific golden plover is the Arctic tundra from northernmost Eurosiberia into western Alaska. It nests on the ground in a dry open area. It is migratory and winters in south Asia and Australasia. A few winter in California and Hawaii, USA. In Hawaii, the bird is known as the k≈çlea, and in New Zealand it is known to MƒÅori as kuriri. It is very rare vagrant to western Europe. They return to the same wintering territory each year, which allowed scientists in Hawaii to attach tiny light level geolocator devices to the birds and then retrieve them the following year in the same location. This research revealed that these birds make the 4800 km non-stop flight between Alaska and Hawaii in 3‚Äì4 days. ==References== ==External links== * Pacific golden plover Category:Birds of the Arctic Category:Native birds of Alaska Category:Birds of North Asia Category:Birds described in 1789 Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Pacific golden plover"},{"id":"300539","text":"Human alphaherpesvirus 3 (HHV-3), usually referred to as the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is one of nine herpesviruses known to infect humans. It causes chickenpox (varicella), a disease most commonly affecting children, teens, and young adults, and shingles (herpes zoster) in adults; shingles is rare in children. VZV infections are species-specific to humans, but can survive in external environments for a few hours. VZV multiplies in the lungs, and causes a wide variety of symptoms. After the primary infection (chickenpox), the virus lies dormant in the nerves, including the cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic ganglia. Many years after the person has recovered from chickenpox, VZV can reactivate to cause neurological conditions. ==Epidemiology== Primary varicella zoster virus infection results in chickenpox (varicella), which may result in complications including encephalitis, pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), or bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis). Even when clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person (virus latency), in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. VZV enters through the respiratory system. Having an incubation period of 10‚Äì21 days, averaging at 14 days. Targeting the skin and peripheral nerve, the period of illness is from 3 to 4 days. 1‚Äì2 days before the rashes appear is when this virus is the most contagious. Some signs and symptoms are vesicles that fill with pus, rupture, and scab before healing. Lesions tend to stay towards the face, throat, and lower back sometimes on the chest and shoulders. Shingles usually stay located around the waist. In about 10‚Äì20% of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, producing a disease known as shingles or herpes zoster. VZV can also infect the central nervous system, with a 2013 article reporting an incidence rate of 1.02 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Switzerland, and an annual incidence rate of 1.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Sweden. Other serious complications of varicella zoster infection include postherpetic neuralgia, Mollaret's meningitis, zoster multiplex, and inflammation of arteries in the brain leading to stroke, myelitis, herpes ophthalmicus, or zoster sine herpete. In Ramsay Hunt syndrome, VZV affects the geniculate ganglion giving lesions that follow specific branches of the facial nerve. Symptoms may include painful blisters on the tongue and ear along with one sided facial weakness and hearing loss. If infected during initial stages of pregnancy severe damage to the fetus can take place. Reye‚Äôs syndrome can happen after initial infection, causing continuous vomiting and signs of brain dysfunction like extreme drowsiness or combative behavior. In some cases, death or coma can follow. Reye‚Äôs syndrome mostly affects children and teenagers, using aspirin during infection can increase this risk. ==Morphology== VZV is closely related to the herpes simplex viruses (HSV), sharing much genome homology. The known envelope glycoproteins (gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL) correspond with those in HSV; however, there is no equivalent of HSV gD. VZV also fails to produce the LAT (latency-associated transcripts) that play an important role in establishing HSV latency (herpes simplex virus). VZV virions are spherical and 180‚Äì200 nm in diameter. Their lipid envelope encloses the 100 nm nucleocapsid of 162 hexameric and pentameric capsomeres arranged in an icosahedral form. Its DNA is a single, linear, double-stranded molecule, 125,000 nt long. The capsid is surrounded by loosely associated proteins known collectively as the tegument; many of these proteins play critical roles in initiating the process of virus reproduction in the infected cell. The tegument is in turn covered by a lipid envelope studded with glycoproteins that are displayed on the exterior of the virion, each approximately 8 nm long. ==Genomes== The genome was first sequenced in 1986. It is a linear duplex DNA molecule, a laboratory strain has 124,884 base pairs. The genome has 2 predominant isomers, depending on the orientation of the S segment, P (prototype) and IS (inverted S) which are present with equal frequency for a total frequency of 90‚Äì95%. The L segment can also be inverted resulting in a total of four linear isomers (IL and ILS). This is distinct from HSV's equiprobable distribution, and the discriminatory mechanism is not known. A small percentage of isolated molecules are circular genomes, about which little is known. (It is known that HSV circularizes on infection.) There are at least 70 open reading frames in the genome. There are at least five clades of this virus. Clades 1 and 3 include European/North American strains; clade 2 are Asian strains, especially from Japan; and clade 5 appears to be based in India. Clade 4 includes some strains from Europe but its geographic origins need further clarification. ==Evolution== Commonality with HSV1 and HSV2 indicates a common ancestor; five genes do not have corresponding HSV genes. Relation with other human herpes viruses is less strong, but many homologues and conserved gene blocks are still found. There are five principal clades (1‚Äì5) and four genotypes that do not fit into these clades. The current distribution of these clades is Asia (clades 1,2, and 5) and Europe (clades 1, 3 and 4). Allocation of VZV strains to clades required sequence of whole virus genome. Practically all molecular epidemiological data on global VZV strains distribution are obtained with targeted sequencing of selected regions. Phylogenetic analysis of VZV genomic sequences resolves wild-type strains into 9 genotypes (E1, E2, J, M1, M2, M3, M4, VIII and IX). Complete sequences for M3 and M4 strains are unavailable, but targeted analyses of representative strains suggest they are stable, circulating VZV genotypes. Sequence analysis of VZV isolates identified both shared and specific markers for every genotype and validated a unified VZV genotyping strategy. Despite high genotype diversity no evidence for intra-genotypic recombination was observed. Five of seven VZV genotypes were reliably discriminated using only four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in ORF22, and the E1 and E2 genotypes were resolved using SNP located in ORF21, ORF22 or ORF50. Sequence analysis of 342 clinical varicella and zoster specimens from 18 European countries identified the following distribution of VZV genotypes: E1, 221 (65%); E2, 87 (25%); M1, 20 (6%); M2, 3 (1%); M4, 11 (3%). No M3 or J strains were observed. Of 165 clinical varicella and zoster isolates from Australia and New Zealand typed using this approach, 67 of 127 eastern Australian isolates were E1, 30 were E2, 16 were J, 10 were M1, and 4 were M2; 25 of 38 New Zealand isolates were E1, 8 were E2, and 5 were M1. The mutation rate for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation rates among the herpesviruses have been estimated at 1 √ó 10‚àí7 and 2.7 √ó 10‚àí8 mutations/site/year, respectively, based on the highly conserved gB gene. ==Treatment== Within the human body it can be treated by a number of drugs and therapeutic agents including acyclovir for the chicken pox, famciclovir, valaciclovir for the shingles, zoster-immune globulin (ZIG), and vidarabine. VZV immune globulin is also a treatment. Acyclovir is frequently used as the drug of choice in primary VZV infections, and beginning its administration early can significantly shorten the duration of any symptoms. However, reaching an effective serum concentration of acyclovir typically requires intravenous administration, making its use more difficult outside of a hospital. ==Vaccination== A live attenuated VZV Oka/Merck strain vaccine is available and is marketed in the United States under the trade name Varivax. It was developed by Merck, Sharp & Dohme in the 1980s from the Oka strain virus isolated and attenuated by Michiaki Takahashi and colleagues in the 1970s. It was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval in 1990 and was approved in 1995. Since then, it has been added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in Australia, the United States, and many other countries. Varicella vaccination has raised concerns in some that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong, possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes. Vaccine coverage in the United States in the population recommended for vaccination is approaching 90%, with concomitant reductions in the incidence of varicella cases and hospitalizations and deaths due to VZV. So far, clinical data has proved that the vaccine is effective for over ten years in preventing varicella infection in healthy individuals, and when breakthrough infections do occur, illness is typically mild. In 2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second dose of vaccine before school entry to ensure the maintenance of high levels of varicella immunity. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved Zostavax for the prevention of shingles. Zostavax is a more concentrated formulation of the Varivax vaccine, designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age. A systematic review by the Cochrane Library shows that Zostavax reduces the incidence of shingles by almost 50%. Shingrix is a V. zoster vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline which was approved in the United States by the FDA in October 2017. The ACIP recommended Shingrix for adults over the age of 50, including those who have already received Zostavax. The committee voted that Shingrix is preferred over Zostavax for the prevention of zoster and related complications because phase 3 clinical data showed vaccine efficacy of >90% against shingles across all age groups, as well as sustained efficacy over a 4-year follow-up. Unlike Zostavax, which is given as a single shot, Shingrix is given as two intramuscular doses, two to six months apart. A herpes-zoster subunit (HZ-su) vaccine has shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults with human immunodeficiency virus. ==History== Chickenpox-like rashes were recognised and described by ancient civilizations; the relationship between zoster and chickenpox was not realized until 1888.Wood MJ. History of Varicella Zoster Virus.Herpes. 2000 Oct;7(3):60‚Äì65. In 1943, the similarity between virus particles isolated from the lesions of zoster and those from chickenpox was noted. In 1974 the first chickenpox vaccine was introduced. ==See also== * Progressive outer retinal necrosis * Simian varicella virus ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chickenpox Category:Varicelloviruses Category:Animal viral diseases ","title":"Varicella zoster virus"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},L={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",L,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(I,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/25.md","filePath":"guide/25.md"}'),H={name:"guide/25.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{F as __pageData,G as default};
