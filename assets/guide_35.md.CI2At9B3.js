The purpose of the Commission was to improve student safety at school by providing plans and recommendations of action designed to meet specific needs, including a range of issues from social-emotional support, school safety infrastructure, and the impacts video games and broadcast media have on violence. Commission members as of 2018 included Voss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions (and later former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker), Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. Formal meetings were hosted by the Commission as were field visits for the purpose of gathering input from experts on relevant subjects. The public also provided input on ways to make schools safer. ==Plan of action== The commission reported that there could not be a one-plan-fits-all because of the many variations in schools across the country; therefore, the Commission's focus while drafting their final recommendations was on school size, structure, and geographic location. The Commission considered input from their meetings as well as field visits and information they acquired from listening sessions. Other considerations critical to their work include input from parents and students, teachers, school administrators, counselors, safety personnel, law enforcement and security professionals, mental health professionals, and other related independent parties. The Commission noted in their report: \\"Implementation of the practices identified in this guide is purely voluntary, and no federal agency will take any action against schools that do not adopt them\\". ==2018 Report== On December 18, 2018, the Commission released its final report consisting of 177 pages \\"detailing 93 best practices and policy recommendations for improving safety at schools across the country\\". The report is wide-ranging with coverage that includes cyber bullying and social and the emotional well-being of students, to improvements in building security. These recommendations were based on current efforts that were working in various states. The report \\"emphasizes the critical need for healthy relationships, caring school communities, and an interconnected citizenry as the main defenses against school violence\\".Michael J. Kaufman, Badges and Incidents: A Transdisciplinary History of the Right to Education in America (2019), p. 188. Among the policy recommendations were proposals for \\"rescinding an Obama-era initiative meant to reduce racial disparities in school discipline\\", which the Commission asserted \\"has made schools less safe by discouraging them from removing dangerous students\\". Recommended steps include \\"threat assessment programs, security improvements, and active shooter drills\\".CQ Researcher, Issues for Debate in American Public Policy: Selections from CQ Researcher (2019), p. 365. The Report was criticized by Democrats, civil rights advocates and gun control activists, who expressed a preference for more stringent gun control laws in response to school violence. ==References== ==External links== * Federal Commission on School Safety webpage * Federal Commission on School Safety Releases Comprehensive Resource Guide for Keeping Students, Teachers Safe at School (December 18, 2018) Category:United States Presidential Commissions Category:2018 establishments in the United States Category:Education policy in the United States ","title":"Federal Commission on School Safety"},{"id":"61592500","text":"On 15 August 2019, 28-year-old police constable Andrew Harper was killed near Sulhamstead, Berkshire, England, whilst in the line of duty. Harper and a fellow officer were responding to a report of burglary, after which Harper was dragged behind a car causing his death. In July 2020, three teenage males were convicted of manslaughter and received sentences of 16 and 13 years' imprisonment. == Background == Andrew James Harper (born 22 March 1991) grew up in Wallingford. He was educated at The Henley College, where he showed an ambition for joining the police. Harper initially joined Thames Valley Police as a special constable in 2010 at the age of 19, before joining as a regular police constable in 2011. He joined Thames Valley Police's road policing unit approximately six weeks before his death, and was based at the force's Abingdon station. On 18 July 2019, Harper married his partner of 13 years, Lissie (née Beckett). They had been expecting to go on their honeymoon in mid- August. == Incident == At 23:17 on 15 August 2019, Thames Valley Police received a 999 call from a property near Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, reporting a burglary-in-progress and theft of a quad bike. Harper and fellow constable Andrew Shaw, who were finishing a surveillance shift in Reading, responded to the call in their unmarked BMW police car. At 23:28, Shaw and Harper happened upon a SEAT Toledo towing the stolen quad bike on Admoor Lane near Bradfield Southend. Harper, the passenger of the BMW, alighted the police vehicle and ran to the suspects' vehicle. In doing so, he was caught in a strap that had been used to tow the quad bike. With the quad bike no longer attached, the suspects drove south-east on Lambden's Hill with Harper \\"lassoed\\" to the rear of the SEAT vehicle. Shaw lost sight of the SEAT but in his pursuit found Harper's stab vest in the road. The SEAT, with Harper still being dragged behind, arrived at the lane's junction with the A4 Bath Road—approximately from where the police came upon the suspects. The SEAT crossed the A4 into Ufton Lane near Sulhamstead, and Harper became disentangled. At 23:30, Shaw received a radio transmission from another responding officer which warned of \\"a body in the road\\"; Shaw replied that he believed the body was that of Harper. Shaw arrived at the location to find another officer tending to Harper, who was pronounced deceased by paramedics at 23:45. The SEAT was later found at Four Houses Corner travellers' site near Burghfield Common by a police helicopter using thermal imaging. == Investigation and legal proceedings == At 00:50 on 16 August, police arrested an 18-year-old male and a 17-year-old male at the caravan site. In a separate operation, a 20-year-old man from Pingewood was arrested on suspicion of murder. A second 17-year-old male was also later arrested. Media reported that in total, 10 males aged between 13 and 30 had been arrested. On 19 August, the 20-year-old was charged with murder. On 17 August, Thames Valley Police's Major Crimes Unit stated that a post mortem performed the previous day gave Harper's cause of death as \\"multiple injuries\\", which was congruent with their theory that he had been \\"caught between a vehicle and the road, and then dragged for a distance\\". The post mortem also showed that Harper had sustained a \\"very severe\\" brain injury; a pathologist stated that it was likely Harper lost consciousness when he fell to the ground. Investigations showed that Harper was dragged in 91 seconds, with the defendants averaging . On 18 September, 18-year-old Henry Long and 17-year-olds Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were charged with murder. A fourth male, a 21-year-old from Basingstoke, was charged with conspiracy to steal a quad bike and subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge. On 19 September, the Crown Prosecution Service said that they had discontinued the case against the 21-year-old. === Trial === The murder trial, presided over by Mr. Justice Andrew Edis, began at the Old Bailey on 10 March 2020. Bowers and Cole—both minors at the time of the offence and originally protected by Section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933—pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal a quad bike but denied manslaughter. Long, who was driving the SEAT, had previously admitted manslaughter and conspiracy to steal a quad bike. All three defendants denied murder. On 13 March, the court heard that all parties agreed that the police constable first to attend to Harper on the A4 did not strike him with his vehicle, contrary to early reports of the incident. The trial was temporarily suspended on 17 and 18 March as a member of the jury was unwell. The trial, which was being held during the COVID-19 pandemic, resumed on 19 March after two of the jurors were discharged because they were self-isolating. On 23 March, along with all other jury trials in England and Wales, the trial was suspended pending a review of operations amid the spread of COVID-19. During this subsequently abandoned trial, Thames Valley Police said they had received intelligence suggesting possible jury intimidation. The police later said that there was not a \\"shred of evidence\\" that the jury had been influenced. A retrial began on 23 June following changes to the UK's COVID-19 lockdown. On 20 July, a juror was discharged after a prison officer reported that she had mouthed \\"bye boys\\" to the defendants in the courtroom. The following day, the 11-person jury retired to deliberate. On 24 July, the three defendants were cleared of murder. Long had pleaded guilty, and Bowers and Cole were found guilty of, manslaughter. Harper's widow had made a victim impact statement and later released an open letter, in which she implored Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel to allow a retrial seeking a murder verdict. On 31 July, Long was sentenced to 16 years and both Bowers and Cole to 13 years in prison. In his summary, on the matter as to whether the jury had been subject to any improper pressure, Edis said \\"To the best of my knowledge and belief there is no truth in that at all\\". Harper's MP, John Howell, had said that he intended to ask for a review of the sentences. === Appeals === On 4 August, the Attorney General's Office confirmed that it had received a request to review the sentences under the unduly lenient sentence scheme. On 19 August 2020, Bowers and Cole launched an appeal against their convictions for manslaughter. On 21 August, the killers sentences were referred to the Court of Appeal after the attorney general considered them to be \\"unduly lenient\\". == Legacy == Harper's funeral was held on 14 October 2019 at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. Members of the public lined the streets to watch the funeral procession, and over 800 people attended the service including Home Secretary Priti Patel and Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran—both of whom later paid respect to Harper in the House of Commons. On 27 October 2019, 5,000 motorcyclists took part in a \\"ride of respect\\" between RAF Benson and Abingdon Airfield. On 28 January 2020, Harper was given a posthumous award by the Police Federation of England and Wales. In June 2020, Thames Valley Police have named the newest horse of their mounted section \\"Harper\\" as a tribute. In August 2020, Harper's widow launched a campaign for a new law which would require life imprisonment for criminals whose actions result in the death of any police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor, or paramedic. Separately, Harper's mother launched a campaign to require killers of police officers to receive minimum jail terms of 20 years. == See also == * List of British police officers killed in the line of duty == Footnotes == == References == Category:2019 deaths Category:2019 in England Category:2020s trials Category:August 2019 crimes in Europe Category:August 2019 events in the United Kingdom Category:British police officers killed in the line of duty Category:Crime in Berkshire Category:Deaths by person in the United Kingdom Category:Deaths in South East England Category:Manslaughter in the United Kingdom Category:Murder trials Category:Sulhamstead Category:Trials in London ","title":"Killing of Andrew Harper"},{"id":"61592513","text":"Rukshyn (; ) is a commune (selsoviet) in Khotyn Raion, Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine.

The goal was to draw people's attention to the 2019 anti-extradition bill movement and the protesters' five demands for government accountability and democratic reform. Organisers estimated that 210,000 people participated. In the early night time hours, Hongkongers joined hands to create a human chain of 50 kilometres long on both sides of Victoria Harbour, along the three main MTR lines and over the top of Lion Rock, without any disruptions to traffic. The action was inspired by the Baltic Way demonstration of 1989, which involved two million people, and contributed to the collapse of Soviet Russian control of the region. == Inspiration == The Baltic Way in Latvia The action was inspired by a similar event that occurred 30 years before, on 23 August 1989. The Baltic Way involved two million people in a human chain across 675 kilometres that linked the capitals of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, serving as a call for restoration of independence from the Soviet Union. On 11 March 1990, within seven months of the Baltic Way, Lithuania became the first Soviet state to declare independence. The independence of all three Baltic states was recognised by most western countries by the end of 1991. The Hong Kong Way idea was posted to the LIHKG forum on 19 August 2019 with the objectives of calling attention to police violence, attracting \\"the focus of international media, to show ... our determination and unity to fight for democracy\\" and \\"in the hopes of more international support.\\" The event was also a peaceful show of unity and solidarity among Hong Kong people, a visual display of community strength in the face of challenges. Many participants wore masks, fearing that attending a peaceful rally could lead to reprisals by authorities or loss of employment as a result of pressures from Beijing. Despite the fears people still turned up. As protesters held hands to form the human chain, many chanted \\"add oil!\\" and \\"Democracy now!\\" == Logistics and organisation == === On the streets === Map of Hong Kong Way Nathan Road, Mong Kok, junction of Shantung Street The Hong Kong Way event was organised from the LIHKG forum, along with real-time Telegram chat groups to assist with the creation of the human-chain. The event took place in the absence of a \\"letter of no objection\\" from the Hong Kong Police Force. Organisers created videos and posters, mapped out the route of the proposed human chain, and they used different Telegram channels for different sections around the city. Organisers billed the event for Friday, 23 August between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. They called on participants to assemble at 7 pm on pavements along the three main MTR lines in Hong Kong – the Tsuen Wan line, Kwun Tong line and Island line — and to hold hands, creating three human chains across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories as a form of peaceful protest. Volunteers were on hand at every MTR station to direct demonstrators along the route to ensure the chain was continuous. Participants stood in single file along pavements. At road junctions, the chain constantly reformed obeying traffic lights, so that vehicular traffic could flow normally. At 9 p.m., demonstrators collectively covered up their right eye with one hand, to symbolise the first-aid worker who had lost an eye due to having been hit by a police bean bag round earlier in August. People were in positive mood, and the demonstration was entirely peaceful, with police keeping a low profile. Participants promptly departed from their positions shortly thereafter. The campaign avoided North Point, which is known to be where many local Fujianese people reside. Democracy activists were previously assaulted by stick-wielding Fujianese residents who had attacked citizens during the previous phase of protests on 5 August. More than 1,000 hikers gathered on top of Lion Rock === Lion Rock === A team of hikers also scaled Lion Rock, a landmark that symbolises to many the spirit of Hong Kong, lighting their trail with torches. The group, initiated on Tuesday, organised separately from the MTR campaign so as not to detract from it. Organisers hoped to send a distinct and separate message of solidarity with the \\"Hong Kong Way\\". It attracted trail runners, hikers, and nature lovers. After getting to the top, they lit up the hilltop so that its outline was visible in many parts of Hong Kong; they sang \\"Glorious Years\\" by Beyond – written about Nelson Mandela's struggle against Apartheid in South Africa, and \\"Below the Lion Rock\\" – the theme song to an iconic television series of the same name. The group also organised a team to check the area the next day and clean up if necessary. == Responses == Some 100 supporters joined hands in Lithuania on the same day to show their solidarity with Hong Kong's protests. Lithuanian lawmaker Mantas Adomėnas, who co-organised the rally with Emanuelis Zingeris, said he was 16 years old when he joined the Baltic Way. He said he was impressed with Hong Kong's struggle for liberty and democracy, having visited the city during the protests in 2014 and also during the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The Chinese central government in Beijing which had been claiming that the wave of protests over the previous 11 weeks was instigated by \\"foreign forces\\", had up to that point stopped short of calling the protests a colour revolution, but mainland scholars agreed that the symbolic reference to the collapse of the Soviet Union was \\"provocative\\" and would add to the government's concerns. ==See also== * 228 Hand-in-Hand rally (Taiwan) * List of August 2019–20 Hong Kong protests * Umbrella Movement * Baltic Way * Hands Across America * Catalan Way ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 in Hong Kong Category:2019–20 Hong Kong protests Category:August 2019 events in China ","title":"Hong Kong Way"},{"id":"61592536","text":"Hinematau Naomi McNeill is a New Zealand academic, are Māori, of Tapuika descent and as of 2019 is a full professor at the Auckland University of Technology. ==Academic career== After a 2007 PhD titled 'Te hau ora o naga kaumatau o Tuhoe: a study of Tuhoe kaumatau mental wellness' at the Auckland University of Technology, McNeill rose to full professor.https://www.komako.org.nz/person/550 == Selected works == * McNeill, Hinematau Naomi. \\"Māori and the natural environment from an occupational justice perspective.\\" Journal of Occupational Science 24, no. 1 (2017): 19–28. * McNeill, Hinematau. \\"Attitudes to family violence: Maori study.\\" Attitudes to Family Violence–A Study Across Cultures (1986). * McNeill, Hinematau. \\"A critical reflection of ethical issues in research.\\" (2008). * McNeill, H.

James Stephens was a Young Irelander and part of the rebellion of 1848 that followed these newspaper closures. He fled to France after the rebellion's failure. In 1856, he returned to Ireland and made connexions with former rebels. Two years later, he founded the Irish Republican Brotherhood (I.R.B.). In 1863, he told friends he was to start a newspaper. With funds through John O'Mahony, founder of the Fenian Brotherhood in the U.S.A., he set up an office at 12 Parliament Street.

Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa was the business manager and James O'Connor his assistant and bookkeeper. It was printed by John Haltigan. Most of the articles were written by O'Leary and Kickham. The first issue came out on Saturday 28 November. Its sympathies were clear: a front-page advertisement offered to ship old copies of the United Irishman and The Irish Felon to any address in the U.K. and editorial content was critical of the political status quo. Superintendent Daniel Ryan of Dublin police's G division (largely concerned with Fenianism), noted the new publication's birth and commented on its low circulation. Plans for a rising in Ireland, hatched in the US, were found at Kingstown station in July 1865: in an envelope was a £500 New York bankers' draft payable to Stephens' brother-in-law. This was handed to Dublin Castle and the link proved to be decisive for what followed. Later, a letter to the Tipperary I.R.B. calling for a nationalist uprising was found by a police informer working for the People, one Pierce Nagle (Nagle had visited British officials while in New York in 1864 and offered his services after being upset by Stephens' manner. He secured his employment at The People from New York). After he provided the information, the offices of the People were raided on 15 September. The last issue came out the following day. The paper was suppressed by the Lord Lieutenant, John Wodehouse; Luby, O’Leary, O’Donovan Rossa and O'Connor were arrested and held at Richmond Bridewell prison. Stephens and Kickham joined them a month later; Stephens escaped from prison on 24 November. A Special Commission was opened on 27th. 41 people were charged: Luby, O'Leary, O'Connor, O'Donovan Rossa and Kickham were charged with the most serious crime of treason felony, first used against the republicans of 1848. Evidence used for the prosecution included the letter found by Nagel and his testimony about Fenian connexions, articles from the People as far back as the first issue, in which Irish Catholic judges including one of the presiding judges, the current Attorney-General and Privy Councillor William Keogh, had been strongly criticised, and a devastating secret document from 1864 written by Stephens and entrusted to Luby granting Luby, O'Leary and Kickham executive powers over the I.R.B.; Kickham was unaware of the document. The conflicts of interest, also with the other judge, (John) David FitzGerald who was involved in the defendants' arrest, were highlighted by the defending counsel, former Tory M.P. Isaac Butt Q.C.. Also noted was the striking - if not unusual - jury- packing (in a mostly-Catholic land, some of the juries involved were entirely Protestant). Luby, O'Leary and O'Connor received sentences of 20 years. O'Donovan Rossa was sentenced to life imprisonment, because of his previous convictions. The frail Kickham, lifelong near-blind and deaf, got 12 years; Judge Keogh praised his intellect and expressed sympathy with his plight, despite having refused his request for a writ of corpus to bring Luby and Charles Underwood O'Connell to his trial concerning his ignorance of the 'executive document', as Luby had already begun his sentence in Pentonville. ==References== Category:Defunct newspapers published in Ireland Category:Publications established in 1863 Category:Defunct weekly newspapers Category:Young Ireland Category:Irish Republican Brotherhood Category:1865 disestablishments ","title":"The Irish People (1863 newspaper)"},{"id":"61592733","text":"Rosa 'Blueberry Hill', (aka Wekcryplag ), is a floribunda rose cultivar, bred by Tom Carruth, and introduced into the United States by Weeks Rose Growers in 1997.

Stewart developed the boat from the West Wight Potter 14, a British design he had bought the US rights to. The design was originally marketed by the manufacturer as the HMS 18. ==Production== The design has built by International Marine in Inglewood, California, United States since 1971 and remained in production in 2019, with more than 1600 completed. ==Design== West Wight Potter 19 West Wight Potter 19 cockpit The West Wight Potter 19 is a recreational keelboat, with a hard chine hull, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a vertically lifting fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. It is equipped with closed cell foam flotation and is unsinkable. The boat has a draft of with the lifting keel extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. The keel is retracted from the cockpit by a winch and fully retracts. The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The galley consists of a sink to port and single-burner butane stove to starboard. There is sleeping accommodation for four people and seating for five and a potable head. The manufacturer claims the boat can be rigged and launched from its trailer in 45 minutes and can also be single-handly rigged and launched. ==Operational history== A 2008 review by John Kretschmer noted, \\"while plenty of Potters have made impressive passages, most are sailed quietly on lakes, bays and coastline all over the country. Most importantly, they're almost universally admired by the folks who own them, and for good reason. The boat is stable in the water, it can stand up to a breeze, it's surprisingly commodious, it's easy to launch and can be trailed behind almost any vehicle. Mounted on its trailer the West Wight Potter 19 fits snugly in most garages, which eliminates the cost of dockage and winter storage.\\" Mike Brown wrote a review of the design in 2009, stating, \\"it might not have the catchiest of names, but I found everything else about the West Wight Potter 19 delightful ... I am completely sold on the Potter 19, and I despair for the taste of our boating population if it does not sell in numbers. It was one of the few review boats I had to be politely ejected from. I did not want to go home.\\".

At room temperature, it is a white, flaky solid. 1-pentadecanol is a long-chain fatty alcohol, identical to pentadecane with one of its terminal hydrogen atoms replaced by a hydroxy group. It is an achiral molecule. The Shell corporation uses a proprietary process for the synthesis of 1-pentadecanol (referring to it by the trade name Neodol 5) via hydroformylation of olefins produced from ethylene. Like other long-chain primary alcohols, it is used as an ingredient in industrial chemicals, lubricating oils, and consumer products such as lotions and creams. Additionally, it can be used as a feedstock for processes that use ethoxylation and sulfation reactions to produce surfactants. In 2008, a synthesis of pachastrissamine (a cytotoxic lipid compound found in sea sponges) was described starting from 1-pentadecanol. Compared to other 1-alkanols (1-nonanol, 1-undecanol, and 1-tridecanol), 1-pentadecanol possesses lower solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide, consistent with a general trend of decreased solubility in alcohols with longer chains.

G. C. Bierer, was a judge in Oklahoma Territory who served as an Associate Justice of the Territorial Supreme Court between 1894 and 1898. ==Early life and education== Bierer was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania on October 24, 1862 to a family of German descent. His father was Everard Bierer (1827–1910) and his mother was Ellen (née Smouse) Bierer (1832–1913).Who's Who in Law, Vol. 1. (1937).p.79 Accessed February 17, 2020.}\\"Andrew Gordon Curtis Bierer.\\" Find A Grave. March 7, 2010. Accessed August 23, 2019. His father and grandfather were both staunch Democrats and passed their political beliefs down to the son and grandson. The family migrated to Hiawatha, Kansas in 1865, where young Bierer was raised and graduated from high school.\\"Hon. A. G. C. Bierer, A. M.\\" Medico-legal Journal. vol. 27, No. 1. June 1909. p. 80. Accessed August 23, 2019. After completing high school, Bierer began studying law. He was then admitted to the bar, then enrolled in the Georgetown University Law School in the District of Columbia, where he earned the Master of Arts degree in law in 1886. Moving to Garden City, Kansas, he built up a law practice (Brown, Bierer and Cotteral) and married Miss Nannie Stamper in 1888. In 1887, he ran for the position of Judge of the District Court. He was appointed city attorney for Garden City in 1889 and served until he moved to Guthrie, Oklahoma (then known as Oklahoma Territory) in 1891. ==Oklahoma Territory Supreme Court== Bierer was appointed as City Attorney shortly after moving to Guthrie, and served for one year. He then established the law firm Bierer and Cotteral, which became noted for the number of its members who went on to occupy high judicial positions. Bierer himself was appointed an associate justice of the Oklahoma Territory Supreme Court in 1894, for a term ending in 1898. James R. Keaton, who succeeded Bierer as head of the law firm, was also appointed to the Supreme Court in 1896. John H. Cotteral, the junior partner, was appointed United States District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma in 1907. Bierer stepped down from the court on February 16, 1898. He was succeeded by Bayard T. Hainer of Guthrie. ==Post Supreme Court== According to author Michael J. Hightower, Bierer was a stockholder and attorney for the Bank of Indian Territory in 1911, when he got into a physical confrontation with a number of state banking inspectors who dropped in one morning to demand an emergency audit. Otherwise they would close the bank. Bierer called them, \\"... a set of thieves and burglars, and I dare you to try to close this bank.\\"Hightower, Michael J. Banking in Oklahoma 1907-2000. University of Oklahoma Press: Norman. . 2014. p. 72. Accessed September 14, 2019. Assistant State Banking Commissioner, R. L. Garnett, who was part of the group, attached a closure notice to the cashier's window and announced, \\"This bank is closed.\\" Bierer swore again, ripped down the notice and stuffed it into his pocket. Unsure what to do with this man who was ready to defend his business with fisticuffs, the group apparently left without the audit it had demanded. After his term on the Supreme Court expired, Bierer returned to private business, working with Frank Dale, another former justice of the Oklahoma Territory Supreme Court. In 1925, A. G. C. Bierer joined with his son, A. G. C. Bierer Jr., to form a new law firm, Bierer and Bierer, in Guthrie. ==Death== Judge Bierer died at his home in Guthrie on February 21, 1951. His survivors were: A. G. C. Bierer Jr. (son) Mrs. Horace Taylor (daughter), and two grandsons, A. G. C. Bierer III and Alva McDonald Bierer.

Securities & Exchange Commission, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court upheld the constitutionality of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, . On March 28, 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the constitutional dispute between the Electric Bond and Share Company and the SEC over the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The Act gave the SEC authority to regulate electric companies nationwide and enforce its rules. It required that all companies selling gas and electricity in the United States register with the SEC and restricted holding companies to one or two tiers of subsidiaries. The Act also gave the SEC the power to limit holding companies to a geographic area so that individual states could regulate them. After the Act was signed into law on August 26, 1935 the electric industry contested the validity of the entire act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 79 et seq., as being in excess of the powers granted to Congress by section 8 of article 1, and in violation of section 1 of article 1 and of the Fifth and Tenth Amendments, of the Constitution of the United States. On November 26, 1935, the SEC filed its test case in the District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCo). Fourteen of EBASCo's subsidiaries were also petitioners in the case. ==Background== In 1914, as a tactic to counter the growing support of public ownership of electric companies, the Vice President of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, August Hockenbeamer, came up with the idea of selling non- voting securities (stocks) to the public, something theretofore not done in the industry. The National Electric Light Association openly promoted the idea of selling securities regularly to its members, documenting its historic growth, as part of its ongoing public-relations campaign, as later documented in the FTC's 1928-35 Investigations. The FTC's Investigations found serious flaws in how Holding companies were used to manipulate public investors in the electric industry that led to the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was passed by the 74th United States Congress as major New Deal reform legislation. Also known as the Wheeler-Rayburn bill, it subjected U.S. holding companies for the first time to federal regulation. The law gave the SEC the authority to require registration of electric holding companies and lock them down geographically so that they were no longer able to evade state public utilities commissions. It also gave the SEC the power to force holding companies down to just two levels of subsidiaries or break them up. On November 26, 1935, the SEC filed its test suit against the EBASCo. that included 14 of EBASCo's subsidiaries. The SEC won the initial test case in the Southern District Court of New York. Industry opponents then appealed the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that also upheld the law.Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, Robert E. Healy, was the general counsel for the Federal Trade Commission that carried out the 1928-35 investigation of the electric industry. The investigation produced detailed recommendations for what the Public Utility Act should do to fix the growing concentration of holding companies. He was appointed by President Roosevelt to be a SEC commissioner when that agency was formed, which was the federal agency given the task of enforcing the Act. Franklin D. Roosevelt also appointed him to be a member of his National Power Policy Committee that wrote the legislation that congress passed on August 24, 1935. Healy picked Benjamin V. Cohen to be the principal author of the Act. Cohen, who received a Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard, became a member of President Roosevelt's \\"Brain Trust\\" at the suggestion of Felix Frankfurter. Cohen had also worked for Louis Brandeis. In his 2003 book, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. labeled the Public Utility Company Act as \\"neo-Brandeisian\\". At the time when Schlesinger used the term neo-Brandeisian, he was referring to the historic ideas of supreme court justice Louis Brandeis' views on United States antitrust law. List of constitutional challenges against PUHC Act and SEC 1938According to the SEC's 1936 annual report, once the enabling legislation passed the U.S. Attorney General, U.S. Postmaster General, and the Commission announced that they would \\"not enforce any criminal penalties of the Act until the constitutionality of the law had been established by the Supreme Court in a civil suit\\". In the meantime, electric companies across the United States started filing suit against the law's passage. On November 26, 1935, the Commission filed its test case against the Electric Bond and Share Company in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. On December 7, 1935, the U.S. Attorney General and the SEC made a motion to stay all lawsuits that the electric industry had already filed in the D.C. District Court against the Act. The Court ruled in its favor on January 9, 1936. However, on June 22nd, 1936, the U.S. Court of Appeals, reversed the decision because the lawsuits were not all identical. By June 30, 1936, the number of industry lawsuits against the SEC jumped to 58. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the SEC on January 29, 1937. On November 8th, 1937, the Second Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of the Commission. Members of the Supreme Court in 1938 By 1938, thirty-nine of the other fifty-one cases were still active. On March 28, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case in favor of the SEC, only one of the other cases had been ruled on. That case was Burco v. Whitworth, 297 U.S. 726 (1936), which lost. All of the other cases were dropped after the Supreme Court decision. The 1938 decision was decided by the Hughes Court that had held sway during the Great Depression and the New Deal. The Court had been dominated by four conservatives known as the \\"Four Horsemen\\" that had struck down many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies. However, two of the horsemen, Willis Van Devanter and George Sutherland left the court prior to the case being heard. One of the new judges, Hugo Black, who was a Senator in 1935, played a key role in the Act's passage In 1941 Robert E. Healy gave a speech that included a summary of the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act as well as the events before and after its passage. He stated that the passage of the Act gave the SEC the authority to regulate electric holding companies and protect investors. Mr. Healy addressed the industry's attempt to terrify the general public about section 11 of the act during debate in congress and that it would \\"destroy the utility industry\\". Instead section 11, he said was \\"akin to the philosophy of the Sherman Act\\" and \\"the utility house is being set in order\\" based on the findings and recommendations of the 1928-1935 Federal Trade Commission Investigation. ==Judgment== The case was heard before the U.S. Supreme Court from February 7–9, 1938. Lawyers for Ebasco included former Solicitor General of the United States Thomas D. Thacher and John F. MacLane from the law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, with Frank A. Reid and A.J.G. Priest of the law firm Reid-Priest also taking part in the brief, for petitioners. United States Assistant Attorney General Robert H. Jackson and Benjamin V. Cohen, with whom United States Attorney General Cummings, Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed, Assistant Solicitor General Bell, and Allen E. Throop (SEC General Counsel), Thomas G. Corcoran, Paul A. Freund, John J. Abt, and Frederick B. Wiener were on the brief, for the government. U.S. Solicitor General Stanley Reed was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court on January 25, 1938. He took part in presenting the case to the Court, but stepped aside in the case's decision. Cohen and Corcoran were the principal authors of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. EBASCo. claimed that sections 4(a) and 5 of the Act which required holding companies to register with the SEC violated the Fifth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution. The Southern District Court of New York ruled in favor of the government as did the appeals court. EBASCo claimed that the U.S. Congress had no right to regulate its interstate activities, but both the court and the Federal Trade Commission investigation between 1928-35 documented that it had been selling services, securities and energy across state lines. Ebasco's core strategy/claim that if any section of the act were in violation, the whole Act should be thrown out. In his opinion, released on March 28, Chief Justice Hughes denied the defendant's argument as well as the Ebasco's attempt to block the Act from obtaining financial information to protect investors. On Page 441-2 of the decision, Chief Justice Hughes quoted directly from the act and why Congress wanted to federal supervision of electric holding companies. It summarized the activities of Holding Companies and that the many tiered subsidiaries made effective state control of its interstate activities difficult \\"if not impossible\\" to regulate. He also stated that \\"the national interest and the interest of investors and consumers may be adversely affected\\". His opinion was in favor of the Act and that the parts of it relating to registration of utility holding companies were constitutional. On March 28, 1938, Chief Justice Hughes wrote the majority opinion in favor of the SEC. There was no written dissent from Justice McReynolds. Once again, Ebasco attempted to challenge the constitutionality of the Act's Section 11 but on November 25, 1946, the Supreme Court ruled 6-0 in favor of the Act and the SEC (see American Power & Light Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission 1946). Standard And Poor's Outlook, No. 39, P. 462. dated 1943 made the following comment on the Act: \\"... there is no denying that [SEC policy] has helped investors by improving the financial status of many subsidiaries of utility holding companies...\\" In 1946 the University of Pennsylvania Law Review published \\"A Death Sentence or a New Lease On Life? A Survey Of Corporate Adjustments Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act\\" By Robert M. Blair-Smith and Leonard Helfenstein (pg 148-201). Their piece documented the process of how the SEC oversaw the reorganization the United Light and Power Company and its 75 subsidiaries (pg 161-188) over a ten-year period with the goal of protecting public investors. Their conclusion was that: \\"...the Commission under Section 11 has been to eliminate or reduce the leverage feature in equity securities of holding-company systems, to bring sound equity securities out of system portfolios into the public markets in place of the relatively weak and speculative securities of the holding companies...\\" Their study also said: \\"Between the end of 1935 and June 30, 1944, holding companies divested themselves of 266 companies with assets of over 3 3/4 billion dollars.\\" == Subsequent developments == * North American Co. v.

He was a student of Kala Bhavana between 1940 and 1946. He started his working life at Delhi Polytechnic and went to become principal of Lucknow College of Arts and Crafts. Thereafter, he returned to Kala Bhavana first as a professor and later as its principal. He retired in 1978 and settled down in Santiniketan. At Santiniketan, the ideas of Rabindranath Tagore on art and teaching continued for a long time as a monumental model. Subsequently, there developed in the art arena of Santikietan the three pillars of ideas – Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee and Ramkinkar Baij. They together raised Santiniketan to a level of unique eminence in the field of modern art in pre-independence India. In the post-independence period, the revivalist idiom of the Bengal School of Art was discarded and a new momentum was visible in the works of many artists. Dinkar Kowshik was a prominent name in the star-studded group. Protest is the very core of the modern vision in contemporary art. Amongst the other prominent names associated with the art arena at Santiniketan in the post- independence era are K.G. Subramanyan and Somnath Hore. As principal of Kala Bhavana, Dinkar Kowshik reshaped it for contemporary art practices. He invited sculptor Sarbari Roy Choudhury, Ajit Chakraborty, graphic artist Somnath Hore and painters Sanat Kar and Lalu Prasad Shaw to join Kala Bhavana as teachers. Amongst the many things he did to revolutionise the institution was to hold Nandan Mela.Nandan Mela celebrates the birth anniversary of Nandalal Bose. “The students involve in various kinds of activities including art stalls put up by the Painting, Sculpture, Ceramics, Graphics, Design and Art History Departments.

He circumnavigated the world before returning to England. ==History== Originally a merchant captain, Eaton commanded the 80-man, 250 ton, 20-gun Nicholas out of London when he sailed for Danish St. Thomas in 1683. After a visit to Cape Verde and a raiding spree along the Brazilian coast (including time spent alongside pirate George Bond), Eaton rounded the Strait of Magellan in early 1684. It was there he met the Cygnet under Charles Swan, who tried to conduct legitimate trade with the Spanish before turning to piracy. Nicholas soon met with the Bachelor's Delight under John Cook (who soon died and was replaced by Edward Davis) and separated from Cygnet. Eaton and Davis sailed together for several months, attacking Spanish shipping off Peru and other settlements. They met at Cocos Island, La Plata, and Juan Fernandez before Davis sailed on alone. Eaton elected to sail west across the Pacific, resupplying at Gorgona then leaving for the East Indies (via Guam), which he reached in early 1685. Some of his men - including chronicler Ambrose Cowley, who had transferred from Davis - deserted at Batavia, while others remained with Eaton to raid local shipping near Canton and Timor. They had captured so much treasure that when their sails were damaged, they fashioned new sails of Chinese silk. One source claims Eaton died after Nicholas reached Madras, where his remaining crew divided: some went ashore while others continued to raid up and down the coast, and still others returned to England aboard Nicholas. Other sources say Eaton survived the trip through the Indian Ocean, eventually returning to London in 1686. Some of Eaton's crew who'd elected to continue their piracy in the Indian Ocean eventually took over an East India Company vessel named Good Hope and convinced its navigator Duncan Mackintosh to serve as their Captain. ==See also== *William Dampier - Another chronicler and navigator who sailed with Cook, Davis, and Swan. ==References== Category:17th-century pirates Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:English pirates Category:Piracy in the Indian Ocean ","title":"John Eaton (pirate)"},{"id":"61593443","text":"The Valley Flyer is a train service run by Amtrak between New Haven, Connecticut and Greenfield, Massachusetts along Amtrak's New Haven–Springfield Line and the Connecticut River Line, owned by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

Bilateral relations between Spain and Cape Verde have always enjoyed good health, following the qualitative leap that occurred with the visit to Madrid of Prime Minister José María Neves in March 2007 the signing of important agreements (framework cooperation agreement on “last generation” migration matters); Political MOU; three international judicial cooperation agreements; MOU for joint surveillance of maritime spaces; IV Joint Cooperation Commission 2007–09, which significantly increases ODA to Cape Verde), and the opening of an Embassy resident in Praia in July 2007. Spain has placed Cape Verde among the priorities of its foreign action in Sub-Saharan Africa for several reasons:Ficha de Cabo Verde Office of Diplomatic Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain. Section: Diplomatic relations. * First, Cape Verde has become a reference in the subcontinent of Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of democratic governance, rule of law, respect for rights and freedoms and dynamism of civil society * Likewise, it is worth highlighting the commitment of Cape Verde in the promotion of sustainable development and the fight against poverty and its progress in economic and social matters.(reflected in its basic indicators and in its access, since January 1, 2008, to the group of middle-income countries). * Spain and Cape Verde have clear and important shared interests, such as the need to intensify cooperation, in order to give an adequate response to the phenomenon of migration, the fight against illicit traffic, the promotion of trade relations or investment Direct in the country. * Likewise, the neighborhood between Cape Verde and Canary Islands, which makes Spain the Member State of the European Union geographically closest to Cape Verde and multiplies the opportunities to intensify relations in Spain economic, commercial, cultural, scientific or educational fields. * Spain and Cape Verde share a long tradition of collaboration in the field of Security and Defense. The main challenges for Cape Verde in matters of security and defense are linked to its status as an island and archipelagic State, its geostrategic position, a crossing point for illegal traffic between Africa, Europe and America and the difficulty of Cape Verdean authorities to effectively control such a geographically dispersed and fragmented territory, taking into account that its territorial sea extends along 58,000 km² of ocean and that the country has 700,000 km² of maritime spaces between territorial sea, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone. == Economic relations == Despite the limited size of its market, the proximity and affinity of the Canary Islands, and the tourist potential of Cape Verde, cause an intense bilateral economic relationship, with Spain being its main trading partner. In this sense, according to the latest INE data for 2014, Spain is the first destination for Cape Verdean exports (67% of the total).Ficha de Cabo Verde Office of Diplomatic Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain. Section: Economic relations. === Commercial relations with the Canary Islands === In 2012, the Canary Islands increased both their exports and their imports with Cape Verde, with €14.6 million exported with a positive annual recovery of 0.9% and with imports that exceeded €182.12 thousand, which has suffered an annual variation 18.9% positive, the main imported item being the corresponding \\"Canned meat or fish\\" with a weight of 37%.AFRICA Infomarket Relaciones comerciales de Cabo Verde == Cooperation == Cape Verde has been a priority country for Spanish cooperation during the term of the III Master Plan 2009 – 2012. The Basic Cooperation Agreement was signed by both countries in 1979, with four mixed commissions being concluded under its framework. In the year 2007 the OTC of Praia was opened. In the IV Joint Cooperation Commission, with an initial validity for the 2007–2009 period, a cooperation volume of €27M per year was committed in non-refundable cooperation. The IV Mixed Commission was extended in September 2010 until the approval of a future partnership framework. The IV Master Plan 2013–2016 provides for the gradual conclusion of the bilateral cooperation program. The evolution of ODA to Cape Verde reflects the high importance accorded to the country for Spanish cooperation (€77 million of net ODA for the period 2007–2011), as well as the widely exceeded compliance with the commitments established in the IV COMIX during Validity: €15.1 million (2007), €15.4 million (2008), €17.6 million (2009), €17.6 million (2010), €11.1 million (2011), 3, € 5M (2012, estimated figure) and 111,800 Euros (2013). The participation of Spain in budgetary support to Cape Verde stands out (more than € 20M in the 2007–2012 period). In 2011, €4.4 million were disbursed, and in 2012 a final disbursement was made for €3 million (compared to the €4.6M initially planned).Ficha de Cabo Verde Office of Diplomatic Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain.

On February 24, 2005, Essa, who was en-route to the movie theater, collapsed behind the wheel, and swerved and bumped into a passing van. She later died at the hospital. Her family immediately suspected Yazeed, who, following questioning by police, fled to Lebanon, and later Cyprus where he was arrested on October 7, 2006. Following a lengthy extradition process, Essa was sent back to the US, and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 20 years on March 9, 2010. == Early life == Rosemarie DiPuccio was born on October 21, 1966 to Rocco and Gee Gee DiPuccio. She became a nurse at the now defunct Mount Sinai Hospital, where she met Yazeed Essa, an ER doctor and businessman, in 1995. At the time, he had been seeing Alexandra Herrera, whom he later left for DiPuccio. They were married on September 11, 1999. Their son Armand was born a year later, and two years after that, a daughter, Lena. Essa was described by her family to be an extremely loving mother, and that the couple seemed to be happy and planning for a third child. == Murder == On February 24, 2005, at around 2 pm, Essa left to go to the movie theater with her sister. Shortly before she left, her husband handed her a calcium supplement, which she took. While driving to the theater, Essa began to feel sick, and called a friend Eva McGregor, telling her that she suspected her illness was due to the calcium pill. Essa then hung up and called her husband, who did not respond. She was only driving 10 mph when she collapsed behind the wheel, grazing a SUV before rolling to a stop. When first responders arrived at the scene, Essa was nearly unconscious and began vomiting in the car before losing consciousness. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 3:02 PM. Her relatives later recalled that her husband was standing apart, emotionless. Later, an email sent by him informing others of his wife's death read simply \\"Just wanted to let you know that Rosie died yesterday in a minor car accident. She will be missed.\\" == Investigation == When Dominic DiPuccio, Essa's brother, called McGregor to inform her of Essa's death, she told him about Essa's call and her suspicions about the pill. McGregor had suspected Essa's husband had tampered with the pills, and confronted him about it at the funeral. McGregor later told a fellow nurse, Christine DiCillo, who called in a tip to the police, who had already begun investigating Essa's death as suspicious. Relatives also recalled that Yazeed was acting very strangely following his wife's death. Refusing offers of help from the family, he instead hired two nannies, Marguerita Montenaz and Michele Madeline. Detective Gary McKee, an investigator on the case, later discovered that Yazeed was having an affair with both women. Following DiCillo's tip, McKee questioned Yazeed about the calcium pills on March 17. Yazeed explained that he had given Essa calcium pills, saying, \\"Two weeks before I was over at my mom's house, and I thought about this as well. My mom had this older woman over and they were talking about osteoporosis and whatnot. And I'd been told Rosie was there that we should probably, you know, she's over 35, she should probably start taking calcium supplements.\\" McKee requested the pills, and Yazeed complied. That day, Yazeed threw a party which was described as a going-away party, before calling his sister Runa at 4 am asking if she could watch the kids, claiming that a friend out-of-state had been in an accident. Then, Yazeed vanished. Four weeks after Essa's death, the toxicology report found that the calcium pills given to Essa were filled with potassium cyanide, confirming police and the DiPuccio's suspicions. The local police then called the FBI, who assigned Phil Torsney to track down Yazeed. == Fugitive == After fleeing, Essa traveled first to Detroit, then into Toronto, Canada, where he flew to Heathrow, before flying to Cyprus and then to Beirut, Lebanon. However, Lebanon did not have an extradition treaty with the US, and so Yazeed was able to live freely, despite the DiPuccio's pleas for Yazeed to return to the states. In Beirut, Yazeed was harboured by Jamal Khalife, a family friend, who provided Yazeed with IDs and safe houses throughout the country. Despite this, Yazeed continued to live lavishly, and was witnessed at several nightclubs and bars. He also began dating 38 year old school teacher Nayla Souki three months after his arrival. On October 7 2006, Yazeed boarded a plane to Cyprus, where he was immediately arrested by Cypriot police upon exiting the plane. Though Cyprus does have an extradition policy with the US, it did not apply in cases in which the death penalty was involved, despite Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason stressing that the death penalty would not be sought. For nearly three years, Yazeed's attorneys pushed back against his extradition until January 2009, when he was finally extradited back to Cleveland to face trial for aggravated murder. == Trial == On January 14, 2009, Yazeed Essa was arraigned before Judge Deena Calabrese. He was charged with aggravated murder. The trial began on January 9, 2010. On March 8, 2010, Yazeed was convicted of aggravated murder, and sentenced to life in prison without parole for 20 years. == Media == The murder was the subject of an episode of 48 Hours.

After the increase in bilateral relations in 2006, the foundations of a relationship were laid down which, having as an epicenter cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration, revolves around the following axes: # Cooperation for the reinforcement of Gambian capabilities in border control matters, which is specified both in the donation of material and in the formation of the Gambian Navy by the Civil Guard. #Increase of official development assistance, especially in vocational training projects, job creation for young people and strengthening the administration. Although Gambia is not included in the 2012 Master Plan, it continues to receive funds invested by AECID in multilateral programs and projects, through the UN system and ECOWAS, as well as U.A. == Economic relations == Bilateral trade relations are very scarce and Spain's trade balance with the Gambia registers a traditional surplus. In business, the volume of business and the Spanish presence in the Gambia are very modest. Spanish exports to the Gambia amounted to 14 million euros in 2015, representing an increase of 40% over the previous year. Among the main suppliers in Gambia, Spain ranked number 5 in the European Union, behind France and the United Kingdom.Ficha de Gambia Office of Diplomatic Information.

It causes disease in channel catfish and blue catfish, and can cause significant economic loss in catfish farms. The disease is endemic in the USA and there are reports of the virus in Honduras and Russia. == Pathology == === Clinical signs === Transmission is both horizontal and vertical. Reservoirs of disease are clinically affected fish and recovered covert carriers.Channel Catfish Virus, reviewed and published by Wikivet accessed 18/08/2011 Disease occurs in fish less than a year old that weigh less than 10 grams. The critical environmental factor is water temperature with the disease occurring during warm weather. Outbreaks are normally seen only in farmed fish. Affected fish have pot-bellied appearance, haemorrhages on the fins and musculature and exopthalmos. Affected fish seem off balance and tend to swim erratically or close to the surface, and eventually sinking to the bottom. Fish that survive the infection have lifelong protective immunity but remain latent carriers of the virus. This is a significant source of disease for vulnerable fish. Increased mortality in young catfish during warm weather, especially after stress, is suggestive of Ictalurid herpesvirus 1. === Diagnosis === The virus can be detected in water containing infected fish and organs of diseased fish by virus neutralisation, fluorescent antibody testing, ELISA, or PCR. FAT and ELISA should be used for diagnosis of clinically infected fish while virus neutralisation or PCR should be used to detect carrier fish. Lesions are seen on the liver, kidney and many other internal organs both histologically and grossly on postmortem examination. === Treatment and control === There is no available treatment. Stress and high stocking-densities should be avoided to reduce disease occurrence. Appropriate quarantine and hygiene measures should be employed to prevent spread of disease. The virus is sensitive to acidic pH, heat, and UV light, and is inactivated by pond mud and sea water. == References == Category:Alloherpesviridae Category:Fish viral diseases ","title":"Ictalurid herpesvirus 1"},{"id":"61594461","text":"Ictalurid herpesvirus 2 (IcHV-2) is a species of virus in the genus Ictalurivirus, family Alloherpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == == External links == * Category:Alloherpesviridae ","title":"Ictalurid herpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61594470","text":"Salmonid herpesvirus 1 (SalHV-1) is a species of virus in the genus Salmonivirus, family Alloherpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == == External links == * Category:Alloherpesviridae ","title":"Salmonid herpesvirus 1"},{"id":"61594475","text":"Intsia palembanica is a species of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae.

Mol Biol Evol == Pathology == Human alphaherpesvirus 2 infects humans, most often as genital herpes. In the United States more than one in six people have the virus. It is primarily a sexually transmitted infection. Human alphaherpesvirus 2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia. Human alphaherpesvirus 2 is periodically shed in the human genital tract, most often asymptomatically. Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle, or hard-to-notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection, so acquiring the virus is possible even if no active blisters or sores are present. In one study, daily genital swab samples found Human alphaherpesvirus 2 at a median of 12–28% of days among those who have had an outbreak, and 10% of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection, with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak (\\"subclinical shedding\\"). In another study, 73 subjects were randomized to receive valaciclovir 1 g daily or placebo for 60 days each in a two-way crossover design. A daily swab of the genital area was self-collected for Human alphaherpesvirus 2 detection by polymerase chain reaction, to compare the effect of valaciclovir versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent, seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital herpes infection. The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo, showing a 71% reduction; 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus 54% of subjects on placebo.

After the years of the international embargo on Libya for Gaddafi's support for terrorism and its weapons of mass destruction program, in 2004 a timid normalization of Libya's relations with the international community began. In 2011 Spain was one of the first countries to position itself in favor of the 17 February revolution, actively supporting it in the political and humanitarian assistance fields.

The Masar Program is a Spanish Cooperation program initiated in June 2012, whose purpose is to accompany democratic governance processes in the Arab World, contributing to the modernization and strengthening of institutions and of the key actors in the development of the rule of law, so that public authorities can respond to the needs of their societies, and civil society can be one of the engines of change. The strategic objective of Spanish cooperation in Libya is to contribute to strengthening the country's capacities in its process of reconstruction and political transition. In 2012, Spain financed a demining program of the MAG NGO and the electoral assistance program of the United Nations Mission in Libya. Within the framework of the Masar program, Libya's Deputy Minister of Justice of Libya, Sahar Banoon, traveled to Spain on 17 June 2013 together with a delegation from his ministry to learn about the Spanish prison system with a view to starting collaboration on prison reform in Libya. The promotion of exchanges at the institutional, business and civil society level between Spain and Libya is one of the main aspects of Spanish cooperation through study visits to Spanish institutions and participation in conferences and seminars organized by institutions such as Casa Árabe, Casa Mediterráneo, and Club de Madrid. In the cultural field, the promotion of Spanish culture and language stands out, with the creation of a Spanish reading place at the University of Tripoli in the 2013–2014 academic year.Ficha de Libia Office of diplomatic information.

It was designed by George Newton Kenworthy and built in 1935 by F. T. Eastment and Sons. It was added as a Heritage Item to the North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013 on 2 August 2013. The architect, George Newton Kenworthy, is known for his work in the Art Deco style, and most particularly his designs for theatres and cinemas including the Enfield Savoy Theatre (alterations 1938), the Majestic Theatre in Port Macquarie (1936), and the Regent Theatre in Mudgee (1935). ==History== View from interior The Italian-Australian Virgona family led by director Angelo Virgona, who had opened the North Sydney Orpheum on the corner of Alfred Street and Junction Street in North Sydney in 1913 and renovated into a more modern style in 1924 (it was resumed in 1968 and demolished for the new Warringah Expressway), commissioned a new cinema further north in the Cremorne area in 1934 with an Art Deco design by prominent architect George Newton Kenworthy. Completed at a cost of over £45,000, the Cremorne Orpheum Theatre was officially opened on 4 October 1935 by the local Member for Neutral Bay, Reginald Weaver. On its opening the Sydney Morning Herald noted that it was \\"designed on strictly modern lines, especially with regard to acoustic response and internal furnishings. It is regarded as one of the most up-to- date structures of the kind in Australia.\\" When it was first opened the theater was also used for stage productions. After a failed attempt to sell the theatre in 1971, it remained a family operated cinema until the Orpheum closed in 1979, a fate shared by many other suburban cinemas across Sydney. However in 1977 it had already been recognised for its heritage value by the National Trust of Australia (New South Wales), and its restoration was undertaken in 1987 led by John Love for a new owner, television personality Mike Walsh, at a cost of $2.5 million The restoration works also transformed the theatre into a multiplex cinema, with the addition of a second screen in the former Ballroom area. Rechristened as the \\"Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace\\", it reopened on 9 December 1987 with the feature Planes, Trains and Automobiles. A third and fourth screens were added in the 1990s and two more were added in 2000 in the place of the former shopping arcade. The 1987 restoration also added a 1925 Wurlitzer pipe-organ that was originally installed in the Wilson Theatre in Fresno, California until 1973, and it is often played at selected film screenings. The cinema, which is a longtime favourite of film critic David Stratton, celebrated its 80th birthday in 2015. ==See also== *Australian non-residential architectural styles ==ReferencesMike Walsh AM OBE Official Website – The Hayden Group (Owner) Category:Cinemas in New South Wales Category:Art Deco architecture in Sydney Category:Theatres in Sydney Category:Theatres completed in 1935 Category:1935 establishments in Australia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1935 Category:Cremorne, New South Wales Category:Entertainment venues in New South Wales Category:North Sydney Council ","title":"Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace"},{"id":"61594818","text":"Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1 (VeGHV-1) is a species of virus in the genus Percavirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Vespertilionid gammaherpesvirus 1"},{"id":"61594821","text":"Ateline gammaherpesvirus 2 (AtHV-2) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Ateline gammaherpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61594833","text":"Grace Hamblin (1 January 1908 – 15 October 2002) served as secretary to both Winston Churchill and Lady Clementine Churchill from the early 1930s, until their deaths. She subsequently served as the first curator at Chartwell, the Churchills' country home in Kent. ==Life== Hamblin was born in Kent in 1908, the daughter of the head gardener at an estate adjacent to Chartwell. Joining Churchill's staff as a junior secretary in 1932, in 1940 she moved with the Churchills to Downing Street, becoming private secretary to Clementine Churchill. Appointed OBE in Churchill's resignation honours list in 1955, she became the first administrator when Chartwell was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1966. Hamblin, together with Lady Churchill and her daughter Mary Soames, were largely responsible for the organisation and arrangement of the house following Churchill's death. Robin Fedden, Deputy Director-General of the Trust and author of the first guidebook to Chartwell, recorded Hamblin's 33 years service to the Churchill family and to the house. Hamblin, famously discreet throughout her life, achieved some notoriety in 2015 when her leading role in the destruction of Graham Sutherland's portrait of Churchill was revealed. Presented to Churchill by the Houses of Lords and Commons as an 80th birthday present, the realistic portrait was detested by both Churchill and his wife and, acting on Lady Churchill's instructions, Hamblin and her brother removed the painting from Chartwell at some point in the mid-1950s and burnt it. Hamblin retired from the post of Administrator at Chartwell in 1973. Hamblin died in her home at Westerham, Kent, which she had bought with funds from the sale of one of Churchill's own paintings, in 2002. A collection of her papers, mainly consisting of notes for speeches she gave about her life with the Churchills, is held at the Churchill Archives Centre at Churchill College, Cambridge. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * ==External links== Category:1908 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Winston Churchill ","title":"Grace Hamblin"},{"id":"61594837","text":"Ateline gammaherpesvirus 3 (AtHV-3) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Ateline gammaherpesvirus 3"},{"id":"61594840","text":"Cricetid gammaherpesvirus 2 (CrHV-2) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Cricetid gammaherpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61594841","text":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 5 (McHV-5) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 5"},{"id":"61594843","text":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 8 (McHV-8) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 8"},{"id":"61594844","text":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 11 (McHV-11) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 11"},{"id":"61594845","text":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 12 (McHV-12) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Macacine gammaherpesvirus 12"},{"id":"61594847","text":"Murid gammaherpesvirus 7 is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Murid gammaherpesvirus 7"},{"id":"61594849","text":"Saimiriine gammaherpesvirus 2 (SaHV-2) is a species of virus in the genus Rhadinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Saimiriine gammaherpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61594879","text":"Santaishan Palaung Ethnic Township () is an ethnic township in Mangshi, Yunnan, China.

The novel describes a period during the 1930s: his last term at school, and the following weeks living in Shanghai, where his father had a business. ==Background== The novel was first published in 1943 by Routledge, and it was his first published book, previously having articles published in periodicals. Edith Sitwell, who had written to Welch that \\"you are a born writer\\"; agreed to accept the book's dedication. At the publisher's suggestion, Welch, who had been an art student, made decorations for the book, included end-papers, a dedicatory page and decorated section numbers.James Methuen-Campbell. Denton Welch: Writer and Artist. Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2004. Page 118. At the time in which the novel is set, the writer's father, Arthur Welch, was a director of Wattie & Co, rubber estate managers in Shanghai. His mother, from Massachusetts, USA, had died in 1927.Introduction by Michael De-la-Noy to Denton Welch, I Left my Grandfather's House. Allison and Busby, 1984. Europeans such as his father lived in the Shanghai International Settlement. When talking with their servants, Pidgin English was spoken; it is often quoted in the novel. The original manuscript, which consists of nine exercise books, was donated to the British Museum (now held by the British Library) by Sir Eric Miller in 1956.Gransden, K. W. (1957) “Denton Welch's ‘Maiden Voyage.’” The British Museum Quarterly, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 31–32In an article for The Guardian, published on 11 April 1975, Michael De-la-Noy refers to an paragraph which the editors at Routledge deleted from the original manuscript (through fear of litigation), in which Welch recalls a train journey where he encountered Lord Alfred Douglas. This passage has never been reinstated in any subsequent editions, although Welch reused some of the material in his next novel, In Youth is Pleasure. ==Summary== The novel is split into three sections, each prefaced in the original text with one of Welch's illustrations. The first (marked \\"0\\" in Welch's drawing) covers his escape from, and last term at Repton School. The second covers his journey to China and the third recounts his yearChapter 34, p. 248 spent there. Instead of travelling from London to Repton, in Derbyshire, the narrator takes a train to Salisbury, which he had once visited with his mother. He goes on to Exeter, and walks to Budleigh Salterton; he visits family acquaintances, who are surprised to see him. Back in Salisbury after a few days, he has no money left, and returns to his relations in London. He returns to school in Derbyshire. Throughout the novel, every feature of his life comes under his calm scrutiny. \\"Haltingly at first the conversation flowed all over the [dining] room; then it gathered volume.... I imagined that everyone was talking about me, and I expect they were....Chapter 5. \\"Getting used to school in those first days was strange. Everyone thought that I had run away for a different reason and so they all treated me differently.\\"Chapter 6. His father, sorry that he had run away from school, suggests in a letter that he come to Shanghai with his elder brother Paul, who is joining the company. \\"I was so full of joy that I ran down the lane and over the fields until I was exhausted. I felt like a person full of power and skill. I was no longer a part of the dead old system. I could bear anything now till the end of term.\\"Chapter 8. He describes his arrival in Shanghai: \\"The water was covered with boats. Junks with coloured sails and great eyes painted on their bows were stuck together with sampans and iron-plated steamers, like a pudding of small sago and large tapioca. The Bund glistened through the masts and funnels. The buildings reminded me of New York, which I had never seen. There were no sky-scrapers, only an uneven terrace of buildings looking huge and majestic in the sun.\\"Chapter 15. The narrator is interested in antiques, and he accompanies a friend of his father, an antiques dealer who is going to Kai-feng Fu on business, stopping en route at Nankin. Travelling by train from Nankin to Kai-feng Fu, \\"I sat looking out of the window at the eternal hills and plains and cities of dried mud. Everything was the same, tawny, earth-brown. Even the city walls were of baked-gold mud which made them look imitation, like the scenery at a searchlight tattoo.\\"Chapter 17. On the day of his departure for Europe, \\"... I hurried into the dining room.... I started to read, hoping to calm my excitement.... I looked up and saw Cook squinting at me through the service-hatch. I seemed so different to myself, that I was not surprised. People were justified in staring at me. I was going away.\\"Chapter 35. ==Critical Response== Contemporary reaction was positive, the striking prose style in particular catching many reviewers' eyes. Writing in The Spectator, Janet Adam Smith identified in the writing an \\"almost painful intensity and immediacy\\", through which the young Denton \\"lives for us in these pages with an almost embarrassing vividness.\\"The Spectator Book Review, 14th May 1943, pp. 456-7 In The Times Literary Supplement, Marjorie Tiltman found an \\"astonishing awareness\\" from \\"an intolerant and clever pen\\", revealing \\"the over-egotism of the sensitive, the self-centeredness of the lonely in spirit, and, almost in spite of himself, awakes the reader's compassion.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 28th August 1943, p. 412 In an observation arrestingly revealing of its era, Tiltman chooses to identify the act of \\"illegally demanding a half-ticket\\" for the Salisbury train in the opening lines of the book as an example of Denton's \\"mis-deeds\\". Robert Phillips notesPhillips, Robert (1974) Denton Welch, New York: Twayne, p. 46 that for some time following publication, many, including some significant bibliographies, took Maiden Voyage to be a work of literal autobiography. However he notes that in selecting, arranging and embellishing details from his life, Welch causes them to \\"lose specifically personal meaning and begin to become universal human materials, elements of works of art\\".Phillips (1974) p. 47 Phillips identifies several themes in the work, all inter-related, which include his attitude towards women following the early death of his mother, and heightened elements of his growing sexual awareness (emphatically not 'awakening'). These are manifested in a number of arresting, highly charged, sometimes violent and often misogynystic images: an encounter with a Phallaceae fungus (or stinkhorn mushroom) at school (p. 83), a violent nightmare involving a woman whose breast has been pierced by a hat-pin (p. 113-14), a boxing lesson from a furniture-mover he has been spying on and during which he takes a beating (p. 226) and an episode where he dresses up in his friend Vesta's frock (including make-up) before heading out into the street, fully aware that he resembles a prostitute (p. 243). Apart from Sitwell, the book was praised by E.M. Forster, Gerard Hopkins and Kenneth Clark, although Forster's initial response to Welch's writing was rather more measured. He later modified his view when he learned of Welch's physical challenges.De la Noy, Michael (1984) Denton Welch: The Making of a Writer, Harmondsworth: Viking, p. 164 ==References== Category:British autobiographical novels Category:1943 British novels Category:Novels set in schools Category:Novels set in Shanghai ","title":"Maiden Voyage (novel)"},{"id":"61594983","text":"Tupaiid betaherpesvirus 1 (TuHV-1) is a species of virus of uncertain generic placement in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== Category:Betaherpesvirinae ","title":"Tupaiid betaherpesvirus 1"},{"id":"61594985","text":"Equid gammaherpesvirus 7 (EHV-7) is a species of virus of uncertain generic placement in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Equid gammaherpesvirus 7"},{"id":"61594987","text":"Phocid gammaherpesvirus 2 (PhHV-2) is a species of virus of uncertain generic placement in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Phocid gammaherpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61594989","text":"Saguinine gammaherpesvirus 1 (SgHV-1) is a species of virus of uncertain generic placement in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ","title":"Saguinine gammaherpesvirus 1"},{"id":"61594994","text":"Iguanid herpesvirus 2 (IgHV-2) is a species of virus of uncertain generic and subfamilial placement in the family Herpesviridae and order Herpesvirales. == References == == External links == * Category:Herpesviridae ","title":"Iguanid herpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61595009","text":"is a Japanese shōjo manga series written and illustrated by Mari Asabuki based on the 2010 arcade game Pretty Rhythm: Mini Skirt.

The film focuses on the Planet of Earth suffering a reversal of polarity, caused by the impact of the comet's fragment in Northern Alaska that sets off its cataclysmic, electromagnetic polar reversal storm. == Plot == The television film opens in a darkened news studio, in which KJRX news anchor, Lou Vanetti broadcasts his final words while smoking on camera, during the final hours of Earth, that the magnetic field is dropping to near-zero levels. Two people, Cynthia (Holly Elissa Dignard) and Shane (Tyler Johnston) explores through a deserted town of Lindenville during the electromagnetic storm, only for the former to be \\"swallowed\\" into the ground due to an earthquake. The film transitions back to one week earlier, when the same news anchor from before; Lou Vanetti, informs the public of worldwide flight grounding during the passing of the electromagnetic-emitting comet above the Earth's atmosphere. Doctor James Mayfield (Jack Coleman), a United States government astrologist and astrophysicist from the Storm Hazards Department (SHD), and his colleague Peter (Nicolas Carella), was sent there in the Arctic Alaska region to track and monitor the comet's status, trajectory, and the computer readings above the atmosphere. The comet suddenly began to fragment, causing a smaller comet; in diameter, travelling over , to detour about 45 degrees, and is on a direct collision course for Earth. SHD colleague, Pam, notices this and tries to warn James and Peter, but due to the electromagnetic interference caused by the comet, they failed to hear her, until they began to make a desperate attempt to escape once they spotted the comet blasting above them. The comet's fragment impacts the northern State of Alaska, generating the shock wave blast that wrought severe damage to Canada, Alaska, and the Russian Far East. James' colleague; Peter, is among the quarter-million of fatalities, with James Mayfield the sole survivor of the impact as he took cover in an avalanche bunker. He returns home in Lindenville, and was displeased by the president's speech (Roger Cross), because of his near-death experience. While at home, their TV suddenly emits static squealing-noises, followed by an unknown Earth tremor. Recognizing the earth's tremor preceded by the EM disturbance, he tries to log in SHD to review the data Peter uploaded during the comet's impact, but his access was blocked and its data was classified by the administration, following the gag order of the whole department. Despite this, he continued his investigation as he became more suspicious when the sun unexpectedly sets at Eagle Peak. James' son, Shane meets Zoe and Kevin at the park, who the latter challenges Shane in drag racing to settle a dispute over who's to repay the damage for a telescope that they broke during a fight earlier that night. As they prepare for a drag race, an electromagnetic interference suddenly occurs, preceded by an earthquake that swallows Kevin and his car. Shane and Zoe makes a run from the park. At the same time, James explains in an interview by Vanetti about the misalignment of the Earth's axis due to a sudden axis tilt, following the cataclysmic events in Alaska. James' findings have received huge attention, and as a result of violating the gag order and censorship by the US government, he was being called by his father, General Mayfield (Terry David Mulligan), to report to the Gilboy Air Base, where James began explaining about the consequences of the earth's axis shift to the General, the President, and Doctor Elman. Later, a 40 Khz- electromagnetic shock wave tears through Lindenville, and around the world, resulting in a worldwide electricity blackout and knocking out communications and killing anyone inside the buildings, inside their cars, and while using electronics. The President declares federal martial law, and orders all civilians to evacuate to emergency shelters, while James instructs his family to leave Lindenville to refuge safety in a town of Little Brook, 40 miles away. While on the road, Shane and Cynthia are forced by members of the U.S. Army to turn back and take shelter in a parish; against James' instructions. Returning to Lindenville, as they find their road blocked on the way, an EMP shockwave and an earthquake forces Shane and Cynthia to bail and run on foot, and they narrowly survived the tremor after Cynthia nearly \\"swallowed\\" into the crevice, before they made their way to the Lindenville Parish. There, she tries to persuade the people inside and the General in-charge to evacuate to Little Brook, but they didn't believe her. Only Michael and Zoe are able to leave the Lindenville Parish with Cynthia and Shane before the electromagnetic shockwave fried everyone inside. While heading for Little Brook, Michael dies of heart attack after when the EMP wave disabled his pacemaker, and after the death of a looter by electrocution by the EMP shockwave as he tried to steal Michael's SUV. Despite the vehicle being fried, Shane was able to turn the vehicle back on by using the EMP wave to ignite the spark plugs and start the engine. At the same time, James & General Mayfield, along with the Russian Navy Captain Yulenkov and his submarine crew, dives and head towards the Mariana Trench, in an attempt to bring the planet back into normal axis tilt, by dropping two nuclear warheads into a large crack in the bottom of the trench. Despite encountering several anomalies on the journey, their combined efforts of cooperation between Russia & the United States became a success as the warheads detonate at the bottom of the trench, and Planet Earth was saved. == Cast == * Jack Coleman as Dr. James Mayfield, a government astrologist & astrophysicist working for the Storm Hazards Research Lab. * Holly Elissa Dignard as Cynthia Mayfield, Shane and Jame's stepmother, and science teacher. * Tyler Johnson as Shane Mayfield, James' son. * Terry David Mulligan as General Mayfield, James' father, who works at the Gilboy Air Base. * Roger Cross as the President of the United States * David Lewis as Lou Vanetti, KJRX News Anchor in Lindenville * Rob Morton as Michael * Emma Lahana as Zoe, Kevin's girlfriend * Nicholas Carrera as Peter, Jame's colleague from the Storm Hazards Department, who was killed by the blast from the comet's impact in Alaska. * Marsha Regis as Pam, working in the Storm Hazards Research Lab. * Scott Lyster as Kevin, Shane's classmate who got into an altercation and was killed at the park during an astronomically-agitated earthquake. * Jay Brazeau as Doctor Elman. * Donovan Cerminara as a U.S. Army Soldier at a roadblock, who ordered Cynthia to turn back and take shelter in the church, despite Cynthia's pleas to flee Lindenville. * Brent Stait as Guard Captain * Kurt Max Runte as Captain Yulenkov, Russian Navy Guard Captain. * Darren Moore as a Looter, who tried to steal Michael's SUV before being fried by the EMP shockwave. == Critical reception == On Rotten Tomatoes, it has no reviews listed (as of August 2020). == References == == External links == * * Category:2009 television films Category:Disaster television films Category:Syfy original films Category:American disaster films Category:American films Category:American science fiction television films Category:Canadian disaster films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian science fiction films Category:Canadian television films Category:CineTel Films films Category:Comets in fiction Category:Films set in Alaska Category:Films set in Washington (state) Category:2000s disaster films Category:2000s science fiction films Category:Impact event films ","title":"Polar Storm"},{"id":"61595116","text":"Sahuwala is a village located in Bhadra, Tehsil, within the Hanumangarh district in the state of Rajasthan, India.

ESPN's relationship with bowling began in 1985, when ESPN aired the 12 Summer Tour events. By 2001, ESPN would provide exclusive coverage of 20 regular-season events and four to six summer telecasts, all on Sundays or Tuesdays. ==History== After the PBA's sale and move of broadcasts to ESPN, most tournaments used a \\"bracketed\\" format. Each bowler bowled nine qualifying games, with the top 64 by pinfall competing in best 4-of-7 head-to-head matches. The four remaining bowlers from match play competed in two semi-final matches (#4 seed vs. #1 seed, and #3 seed vs. #2 seed), followed by a final match of the semi-final winners. A few tournaments still used the stepladder format for the finals. ===The World Series of Bowling=== In a cost-cutting effort, the PBA split the 2009–10 season into two segments. The first, the 2009 World Series of Bowling, consisted of seven PBA Tour events—including one major tournament (PBA World Championship) – held in August and September 2009 in Allen Park, MI, near Detroit.PBA World Series of Bowling website All of the events ran in a split format: the early rounds of each tournament were held on consecutive days in August and September, and ESPN television taped the final rounds for the tournaments on Labor Day weekend (September 5–7). These were aired on seven Sundays, October 25 through December 6, 2009. The second half of the season, running January–April 2010, consisted of 11 traditional touring weekly tournaments, including the remaining three majors. Each event ended with the live ESPN television finals on Sundays. The second half also included three special (non-title) televised events: the Chris Paul PBA Celebrity Invitational, the PBA Experience Showdown, and the PBA Women's Series Showdown. The PBA announced in May, 2010 that it would again cover all of the Fall tournaments for the upcoming season at the World Series of Bowling. The second annual event was held October 24 through November 6, 2010 at South Point Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. It consisted of five title events, qualifying for the PBA World Championship, and one non- title, made-for-TV event. Based on input from players, as well as corporate partner and ESPN television needs, there were some revisions to the series:Vint, Bill. \\"South Point in Las Vegas to Host 14-Day 2010 World Series of Bowling.\\" Article at www.pba.com on May 24, 2010. * All events were \\"open,\\" meaning any PBA member could enter the entire World Series of Bowling via $750 entry fee. There were no Tour Qualifying Rounds or \\"World Series Trials.\\" * Over the first five days (starting October 25) all players bowled 12 games on each of the PBA's five \\"animal\\" oil patterns (Cheetah, Chameleon, Viper, Scorpion and Shark). The Top 16 qualifiers on each pattern advanced to a 9-game match play the following week. Top 5 qualifiers after the match play rounds in each event advanced to the televised stepladder finals, contested on November 5–6 and taped by ESPN for broadcasts on five consecutive Sundays, starting November 28. * The standings after all 60 animal pattern qualifying games also determined the rankings for the PBA World Championship. The World Championship was again be the first major and first live ESPN broadcast of the season, but this time it featured the Top 8 qualifiers bowling over three consecutive days (January 14–16, 2011). * The Top 6 U.S. qualifiers and Top 6 International qualifiers after the 60 animal pattern games competed in a special (non-title) televised event called \\"USA vs. The World,\\" which was taped on November 6 for a January 9, 2011 broadcast. In the 2010–11 season the PBA, for the first time, scheduled three consecutive days of live broadcasts for the PBA World Championship finals, January 14–16, 2011. The format was an 8-bowler stepladder. The 8–7 and 7–6 matches aired Friday night, January 14 on ESPN2; the 6–5 and 5–4 matches aired Saturday night, January 15 on ESPN2; the top four then competed Sunday afternoon, January 16 on ESPN. For the 2011-12 season, a total of 14 TV broadcasts were taped at the 2011 World Series of Bowling in Las Vegas to be aired on later dates. For the first time, the TV finals for the PBA World Championship did not air live. In fact, ESPN only aired the finals of the PBA's three remaining major tournaments (USBC Masters, U.S. Open and Tournament of Champions) in a live 2012 broadcast. All other ESPN broadcasts for Winter 2012 were taped events from the World Series, while four additional non-major title tournaments were available live via the PBA's \\"Xtra Frame\\" webcast service.2011-12 Schedule at www.pba.com For the 2013 World Series of Bowling and into the 2014 season, the PBA began using lane oil that is dyed blue for televised matches, thus helping viewers not only see the pattern layout but also see how the play area changes from game to game. Said ESPN Coordinating Producer Kathy Cook, \\"Until now, one of the most crucial and least understood aspects of the game was invisible.\\" ===In conjunction with ABC (2011)=== The PBA, through its renewed contract with ESPN, returned to ABC for the first time in over thirteen years, as it televised the 2011 Tournament of Champions from Red Rock Lanes in Las Vegas. The event took place on January 22, 2011 in a live telecast, with Rob Stone and Randy Pedersen on the call, and Nelson Burton, Jr. joining them throughout the telecast with reflections on the history of the Pro Bowlers Tour on ABC. The second match of the telecast nearly ended in a perfect game as Mika Koivuniemi defeated Tom Daugherty 299–100. Daugherty broke the old record for the lowest game in PBA History of 129, previously held by Steve Jaros. The match was also the largest differential in PBA history, with a spread of 199 pins. Koivuniemi went on to defeat top seed Tom Smallwood in the final match to take home a PBA-record $250,000 first prize. ===The end of ESPN's package (2018)=== On March 21, 2018, Fox Sports announced that it had acquired the television rights for the PBA Tour, replacing ESPN, with 26 broadcasts on Fox Sports 1 and four on Fox beginning in 2019. Fox's broadcasts total approximately 58 hours, in comparison to the 30 hours of coverage provided by ESPN linear channels in 2018. ==Commentators== The announcers were chosen by the PBA with ESPN's approval, since the PBA produces their own shows, sells the commercials and bought the airtime from ESPN. *Chris Barnes (color commentary) - During the 2006–07 Denny's PBA Tour season, fellow Denny's PBA Tour bowler Norm Duke took part in the ESPN telecasts for events in which he failed to reach the TV Finals. Along with Dave Ryan and Randy Pedersen, he served as a second color commentator. However, during events in which Duke made the TV Finals, Barnes filled in as the third commentator. In the 2011–12 season, Barnes has been the third commentator for several World Series of Bowling finals events, joining Pedersen and Rob Stone. *Nelson Burton Jr. (color commentary) - After leaving ABC, Burton moved to ESPN and spent one year in 1998 providing analysis for select PBA broadcasts. He also was a commentator for the 1998 Women's College Bowling National Championship. He and former NBC bowling announcer Jay Randolph called the action on ESPN2. In August 2007, Burton and Marshall Holman were the broadcasters for the 2007 U.S. Women's Open in Reno, Nevada on ESPN. The early rounds of the event were taped that month and aired every Sunday afternoon over the course of four weeks, starting Sept. 16. The live televised finals aired on Oct. 14, and Liz Johnson won the event. It was Bo's first national broadcasting work in nearly ten years. He also handled the broadcast of the 2008 U.S Women's Open, once again teaming with Holman. Burton Jr. returned to the ABC broadcast booth for the 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions, the first ABC broadcast of a PBA event since 1997.Schneider, Jerry. \\"Nelson Burton Jr. Returns to ABC Sports Broadcast Team for 2011 Tournament of Champions.\\" Article at www.pba.com on November 24, 2011. *Carolyn Dorin- Ballard (laneside reporter) *Cathy Dorin-LizziKramer, Lindsay. \\"Bowling sisters reverse roles at USBC Queens final\\", The Post-Standard, April 27, 2011.

During events in which he made the TV Finals, Chris Barnes filled in as the third commentator. *Mike Durbin (color commentary/play-by-play) - From the early 1980s to 1995, Durbin worked as a color analyst for ESPN alongside play-by-play man Dennis Schreiner. The two called tournaments in the summer and fall, along with senior tour events, while ABC Sports would cover the winter-spring events on the Pro Bowlers Tour, occasionally with Durbin alongside Chris Schenkel. Durbin would occasionally call the ESPN action himself with another analyst, such as Earl Anthony, if Schreiner was out on assignment. Durbin also worked as a commentator for USA Network's occasional bowling telecasts in the 1980s. In 1996, Marshall Holman became the new color analyst for ESPN's coverage, while Durbin took over play-by-play duties. Durbin retired from broadcasting in 1997. *Marshall Holman (color commentary) - Holman served as a color analyst alongside Mike Durbin on several ESPN and ESPN2 bowling telecasts from 1996–2001. After several years out of the booth, Holman has returned to the broadcasting arena. He served as a color analyst at the 2007 USBC Queens tournament and was in the broadcast booth (along with Nelson Burton, Jr.) for ESPN's five-week coverage of the 2007 and 2008 U.S. Women's Open events. He later provided commentary, alongside play-by-play man Dave Ryan, for the 2009 U.S. Women's Open telecasts. *Mike Jakubowski (play- by-play) *Dave Lamont (play-by-play) - From 2016 to 2018, Lamont was the lead play-by-play broadcaster for PBA Tour events on ESPN.https://www.pba.com/articles/Veteran-Broadcaster-Dave-LaMont-Tabbed-as- New-Play-By-Play-Announcer-for-PBA-Tour-Telecasts *Lon McEachern (play-by- play) *Randy Pedersen (color commentary) - Pedersen once commented on his role as PBA analyst on ESPN telecasts. He said, \\"I want to convey to the viewing public that they are watching the best bowlers in the world. It's my job to explain what makes them that good, as well as provide other information that 'Johnny 150 average' doesn't already know. One thing I learned is if you can bring enthusiasm to the table, sometimes it doesn't really matter what is coming out of your mouth.

Upon completion of that series Kimberly became the laneside reporter for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) on ESPN, making her debut at the 2010 World Series of Bowling. She has remained in this role through the 2018 PBA season on ESPN. *Jay Randolph (play-by-play) *Dave Ryan (play-by-play) - His signature phrases on bowling telecasts were \\"60 feet to success!\\" and \\"He's got all ten down.\\" Some bowling fans criticized him for calling pins by a number, such as \\"number seven\\" instead of saying \\"the seven pin.\\" Ryan was replaced by Rob Stone for PBA telecasts in 2007, but he has continued to call other bowling events on occasion, such as women's tournaments and college tournaments. *Denny Schreiner (play-by-play) *Rob Stone (play-by-play) - Stone replaced Dave Ryan as the lead play-by-play announcer for PBA bowling telecasts on ESPN prior to the 2007–08 Denny's PBA Tour. He would continue in this position on PBA telecasts through the end of 2011, after which he left voluntarily to take a position with Fox Sports.

Disavowal of polytheists is a Qur'anic term or tradition which is applied to \\"disgust to polytheists and the enemies of Allah/His apostle\\".; it likewise means: \\"Announcement of Bara'ah (disgust/aversion) from all Taghuts and arrogance powers\\". Aversion to idolaters or disavowal of polytheists in Hajj is recently followed more diligence from the political angle, and is carried out by Muslims --Hajjis-- as an opportunity to confront the plans of arrogance. The history of this Quranic tradition is considered from the time of Khalilullah (Abraham) to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In the current years, it has also been paid heeded seriously by religious/political leaders, such as Seyyed Ruhollah Khomeini and Seyyed Ali Khamenei. == Current era == The revival of this Islamic custom and its basics explanation in the recent era are come back to the suggestion of the first supreme leader of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini who named two doctrines of \\"Tawalla and Tabarra\\" as the main base of this Islamic expression.Sahifeh Imam, Seyyed Ruhollah Khomeini, Vol. 20, P. 111 In explaining the philosophy of Bara'at (Disavowal), Khomeini mentions that: the great/mean/little (first, middle and back) devils must be repulsed from the holy privacy of Islam. He also added in regards to the issue of \\"Bara'ah Min al-Mushrikin\\" (disavowal of polytheists) in Hajj\\": After passing away of the first supreme leader of Iran Seyyed Ruhollah Khomeini, the current supreme leader of Iran Seyyed Ali Khamenei issues message(s) annually on the ritual of \\"disavowal of polytheists\\" to Hajj pilgrims. He mentioned in his last message in August 6th, 2019 that: \\"The ritual of Bara’ah which means refusing every instance of mercilessness, cruelty, wrongdoing and corruption of the tyrants of any time, and rising against intimidation and extortion by the arrogant throughout history, is one of the great blessings of Hajj, and an opportunity for oppressed Muslim nations. Today, repudiating the front of shirk [polytheism] and kufr [disbelief] made up of the arrogant powers—the foremost of them being the U.S.—equals refusing the killing of the oppressed, and waging wars...\\" == In Quran == Quran, the central religious text/book of Islam The most attention of the Quran in regards to the subject of Bara'ah is concerning the communication of \\"Bara'ah Min al-Mushrikin\\" (disavowal of polytheists) at the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad during the season of Hajj in 9th lunar year,Jarullah-al-Khashef, Zamakhshari, Vol. 2, P. 242-245Tabarsi, Fazl ibn Hasan, Jawame'-al-Jame', Vol. 2, P. 36 and also aversion of Abraham from Mushrikins (polytheists). In the meanwhile, being numerous ayahs in the Quran and removing the idols from Kaaba by Muhammad during the history of Islam portrays the importance of this tradition from Islamic aspect. The issue of \\"disavowal of polytheists\\" which is considered as an/the essential political of Hajj, has been mentioned in Surahs/Ayahs of Quran, such as: in Surah Al- Mumtahanah, Surah Al-Fath, Surah Al-Ma'ida. Even there is a Surah by that name too, namely Surah Bara'ah (At-Tawba). According to the announcement of Bara'ah, it was banned for the polytheists to enter Masjid al-Haram, and to perform Hajj.Al Rodh al Anaf, Vol. 1, P. 249-250Sireh, Ibn Eshagh (Muhammad ibn Ishaq Ibn Yasar), Vol. 2, P. 75 == See also == * 1987 Mecca incident * Al Wala' Wal Bara' * At-Tawba * Glossary of Islam * Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization (Iran) * Tawalla & Tabarra == References == Category:Hajj Category:Islamic terminology Category:Jihad Category:Quran Category:Mecca ","title":"Disavowal of Polytheists in Hajj"},{"id":"61595580","text":"Jeffrey John Arbon (born 1967), is a male former diver who competed for Great Britain and England. ==Diving career== Arbon represented Great Britain at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

It is used in Australia's Sheffield Shield, under the name Quotient. It was used to determine the champions in 1910–11, and a number of times after that. It has not been required to determine final league positions since fractional bonus points for each run scored and wicket taken were introduced (in 2014–15). It is used in India's Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy, under the name Quotient. ==Calculation== It is the number of runs scored per wicket lost, divided by the number of runs conceded per wicket taken: \\\\text{RpW ratio }=\\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs scored}}{\\\\text{total wickets lost}} \\\\div \\\\frac{\\\\text{total runs conceded}}{\\\\text{total wickets taken}}. Mathematically, this is equivalent to: \\\\text{RpW ratio} = \\\\frac{ {\\\\text{total runs scored}} \\\\times {\\\\text{total wickets taken}} } { {\\\\text{total runs conceded}} \\\\times {\\\\text{total wickets lost}} }. For example, if in one match Sri Lanka scored a total of 535 runs for the loss of 14 wickets, then they scored 38.214 runs per wicket. If they conceded 534 runs while taking 20 wickets, then they conceded 26.7 runs per wicket. So their RpW ratio = 38.214 ÷ 26.7 = 1.431. The RpW ratio for their opponent (New Zealand) is the inverse of this: 26.7 ÷ 38.214 = 0.699. So if two teams have played only each other, their two RpW ratio figures are reciprocals. As the units are the same either side of the division (runs/wickets), they cancel out, so RpW ratio is a dimensionless quantity. ==Interpretation== It is the average number of runs scored per wicket, for each run per wicket conceded: *If RpW ratio is less than 1, then the team scored fewer runs per wicket than it conceded. In the example, New Zealand scored 26.7 runs per wicket but conceded 38.214 runs per wicket. So they scored 0.699 runs per wicket for each run per wicket conceded. *If RpW ratio equals 1, then the team scored exactly the same number of runs per wicket as it conceded. *If RpW ratio is greater than 1, then the team scored more runs per wicket than it conceded. In the example, Sri Lanka scored 38.214 runs per wicket and conceded 26.7 runs per wicket. So they scored 1.431 runs per wicket for each run per wicket conceded. RpW ratio is not to be confused with the ratio of runs conceded to wickets taken by individual bowlers, known as bowling average, or with batting average. ==References== Category:Cricket terminology Category:ICC World Test Championship Category:Sheffield Shield ","title":"Runs Per Wicket Ratio"},{"id":"61595655","text":"Carolyn Roscoe (born 1966), is a female former diver who competed for Great Britain and England. ==Diving career== Roscoe represented Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Mme de Staël thought her among the most sympathetic women in Weimar while Goethe himself, who enjoyed her company, referred to her as the \\"little Schardt\\" (als den \\"kleinen Schardt\\"). She also wrote poems herself, which were mostly short lyric pieces, and produced translations from English and Italian (most of which remain unpublished). ==Biography== Friederike Sophie Eleonore von Bernstorff was born in Hanover. She had one sibling, her brother Hans Joachim Carl von Bernstorff (1754-1802). Andreas von Bernstorff (1688-1757), her father, was the vice-director of a law firm in Celle. He had been relatively old when he had married her mother, Charlotte von Holle (?-1763), and both parents died while the children were still small. Sophie was taken in to grow up with her cousins in the home of the international statesman Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff (1712-1772). Count von Bernstoff was a lover of literature who is credited with having introduced the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock to the German literary scene. Count von Bernstoff had also married a woman far younger than himself, and after his death his widow, born Charitas Emilie von Buchwald (1733–1820), moved to Weimar with Sophie, who by now was in her early twenties. On 28 April 1778 Sophie married the Weimar privy counsellor, Ernst Karl Konstantin von Schardt (1743–1833), a brother of Charlotte von Stein (1742-1827). The marriage was not a good one, spoiled, from Sophie's point of view, by the character defects of her husband, whose intellectual capacity fell far short of her own. She sought compensation for the lack of a satisfactory family life in a succession of close friendships with numerous men and women, some of whom were celebrities of the Weimar literary scene while others were individuals of little public note. True personal fulfillment came only with her flight to Catholicism. After several years of secretly drawing closer to the church, she completed the final necessary steps and converted at Easter 1816. The better known members of Sophie von Schardt's Weimar network of friends included the lyric poet and Goethe intimate Karl Ludwig von Knebel. Another was the philosopher-poet Johann Gottfried Herder, who taught her Greek, and was particularly appreciative of her cheerful temperament which he valued as a corrective to his own tendency to melancholy. She developed a close relationship with the poet Zacharias Werner. Sophie von Schardt was a prodigious letter writer. One confidant and friend with whom she conducted an extensive correspondence, especially around 1812, was the lawyer-poet Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg. The correspondence details her careful preparation for her conversion to Catholicism. Stolberg-Stolberg understood the social and family-related complexities involved, having made precisely the same transition himself in 1800.

It is one of the few instruments by Schnitger to have been structurally changed as early as the 18th century. The organ has 21 stops, over two manuals and pedal. 15 stops are still original Schnitger work. ==Building History== ===New organ by Arp Schnitger, 1694=== On August 1, 1693, the annual administrators of the orphanage contractually agreed with Schnitger for him to build a new organ for them. Their previous positive organ, dating from 1627, had been repaired by Joachim Richborn in 1671, but had since been disused.Fock (1974). Arp Schnitger und seine Schule. p. 67. Schnitger's new organ was completed on February 24, 1694 after seven months' work, with two manuals and pedals free-standing behind them. According to the contract, Schnitger was entitled to 650 Reichstaler for the job. Additionally to the 20 stops agreed by contract, Schnitger also provided a Dulcian 8′ for the upper manual. The instrument was examined and approved by Johann Adam Reincken and his son-in-law Andreas Kneller.Edskes, Vogel (2016). Arp Schnitger and His Work. p. 143. The facade of the Hauptwerk ('Great organ') is three-towered with an elevated, polygonal central tower and two side towers, which were originally also polygonal. The towers are connected by two-storey pipe-flats, which are divided by profiled intermediate cornices; the lower pipes of these are mute. Original, preserved carving completes the prospect of the Hauptwerk at the top and bottom, forming lateral blind-relief wings of acanthus tendrils with volutes, and abutting the center tower. Due to the low ceiling height, the main case originally stood as a Brüstungsorgel ('parapet organ') integrated into the orphanage gallery edge somewhat like a chair-organ. Behind it was the 'Mittelste Werck' ('Middle division', essentially a 'Hinterwerk') positioned above the console. Behind the console, just above the floor, was the pedal with the largest pipes in the centre. To colour the case-front, Schnitger chose a dark background on which gilded decoration stood out.Edskes, Vogel (2016). Arp Schnitger and His Work. p. 42. The principals and flutes are characterized by a fast response and a sonic elegance. The flute stops sound relatively mild, while the original mixture lies very high and sounds sharp. Schnitger's masterful reed stops have a great ability to blend with other stops. The fine intonation is characteristic of Schnitger's city organs. That this small city organ is the only surviving one of its kind by Schnitger is attributable to the instrument's transfer to Grasberg.Vogel, Lade, Borger- Keweloh (1997). Orgeln in Niedersachsen. p. 183. ===Transfer to Grasberg by Wilhelmy 1788=== When the Hamburg orphanage was about to be demolished and abandoned in 1785, Johann Jakob Lehnert built a new organ for the new orphanage.Fock (1974). Arp Schnitger und seine Schule. p. 100. After the sale of the Schnitger organ, Georg Wilhelm Wilhelmy (of Stade) transferred the instrument from Hamburg to Grasberg for 500 Reichstaler. Here Jürgen Christian Findorff had built a new church for the marsh colonists in 1781–1785. Wilhelmy built new casework below the original Hauptwerk impost and rearranged the structural housing of the two manuals. The Mittelwerk, originally sited behind the Hauptwerk, was re-installed in the new lower case as a Brustwerk. In the doors in front of the Brustwerk are foliated wooden pipe dummies. The side towers received their present semi-circular shape; Schnitger had made the side towers polygonal, whereas he usually built pointed side towers. Wilhelmy made a new mechanism using many Schnitger parts, and renewed the keyboards. Taking advantage of the new space he re-worked the pedal Dulcian 16′ into a Posaune 16′ with wooden resonators, removed the trumpet 4′ ('Schallmey') and put the trumpet 8′ in its place. The Cornet 2′ was removed and the four-rank pedal mixture was transformed into a two-rank Rauschpfeife due to the Posaune's larger wooden boots. Noteworthy is the elegant mechanism with the original sticker action for the Hauptwerk. In 1826, a repair costing 442 Reichstaler by Wilhelmy's son Johann Georg Wilhelm Wilhelmy was carried out because the organ was severely damaged due to a damaged church roof.Vogel, Lade, Borger-Keweloh (1997). Orgeln in Niedersachsen. p. 182. ===Later works=== In 1859 to 1862 the Nasat and Sesquialtera were removed by J.H. Rohdenburg (of Lilienthal) and replaced, in contemporary taste, with foundation stops (Bordun 16′ and Viola da Gamba 8′). In 1917, the 65 case-pipes had to be handed over to the army administration for armament purposes, as Schnitger organs were not under monument protection at the time. ===Restorations=== The first renovation was in 1931–1932 by Schindler (of Bremen), with the aim of restoring the original disposition. Another renovation took place in 1950 by Paul Ott. Due to the lower wind pressure applied at this time however, the pipe work was revised and the cut-ups changed. Only the Waldfloit was spared from the mutilation of its pipe mouths.Fock (1974). Arp Schnitger und seine Schule. p. 101. The organ was consequently restored in 1980–1985 by Hillebrand (of Altwarmbüchen) and the previous unsatisfactory interventions were reversed. Lost stops were reconstructed according to the scale data of the organologist Cor Edskes (Groningen) and Rudolf von Beckerath (Hamburg), who had carefully documented the organ's condition before 1950 including the scale measurements. The facade's current colour scheme does not correspond to the original state. The original dark colour has been uncovered on one of the right-hand tower supports. From 1988 to 1989, due to a church renovation, a temporary removal of the organ and installation in the monastery of Möllenbeck was necessary. Rowan West restored the organ in 2015/2016, cleaning and removing mould, carrying out essential maintenance, and making a new copy of the damaged tongues of the Dulcian and of Wilhelmy's manual Trommet. ==Disposition== The 1985 state of the organ shows the original disposition: { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse;\\"  style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"  { border=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"3\\" I Hauptwerk CDEFGA–c3 \\\\---- -  Principal  8′  Hi -  Rohrfloit  8′  S -  Octav  4′  S -  Nasat  3′  Hi -  Octav  2′  S -  Sesquialtera II   HiSome old pipes. -  Mixtur IV–VI   S -  Trommet  8′  S }  style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"  { border=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"3\\" II Brustwerk CDEFGA–c3 \\\\---- -  Gedackt  8′  SOak wood. -  Rohrfloit  4′  S -  Waldfloit  2′  SCylindrical and open. -  Quint  1⁄3′  S -  Scharff IV   S -  Dulcian  8′  S }  style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"  { border=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Pedal CDE–d1 \\\\---- -  Supbaß  16′  SMetal except CDE. -  Gedact  8′  SMetal. -  Octave  4′  S -  Mixtur IV   Hi -  Posaune  16′  WiWooden resonators. -  Trommet  8′  S -  Cornett  2′  Hi } } * Couplers: II/I (Sliding Coupler) (S) * Tremulant (new) ; Notes : S = Schnitger : Wi = Wilhelmy : Hi = Hillebrand ==Technical Data== * 21 stops, 33 ranks of pipes * Wind system: ** 3 Wedge bellows ** 3 Check valves (ventils) ** Wind pressure: 70 mmWS * Windchests: Manuals (Schnitger), pedal (Schnitger) * Mechanism/Action: ** Keyboards (Schnitger) ** Key action: Mechanical ** Stop action: Mechanical * Temperament: ** Well temperament (Neidhardt III) ** Pitch: about one semitone above a1 = 440 Hz ==Bibliography== * Cornelius H.

In one incident, the band was forced to push the plane off the runway after an engine failed, and in another incident, a malfunctioning magneto prevented the plane from flying and Nelson from participating in the first Farm Aid concert in Champaign, Illinois. ==Crash landing== On December 26, 1985, Nelson and the band left for a three-stop tour of the southern United States. Following shows in Orlando, Florida, and Guntersville, Alabama, Nelson and band members took off from Guntersville for a New Year's Eve extravaganza in Dallas, Texas. The plane crash-landed outside of De Kalb, Texas, northeast of Dallas, in a cow pasture less than two miles from a landing strip at approximately 5:14 p.m. CST on December 31, 1985, hitting trees on its way down. Seven of the nine occupants were killed: Nelson and his companion, Helen Blair, 27; bass guitarist Patrick Woodward, 35; drummer Rick Intveld, 22; keyboardist Andy Chapin, 34; guitarist Bobby Neal, 38; and road manager/sound man Donald Clark Russell, 35. Pilots Ken Ferguson and Brad Rank escaped through cockpit windows, although Ferguson was severely burned. ==Burial== Nelson's remains were misdirected in transit from Texas to California, delaying the funeral for several days. On January 6, 1986, 250 mourners entered the Church of the Hills for funeral services while 700 fans gathered outside. Attendees included \\"Colonel\\" Tom Parker, Connie Stevens, Angie Dickinson and dozens of actors, writers and musicians. Nelson was privately buried days later at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park – Hollywood Hills cemetery in Los Angeles. ==Aftermath== Nelson's ex-wife Kristin Nelson threatened to sue the Nelson family for her former husband's life insurance money and tried to wrest control of his estate from David Nelson, its administrator. Her bid was rejected by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge. Ricky Nelson had bequeathed his entire estate to his children and did not leave anything for his ex-wife. Only days after the funeral, rumors and newspaper reports suggested that cocaine freebasing was among several possible causes of the plane crash. Those allegations were refuted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) following its investigation. ==Investigation of incident== Reports vary as to whether the plane was on fire before it crashed, though some witnesses attested that it was indeed in flames while still airborne. However, NTSB chairman Jim Burnett said that although the plane was filled with smoke, it landed and came to a stop before it was swallowed by flames. The NTSB conducted a year-long investigation and finally concluded that, while a definite cause was still unknown, the crash was probably the result of a fire that was caused by the plane's cabin heater \\"acting up.\\" ===Pilots questioned=== When questioned by the NTSB, pilots Brad Rank and Ken Ferguson had different accounts of key events. According to Ferguson, the cabin heater was acting up after the plane took off. Ferguson said that Rank repeatedly went to the back of the plane to try to fix the heater, and that Rank told Ferguson several times to turn the heater back on. \\"One of the times, I refused to turn it on,\\" said Ferguson. He continued, \\"I was getting more nervous. I didn't think we should be messing with that heater en route.\\" After the plane crashed, Ferguson and Rank climbed out through the cockpit windows, suffering extensive burns. They shouted to the passenger cabin, but there was no response. Ferguson and Rank backed away from the plane, fearing an explosion. Ferguson stated that Rank told him, \\"Don't tell anyone about the heater, don't tell anyone about the heater.\\" However, Rank told a different story. He said that he was checking on the passengers when he noticed smoke in the middle of the cabin, where Rick Nelson and Helen Blair were sitting. Even though he never mentioned a problematic heater, Rank stated that he went to the rear of the plane to check the heater, saw no smoke, and found that the heater was cool to the touch. He said that after activating an automatic fire extinguisher and opening the cabin's fresh- air inlets, he returned to the cockpit, where Ferguson was already asking traffic controllers for directions to the nearest airfield. Rank was criticized by the NTSB for not following the in-flight fire checklist, opening the fresh air vents instead of leaving them closed, not instructing the passengers to use supplemental oxygen and not attempting to fight the fire with the handheld fire extinguisher that was in the cockpit. The board said that while these steps might not have prevented the crash, \\"they would have enhanced the potential for survival of the passengers.\\" The words of the NTSB seemed to echo those of firefighter Lewis Glover, one of the first on the scene, who stated, \\"All the bodies are there at the front of the plane. Apparently, they were trying to escape the fire.\\" ===Suspected cause=== An examination indicated that a fire had originated on the right side of the aft cabin area at or near the floorline. Some reports said the passengers were killed when the aircraft struck obstacles during the forced landing. The ignition and fuel sources of the fire could not be determined. According to another report, the pilot indicated that the crew repeatedly tried to turn on the gasoline cabin heater shortly before the fire occurred, but that it failed to respond. After the fire, the access panel to the heater compartment was found unlatched. The theory is supported by records that showed that DC-3s in general—and this aircraft in particular—had a history of problems with the cabin heaters. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas DC-3 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Texas Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by in-flight fires Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1985 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1985 Category:Accidental deaths in Texas Category:1985 in Texas Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:December 1985 events in the United States Category:1985 in American music ","title":"Death of Ricky Nelson"},{"id":"61595904","text":"Tigers Are Not Afraid () is a 2017 Mexican crime-fantasy film written and directed by Issa López. The film is produced by Marco Polo Constandse, under the banner of Filmadora Nacional, and Peligrosa. The film stars Paola Lara, Juan Ramón López, Ianis Guerrero, Rodrigo Cortes, Hanssel Casillas, Nery Arredondo, and Tenoch Huerta. == Plot == Estrella (Paola Lara) is a young girl in a Mexican city devastated by the Mexican Drug War. While working on a fairy tale writing assignment, Estrella’s classroom is disrupted by gunfire outside the school. Amid the panic, Estrella’s teacher hands her three pieces of chalk she says will grant three wishes. Following the incident, classes are indefinitely suspended. Street orphan Shine steals a gun and an iPhone from Caco, a henchman of crime boss Chino, who is actually politician Servando Esparza. Shine points the gun at Caco, who is drunkenly oblivious to the theft, but is unable to shoot. Estrella walks home past a dead body on the street. A trail of blood from the body follows Estrella to her house, where Estrella discovers that her mother is missing; a probable victim of rampant drug cartel-related violence from Chino’s human trafficking ring ‘The Huascas.' Growing lonely and desperate for food, Estrella wishes for her mother to return. Estrella begins experiencing haunting visions of her mother as a ghost imploring Estrella to “bring him to us.” Soon after, Estrella catches Shine looting her house. Estrella follows Shine back to his hideout and meets fellow orphans Pop, Tucsi, and Morro. Shine refuses to feed her or welcome her into his gang but Estrella stays with the boys anyway. Caco comes looking for his stolen gun and phone. The other children escape, but Morro is kidnapped. Shine gives Estrella the stolen gun and tells her that if she kills Caco, he will let her remain in his gang. Estrella sneaks into Caco’s apartment. While aiming the weapon, Estrella makes a wish that she didn’t have to kill Caco. She then sees that Caco is already dead. Estrella frees Morro and tells Shine that she killed Caco. Later that night, Estrella has another vision of her mother. She warns that the man who really killed Caco will be looking for Estrella, and Estrella must bring the man to her. Shine, Estrella, Pop, Tucsi, and Morro bring the other rescued boys back to their rival gang leader Brayan. Brayan taunts Shine for having Estrella kill Caco when Shine should have been the one to do it. Estrella finds Shine crying over the fact that he couldn’t kill Caco. Shine confesses that he keeps Caco’s phone because it contains a picture of his own missing mother. Having heard about Estrella from Brayan, Caco’s brother Tio calls Caco’s phone to threaten the children. After the kids decorate soccer balls, Shine tells Estrella more about his mother. Shine asks Estrella if she might use her last wish to remove the burn scars on his face. Estrella refuses, claiming something bad happens every time she makes a wish. Tio captures Shine while the other boys stage an imaginary talent show. Estrella has another haunting vision of her mother along with other murder victims while hiding from Tio before also being captured. Morro shoots Tio to save his friends, but Tio shoots and kills Morro. The other children escape. Wondering why recovering the phone is so important to the Huascas, Shine and Estrella closely examine its contents. They discover Caco recorded a video of Chino killing a captive woman. Estrella has Shine call Chino. Chino threatens the children. Estrella bargains to turn over the phone if Chino makes the remaining Huascas disappear. Chino agrees and arranges a meeting. Chino also reveals that he was the one who actually killed Caco because Caco could not turn over the stolen phone. In the wake of the revelation that she did not kill Caco, Shine and the other two boys shun Estrella. Haunting visions of dead people chase Estrella, again telling her to “bring him to us.” Fearful of Chino, Pop and Tucsi steal the phone from Shine. They show the footage to two policemen, but the officers refuse to act when they recognize the murderer as Chino. Shine takes back the phone. Shine notices that the bracelet worn by the murdered woman in the video is identical to the bracelet worn by Estrella’s mother in a photo seen earlier. Morro’s ghost tells Estrella where to find the boys. When they reconnect, Shine tells Estrella the truth about her mother. Estrella insists that they must go to Chino or else he will kill them all. After burying Morro in a box dropped into water, Estrella, Shine, Pop, and Tucsi go to the meeting with Chino, Tio, and another henchman in an abandoned building, where Shine turns over the phone. When Shine refuses to reveal the password, Chino crushes the phone with his foot. Chino then executes Tio and the other henchman, explaining to Estrella that he honored his part of the agreement. Pop and Tucsi run away. Recognizing the building, Estrella insists on finding the room where her mother died. Shine accompanies her. Shine reveals that he still has Caco’s phone because he gave Chino a decoy. Shine advises Estrella that wishes aren’t real. Estrella still chalks Shine’s cheek and makes a final wish that his scars disappear. Chino suddenly shoots Shine through his face. Estrella flees while Chino chases after her. Morro’s tiger doll leads Estrella into a shaft. Estrella falls into a room containing numerous dead bodies, including her mother’s. Estrella tearfully connects with a vision of her mother when her mother’s bloody body briefly reanimates. Estrella uses Caco’s phone to lure Chino into the room and trap him inside. The ghosts of his victims are heard killing Chino. Estrella encounters Shine’s ghost. After their conversation, Shine enters the body pit room and sets it on fire. On her way out of the building and into an open field, Estrella encounters a tiger that escaped from a zoo. == Cast == == Reception == === Critical response === On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 98 reviews, and an average rating of 8.22/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Tigers Are Not Afraid draws on childhood trauma for a story that deftly blends magical fantasy and hard-hitting realism - and leaves a lingering impact\\". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Debruge of the Variety wrote, \\"The actors may be young, but the story skews decidedly mature. After all, in her commitment to realism, López allows terrible things to happen to the kids — including death in several cases — and that’s a hard thing to accept, not because it doesn’t happen in the real world, but on account of the melodramatic and manipulative way such tragedy is handled\\". Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Both the emotion and the horror might have taken still deeper root if the world of the movie felt less hectic and more coherently realized, if the supernatural touches and occasional jump scares welled up organically from within rather than feeling smeared on with a digital trowel\\". Brian Tallerico of the RogerEbert.com wrote,\\"Tigers Are Not Afraid may be imperfect, but you can feel the passion and creativity of its filmmaker in every decision.

Discovered by musicologist Willy Hess, it may be one of Beethoven's first attempts at composing a work for this combination of instruments. The surviving manuscript comprises three pages containing parts of two separate movements, both of which are missing several pages including their openings. Violinist Eimar Heeney identifies the two fragmentary movements as being the slow movement and concluding rondo. Musicologist Sieghard Brandenburg also reconstructs the fragments in this way and adds that he believes the finale was never completed because the score ends abruptly with plenty of space remaining on the page. Both authors agree that the work was balanced in such a way that the violin has a purely accompanying role. Brandenburg characterized the fragments as demonstrating that at this point in his career Beethoven possessed a sound understanding of the techniques used in classical violin sonatas, but may not have had the skill to use them effectively. Heeney agrees with the assessment regarding the balance between the violin and the piano in this work and adds that the violin part did not contain anything outside the skills of a typical amateur musician of the period. Scholar Richard Kramer commented that the style of the work was heavily influenced by Mozart's Violin Sonata in A major, K. 526. ==References== Notes Sources * * * ==External links== * , performed by Rachel Barton Pine Category:1790 compositions Category:Violin sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven Category:Compositions in A major ","title":"Violin Sonata in A major (Beethoven)"},{"id":"61596324","text":"The men's 100 kg sambo event at the 2019 European Games in Minsk was held on 22 June at the Minsk Sports Palace. ==Results== ;Legend * VH – Total victory – painful hold * VS – Total victory by decisive superiority * VW – Total victory by withdrawal ;Repechage ==References== ==External links== *Draw Sheet Men's 100 kg ","title":"Sambo at the 2019 European Games – Men's 100 kg"},{"id":"61596333","text":"Desmond M Gwilliam (1954-1999), was a male boxer who competed for England. ==Boxing career== Gwilliam won two national boys' club championships before winning the gold medal in the Dutch Multi-Nations tournament.

Jute was historically a major export item of Bangladesh but has declined since the 1970s. Exports have fallen as other countries grew jute and alternate products like plastic and hemp found more widespread use. Bangladesh produces, as of 2018, 33 percent of the total worldwide production of jute. ==Early history== Historically jute produced in Bengal was made into rope and clothes using local handlooms. During the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815) in Europe the supply of Russian flax linen to mills in Dundee, Scotland. The British needed a new source and jute was touted as a potential alternate to Russian flax. The problem with manufacturing jute fabrics in industrial mills was that Jute fabric was too course for the machines. The firm of Balfour and Melville developed a process to weaken the fabric by using water and whale fat. In 1838, Dundee mills received an order to manufacture sacks for sugar plantations in Dutch controlled Java. They produced jute burlap sacks for the order using the Balfour and Melville method. This generated demand and promoted jute from Bengal. Demand for jute further increased following the Crimean War (1853-1856). In 1873, the British Raj formed a commission with led by HC Kerr to investigate the jute industry and jute cultivation in Bengal. Report on the Cultivation of, and Trade in, Jute in Bengal was published in 1877. The report suggested that large scale jute cultivation began in the 1840s in the Bengal region. Drying jute fibre George Auckland, along with a Bengali partner, Shyamsunder Sen, established the first jute mill in the region 1855 in Rishra on the banks of the Hooghly River. The American Civil War had made it necessary to find an alternate fabric source. Jute was a good alternate as it was relatively cheaper and was sourced from a British colony, Bengal Presidency of British India. Jute mills were opened around Kolkata which rapidly grew in numbers in the later half of the 19th century. In 1882, there were 18 mills which had increased to 51 by 1901 and employed 10 thousand workers. The majority of the jute manufactured in the mills were exported to Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. The Jute industry had become the second largest industry in British India after the cotton industry and Kolkata became the centre of the jute trade. The majority of the factories were located outside Kolkata and were owned by foreigners. In the 1920s, jute prices rose dramatically which also lead to increased production. Jute prices fell in the 1930s despite the Indian Jute Mills Association trying to stop the price decline by reducing working hours. The British Raj formed the Bengal Jute Inquiry Committee to create reports on the state of the Jute industry in Bengal in the 1930s during the Great Depression. It published two reports, one in 1934 and another in 1939. The report identified that low prices in one year led to lower production and higher prices the next year, this was followed subsequently by higher production and lower prices next year. The reports recommended the government restrict the production of jute. During World War Two production increased and at the end of the war there were 111 jute mills in the region. Jute production took place in the East Bengal while the majority of the mills were located in West Bengal. After the Partition of India, this became difficult as East Bengal joined Pakistan and West Bengal went to India. From 1947 to 1948, there was free trade between India and Pakistan which stopped when India declared Pakistan a foreign country and imposed border control. Trade between the two regions became difficult and Pakistan also started to develop Jute mills in East Bengal. Before the Partition of India, there were 108 jute mills in Bengal and all of them were located in West Bengal. East Bengal despite being where the majority of the jute was cultivated was left with no mills after becoming part of Pakistan. India and Pakistan tried halfheartedly to continue the Jute trade between East and West Bengal as both countries were trying to become selfsufficient in the production and processing of jute. India was trying to encourage domestic cultivation and Pakistan was trying to encourage domestic entrepreneurs to establish jute mills. Entrance of Adamjee Jute Mills Bawa Jute Mills Limited, Adamjee Jute Mills, and Victory Jute Products Limited were established in 1951 in East Bengal. Adamjee Jute Mills was built with financial support from the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation. By 1960, the number of jute mills had increased to 14 and 12 of them was supported by Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation. The majority of these mills were founded by non- Bengalis. This generated some tension as the majority of the workers were Bengali which made the government realise that they needed to encourage more Bengali entrepreneurs. Abul Kashem Khan, the Minister of Industry, developed a plan to divide the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation into two, West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation and East Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, to encourage more entrepreneurs from East Pakistan. The East Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation lowered the minimum number of looms required to open a factory and encouraged small Bengali entrepreneurs. This increased the number of jute mills owned by Bengalis. By 1970, East Pakistan had 77 jute mills which employed 170 thousand people. Pakistan earned 77 million rupees from the export of jute from East Pakistan and became the largest exporter of jute in the world. Jute as percentage of foreign revenue increased from .2 percent in 1952 to 46 percent in 1970. ==History== Machinery inside Adamjee Jute Mills In 1971, East Pakistan became the independent country of Bangladesh following the Bangladesh Liberation war. The owners of jute mills from West Pakistan left Bangladesh and abandoned their jute mills. The government of Bangladesh ordered the Bangladesh Jute Board to take over those mills. The board appointed administrators for the mills. The administrators proved to be inept because they were appointed not based on their qualifications but political connections. In 1972, the government of Bangladesh nationalised all industries including jute mills and included socialism in the constitution of Bangladesh. The nationalised jute mills were placed under the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation. Adamjee Jute Mills suffered from management problems after nationalisation There was absenteeism and issues with unions. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation was given the task of controlling the price, purchase, and sale of jute in Bangladesh. In the 1970s rising cost, the devaluation of taka, and corruption lead to Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation incurring significant financial losses. In 1973, the Government established the Jute Division and placed it under the Ministry of Finance. In 1976, the Jute Division was turned into the Ministry of Jute. In 1979, an expert committee of the government recommended that the government privatise the mills. From 1979 to 1980, three jute mills were returned to their previous owners and two were privatised. In the 1980s, the government provided subsidiaries and export bonus to encourage the industry to poor results. In 1982, the Government of Bangladesh returned 35 mills to private owners. The jute grown in Bangladesh is used to produce Hessian fabric, Jute Carpets, and sacks. The World Bank recommended the Government of Bangladesh to appoint a firm to study the condition of the Jute industry in 1990 and accordingly a foreign consultant was appointed. According to the study, the jute industry had a liability of 20.75 billion taka with local banks and almost 13 billion taka was liability was held by state owned jute mills under Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation and rest were held by private jute mills. The study recommended reduction in capacity and privatisation of all government held jute mills. The World Bank offered a loan, US$250 million, to implement these and some other recommendations. The government of Bangladesh closed down four mills and made funds available to state owned mills so that they could reduce their workforce. These did not reduce losses for the jute mills and the government failed to turn profit. The private jute mills were also under performing and two were closed down. ==Current state== In 2002, the Government closed down Adamjee Jute Mills, the largest jute mill in Bangladesh. Despite this, the remaining jute mills are still losing making concerns for the government. By 2006, the Government of Bangladesh had shares in 78 percent of jute mills in Bangladesh and owns 29 mills completely. In 2010, the Government of Bangladesh made it mandatory for wholesale manufacturers and sellers to pack rice, sugar, wheat, and fertilisers in jute bags. This requirement was expanded to include animal feed in 2018. In 2018, Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation recommended the Ministry of Jute and Textiles form a 100 billion taka fund, Jute Sector Development Fund, to develop the jute industry and provide low cost loans. The Jute industry exports close to a billion dollars of product from Bangladesh every year. In January 2018, the Government of Bangladesh imposed a ban on the export of raw/unprocessed jute to ensure adequate supply for the local market. The export ban was lifted in June 2019 following the demands of Bangladesh Jute Association. From 2010 to 2019, the Government of Bangladesh has given to about 7.5 billion taka to the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation. The corporation has not been able to turn profit, and it has been experiencing losses every year since 1980 with the exception of 2010-11 fiscal year. The Daily Star described the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation as \\"bottomless pit\\". Jute plants being harvested The private sector in Bangladesh are taking a renewed interest in jute as demand for biodegrable and sustainable natural fabric grows. Khiyoo Fashion House, a Bangladeshi company, is making garments and shoes using jute. In 2017, India imposed anti-dumping tariffs on jute hessian fabric, bags and yarn. In 2019, India expanded anti-dumping tariffs by imposing US$125.21 on per tonne of jute sacks. This led to concerns being expressed by Bangladesh Jute Mills Association and Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association as India was a major destination for Bangladeshi jute. Janata Jute Mills and Akij Jute Mills are the two largest private jute mills in Bangladesh. ==Research== Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, founded in 1936, is a government research institute and the oldest mono corp research institute in Bangladesh. It was founded by Indian Central Jute Committee in Dhaka Farms as Jute Research Laboratory. It was upgraded by Pakistan Central Jute Committee and renamed to Jute Research Institute in 1951. In 2010, a research team decoded the genome of jute. The team was led by Maqsudul Alam, a Bangladeshi professor at the University of Hawaii and included researchers from Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, Datasoft, and the University of Dhaka. NatUp Fibres, a company based in Normandy, France, has research using jute to make interior components for cars. The components are currently made from flax, which is relatively more expensive. Golden Fibres Trade Centre exports Bangladeshi jute to car manufacturers in Germany. Bangladesh meets about 10 percent of the automobile industries demand for jute as of 2018. In 2018, the chief scientific officer at Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, Dr Mubarak Ahmad Khan, developed a polymer using jute that could be used to manufacture biodegrade plastic bag, called Sonali Bag. ==References== 01 Category:Bangladeshi clothing Category:Industry in Bangladesh Category:Manufacturing companies of Bangladesh ","title":"Jute Industry in Bangladesh"},{"id":"61596448","text":"Gérard Vuilleumier (5 December 1905 - 17 April 1984) was a Swiss ski jumper.

It is a Grade I listed building. ==History== The first guildhall on the site was a timber-framed structure constructed as a meeting place for local merchants in about 1227. In 1717 civic leaders decided to replace the old guildhall with a grander structure. The current building, which was designed by Thomas White in the Queen Anne style, was completed in 1723. The design involved a central bay and two wings with the central bay being flanked by two full-height Composite order columns with a pediment above displaying flute- playing cherubs and the Royal Arms. At roof level, above the cornice, carved figures of Justice, Peace, Plenty, Chastisement and Hercules were erected together with four urns. At ground floor level, in the middle of the central bay was the main entrance which was flanked by Composite order columns with a fanlight and architrave above. On either side of the entrance, statues of King Charles I and King Charles II were erected in niches; at first floor level, above the main entrance a statue of Queen Anne was erected, also in a niche. Inside, a court room and a lower hall were established on the ground floor and a council chamber and a large imposing assembly room were established on the first floor. King George III described the assembly room as \\"a handsome gallery\\" when he visited the guildhall in August 1788. In the 18th century, Worcester elected members of Parliament at the guildhall, a minimum requirement being that they should own freehold property worth 40 shillings a year; the decision was made by the loudest shouting rather than raising of hands. The court room was used a facility for dispensing justice and accommodated the crown court and nisi prius court. Citizens were given the privilege of being imprisoned underneath the guildhall rather than in the town jail, except for the most serious offences. Sir Winston Churchill was presented with the Freedom of the City of Worcester at the guildhall on 20 May 1950. The guildhall was the headquarters of the county borough of Worcester for much of the 20th century and, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972, became the meeting place of enlarged Worcester City Council. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, attended a reception at the guildhall in July 2012, before undertaking a walkabout outside the building. Works of art in the guildhall include portraits by Christopher William Hunneman of King George III and of his wife, Queen Charlotte and a portrait by James Sant of Queen Victoria. ==Gallery== File:Worcester Guildhall Assembly Room.jpgThe Assembly Room File:Worcester Guildhall Lower Hall.jpgThe Lower Hall File:Worcester Guildhall Council Chambers.jpgThe Council Chambers File:Worcester Guildhall Court Room.jpgThe Court Room File:Worcester Guildhall Mayors Parlour Room.jpgThe Mayors Parlour Room ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Worcestershire Category:City and town halls in England Category:Government buildings completed in 1723 ","title":"Worcester Guildhall"},{"id":"61596474","text":"Roll Call () is a 1965 Soviet drama film directed by Daniil Khrabrovitsky.Стеблов о ссоре с Михалковым: я почувствовал, что он мне врежетСтеблов рассказал о ссоре с Михалковым на почве патриотизма == Plot == The film tells about General Zhuravlev, who after the war is engaged in the creation of spaceships.

Montero and Simó himself based on the graphic novel Buñuel en el laberinto de las tortugas by Fermín Solís, about film director Luis Buñuel making the 1933 film Land Without Bread. In August 2019, it was shortlisted as one of the three films in contention to be the Spanish entry for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but lost to Pain and Glory. ==Plot== The controversy surrounding his first feature length film, L'Age d'Or, leaves director Luis Buñuel unable to find new work. An anthropologist named Maurice Legendre hands Buñuel an ethnographic study of the Las Hurdes region of Spain and asks if he would consider making a documentary of the region. Buñuel's friend, sculptor Ramon Acin, buys a lottery ticket and promises to use the winnings to fund the film. Indeed, Ramon wins and keeps his promise. So Buñuel assembles a film crew in the town of La Alberca. From La Alberca, Buñuel drives the crew to a monastery that doubles as a hostel. From the monastery, the crew explores the nearby villages. The villages consist of ramshackle box-shaped houses packed tightly. The winding streets between the houses make each village resemble a labyrinth, and Ramon notes that the jagged roofs resemble the scales on a turtle. The crew find themselves appalled by the poverty-stricken conditions of the homes. The plentifulness of their food supplies astonishes villagers. When they film a school, they find out that locals make most of their money getting government payments for taking in orphaned children, and the schoolchildren crowd around Buñuel desperate for affection. Buñuel later finds a little girl dying on the street, and feels helpless not having the medicine that would cure her. Although the film is a documentary, Buñuel stages many scenes for dramatic effect, in opposition to his crew. In La Alberca, Buñuel makes Ramon hire a farmer to reenact the local tradition of ripping the head off of a rooster. Later on, Buñuel wants to film the image of a mountain goat slipping and falling down a cliffside, but shoots a goat dead rather than wait for an accident to happen. Buñuel also arranges for a donkey to get stung to death by bees, to use as a symbol for the suffering of the local people. All through the shoot, Buñuel is tormented by nightmares of his troubled childhood. One nightmare about his mother and the Virgin Mary compels him to dress in a nun's habit. When the sick girl finally dies, Buñuel has a nightmare where he sees a friend from the region as Death. The nightmare inspires him to have the villagers reenact a funeral for an infant for the film. By 1933, Buñuel is back in Paris editing his film, Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan. Notes at the end of this movie explain that days after the Nationalist coup in Spain, Ramon Acin and then his wife were executed for their Anarchist activity. Buñuel is able to release his movie in Spain, but without Ramon's name. Movie notes explain that he was able to restore Ramon's name to the credits many years later. ==Release== The world premiere was held at the 2018 Animation Is Film Festival in Los Angeles on October 20, 2018.

It had its origins in a signal company and a cyclist battalion formed in 1908 and it provided the divisional signals for the 50th (Northumbrian) Division and its duplicates during World War II. Its successors continued in the postwar TA until 2009. ==Origin== When the Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) was created in 1920 the 50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Signals was formed in the Territorial Army (TA). It combined the former 50th (Northumbrian) Signal Company of the Royal Engineers (RE) with the 5th (Cyclist) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment.Lord & Watson, pp. 161–2.Nalder, p. 600–1. When the old Volunteer Force was subsumed into the Territorial Force (TF) after the Haldane reforms in 1908, the 1st Newcastle Engineer Volunteers provided the RE components of the TF's Northumbrian Division, including the Northumbrian (The Newcastle) Divisional Telegraph Company, RE, with the following organisation:Monthly Army List, various dates.London Gazette', 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 93–100. * Company Headquarters (HQ) at Barras Bridge, Newcastle upon Tyne * No 1 Section at Barras Bridge * No 2 (Northumberland) Section * No 3 (York & Durham) Section * No 4 (Durham Light Infantry) Section Nos 2–4 Sections were attached to and largely manned by the three infantry brigades of the division. The Telegraph Company was redesignated a Signal Company in 1911. RE Signal Company at work on the Western Front. The Northumbrian Division mobilised on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 and in April 1915 was sent to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, where it was numbered as the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. The division was immediately sent into action in the Second Battle of Ypres, and was engaged in many of the major actions on the Western Front for the rest of the war, including the later stages of the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the last phase of the Battle of Passchendaele. The division was virtually destroyed during the German Spring Offensive of 1918. The Divisional RE remained with the 50th while it was reconstituted with units brought back from other fronts. The division re- entered the line for the last month of the Allies' victorious Hundred Days Offensive. It was demobilised in March 1919.Wyrall, 50th Division. After mobilisation, the TF units of the Northumbrian Division raised 2nd Line units with the same titles as the parents, but with a '2/' prefix, including the 2/1st Northumbrian Divisional Signal Company, RE. These units later constituted the 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division, responsible for coastal defence in North East England while supplying drafts to the 50th Northumbrian on the Western Front. However, the drain of supplying drafts was such that the division could not be kept up to strength: in July 1916 it was broken up and its number transferred to the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division. While the RE field companies were sent overseas, 63rd (2/1st Northumbrian) Signal Company was broken up for drafts in the UK.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 49–54. ==Royal Corps of Signals== The new 50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Signals was initially formed in 1920, with headquarters at Gateshead, and had absorbed the 5th (Cyclist) Bn, East Yorkshire Rgt by the following year when its HQ moved to 4 West Parade in Hull. It had the following organisation:Wyrall, East Yorkshires, p. 402. * 1 Company at Darlington * 2 Company at Middlesbrough * 3 Company at Gateshead The first Commanding Officer (CO) was Major C.L. Bagnall, a former officer in 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, who had commanded No 4 Section of the company in 1914. He later became the unit's Honorary Colonel. By the 1930s, 50th (Northumbrian) Signals HQ had moved to the Drill Hall at Darlington and also administered: * 206th Medium Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, The Green, SunderlandLord & Watson, p. 244. * No 3 (Northumbrian) Air Squadron Signal Section (Supplementary Reserve, (SR)), Elmgrove Terrace Drill Hall, Gateshead-on-Tyne * No 5 (Northumbrian) Air Squadron Signal Section (SR), Drill Hall, Darlington * No 12 (Northumbrian) Air Squadron Signal Section (SR) * No 14 (Northumbrian) Air Squadron Signal Section (SR) By 1939 the SR units had left, but the unit was responsible for administering two newly-formed TA signal sections at Middlesbrough: * 271st Army Tank Brigade Signal Section * 253rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment Signal Section ==World War II== 50th (Northumbrian) Division's formation sign in World War II. ===Mobilisation=== Following the Munich Crisis the TA was doubled in size. Once again, 50th (Northumbrian) Division formed a duplicate, 23rd (Northumbrian) Division, with its own divisional signals. 50th Division was mobilised on 3 September 1939 and 23rd Division became active on 2 October 1939.Northern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Joslen, pp. 81–2.Joslen, p. 62.

Battle of France The 50th Division joined the new British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in February 1940. Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 19. When the Germans attacked in May, the division moved up into Belgium with the rest of the BEF and took up positions on the River Dendre.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 49. However, the Germans broke through French lines and the BEF was forced to retreat. By 19 May, 50th Division was moved back to Vimy Ridge north of Arras to prepare for a counter-attack as part of 'Frankforce', in what became known as the Battle of ArrasEllis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter V.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VI. After this brief check, the Germans continued to advance. By now the BEF was cut off from the bulk of the French armies and began its retreat towards Dunkirk. 50th Division guarding an open flank and suffering heavy casualties.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IX.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapte XIII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XV.Ellis, France & Flanders, p. 239. The division, less its heavy equipment, was evacuated from Dunkirk on 1 June and landed in the United Kingdom the following day. North Africa After re-equipping and retraining in the United Kingdom, 50th Division sailed on 23 April 1941 to join Middle East Forces. Following spells in Cyprus, Iraq and Syria, it joined British Eighth Army for the Battle of Gazala (26 May–21 June 1942), where part of the division was captured. Eighth Army fell back to the El Alamein position, which it successfully defended. 50th Division then took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the subsequent advance across North Africa to Tunisia, including the battles of Mareth and Wadi Akarit. Sicily For the Allied invasion of Sicily 50th Division was in the first assault wave and then fought its way up the east side of the island, including the Battle of Primosole Bridge.Barnes, pp. 3–55. With its experience of amphibious assaults, 50th Division was earmarked for the forthcoming invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) and sailed for Britain in October 1943.Barnes, pp. 53–5. North West Europe On D Day, 50th Division was heavily reinforced to carry out the landings on Gold Beach. Once off the beach, 50th Division pushed inland towards Bayeux, and then consolidated its gains over the next few days against German counter-attacks. Progress towards Villers-Bocage was held up by strong Panzer units.Joslen, p. 581.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 171–8, 209–13, 230–1, 253-6.Barnes, pp. 74–9, 102–15 & Appendix C. For the next two months the division fought its way slowly through the Bocage country before being relieved on 5 August.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 334, 388–9, 402, 409.Barnes, pp. 116–31. However, it was back in action on 9 August, attacking against stiff opposition in the advance beyond Mont Pincon as the Allies closed the Falaise Gap.Barnes, pp. 132–7. Once the Seine was crossed and the pursuit began, 50th Division supported 11th Armoured Division's rapid advance, protecting the flank and 'mopping up' local resistance. On 1 September the division secured bridges over the River Somme near Amiens and reached Arras. On 3 September it took part in the Liberation of Brussels.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 468–71.Barnes, pp. 137–40.Ellis, Germany, pp. 4–6. More resistance was met at the Albert Canal, and 50th Division had to make an assault crossing in storm boats, following which the infantry pushed on and captured Gheel after bitter fighting. (7–11 September).Barnes, pp. 141–7.Ellis, Germany, pp. 12–3. The division was due to play a minor role in Operation Market Garden, holding the bridgehead from which Guards Armoured Division advanced, and later defending the road and bridge at Nijmegen, but the latter turned into a major defensive battle after the defeat at Arnhem.Barnes, pp. 148–55.Ellis, Germany, pp. 32, 42, 98. The defence of the Nijmegen bridgehead was 50th Division's last operation. It was by now very weak, and in December 1944 it was broken up to provide reinforcements for other units in 21st Army Group. Most of the division's units returned to the UK as training cadres to turn surplus Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel into infantry, but divisional HQ and signals was kept together. Divisional Signals was demobilised on 31 July 1945, shortly before divisional HQ went to Norway to become HQ British Land Forces Norway.Barnes, pp. 156–9.Ellis, Germany, pp. 158–9, 371. ===23rd (Northumbrian) Divisional Signals=== 23rd (Northumbrian) Divisional Signals did not accompany the division when its infantry were sent to France to act as labour troops in April 1940. They got caught up in the fighting during the retreat to Dunkirk and suffered such heavy casualties in rearguard actions that the division was disbanded at the end of June after its return to England. The divisional signal unit was converted into a training school for non-commissioned officers at Harrogate, in which role it continued until the end of the war. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the unit reformed at Darlington from elements of 50th and 23rd Divisional Signals as 50 (Northumbrian) Infantry Divisional Signal Regiment. It adopted the title 50 (Northumbria) Division Signal Rgt in 1956.Lord & Watson, pp. 194, 268. When the TA was reorganised in 1961, the division became 50th (Northumbrian) Division/District and the regiment (as 50 (Northumbrian) Signal Rgt) absorbed elements of 60th (Mixed) Signals Rgt at York, also taking over responsibility for two brigade signal squadrons:Lord & Watson, pp. 205–6. * 338 Sqn formed at Gateshead in 1959 from 149 Bde Signals * 339 Sqn formed at Middlesbrough in 1959 from 151 Bde Signals When the TA was converted into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) in 1967, the regiment was reduced to 50 (Northumbrian) Signal Squadron in 34 (Northern) Signal Regiment.Lord & Watson, p. 141.50 (Northumbrian) Signal Sqn at MoD (archive).34 (Northern) Signal Rgt at MoD (archive). 34 (Northern) Signal Rgt in 12 Signal Brigade had the NATO role of providing communications between the Channel Ports and the rear boundary of I (British) Corps in British Army of the Rhine. After 1993 this became the provision of theatre-level communications support for the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps as part of 11 Signal Brigade.

The original family gave rise to several branches, one of which became Dukes of Medina Sidonia from the 15th century to the 18th century, in turn giving rise to other branches including the Count-Dukes of Olivares. ==Origin== The founder of what became the House of Guzmán was a Castilian nobleman named Rodrigo Muñoz de Guzmán, who is first seen in the mid 12th- century as tenente (Lord) of Roa and lord of the village of Guzmán in Burgos. The family would come to be known by a toponymic surname indicating their derivation from the latter village. Rodrigo last appears in January 1186.Gonzalo Martínez Díez, \\"Orígenes familiares de Santo Domingo, los linajes de Aza y Guzmán\\", in Santo Domingo de Caleruega en sus contexto socio- político, 1170-1221, Luis Vicente Díez Martín and Cándido Aniz Iriarte, eds., (Monumenta Histórica Iberoamericana de la Orden de Predicadores, no. 5), Salamanca: Jornadas de estudios medievales, 1994, pp. 173-228 By the 15th century, as related by Fernán Pérez de Guzmán in his Generaciones y Semblanzas, the family had developed multiple origin traditions. One of these traced the family from a certain Count Ramiro, who had taken as wife or lover the daughter of a King of León. A second legend indicated that among those from diverse nations taking part in the Reconquest was a brother of the Duke of Brittany, named Gudeman (meaning 'good man'). The legend, as related by Fernán Pérez de Guzmán, tells that Gudeman remained south of the Pyrenees, married into the lineage of Count Ramiro, and the family derived their name from him, in the derivative form of Guzmán. Fernán Pérez de Guzmán dismisses this unsupported legend, saying that there are no records of the tale, save for the memories of men.(anon.), Centón epistolario del Bachiller Fernán Gómez de Cibdareal, Generaciones y Semblanzas del Noble Caballero Fernan Perez de Guzman, Claros Varones de Castilla, y Letras de Fernando de Pulger, Madrid: Imprenta Real de Gazeta, 1775, pp. 227-8 All that is known about the authentic ancestry of founder Rodrigo Muñoz is found in his patronymic and toponymic, indicating his father was named Munio (or perhaps Nuño) and he was from Guzmán. Early historians would make Ramiro Muñoz the grandfather of Saint Dominic, but modern genealogical research finds no evidence for such a connection. One of Rodrigo's sons, Pedro Rodríguez de Guzmán was killed fighting for king Alfonso VIII of Castile at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195.Salazar y Acha, \\"Precisiones y nuevos datos . . . \\", p. 223 Pedro's son, Guillén Pérez de Guzmán, would fight for the same king at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212,Sánchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana en la plena Edad Media, vol. I, pp. 236–237, note 102 and was father of Mayor Guillén de Guzmán, one of the mistresses of king Alfonso X of Castile and by him mother of Beatrice of Castile (1242–1303), queen of Portugal.Martín Prieto, \\"La fundación del monasterio de Santa Clara de Alcocer\\", pp. 240–241 ==Rise to prominence== Coat of arms of the Duke of Medina Sidonia The family rose to greater prominence under the leadership of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán (1256–1309), otherwise known as Guzmán el Bueno (Guzmán the Good), nobleman and soldier under Sancho IV of Castile.Alonso de Haro, Libro de oro In 1282, that king's father, Alfonso X, had rewarded Guzmán's services with the town of Alcalá Sidonia, today Alcalá de los Gazules, who would exchange him that same year for the Donadío de Monteagudo (now a farmhouse in the municipality of Sanlúcar de Barrameda). In addition, the king married him to María Alfonso Coronel, a rich woman who would contribute to the marriage a very important dowry, composed of houses in the collation (feligresía) of San Miguel in Seville, olive groves of Torrijos (now a hacienda in Valencina de la Concepción), Olive groves of La Robaína (in Pilas), the town of Bollullos de la Mitación, the aceñas (flour mills) that were in the Guadalete river next to Jerez de la Frontera, the payment of La Ina vineyard (now a rural neighborhood in Jerez de la Frontera) and the vineyard payment of El Barroso (now a farmhouse in Jerez de la Frontera).[2] The Guzmán lineage continued throughout the Middle Ages in the reconquest of the southern peninsula against the Arabs and was established as a noble house of first rank, achieving its climax with the conquest of Granada, playing a leading role in the Castilian politics. This line of Guzman, like others of the Civil War of the mid-fourteenth century, within the one hundred year war, continued through the male line to change the surname for female line in the family inheritance until 1779 in the main title with that of the Álvarez de Toledo lineage.Alonso de Haro, Libro de oro Several current Spanish noble families derive from the House of Guzman: the House of Duke of Medina-Sidonia, as direct heirs of Beatriz Castilla, and its small Ducal House of Fernandina. From the House of Medinasidonia (Dukes since 1440) come the lesser noble houses of the Marquesados de Cazaza (in the House of Guzmán since 1504) and Gibraltar (created in 1390 for Enrique de Guzmán, son of the Count of Fog) from which There were and there are many gentlemen in the Cádiz region.Alonso de Haro, Libro de oro == Notes == ==References== * El libro de Oro de los reyes, Ed.

Perry, a third daughter, was born on May 10, 1894 in Greenville, South Carolina to James Margrave Perry and Jean Victoria Le Gal. Referred to as \\"Miss Jim\\", she was named after her father (a stenography and accounting teacher at Greenville Female College) who had wanted a son to carry on his name. Perry was home schooled by her mother before entering the Greenville Female College in 1909. She graduated with a B.A. in 1913 and went on to earn her Juris Doctor from the University of California, Berkeley in 1917. She was automatically admitted into the State Bar of California. Perry returned to South Carolina, and became the first female registered on May 3, 1918 to practice law in South Carolina following Governor Richard I. Manning signing a bill that gave women the opportunity to do so. She started working at Haynsworth & Haynsworth and was named as a partner in 1937. This was a historical achievement, as no other South Carolinian female lawyer at the time had been named a partner. In 1955, she became the one of the first women in the United States to chair a local bar association when she became the President of the Greenville Bar Association.

Built with numerous components (including the chassis and V8 engine) from a 1949 Ford, the KSC was built as both a production car and a kit car. It was sold at a base price of $3,495, and with options it could cost up to $5,000, which was approximately $1,000 more than the then-new Jaguar XK120. After Frank Kurtis realized that the car was not sustainable financially, largely due to production costs, he sold the KSC's manufacturing rights, along with its blueprints, parts, and tooling, to Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz for $200,000 in 1950. By that time, only 18 to 36 KSCs had been produced. In August 1949, Wally Parks, founder of the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) and co-founder of Hot Rod magazine, drove a modified KSC to on the Bonneville Salt Flats. In September 1949, that same KSC was featured on the cover of the first issue of Motor Trend. The KSC also likely inspired Harley Earl's Project Opel at General Motors (GM), which ultimately created the production Chevrolet Corvette. The KSC was additionally described as the first \\"true American sports car\\" in the 2017 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance program. == Background == In the 1920s, Frank Kurtis began his career in the automotive industry working alongside Harley Earl at Don Lee's Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. By the late 1930s, he was building oval-track midget cars and championship cars for the Indianapolis 500. During the 1950s, Kraft's company, Kurtis Kraft, would go on to build cars that would win five Indianapolis 500s. After building a Mercury-powered sports car just before World War II and similarly customizing a 1941 Buick in 1948, both of which generated serious interest and large offers from businessmen, Kraft decided to build what would become the Kurtis Sport Car (KSC). He envisioned it as a new type of sports car with American power, European handling, and modern styling. == Design == The KSC was designed as a two-seat, aluminum-body sports car by Frank Kurtis. A two-door convertible, it had a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The prototype KSC was designed in 1949, and built on a 1949 Ford chassis. It was powered by a six-cylinder, supercharged Studebaker engine. The only instrument mounted on the prototype's dashboard was a tachometer, although the car also featured a telescoping steering wheel. Low-slung in appearance, the prototype was built with fiberglass body panels, removable plexiglass side windows, and a removable hardtop. The KSC measures in height, in length, and in width. Its wheelbase is and it weighs . The KSC features a distinctive and sturdy front bumper and grille. It also boasts independent front suspension and semi- elliptic rear suspension. The production car was built with the chassis, V8 engine, suspension, and brakes from a 1949 Ford. The choice of engines offered by Kraft ranged from to . The production KSC's body panels were mostly made of aluminum supported by a steel frame, although some of its panels were made from fiberglass or steel. == Production and sale == In May 1949, Kurtis Kraft announced limited production of the KSC, with assembly occurring at its plant in Los Angeles. At the same time, it announced the KSC would also be available as a kit car. The base price for the KSC in 1949 was $3,495, and with options it could cost up to $5,000. At the high end, it was approximately $1,000 more expensive than the then-new Jaguar XK120. During 1949, Kurtis had only sold about 15 to 20 KSCs, by which point he realized that the car was not sustainable financially. In 1950, he sold the KSC's manufacturing rights, along with its blueprints, parts, and tooling, to Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz for $200,000. By the time of the sale, only 18 to 36 KSCs had been produced. Production costs were ultimately the demise of the car. == Performance == In a contemporary review, Tom McCahill of Mechanix Illustrated tested a KSC and reported a 0 to 60 mph time of 11.5 seconds and a top speed of , faster than all American production cars at the time. In August 1949, Wally Parks, founder of the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) and co-founder of Hot Rod magazine, drove a KSC powered by a performance-modified Ford V8 engine to on the Bonneville Salt Flats. == Legacy == In September 1949, the KSC that was driven by Wally Parks at Bonneville was featured on the cover of the first issue of Motor Trend. Publisher Robert E. \\"Pete\\" Petersen, who was partially inspired by Frank Kurtis to start the magazine, may have chosen the KSC for the first cover of Motor Trend in part due to his relationship with Kurtis. That car, the first production KSC and the third built overall (serial number KB003), was purchased by Motor Trend in 2019 and put on display at its headquarters in El Segundo, California. That year, 70 years after reviewing it for its first issue, Motor Trend decided to test KB003, finding that it weighed , had a 0 to 60 mph time of 15.3 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 20.0 seconds. After buying the rights to the KSC in 1950, \\"Madman\\" Muntz proceeded to create the Muntz Car Company and redevelop the car into what eventually became the Muntz Jet. He lost money on the endeavor and ceased production in 1954. By 1951, just two years after the KSC appeared on the cover of Motor Trend, Harley Earl had created a secret program at General Motors (GM) known as Project Opel. Its goal was to create a fiberglass-bodied car using production components, similar to what Kraft had attempted with the KSC. First unveiled at Motorama in 1953 as the EX-122, the resulting GM car eventually entered production as the Chevrolet Corvette. A 1949 KSC won the Motor Trend Classic Award – Editor's Choice at the 2010 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, while a different 1949 KSC won Best in Class for Kurtis street vehicles at the 2011 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance. The 2017 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance program described the KSC as the first \\"true American sports car\\". At the 2019 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance auction, a 1950 KSC sold for $263,200. == References == == Sources == * * * == External links == * Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1949 ","title":"Kurtis Sport Car"},{"id":"61597144","text":"F C H Hohlenberg Frantz Christopher Henrik HohlenbergDansk Militærhistorie – Eric NielsenDansk Biografisk Lexicon VII p 505-506 was a Danish naval officer who specialised in ship design and had little seagoing experience. ==Career== Born 18 February 1764, (or possibly 16 February 1765Topsøe-Jensen Vol 1 page 585 ) he became a junior lieutenant in the Danish Navy at the age of 18 and began an apprenticeship with the Danish Construction Commission. Soon after his appointment, he made a study tour of naval establishments of southern Europe, and later of Sweden and Russia. He was considered the most gifted of Henrik Gerner's pupils when Gerner was fabrikmester at Copenhagen and inherited all of Gerner's papers on the latter's death. In 1795 he became a lecturer in shipbuilding at the Naval Cadet Academy and at the same time a fully fledged member of the Construction Commission. Promoted to the most senior lieutenant's rankKapitejnlieutenant – immediately below full captain in rank in 1796, he became interim fabrikmester (master shipbuilder to the Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy) as his predecessor E W Stibolt retired on health grounds,Political and personal rivalries made the position of fabrikmester a very stressful post! a position confirmed in 1797. In 1801 he was appointed to the Defence Commission. A report which disapproved of his handling of the building of the frigate Rota upset him greatly and at the age of 38, in 1803, Hohlenberg resigned his post and travelled to the Danish West Indies to become harbourmaster and chief pilot at Christiansted on St Croix. He died shortly after arrival on 9 January 1804. He was buried on the island, but the position of his grave was not recorded. The position of fabrikmester at the Danish Naval Dockyards remained unfilled until, in 1810, Jens Jøgen Pihl was appointed. ==Hohlenberg's ships== Of the four ships-of-the-line built to Hohlemberg's designs, three were seized by the British at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) and used by British shipyards. Their design and build qualities were greatly admired by the British naval officers who later served in them. Eleven frigates are also attributed to Hohlenberg along with a number of lesser ships which suffered from being too narrow in the beam. It may have been this latter characteristic that was responsible for the loss of HDMS Hvide Ørn (1798) which capsized with the loss of all hands (including Frantz Hohlenberg's younger brother, JohanTopsøe- Jensen Vol 1 page 587)in the Mediterranean the year after it was commissioned.Record card for HDMS Hvide Ørn ;4 ships-of-the-line; *Christian den Syvende (84), Norge (78), and Prindsesse Caroline (66) were among those captured at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) and added to the British Royal Navy *Prinds Christian Frederik was destroyed in March 1808 at the Battle of Zealand Point ;13 frigates; Of the thirteen Hohlenberg frigates built prior to 1807, nine were captured by the British Royal Navy at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807).

Tactics employed by the force have led to misconduct allegations and protesters have accused the Hong Kong government of using the police as a method to resolve a \\"lingering political crisis.\\" Actions taken by the police force and the Hong Kong government have caused mixed reactions inside Hong Kong and in the general international community. Allegations against the police include excessive use of force, force against unspecific targets, and arrest without warrant. These allegations have been presented in various media both supporting and detracting from the complaints, such as through amateur video. In general, the spirit, rumors, videos, and other media shared by the public have caused a drop in support for the police force, and an Amnesty International report accused the police of using excessive force against civilians. One of the objectives of the 2019–20 protests is establishment of an independent inquiry system into said allegations. Although the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) – a body accused of lacking independence and being impotent – has launched investigations into alleged police misconduct in relation to the protests, some members of the public remain dissatisfied with the escalation of police violence. Protesters contend said violence is often disproportionate and have called for an independent commission of inquiry to be established. Many observers have demanded the Hong Kong government conduct a \\"prompt, independent, impartial investigation\\" on police use of force against protesters, but police unions often raise complaints about this, citing statute and stating that the IPCC is enough. Joining Hong Kong police unions in this matter is Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has steadfastly resisted these calls, citing \\"very, very, very limited\\" room for manoeuvre. In September 2019, Lam established a panel of foreign experts to work with the IPCC to report on its findings, but several members resigned in November 2019, citing inadequate powers given to the body. More extreme protesters have called for the force to be disbanded, citing the increasing rates of violence. == Background == Once heralded as \\"Asia's Finest\\", the public approval rating of the Hong Kong Police Force fell drastically during 2019. Between 1997 and 2010, the police enjoyed net positive approval from the mid-50 to mid-70 percent levels. It reached an all-time low as a result of its actions during the Umbrella Revolution, a similar movement that took place in 2014. According to Hong Kong historian Jason Wordie, since the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China, loyalty and political reliability at all levels of the governing apparatus have been valued greatly by the Chinese government. In the case of the HKPF, the regime explicitly prioritises ethical \\"flexibility\\" and loyalty to directives, as well as obedience to orders. Alleged police brutality has played a significant role in fuelling public anger and driving the protests; the position of both sides became more entrenched as the protests progressed. Hongkongers' initial shock at the usage of tear gas by the police and their use of batons contributed to 2 million people rallying on 16 June. Since then, water cannons laced with blue dye and other skin irritants, projectiles such as beanbags, rubber and sponge-tipped bullets, pepper spray; baton charges and mass arrests, common riot control tactics, have seen increased use. In the six months since the protests began, police have fired 16,000 rounds of tear gas, 10,000 rubber bullets, and some 2,000 rounds of bean bags and 2,000 rounds of sponge bullets. Suspected triads have also attacked demonstrators, with allegedly little or no apparent reaction from the police force, which fuelled a rumor of criminal collusion. Armed with rudimentary protection and facing-off against well-armed police, protesters have thrown rocks, bricks, and Molotov cocktails; used poles, street barricades and slingshots for fighting; vandalised businesses symbolising oppression from the authoritarian PRC regime; and targeted metro stations because of its operator's complicity with police in restricting people's freedom to protest. By the end of 2019, more than 6,000 protesters had been arrested and approximately 2,600 people had been treated at public hospital emergency wards. After a brief suspension, police reinstated an officer who on 11 November had driven his motorcycle into a crowd of protesters. There have been numerous other cases of alleged police brutality, and dissidents accuse the force of not disciplining their officers appropriately. A senior part-time officer was suspended from duty over allegedly leaking operational plans for New Year's Eve to a Telegram group. == Accountability == === Leadership and supervision === Complaints against the police are handled within the police force by the Complaints Against Police Office (CAPO), whose work is monitored by the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) – a government-appointed entity staffed by laypersons independent of the police. The body lacks credibility with some members of the public as its appointees are predominantly pro-establishment, and a significant number among them are allied with CY Leung, the previous chief executive officer. The council has no power to subpoena documents or witnesses, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties. A panel of international experts was hired to assist the IPCC investigate the 2019 protests, and it proposed giving it more power to launch a full investigation into officers' conduct. When this request was denied, many members of the panel resigned. Security consultant and former police officer, Martin Purbrick, said that the police organisation is beset with organisational and management problems. Its rigid structure and culture \\"does not lend itself to creative ideas from junior management in times when existing rules are not working\\". Management has demonstrably been unable or unwilling to control rogue elements in the force. The police have often defended their actions with provocative explanations, and an analysis in Quartz suggested that police responses to criticism reflect their confidence that they will not be investigated. Head of HKPORI, Dr Robert Chung, said that the police had completely deviated from the good practices set up in 1994 under the Service Quality Wing. He suggested trust could be restored by greater discipline of police officers, whose lack of self-control had led to an escalation of civil violence; he also believed all uniformed officers should clearly display their identification on the field and refrain from infiltrating demonstrators. The case of Indonesian journalist Veby Indah highlights the difficulty for victims of police violence in holding police accountable. Indah, while covering a protest for the Indonesian-language newspaper Suara, lost sight in one eye after being hit by a projectile allegedly fired by a police officer on 29 September 2019 as she was filming. Her request to the Hong Kong Police Force for the identity of the officer responsible remained outstanding at the end of December. Since the protests against the ill-fated bill began, Hong Kong authorities have relied on the city's police to maintain order in the face of mounting protests. Not only has the government invoked sweeping colonial-era laws to ban the wearing of masks, it has eased operating restraints of the police: A leaked document showed the government loosened guidelines on the use of lethal force one day before a student was shot: \\"officers will be accountable for their own actions\\" was deleted from guidelines. The lack of restraint exercised by the police, to the extent that being captured on film is no longer a deterrent to misconduct, has undermined its standing and legitimacy in society. Although chief secretary Matthew Cheung apologised for the delayed police response to the violence in Yuen Long, saying the force's handling of the incident \\"[fell] short of people's expectations\\", he backtracked the next day after police unions reacted angrily. Cheung then proclaimed that the police had \\"fulfilled its duties in maintaining social order under enormous stress at this difficult time\\". Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam continued to support the police and refused outright to criticise their conduct, let alone set up an independent judicial inquiry. More than 30 leaders from across society, notably including former chief justice Andrew Li, have publicly called on the administration to launch an independent inquiry, but this is staunchly opposed by police unions. The newly-promoted commissioner Chris Tang said that independent scrutiny would be an \\"injustice\\" and a \\"tool for inciting hatred\\" against the force. Government opposition to an independent inquiry has lent credence to the idea that it actively endorses police violence. No police have been held accountable for their excesses as at the end of December 2019. The inevitable conclusion many members of the public have drawn is that the police have total immunity. Police sources of Washington Post have said that a culture of impunity pervades the police force, such that riot police often disregard their training or became dishonest in official reports to justify excessive force. Commenting on police performance against guidelines one officer said that \\"commanders are too afraid to upset the front-line officers, so if their behavior is not too far away from the guidelines, then they’ll just turn a blind eye [to excesses]\\". ===Lack of identification=== According to Police General Orders set by the commissioner of police, plain-clothes officers must show their warrant cards and explain their identities while exercising their police power and dealing with the public. While uniformed officers must to show their warrant cards unless it would \\"affect the operations, harm the safety of the officers, or if the requests were unreasonable\\", members of the Special Tactical Squad (STS), known as \\"raptors\\", apparently stopped displaying identification numbers during crowd control operations on 12 June 2019, while press photographs taken just two days earlier showed officers displaying them. In the Legislative Council, secretary of justice John Lee defended the change, saying that the uniform has \\"no room\\" to display the identification numbers. The pan-democrats criticised the lack of identification, saying that their absence would make officers unaccountable. The issue of law enforcers without visible identification has been a major source of complaints since the protests erupted. There was considerable public anger at on-duty police officers failing to display their numbers or warrant cards during a demonstration in early July 2019. It is contended that the lack of numbers is a tactic to avoid responsibility. As of October 2019 there were at least five judicial reviews against the police force about officers not displaying their identifying numbers on their uniform. Since the invocation of the emergency law, officers began wearing face masks, making identification even more difficult. The police have defended officers' use of \\"protective gear\\". Vice-president of the IPCC, Christopher Cheung, claimed that members of the STS squad have the right to hide their identification number because they \\"have to enforce laws without having to worry about the consequences\\". He backtracked a day later, although he expressed fears that officers' identification numbers might be misused. However, by October, police said they had put in place a system of unique identifiers so that an officer could be identified even without his or her warrant number. == Use of force== Since 12 June 2019, police use of force has been frequently criticised. There is verifiable footage and witness statements by lawyers, first aiders, and others, all cataloguing the indiscrimate use of crowd control weapons and firearms against protesters and innocent bystanders alike, where individuals who get in the way of police receive a dose in their face. A database was compiled by the Washington Post of 65 incidents evenly spread between each month featuring police use of force between June and November, which took into account every crowd-control tool used by Hong Kong police, and police responses to both peaceful and violent protests. According to nine policing experts assembled by the newspaper to analyse the videos for adherence to the HKPF's guidelines and international standards, Hong Kong police had violated their own rules in about 70 percent of the incidents reviewed; the use of force could be justified under police guidelines in only five of the incidents. As demonstrators' use of bombs and bricks increased, public opinion polls showed that far more people blamed the government and police than protesters despite increasing violence by protesters. Amnesty International published a report on 21 June 2019 that contained eight video clips, and concluded that the police's use of force had violated international human rights laws and standards. Subsequent reports by the NGO were based on interviews of protesters who alleged that the police had used excessive violence against them, including being punched and being hit using batons, even in instances with no active resistance. Of 21 people interviewed, 18 had been treated in hospital and three had been hospitalised for five days or more. On the evening of 21 June, protesters besieged the police headquarters in Wan Chai for 15 hours to protest against police violence on 12 June. The police were criticised by the organisation for using rubber bullets dangerously (by using it as a crowd dispersal weapon and injuring a protester's head on 12 June) During a confrontation with students from the City University of Hong Kong, the commander of the police force allegedly ordered police officers to shoot the student protesters in the head with rubber bullets. The police were also criticised for using pepper spray on a person who posed no obvious threat, and for the use of force on peaceful or retreating protesters. Usage of bean bag rounds allegedly ruptured a female protester's right eye on 11 August. The police denied shooting the protester in the head and suggested that evidence was inconclusive. However, on 29 September, the right eye of journalist Veby Mega Indah was permanently blinded after she was shot by a rubber bullet. Indah was standing away from the protesters with a group of journalists who identified themselves by wearing bright yellow vests and helmets with stickers and press cards on lanyards around their necks. Chief inspector John Tse regretted the injury, saying it was a pure accident. Tse argued that journalists and demonstrators were both at the scene, and demonstrators had thrown at least two petrol bombs from the bridge. On 11 August the police fired pepper-ball rounds at protesters at point-blank range inside Tai Koo MTR station. The police claimed that its use of these weapons aligned with the manufacturer's safety guidelines, though in fact the safety warning pointed out that the weapon should not be used at close range. Prince Edward station and attack civilians on 31 August 2019 Some incidents of police violence have been described as showing disregard for public safety. When the police stormed into New Town Plaza and Yuen Long station on 14 and 28 July 2019, respectively, they trapped bystanders and commuters inside. Police officers were also accused of beating uninvolved bystanders with police batons. In the Tsuen Wan protest, a police officer kicked a man who was already kneeling before the officer. An elderly woman begging an officer not to use pepper spray to disperse the crowd was forcefully pushed away by the officer in question. The police responded by saying that the women had \\"obstructed\\" the police during the 1 December protest. When the STS squad stormed the Prince Edward station and assaulted the passengers and protesters inside with police batons and pepper spray on 31 August, it was once again accused of using excessive force against unarmed and non-resisting civilians. The police action was heavily condemned by the pan- democratic camp, whose convenor, Claudia Mo, called it a \\"licensed terror attack\\"; Amnesty International called the police operation that day a \\"rampage\\", and called for a investigation on police's conduct. Underground physiotherapists and doctors were faced with patients with serious injuries that are obviously from brutal beatings such as bone fractures with serious dislocations that will never heal. On 1 October 2019 a police officer shot with live ammunition at close range an 18-year-old man wielding a pipe. The man was attempting to strike the police officer, who had run in with a drawn revolver to rescue another officer who had been chased and beaten to the ground by a crowd of protesters wielding pipes. Protesters accused the officer of trying to kill the man, claiming that the force used by the protesters was insufficient to justify the use of live ammunition and that the officer had less lethal weapons at his disposal. That day, five other live rounds were fired in various locations. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \\"Whilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate and only risks inflaming the situation\\". The police defended the officer's actions, saying that the officer's and his colleague's lives were at risk. On 14 October 2019, Hong Kong police shot a 14-year-old child in the leg with a live round. Police claim that the shot was meant to have been fired into the air and that the shooting was accidental. The third shooting incident occurred in Sai Wan Ho on 11 November 2019. A traffic cop drew his service weapon at an unarmed white-clad man near a roadblock and then grappled with him. He then shot a black-clad protester whom the police accused of trying to wrest the gun from him. The 21-year-old man was rushed to hospital with injury to liver and kidney; another protester who was shot needed no emergency operation. On 17 November 2019, during a clash between the police and protestors in the area around Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a long- range sound device was used and police warned that live rounds would be used if they met with \\"deadly weapons\\". The press found that Raptors equipped with AR-15 were patrolling around the clash zones. === Mistreatment of detainees === Hong Kong police subduing a protester Since the protests began, police officers have come under criticism as images and videos surfaced showing their treatment of protesters who had been arrested. There have been numerous instances where officers have been accused of abusing protesters after they had been subdued, and the police have either denied or been provocative in their responses. Riot police officers have been seen in online videos surrounding subdued protesters, kicking, punching, or clubbing them, to be stopped only by residents or by colleagues. Another common technique is kneeling on the necks of protesters to subdue them; or banging demonstrator's heads to the ground, causing further injury; stomping on the heads of subdued protesters during arrests are commonplace. Police also often dragged already subdued protesters along the ground – a tactic defended by the claim that they had been \\"uncooperative\\". In widely circulated video recordings of an alleged assault on 21 September in Yuen Long, an unarmed volunteer from the Protect Our Kids Campaign was arrested and taken to an alley and surrounded by about 30 riot police officers and apparently abused. The volunteer, having shouted at a police officer who had pepper-sprayed a 73-year-old colleague, was then dragged into the midst of a group of police and kicked. He was later taken to hospital. The incident was filmed by a local resident; police attempted to disrupt the filming by shining flashlights at the camera. In response to the allegation, Senior Superintendent Vasco Williams asserted that officers had kicked a \\"yellow object\\", Police finally acknowledged that the \\"object\\" in the video was indeed a man, but denied officers had kicked the man, who police accuse of having bitten an officer. Claudia Mo condemned Williams for dehumanising the protesters. The assault is a reminder of an incident during the 2014 Hong Kong protests in which seven police officers dragged an activist into a secluded location and took turns to assault him for several minutes. The police were also accused of tampering with evidence. When Fong Chung-yin was arrested for possessing \\"offensive weapons\\" – which were found to be unpowered laser pointers – police officers inserted batteries into his laser pointers to show to the press that laser pointers can cause a fire. The press expressed concern that the police had interfered with the judicial process. A video of an arrest of a protester on 11 August appeared to show a police officer placing a stick inside the protestor's backpack, but the police force denied accusations and said that the protester had held the stick before he was arrested. While the police maintain that they have respected the \\"privacy, dignity and rights\\" of those in custody according to regulations, allowing detainees transport to hospitals and communication with lawyers and their families\\", Amnesty International criticised them for \\"arbitrary arrest and retaliatory violence against arrested persons in custody\\", and described some of these violent actions as \\"torture\\". In some of the cases, the police were found shining laser lights directly into a detainee's eyes in an attempt to retaliate, and beating detainees for maintaining the right to silence. Some detainees reported sustaining injuries ranging from head wounds to fractured arms following their arrests and some were admitted to hospital after their detention. In September, 31 people detained in San Uk Ling were sent to North District Hospital, among whom six were seriously injured with bone fractures. The police prevented lawmakers from inspecting the San Uk Ling Holding Centre, where many of the detainees were held. The request by six justices of the peace to visit the centre was rejected. The police ceased using the holding centre to \\"stop speculations\\". Robert Godden, the cofounder of Rights Exposure, a British human rights group, reported that arrestees were deprived of sleep and had limited access to food. He also reported hearing \\"howls of pain\\" that had \\"went on for five minutes\\" during his time in detention inside a police station in Ho Man Tin. In May 2020, local human rights group Civil Rights Observer criticised the police for allegedly \\"systematically\\" infringing the human rights of the detainees, who have reported being beaten by police with baton inside the station. One interviewee added that officers slammed his head into the door of a police car repeatedly. The organisation can be amounted as violations of United Nations Convention against Torture. The police were accused of sexually abusing protesters. In Tin Shui Wai, the crotch of a female protester was exposed during the arrest process. The female protester in question also alleged that an officer verbally abused her, calling her \\"prostitute\\". A female protester accused police officers of conducting a gloveless strip search on her and allegedly using a pen to spread her legs open. The police denied the accusation. A student from Chinese University of Hong Kong accused a male police of hitting her breast during her detention in the San Uk Ling Holding Centre and reported that other detainees \\"have suffered sexual assaults and torture by more than one officer, regardless of gender\\". According to a survey by Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women (ACSVAW), 23 women out of 221 respondents blamed the police for sexually harassing them, eight of them reporting that they suffered sexual violence while they were in detention. Some detainees reported that the police had denied them access to lawyers. Some lawyers have reported that the police have obstructed them from meeting their clients, and that they were reluctant to co-operate. === Climate of fear === A police officer draws his gun against protesters The Hong Kong Police Force has been accused of instilling a general climate of fear: The police were also accused of making arbitrary arrests by the Amnesty International. Lawmaker Ted Hui added that the police, after failing to arrest the radical protesters, turned to arrest peaceful protesters, bystanders, young people in general, and people wearing black clothes. The allegations resurfaced after a rally on New Year's Day, during which more than 400 people were arrested, including three members from Civil Rights Observer. Police have admitted that some of the detainees may have been innocent bystanders, but said that such people would be released \\"after further enquiries\\". Legislator Alvin Yeung said that mass arrests were \\"totally unreasonable and groundless\\", and demanded if police had \\"any instructions or any legal basis to conduct the preemptive arrests\\" On 23 June 2019, representatives from the medical, health services, and legal sectors on the Hong Kong Election Committee jointly proclaimed that police had arrested five people seeking public hospital treatment after having eavesdropped on nurses' conversations, and threatened some nurses to try to obtain patient details. The representatives urged the police to respect patient confidentiality, so that patients can seek the care they needed from hospitals without fear. The staff from Tuen Mun Hospital staged a sit-in on 18 October to protest that male officers were being allowed to enter the hospital's maternity ward; armed riot police had also intruded in the hospital, disrupting its operations and scaring patients and staff. As police had been conducted hospital arrests, protesters became reluctant to go to public hospitals for treatment. Pierre Chan, the lawmaker representing the Medical sector, claimed to have evidence that police had access to data on patients \\"because of a loophole\\". He added that many of those injured in protests opted not to go for treatment for fear of arrest, and those medical professionals treating the wounded feared being charged by the police. Underground mobile clinics sprang up, operating out of borrowed cars, which many patients attended, often staffed by junior doctors who wished to remain anonymous, fearing arrest or repercussions from their employers. Police banned a protest in Yuen Long on 27 July due to fears that protesters may have clashed with local villagers. But after that protest, the police continued to ban marches in various places in Hong Kong. On 18 August, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) held an approved rally at Victoria Park, and went ahead with an unauthorised march, which more than a million people attended. The demonstration was largely peaceful and CHRF filed a judicial review challenging the police decision to ban the demonstration. As police had rarely banned marches previously, CHRF representatives criticised the more recent bans by the police, alleging that refusal to issue permits had eroded Hong Kong's freedom of demonstration. On 29 and 30 August, just a day before the proposed march on 31 August, the police arrested at least eight high-profile activists, including Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Chan Ho-tin, as well as lawmakers including Cheng Chung-tai and Jeremy Tam. RTHK reported that Au Nok- hin was arrested for allegedly assaulting and obstructing a police officer during a protest on 8 July, while Apple Daily reported that the lawmaker was accused of assaulting the officer with a megaphone that was \\"too loud\\". Demosisto's vice-chairperson Isaac Cheng condemned the police for rounding up various activists to frighten Hong Kong people from protesting, even though these protests have been leaderless. The treatment of medical and paramedic personnel at the hands of the police during the siege of Polytechnic University was criticised by Hong Kong surgeon Darren Mann as having a \\"chilling effect [on] would-be volunteers from offering their services in the much-needed medical care of injured people\\". ==Crowd control tactics== A water cannon being fired The moment that a police water cannon sprays blue-dyed water at Kowloon Mosque, on 20 October 2019. Around 10 followers and citizens were outside the Mosque. === Undercover operatives as agents provocateurs === The police were accused of using undercover officers to infiltrate the protesters. These officers refused to show their identification numbers when approached by journalists. Then-deputy police chief Chris Tang admitted that the Force had deployed undercover officers who were disguised as various \\"characters,\\" but he refused to disclose how many agents were involved. Undercover officers have been accused of committing arson: a video circulating on the internet showed what appeared to be undercover officers who proceeded to set fire to the Wan Chai MTR station. Another showed Molotov cocktails thrown in the Wan Chai area by black bloc who appeared to have distinctive markers of police operatives. Senior Superintendent Kelvin Kong said that undercover operatives' main objective was to arrest radical and violent protesters; he rejected claims that officers partook in arson, saying \\"The police would never commit any illegal acts, let alone arson, when we are in disguise.\\" Another video showed plain-clothes officers exiting a police vehicle and proceeding to dig up bricks from the pavement; the police had no comment. The police were found to have deployed undercover officers during the 31 August protest, one of whom fired a warning shot. Police claimed that the undercover officer has identified himself before shooting. An officer dressed as a black bloc protester was found inside Sheung Shui station which was closed at the time. When the officer realised he was being recorded, he aimed his flashlight at the camera and threatened to pepper spray the cameraman. The police have since acknowledged that he was a plain-clothed officer \\"conducting an investigation.\\" There have been incidents where riot police have mistaken undercover operatives as protesters when making arrests or when using pepper spray; police claimed these to have been \\"misunderstandings,\\" leading to accusations that either uniformed police have been acting abusively and arbitrarily, or that the plainclothes officers had committed unlawful acts and were caught by riot police. === Teargas usage === The police used tear gas to disperse the protesters The Hong Kong Police Force fired more than 10,000 volleys of tear gas in the five months between the start of protests in June 2019 and November 2019. Police were criticised by pan-democrat legislators for firing teargas at the CITIC Tower from several directions on 12 June, effectively forcing a group of protesters against the building because it was impossible to evacuate. Police use of tear gas often affected bystanders, and children, the elderly, and pets residing near protests. The public has complained of tear gas being shot near a home for the elderly and in the corridor of a public housing estate. Police have been observed firing tear gas on empty roads after the protestors had retreated or dispersed, or lobbed over walls of a police station – a tactic defended as necessary to create safe buffer. A set of non-lethal weapon cartridges used by the police Several video clips captured tear gas canisters apparently being fired from high up of the Government Headquarters, which Police Foundation president, Jim Bueermann described as \\"reckless\\" and potentially lethal because of the velocity canisters fired from a height can attain by the time they reach ground level. The police denied improper use, claiming the canisters filmed were \\"optical illusion\\" of canisters that had been fired from lower levels. Police shooting sponge grenades from the rooftop of Kwun Tong police station on 4 August was also against international safety guidelines. Deployment of tear gas inside Kwai Fong station on 11 August was condemned by experts, as indoor use may cause a stampede and the concentrated chemicals pose severe health risks without adequate ventilation. Media was concerned about the use of tear gas as it may harm innocent commuters, and accused the police – who called the station a \\"semi-open space\\" – of creating a \\"gas chamber\\". Since 28 July civilians and protesters have collected spent canisters and found that some of the used cannisters had been past their use-by date. On 12 August the police admitted that they had used \\"canisters of tear gas past their use-by date\\". Karen Mak, a lecturer from University of Hong Kong, told RTHK that expired tear gas, upon heating, may produce toxic gases such as phosgene and cyanide, though the police insisted that the expired tear gas would not induce additional harmful effects. Citizens have been directly hit and injured by exploding tear gas canisters. On 2 November a volunteer medic was struck and seriously burned. The medic, a student of Hong Kong Shue Yan University (SYU), did not have a gas mask and was surrounded only by journalists and other medics at the time of the incident. The university expressed \\"serious concern\\" over the incident and requested details from the police, as SYU students rallied in support of the injured medic and condemned police violence. The extensive use of tear gas sparked public health concerns as residents feared that when heated, the chemicals may react and release dioxin. A reporter was diagnosed with chloracne, a condition associated with over-exposure to dioxins, following sustained exposure to tear gas. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department have refused to disclose the chemical composition of the gas, as the police wished to keep it secret. The Department of Health and Hong Kong Poison Information Centre of Hospital Authority reported that there was no literature or scientific evidence on dioxin poisoning cases from tear gas exposure. The Environmental Protection Department suggested that they had found no anomalies in dioxin concentration levels. Secretary Wong Kam-sing commented that the burning of items by protesters would be the cause for any increase in dioxin concentration. === Kettling === Police kettled a group of protesters near the CITIC Tower on 12 June. Streams of teargas forced protesters against the building with nowhere to go. During the 14 July protest in Sha Tin, conflict broke out inside New Town Plaza after the police stormed the shopping centre and prevented people inside from leaving. The police had ordered the closure of the MTR station, which is accessible through the mall, making it impossible for people to evacuate. The Civil Rights Observer criticised this tactic as risking the safety of other bystanders, while Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung accused police of \\"chasing people like a pack of wolves, pepper-spraying and beating them indiscriminately\\", and asked the police to publicly explain why they concluded that there were unlawful activities inside the mall that warranted fully equipped riot police moving in. Yeung questioned why police failed to stop further ingress and to give sufficient time for bystanders inside to evacuate. As a consequence, more than 20 people were admitted to hospital – two in critical condition and four with serious injuries. === Cutting short rallies === During the Reclaim Tuen Mun Park march on 21 September 2019, the police displayed a warning flag several minutes after the legal, authorized march has begun. Two and a half hours after the official start, and while many were still waiting to leave the starting point, police abruptly withdrew their approval for an authorised rally on New Year's Day, citing violence, and required all demonstrators to disperse within 30 to 45 minutes; 400 people were arrested, many for illegal assembly, including three human rights observers. The organisers criticised the police order to disperse the million marchers within such a short period was not reasonable. Alvin Yeung criticised the cancellation and subsequent arrests as being tantamount to be entrapment for illegal assembly. === Impact on reporting === Police officer draws his gun on a reporter on 29 February 2020. The police have been accused of interfering with freedom of the press and of assaulting journalists during protests. Incidents cited by journalist associations include being assaulted or being \\"deliberately jostled\\", of which 27 cases were documented in June alone; pushed, beaten, and pepper-sprayed; and shining strobes or other high-intensity lighting at journalists or blocking line of sight to prevent or obstruct reporting. These actions, according to Hong Kong Journalists Association, were perpetrated by the police even after yellow-vested journalists had disclosed their identities. On 6 August, a reporter from Tai Kung Pao was temporarily detained for assaulting a police officer. During the 31 August protests, police refused to let reporters enter Prince Edward station – which the HKJA condemned as an infringement of their rights. In the absence of trustworthy sources, rumours about deaths spread like wildfire, further eroding trust. Journalists were also surrounded by uniformed officers and prevented from asking suspected undercover officers questions. In September, Committee to Protect Journalists cited news reports and online videos and noted that police had targeted teargas canisters directly at several people in Causeway Bay who were clearly identified as journalists. One projectile hit a journalist in the helmet and then exploded near another. After implementation of the anti-mask law, officers were observed forcibly removing reporters' respirators and masks, despite clarification by secretary John Lee that reporters were exempted from the law. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong – which had called for an independent investigation into police violence against journalists and interference with the media's right to cover the protests under the law since start of the protests in June – once again expressed its concern in September that violence against journalists and interference of their work were continuing unabated. Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) and the Press Photographers Association (HKPRA) issued a joint statement alleging that some police officers had treated journalists brutally and obstructed their work by pepper-spraying them in a weekend protest in Kowloon, and decried violence and intimidation directed at journalists. During the clashes between protesters and police, nine journalists from different media were affected and two had pepper-spray directed at their faces. Some were also shot by rubber bullets, or sprayed by water cannon trucks. Their equipment was also damaged by the police. Due to sustained exposure to tear gas, some journalists reported having symptoms such as breathing difficulty and persistent coughing. The HKJA staged a silent march against police brutality on 14 July which attracted 1,500 people, and the association had already filed at least 10 complaints relating to these injuries to the Independent Police Complaints Council. Indonesian journalist Veby Mega Indah's right eye was permanently blinded after she was hit by a rubber bullet at close range on 29 September. Police said that some people dressed as journalists had \\"counterfeit press badges\\" and had \\"attacked police officers\\". On 28 October 2019, Hong Kong Free Press photojournalist May James was arrested while working in Mong Kok. According to the Foreign Correspondents Club, although she had been wearing a press vest and was carrying a valid press pass and other credentials, she was arrested and held overnight before being freed the next day. Police said that James was uncooperative, and had \\"refused to comply\\" when asked for her ID card, and James said she was probably arrested for asking masked officers to display their warrant cards. James had been arrested following an afternoon rally in Tsim Sha Tsui, during which police reportedly behaved violently toward other journalists. Six reporters from different news organisations staged a silent protest at a routine police press conference on 4 November, when each wore a safety helmet with one Chinese character, which, when combined, read \\"investigate police violence, stop police lies\\" (). Police suspended the conference as the reporters refused to either take off their helmets or leave the venue, stopped its online live stream, and cancelled the entire press conference 20 minutes later. Coinciding with the protest they coordinated, HKJA and the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association issued a statement denouncing the arbitrary arrest of journalists. Later that day the police staged a live broadcast on Facebook to express their views on the protests over the weekend. In late November, i-Cable News became the first news organisation in Hong Kong to lodge a formal complaint against the police with the CAPO for mistreatment of at least 23 of its staff over the previous five months. The catalogue of incidents included being obstructed from reporting, pushed, pepper-sprayed, tear-gassed, hit with water cannon, and targeted with strong flashlights, and had their gas masks forcibly removed. The HKJA and the HKPRA accused a police officer of doxxing after the officer had stopped and searched a reporter and deliberately held his ID card in front of a live- streaming camera. Police admitted that \\"[t]here was something inappropriate about the police officer who was responsible for stopping and searching [the reporter]\\", and promised to \\"actively look into the incident\\", while the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said that there was \\"prima facie evidence\\" the law had been broken.' A journalist from NBC accused the police of sexually assaulting her during the protest on 26 January. She was then pepper-sprayed after she attempted to ask other officers the ID number of the said officer. === Impact on first-aid services === The police were accused of arresting first aiders with false accusations, which prompted hospital staff to stage sit-in protests. The police were also accused of obstructing emergency medical treatment for arrested protesters. For instance, the police prevented first-aid workers from treating the wounded after the police stormed and locked down Prince Edward station on 31 August. Legislator and medical professional Kwok Ka-ki called that police strategy a \\"behaviour unbefitting of monsters\\". After university student Chow Tsz-lok fell from the third floor of a car park to the second floor during a police dispersal operation in Tseung Kwan O, the police were accused of obstructing an ambulance from reaching him, delaying his treatment. Chow died four days later. But Leung Kwok-lai, the Fire Services Department assistant chief ambulance officer (Kowloon East), however, stated that the ambulance assigned to Chow was blocked by buses and private vehicles but that the ambulance did not come in contact with the police that were on duty. The police arrested 51 volunteer medics during the siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and held them. Police claimed that protesters were disguising themselves as medical workers, but Dr Arisina Ma, president of Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, criticised the police for arresting the medical workers and detaining them for 24 hours and then forcing them to post bail instead of simply checking their professional identification and releasing them. Surgeon Darren Mann, who had witnessed medics being hogtied and who had telephoned both the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres asking them to intervene, criticised the police for treating medical personnel like terrorists. Writing in Lancet, he called police arrests of these first-aid workers \\"almost unheard of in civilised countries\\". With PolyU under complete lockdown, wounded protesters inside were deprived of all forms of first aid, until the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières intervened. === Use of water cannons and other police vehicles === On 20 October 2019, police clearance actions saw blue-dyed water being sprayed on the gates of the Kowloon Mosque, leading to condemnation by CHRF and the Muslim community in Hong Kong. The police and chief executive Carrie Lam apologised to the Muslim leaders. But the former Indian Association of Hong Kong president Mohan Chugani, who was sprayed outside the mosque alongside lawmaker Jeremy Tam and businessman Phillip Khan, refused to accept Lam's apology, while Khan believed that the police intentionally sprayed the mosque and that the act was an \\"insult to the Islamic religion\\". A traffic police officer was accused of driving his motorcycle into a crowd of protesters in Kwai Chung on 11 November, resulting in two injuries. The officer was then suspended from duty and the police explained that the motorcyclist \\"tried to separate his colleagues and the rioters\\" after an officer had temporarily lost his vision from protesters spraying an unknown substance in his face. On 18 November, in Yau Ma Tei, a police van suddenly accelerated into a crowd of protesters, causing a stampede in which STS officers exiting from the van chased after protesters; the police defended the high-speed driving by their officers: \\"[driving] fast doesn't mean it is unsafe\\". The police denied the stampede, but it was confirmed by the Fire Services Department. ===Obstruction of justice=== On the evening of 13 April 2020, the police intercepted a 21-year-old college student in Kwai Fong Estate near Kwai Chung Police Station and found 2 petrol bombs in their bags. After further investigations, a police officer was suspected of attempting to frame the protester for throwing a petrol bomb at the Police Station. On 20 April, a 38-year-old sergeant stationed in Kwai Tsing Police District was arrested for alleged \\"obstructing justice\\" as he self-directed the petrol bomb case. === Police requirements on surgical masks of arrestees === Several arrestees at a protest on 31 March 2020 were required by police to remove the metal strips from the surgical masks which they wore as a protection against the coronavirus pandemic, saying that these posed a danger. On 1 April, some lawyers and legislators condemned this requirement as an abuse of the health crisis. ===COVID-19 restrictions=== After the government had passed a law banning social gatherings of more than four persons during the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong police issued warnings protestors for violating the restrictions. Civil Rights Observer, a human rights organisation, criticised the police for suppressing \\"expression and peaceful assemblies\\". The police responded by saying that their actions have strengthened \\"citizen’s vigilance and discipline for public health\\". === Verbal abuse === Police officers face accusations of verbally assaulting protesters and journalists: in multiple videos, police officers shout “cockroaches” at protesters, bystanders and journalists alike. This epithet also appeared in an open letter from the chair of the Junior Police Officers Association (JPOA). The practice has continued unabated, and frontline officers continued using the term despite an internal memorandum from a senior police officer calling on his staff to desist. Accusing protesters of desecrating the graves of lawmaker Junius Ho's parents, the JPOA said the vandals \\"cannot be called human.\\" Returning the insults, police are often referred to as \\"dogs\\", or \\"terrorists\\" for instilling terror over citizens. The police's public relations branch distanced itself from these claims, saying that it was not ideal for the force to use such terms, while a police community relations officer said that the term \\"cockroach\\" could be interpreted as a compliment because cockroaches are \\"full of life, and can survive in harsh conditions\\", while dogs are considered loyal and obedient; secretary for security John Lee said that citizens dissatisfied with police conduct can submit a complaint. == Alleged conspiracy with criminals and consistency of law enforcement== During the 1 July march, protesters stormed the Legislative Council Complex and were met with little to no police resistance. When protesters stormed inside the building, they vandalised the interiors. The police retreated after the protesters broke in, which has prompted accusations of selective enforcement. The police's inaction was criticised by pan-democracy politicians to be an effort by the government to \\"discredit\\" the protesters and damage their image, whereas pro-establishment lawmaker Michael Tien praised the police's \\"restrained approach\\". The slow police responses to the Yuen Long station attack by some 100 suspected triads wearing white, when they arrived 39 minutes after initial calls for help, was criticised. Police reported they received an unusually large volume of 999 calls at the time of the attack, and the nearby police station was shut. Six people were arrested in connection with the attack, but the fact that so few were arrested after the event triggered public outcry, and sparked accusations that the police colluded with triads. Officers in riot gear surrounded Nam Pin Wai village, but took no action against the white-clad men inside after making inquiries. Superintendent Yau Nai-keung claimed that no offensive weapons were found. Reports claimed to have media footages showing a white-clad man holding a metal bar standing next to police officers. When protesters were attacked by men armed in rots in North Point and Tsuen Wan again on 5 August, the police response was once again condemned as \\"slow\\". Conflicts lasted for nearly half an hour; the protesters fought off the out-numbered men before the police arrived, according to some reports. None of the people responsible for these attacks have been arrested as of November 2019. Pan-democrats also criticised the police for upholding a \\"double standard\\" in law enforcement, where they use excessive force to subdue young and often peaceful protesters while showing leniency to violent counter-protesters and even not carry out any arrests against them. They cited an incident where a suspect was allowed to use a police shield to hide his identity as an example. The police denied the accusation. == Police responses == Commenting on the analyses of videos by the Washington Post, police said that \\"in general, many media and online reports use short and edited videos that are taken out of context and fail to show the full picture of how radical protesters’ use of extreme violence\\" necessitated a police response. Police officers, they added, need to \\"obtain swift and full compliance\\" of an arrested person to guarantee their safety; force is used as a \\"last resort … only to achieve a specific purpose\\". In one of their routine news conferences the police have justified the indoor use of teargas as a response to violent behavior from protesters, \\"to stop the protesters’ radical behavior as soon as possible\\". By 8 September 2020, police had written over 100 rebuttal letters to media outlets. == Effect on public confidence == According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, the approval rating shrank to a net approval of 22 percent in mid-2019, due to its handling of the protests. 60 percent of respondents in public surveys were dissatisfied with police handling of incidents since June 2019. Nearly 70 percent of Hong Kong citizens believe the police have acted unprofessionally by making indiscriminate arrests and losing self-control. An online survey commissioned by the South China Morning Post conducted between 30 November and 2 December found that two-thirds of respondents supported an independent inquiry into police conduct during protests. 73 percent of respondents believed that public trust in the police had declined as a result of their handling of the protests. 53 percent believed police were \\"too harsh or excessive\\" with protesters, whereas 23 percent considered it as \\"adequate\\" and 24 percent of them believed police were \\"too lenient or insufficient\\". Overall, around 26 percent of those surveyed had no trust at all in police – this included 10 percent of pro-establishment voters and 45 percent of those supporting pro-democracy candidates. David Black, managing director of Blackbox Research – author of the survey – said such a high percentage of the population distrusting the police \\"is [what] we expect to see in authoritarian states.\\" == 2020 IPCC report == The IPCC released a thousand-page report on the behaviour of the police force during the civil unrest in which the police was generally exonerated. It concluded that officers generally acted within guidelines but there was \\"room for improvement\\". The government launched the report on 15 May against a backdrop of a slogan \\"The truth about Hong Kong\\" and images of violent protesters. Chief executive Lam praised the \\"comprehensive and objective\\" report, saying she accepted all its recommendations. The report mirrored police assertions that force was only in reaction to the violent unrest, but said there were \\"areas for improvement\\" when officers interacted with protesters. She said priority for implementation were a code of practice for journalists covering protests; more powers to monitor social media and tackle misinformation; reviewing internal police command structures; and identification of police officers with clear numbers. Rights groups and pro democracy parties universally pointed to the lack of indepence of the IPCC and the absence of police accountability, and expressed outrage at the report as an absurd and preposterous whitewash. Clifford Stott, who quit the IPCC foreign experts panel, said: \\"It would seem the release of the IPCC report is part of a wider set of coordinated announcements designed to deliver the new ‘truth’\\". ==See also== *San Uk Ling Holding Centre *2019 Prince Edward station attack *Controversies of the Hong Kong Police Force == References == == External links == * HK Democratic Movement 2019 – Police Misconduct Category:2019 in Hong Kong Category:2019–20 Hong Kong protests Category:Police misconduct Category:Organised crime in Hong Kong Category:Police brutality in Hong Kong Category:Scandals of Hong Kong Police ","title":"Police misconduct allegations during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests"},{"id":"61597272","text":"James Wayne Lecture (October 29, 1924 — December 19, 1999) was an American football guard who played for one season in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) for the Buffalo Bisons.

First exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1831, it is now in the Louvre in Paris. Its violent subject is typical of French Romantic painting and places it alongside the same artist's The Death of Sardanapalus and The Execution of Doge Marino Faliero, also painted in the late 1820s. He produced it at the same time as Boissy d’Anglas Leading a Riot (a chiaroscuro scene of revolutionary violence in a huge room) and The Battle of Nancy (similarly inspired by late medieval warfare). == History== Sketch by Delacroix, c.1827. Delacroix spent May to August 1825 in Great Britain, becoming devoted to its literature, especially Scott and William Shakespeare. Murder was just one of several works by the painter to be inspired by Quentin Durward – two sketches survive of The Ardennes Boar (ink on paper, showing William I de La Marck, 15 x 10.5 cm, c. 1827–1829, private collection, Paris) and Quentin Durward and La Balafré (sketch, c.1828–1829, musée des beaux-arts de Caen). Postcard of the Great Hall of the Palais de Justice in Rouen, c.1900 Murder was commissioned by the Duke of Orléans, the future king Louis-Philippe, who became its owner. Its chiaroscuro setting was inspired by Westminster Hall in London and the Palais de Justice in Rouen. Delacroix' correspondence shows him to have been worried about the work, only completing it once he was sure it would be his \\"Austerlitz\\" not his Waterloo.René Huyghe, Delacroix ou le combat solitaire, Hachette, 1964, . For some time it was exhibited at the gallery of Henri Gaugain, an art dealer and publisher before being put on show at the 1831 Paris Salon.Gustave Planche, Salon de 1831, on gallica.bnf.fr, Paris, Pinard, 1831, p. 114-116. For Étienne-Jean Delécluze, \\"this little canvas yells, shouts, blasphemes ... one hears the tipsy soldiers' obscene songs. Such figures of brigands! ... What jovial and bloodthirsty bestiality! It swarms and squeaks just as it blazes and stinks!.Étienne-Jean Delécluze, cited in « L'Assassinat de l'évêque de Liège », on idixa.net (accessed 25 July 2016)\\" Théophile Gautier was enthusiastic about the work, stating that \\"for the movement and fury of its composition, it is an inimitable masterpiece, a painted whirlwind, everything moving frantically in this little space, emerging from which one seems to hear lamentations and thunder ; never have we seen thrown onto a canvas a crowd more hard, more swarming, more screaming or more enraged [...] This painting is truly tumultuous and loud ; we hear it as much as we see it.Théophile Gautier, « Exposition du Louvre », sur theophilegautier.fr, La Presse, 22 mars 1838 (consulté le 25 juillet 2016).}} However, classical art critics savaged the work as too innovative – \\"[The same artist's] The Bridge at Taillebourg was a painting by a savage, and The Murder of the Bishop of Liège is furious debauchery by a barbarian.

A monkey adorned with Titian's meltwater.\\"Eugène Delacroix à l'Exposition du Boulevard des Italiens, Paris, 1864, p.7. ==References== Category:Paintings by Eugène Delacroix Category:1829 paintings category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists category:Works about murder category:History paintings Category:Cultural depictions of religious leaders Category:Cultural depictions of Belgian men ","title":"The Murder of the Bishop of Liège"},{"id":"61597332","text":"Reinier van Lanschot Reinier van Lanschot is a politician of Volt Europa and its Dutch wing, Volt Nederland.

Lam accused pan-democrats in the Legislative Council of \\"talking trash\\" in their opposition. Secretary John Lee had said the legal sector did not really understand the bill and some had not read the bill before protesting. Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung said that the turnout rate in the April protest is not a key determining factor for the government to consider and added that fixing the loopholes in the existing extradition law was necessary. Chief Executive Carrie Lam at the press conference with Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng and Secretary for Security John Lee one day after the massive protest on 10 June. The government maintained its hardline approach after the 9 June protest which attracted 1 million people, Carrie Lam continued to push for the bill's second reading on 12 June despite huge opposition and continued to defend the bill, saying that the government was \\"duty-bound\\" to do so. Following the 12 June conflict, both Police Commissioner Stephen Lo and Lam characterised the conflict as a \\"riot\\", which angered protesters and demanded the government to retract the term. The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. The CHRF disagreed and maintained the position that none of them rioted, and the demand urging the government to retract the riot categorisation has since been included in the protesters' list of demands. On 15 June, Lam suspended the bill, but insisted that the rationale for the amendment was sound and that she would do more explanation work. She refused to apologise or resign for forcing the bill through the Legislative Council which led to the subsequent violent conflicts and created rifts among Hong Kong people. However, following the huge protest on the next day, she \\"sincerely\\" apologised to the public but maintained that she would not resign or withdraw the bill as she wished to continue leading the government. The former president of the Legislative Council, Andrew Wong Wang-fat criticised her use of the term \\"suspension\\" as the term does not exist in LegCo's Rules of Procedure. During the 1 July celebration of the 22nd anniversary of the establishment of HKSAR, Lam declared that she would reach out to young people and meet with individuals from all walks of life to listen to their demands. However, when the protesters stormed the Legislative Council Complex that day, she refused to meet the protesters, and held a press conference at 4 am on 2 July to condemn the protesters' \\"use of extreme violence\\", while she refused to respond to questions that concerned the recent suicides that had been associated with her promotion of the bill. Her reaction drew criticisms from Hong Kong Free Press, who accused her of caring more about \\"shards of glass being broken than the lives of several citizens in Hong Kong\\". Following the protest, Carrie Lam invited representatives from public universities to attend a closed-door meeting, though the representatives rejected such request, calling her \\"insincere\\" and the invitation a \\"public relation act\\". They insisted that the meeting must be held publicly as they did not represent all the protesters in the movement. On 9 July, Carrie Lam declared that \\"the bill is dead\\" and the previous attempts to amend the law had failed completely. She gave assurances that the government had ceased any work to amend the bill but she stopped short of withdrawing it. She also rejected setting up an independent commission to investigate the police's conduct during the protests, saying that the existing mechanism, the Independent Police Complaints Council, would suffice. While pro-Beijing lawmakers agreed and claimed it was the time for Hong Kong people to \\"move on\\", opposition called Lam \\"insincere\\" and questioned her reluctance to formally withdraw the bill using the appropriate term. In the Cantonese version, she used the term \\"壽終正寢\\", which means \\"dying a peaceful death\\" to describe the bill amendment. However, some members of the public were sceptical about her usage of the term as it was ambiguous and accused her of playing a \\"translation trick\\". At a meeting with the press after the 21 July protest where protesters defaced the national emblem and mobs attacked commuters inside Yuen Long station, Lam denounced both the protesters and the white-clad group of attackers. She condemned the protesters who had defaced the national emblem for hurting the one country, two systems principle and national pride. On a question regarding a government statement that the questioner regarded as a \\"mild description\\" of the Yuen Long attack, Lam said that the government had \\"not [been] in possession of [facts regarding] all the actual situation on the ground\\". When asked about whether the safety of citizens was more important than the defacing of the national emblem, Lam responded by saying that ensuring public safety was important, but she believed that citizens will agree that \\"it is important and maybe even more important that the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle can continue to be successfully implemented.\\" On 6 August, following a citywide general strike and intense conflicts in various neighbourhoods in Hong Kong, Carrie Lam warned that the protesters are dragging Hong Kong to a \\"point of no return\\", and \\"gambling with the lives of 7 million people\\". She suggested that no concession would be made and the protests were no longer about the extradition bill or her poor governance and were about challenging China's sovereignty and damaging \\"one country, two systems\\" as the protesters chanted the slogan \\"liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\". Lam also announced that the Force would hold daily press conferences. On 9 August, when describing the protesters, she said a \\"small minority of people... [don't] mind destroying Hong Kong\\" and that they had \\"no stake in society.\\" Lam added that her cabinet would begin focusing on improving the city's economy and preparing measures to help the businesses in Hong Kong, and warned of an upcoming economic downturn. Following a rally that was attended by more than 1.7 million people, Carrie Lam announced that she would create platforms for dialogue but continued to reject the five core demands. She also invited politicians including Henry Tang, Anthony Cheung, university principals including Stephen Cheung, Roland Chin, professior Yuen Kwok-yung and more to help build the platform. However, lawmaker Kenneth Leung suggested that protesters and academics were sceptical of this platform because they felt that whoever was building the platform may not be representative, and that protesters had articulated the five core demands clearly already. On 2 September, Reuters received a leaked audio recording in which Carrie Lam admitted that she had \\"very limited\\" room to manoeuvre between the Central People's Government and Hong Kong, and that she would quit, if she had a choice. However, the next day she told the media that she had never tendered her resignation. On 4 September, Carrie Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, and introduce measures such as introducing new members to the Independent Police Complaints Council, engaging in dialogue in a community level, and inviting academics to evaluate the deep-rooted problems of Hong Kong. However, protesters and democrats had previously expressed that a partial concession would not be accepted and affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered. Lam's concession was also criticised as \\"too little, too late\\". After withdrawing the bill, Lam added that \\"stern law enforcement\\" would be used to stop the protesters. ===Pro-government parties=== The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (HKFTU) supported Carrie Lam's amendment of the bill before the mass protests broke out. After Lam announced the suspension of the bill, the views of many pro-government lawmakers U-turned. Starry Lee, the leader of the DAB, claimed that her party would not oppose the withdrawal of the bill, and the party distanced itself from Ann Chiang, who claimed that the government could revive the bill after the summer. Lee disagreed with setting up an independent commission to investigate police behaviour as she felt that it would \\"dampen their morale\\". Felix Chung, a lawmaker from Liberal Party, supported the withdrawal of the bill, though he felt that an independent commission should be set up to investigate the whole incident. The Chief Executive's Office held a private meeting with pro- government lawmakers explaining the decision to suspend the bill, though some lawmakers, including the HKFTU's Alice Mak, were said to have vented their anger toward Lam as her decision may harm their chances in the upcoming elections. Abraham Shek supported the formation of an independent commission and that the problem cannot be resolved by solving economic problems. He said that \\"their five demands did not mention that they want a house. The five demands of young people are that they want justice, fairness and transparency\\". As protests continued to escalate, pro-Beijing lawmakers have condemned the use of violence by protesters, including breaking into the LegCo Complex and using petrol bombs and unidentified liquids against the police. They have maintained their support for the Hong Kong Police Force, and have held various counter-demonstrations to support the police. On 17 August, a pro-government rally organised by the Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance occurred in Tamar Park. Organisers said 476,000 people including pro-government politicians and business leaders joined the demonstration, but police stated only 108,000 attended. Members of the Executive Council, Ip Kwok-him and Regina Ip alleged that there was a \\"mastermind\\" behind the protests but could not provide substantial evidence to support their claim. Fanny Law accused that some young females have been offering \\"free sex\\" services to the hardline protesters without providing any evidence. Her claim was condemned for spreading fake news with malice. === Camp supporting protests=== Activists including alt= The pro-democratic parties played a supporting role in the protests, and have opposed the amendment of the bill and have criticised the Police Force for the alleged misconduct. Many lawmakers, such as Democratic Party's Roy Kwong, assisted the protesters in various scenarios. The Civic Party criticised the government for not responding to the protesters, and described the storming of the LegCo as the \\"outburst of people's grievances\\". Responding to the escalation of the protests seen in mid August at the airport, the convenor of the pro-democratic lawmakers, Claudia Mo, while disagreeing with some protesters' actions, asserted that her group of lawmakers would not split with the protesters. Fernando Cheung warned that Hong Kong was slowly becoming a police state with the increasing violence used by the police. Both the incidents on 21 July and 31 August were likened to terrorist attacks by some pro-democrats. Pro-democrats also criticised the arrests of several lawmakers before the 31 August protest, saying that such arrests were an attempt by the police to suppress the movement, but warned that the police would further \\"fuel greater anger\\". The pan-democratic camp also condemned the violence directed at its protests organisers, lawmakers and election candidates. Lo Kin-hei has accused the pro-Beijing camp and its supporters of committing the \\"most brutal physical violent acts\\" throughout the protests. Several lawmakers, including Dennis Kwok and Alvin Yeung from Civic Party also travelled to the US to explain and discuss the situation in Hong Kong with American lawmakers and business leaders and voice their support for the reintroduction of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Joshua Wong, Denise Ho and several other democrats also provided testimonies during the US congressional hearing for the Democracy Act. Meanwhile, some councillors proposed several alternate versions of the extradition bill. Former government executives, including Anson Chan, the former Chief Secretary for Administration, issued several open letters to Carrie Lam, urging her to respond to the five core demands raised by protesters. At the civil servant rally, Joseph Wong, the former Secretary for Civil Service, said \\"If we think today's officials, today's chief executive, violated or failed to follow the rule of law, as civil servants and as civilians, we have a duty to point it out\\", responding to the current Secretary Joshua Law's letter to all civil servants which requested them to maintain their political neutrality. ===Citizens' responses=== Data was collected to measure public opinion on different aspects of the protests. An author for a report which was conducted for the Chinese University of Hong Kong that surveyed public attitudes toward the protests from August to October said that public opinion was \\"still firmly on the side of the democracy movement’s key demands.\\" A poll conducted by the University of Hong Kong in the wake of the 16 June march found that the number of respondents who respectively identified as Hong Konger and Chinese were both at record lows since the handover of the city in 1997 while 90% of 3200 alumni from the same university passed an October 2019 motion which called for Lam’s resignation. In late October 2019, CNN and the South China Morning Post reported that there are wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say they have been driven away by the violence because they argue that the protesters spread chaos, trash the economy, and hurting their own cause as well as those caught in the crossfire. Such critics, self-dubbed the \\"silent majority\\" and numbering in the hundreds of thousands, say that the protesters' violence and violence cannot be pardoned. On 19 November 2019, Foreign Policy suggested that the \\"silent majority\\" notion may be influenced by a disinformation campaign from Chinese state media and that the support for the protests would be measured in upcoming local elections on 24 November 2019. Despite the increase in violence, the protesters were still able to maintain public support. During the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, democrats, who supported the protesters and their five demands, achieved a landslide victory, successfully took control of 17 of the 18 District Councils of Hong Kong, tripling their number of seats from about 124 to around 388. Meanwhile, pro- Beijing parties suffered a historic defeat and lost more than 242 seats. Pro- Beijing heavyweights including Junius Ho, Horace Cheung, Vincent Cheng, Michael Tien, Holden Chow, Lau Kwok-fan, Luk Chung-hung, Ho Kai-ming and Alice Mak (all of which Legislative Councilors) were all defeated by democrats in their respective constituencies. Regina Ip's New People Party lost all of their seats. Reuters conducted polls in December 2019, March 2020, June 2020 and August 2020. The last poll showed that an increasing number of Hongkongers support the pro-democracy goals since the national security law was implemented. 60% of people oppose the national security law which was 57% in June when few details were known. The support for the protest movement have declined when asked \\"How much do you support or oppose the pro-democracy protest movement?\\" 44% said they supported the movement. In June 51% said they supported the protest movement although the question was asked differently then \\"Generally speaking how much do you support or oppose de protest movement surrounding the extradition bill?\\". 70% wants an independent commission of inquiry that looks into how the police handled the protests which is an 7% rise. 63% wants universal suffrage which is about the same as the poll that was conducted in June. The support for amnesty of all arrested protesters rose to 50% which is 5% more than in June. The majority of people still wants Carrie Lam to resign which is 58%. The number of people who oppose the pro- democracy demands went down to 19% from 21.5%. The majority still opposes Hong Kong independence which is 60%, 20% supports the idea. Just over 50% were unhappy about the postponed legislative council elections. The poll showed that opposition candidates could have done well if the elections were not postponed. Mainlanders in Hong Kong Since October 2019, some mainland Chinese living in Hong Kong expressed fears for their own safety as a result of the protests; an article on NBC opined that the hatred the protesters had towards Mainland China had extended to Mandarin-speakers from Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States. A Bloomberg article said that the anti-Mainland Chinese rhetoric translated into violence on both sides. As a result, Mainlanders in Hong Kong resorted to stop speaking Mandarin in public for fear of being targeted for abuse.Huang, Kristin \\"Meet the mainland Chinese who are living in fear in Hong Kong\\" South China Morning Post. 8 October 2019 From January to March 2020, the Equal Opportunities Commission reported nearly 600 inquiries and complaints about restaurants and other businesses refusing to serve people who are from Mainland China or speak Mandarin – a trend that analysts believe to be partly due to Hong Kong's political environment as a result of the protests. == Mainland China reactions == ===Official statements===  Allegations of foreign interference  The government has accused foreign forces of interfering with domestic affairs, and supporting the protesters; the accusations have in turn been criticised by those accused and third party observers. Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that there was a \\"long-standing tradition\\" of Beijing blaming external forces during domestic demonstrations or unrest. On 29 July, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office held its first press conference since the handover in which the spokesperson blamed the protests on the West and reiterated its support for Hong Kong, saying, \\"The central government firmly supports Carrie Lam leading the Hong Kong government's administration according to law, firmly supports the Hong Kong police strictly enforcing rule of law.\\" The conference was in turn criticised by pro-democracy figures. In September, the Foreign Ministry called a meeting between Joshua Wong and the German Foreign Minister as \\"disrespectful of China's sovereignty and an interference in China's internal affairs\\". The meeting came after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip to the PRC, where she said that the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong \\"must be guaranteed\\" and to whom Wong had written an open letter seeking her backing for the protests.  Reactions to the protesters On 12 August, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, stated \\"radical protesters\\" have \\"repeatedly attacked police officers in the past few days and have committed serious violent crimes\\", which \\"has begun to show the 'first signs of terrorism'\\". In response to the protests on 13 August, state media stated that \\"Hong Kong protesters are 'asking for self-destruction.'\\" On 20 August, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a letter to more than 30 overseas media outlets in Beijing including BBC, NBC, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, and NHK, requesting them to follow the Chinese government's position on Hong Kong affairs. The letter was described by Bloomberg as an attempt by the PRC government to \\"reshape the global narrative over Hong Kong.\\" After the implementation of the anti-mask law, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office stated that the move was \\"extremely necessary\\", while several state-run media has praised the move. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, has supported Hong Kong police to \\"take forceful actions in enforcing the law,\\" and called Hong Kong judiciary to \\"punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes\\". Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, cited Article 23 of the Basic Law and supported the national security law to stop the protests. Customs changes Chinese government has required goods mailed from Mainland China to Hong Kong to be investigated while goods which are believed as related to the protests are forbidden to mailing. ===National security law=== In May 2020, China announced that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), China's rubber-stamp legislative body, would directly draft a national security law that covers \\"secession, foreign interference, terrorism and subversion against the central government\\" into the Annex III of the Hong Kong Basic Law. The legislation of this law in the NPCSC used a legal backdoor that skips the local legislation procedures. Beijing's decision did not align with Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-institution which states that the legislation of a law concerning national security should be done by the local legislative body. This came at a time when Hong Kong had implemented a coronavirus law banning public gathering more than eight people, meaning that large-scale protests were less likely to occur. Zhang Yesui, the spokesperson of the NPCSC stated that the implementation of such law is \\"highly necessary\\". Political analysts believed that Beijing's action would mark the end of the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle and Hong Kong's autonomy, as promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Observers predicted that it would undermine Hong Kong's status as an international finance center and prompt civilians and capital to flee the city, as well as undermining any chance to mend the huge political divide in the city as the new law is likely to fuel further anger and protests. ===State media=== Allegations of foreign interference In early August 2019, CCTV, Ta Kung Pao, and Wen Wei Po, alleged collusion between the United States and the Hong Kong protests when they published articles which included a photo of an American diplomat whom they accused of contributing to civil unrest, meeting in Hong Kong with leaders of Demosistō including Joshua Wong and Nathan Law and other pro-democracy figures including Anson Chan and Martin Lee. Ta Kung Pao also published personal details about the diplomat's family, including photos and the names of her children and husband. The US State Department condemned the action and rebuked China for violating the Vienna Convention. Morgan Ortagus called the Chinese government a \\"thuggish regime\\" and said that, as \\"Chinese authorities know full well\\", diplomats of every country meet with opposition figures as part of their job. The Beijing state- run media have accused foreign forces of interfering with domestic affairs, and supporting the protesters; the accusations have in turn been criticised by those accused and third party observers. Reactions to the protesters Police officer Lau Cha Kei was hailed as \\"hero\\" by Chinese media after he pointed a loaded shotgun at protesters. The protests have been depicted by state media as separatist riots facilitated by foreign forces. A law professor at Nanchang Hangkong University was investigated by the university and faced \\"serious punishment\\" after his chat messages that appeared to support the Hong Kong protesters leaked online. China Central Television covered the LegCo occupation of 1 July, and claimed the action was \\"condemned by people from all walks of life in Hong Kong\\". China Daily said of 20 July counter-demonstration that \\"the silent majority of Hong Kong has every reason to come out and defend their home\\". Following the 10 August protests and weekend airport sit-ins, People's Daily disseminated an article via WeChat that portrayed protesters as the instigators of violence. The article stated that there is broad call from Hong Kong society to make the city safe again by ending \\"violent demonstrations\\". The Chinese media praised the police for being \\"restrained\\" on the day after a protester was shot in Sai Wan Ho on 12 November, and demanded the police to conduct more \\"forceful\\" actions. Chinese media and netizens also hailed the police, in particular, Lau Cha Kei, the station sergeant who aimed his shotgun at protesters in Kwai Chung in July, as \\"heroes\\". During the Siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of Global Times suggested the police to use sniper rifles to shoot the protesters, and that \\"if the rioters are killed, the police should not have to bear legal responsibility\\". Hu denounced Harbour City and its owner Wharf Real Estate Investment after notices banning police entry into the mall were displayed. Hu criticized the mall operator of not \\"protecting\\" the Chinese flag after it was torn down by protesters, who subsequently threw it into the sea. This led to online calls to boycott the mall on Weibo. After the flag was thrown into the sea, China Central Television posted on Sina Weibo, saying that \\"China's national flag has 1.4 billion flag bearers\\". The state-controlled television broadcaster then urged netizens to share the post and declare themselves a \\"flag-bearer\\". This has attracted several Hong Kong celebrities, including Jackie Chan and Jordan Chan. State media has said that the education system of Hong Kong has been advocating the protests directly or indirectly, while suggesting punishments for pro-protests teachers and promoting the Moral and National Education. Chinese state-run media have downplayed the results of the 2019 Hong Kong local elections. On 22 August, Inkstone News reported that People's Daily and the Communist Youth League promoted anti-protests rap songs released by CD Rev. In December 2019, Global Times reported on a mobile game named Fight the Traitors Together, where players can beat up Hong Kong protesters and activists including Joshua Wong and Nathan Law with various weapons such as baseball bats and flip-flops.  Advertisements  In August, Twitter and Facebook published ads paid for by several different Chinese state media outlets, including Xinhua. The ad campaign targeted users in Hong Kong with \\"sponsored\\" content posted to the Twitter feed, speaking negatively of the protests and warning of economic troubles. On 19 August, Twitter posted an update about new advertising standards: \\"Going forward, we will not accept advertising from state- controlled news media entities ... that are either financially or editorially controlled by the state.\\" Additionally, more than a dozen Facebook ads targeted for the US audience have been paid for by CGTN. Facebook has stated that they would continue to promote state-sponsored advertising. An insider with the company said that China purchases Facebook advertising worth \\"hundreds of thousands of dollars\\" each fiscal quarter, making China the largest client in Asia, though the social network is banned within mainland China and unavailable to residents. === Corporate pressure === In early August 2019, online campaigns on social media network Sina Weibo called for boycotts against Taiwanese bubble tea chain Yifang. The mainland office of the Japanese soft drink brand Pocari Sweat distanced itself from its Hong Kong division after the Hong Kong division publicly stopped advertising on the television network TVB, which pro-democracy protestors accused of being pro-Beijing. In early August 2019, online campaigns on Sina Weibo called for boycotts against Taiwanese bubble tea chain Yifang. On 8 August 2019, Chinese authorities pressured Hong Kong's main airline Cathay Pacific to suspend staff members who participated in the anti-extradition protests, and ban staff members from being part of any flights to China. Chinese officials further demanded that the airline must submit for prior approval the names of all crew members flying to Chinese cities or flying through Chinese airspace. Some staff voiced disagreement about Beijing's recent moves and the then-chairman John Slosar defended his staff saying in a press statement that \\"We employ 27,000 people in Hong Kong ... we obviously do not imagine telling them what they have to think about certain subjects.\\" Amid the pressure from Beijing, Cathay Pacific's CEO Rupert Hogg and chief customer and commercial officer Paul Loo both resigned on 16 August 2019; an article in CBS described Hogg's resignation as \\"the highest-profile corporate casualty of official Chinese pressure on companies to support the ruling Communist Party's position.\\" The actions by Beijing on the airline has in turn been criticised by current and former Cathay Pacific staff members and the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. After People’s Daily condemned the MTR Corporation for providing transport for the protesters, MTR shut down all its station ahead of a legal, authorized march on 24 August in Kwun Tong. MTR then subsequently became a target of vandalism after it was accused of kowtowing to Beijing's pressure. On 2 September 2019, People's Daily denounced the Facebook posts of Garic Kwok, the director of Hong Kong mooncake brand Taipan Bread and Cake, for supporting the protests. The next day, products from the brand were removed from both e-commerce sites and stores in mainland China. ===Social media===  Censorship  The first two weeks of protests were largely ignored by central mainland media outlets, with no major stories published until 17 April. The protests were mostly censored from Mainland Chinese social media, such as Sina Weibo. Keyword searches of \\"Hong Kong\\", \\"HK\\" and \\"extradition bill\\" led to other official news and entertainment news. Accounts that posted content regarding the protest were also blocked. By 14 June, censors were said to be working overtime to erase or block news of the protests on social media. On Sina Weibo and WeChat, the term \\"let's go Hong Kong\\" was blocked with the platform citing \\"relevant laws, regulations and policies\\" as the reason for not showing search results. After Carrie Lam formally withdrew the extradition bill, many Chinese netizens expressed their disappointment for Lam's decision. However, most of the comments on Sina Weibo, including those from high-profile state media outlets, were removed later, while the hashtag #Carrie Lam formally withdraws the extradition bill# was removed. Chinese online stores including Taobao removed Animal Crossing: New Horizons from sales after it was used by activist Joshua Wong as a platform to protest during the COVID-19 pandemic. China netizens then sent Wong death threats.  Disinformation  On 19 August, both Twitter and Facebook announced that they had discovered what they described as large-scale disinformation campaigns operating on their social networks. Facebook claimed that images and videos of protesters were altered and taken out of context, often with captions intended to vilify democracy activists and their cause. According to investigations by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, some of the astroturfing activities were coordinated state-backed operations that were traced to the Chinese government. Twitter identified a core group of nearly 1,000 \\"fake\\" accounts, along with an extended spam network of 200,000 accounts, all of which were \\"proactively suspended\\"; Twitter released two data sets disclosing the core group's account and tweet information. Facebook removed a network of seven pages, three groups (including one with 15,500 followers), and five accounts (including one with 2,200 members) in response to its findings. On 22 August, Google stated it had disabled 210 YouTube channels involved in \\"coordinated influence operations\\" around the Hong Kong protests, \\"consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter\\". It said it \\"found use of VPNs and other methods to disguise the origin\\" of the accounts. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang suggested that the activity could be attributed to overseas Chinese citizens, and stated that they \\"have the rights to express their opinions and viewpoints\\". NPR reported that the vast majority of the Twitter accounts were \\"disguised as personal or corporate accounts of marketing firms, international relations experts or bitcoin enthusiasts\\", and found a combined ¥2 million of Chinese government tenders dated 16 and 19 August for Facebook and Twitter accounts. In Bloomberg Opinion, Adam Minter wrote that \\"the vast majority of content tweeted by these accounts wasn't related to Hong Kong and – most important – failed to generate retweets, likes or responses\\". Comparing the Russian online propaganda effort with China's, Adam Segal of the Council on Foreign Relations says \\"the Chinese use of it has tended to be limited to issues that the Chinese consider being internal issues or sovereignty issues.\\" The International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute released a study on 3 September, which analysed the data set released by Twitter. The report, Tweeting through the Great Firewall, found that prior to the 2019 Hong Kong protests, many of the now-banned Twitter accounts were engaged in attacks on critics of the Chinese government. Over 38,000 tweets from 618 accounts targeted Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui. Groups of these Twitter accounts had also coordinated efforts to criticise human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and book publisher Gui Minhai. In April, 112 of the accounts posted a total of 1,600 tweets critical of the 2019 anti- extradition bill protests. Overall, the report found that the purported disinformation campaign had three main narratives: condemnation of protesters, support for Hong Kong Police, as well as \\"conspiracy theories about Western involvement in the protests.\\" === Cyberattacks === Cyberattacks also occurred during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution. Security researchers believe China's Ministry of State Security was responsible for targeting democracy activists with sophisticated malware and spyware attacks that infected Android and iOS devices. The intelligence agency was also linked to powerful denial of service attacks aimed at CloudFlare and Internet voting systems and websites that enabled a grassroots civic referendum. The Chinese government has denied that they engaged in cyberwarfare operations. According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China has \\"always advocated that the international community should jointly safeguard the security of cyberspace through dialogue and cooperation.\\" === Military === An article published by the AFP on 30 July said that \\"Videos falsely claiming to show a Chinese military crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have flooded social media over the past week.\\" One of the debunked posts appeared shortly after a press conference attended by a Mainland Chinese defence ministry spokesman that showed the People's Liberation Army entering Hong Kong; in reality, the video used in the post to purportedly show the crackdown was actually of Chinese military vehicles driving through the Hong Kong district of Kowloon in 2018. On 30 July, Bloomberg News reported that a senior White House official had leaked information about a potential Chinese military buildup along the Hong Kong border. On 31 July, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) distributed a video, which was posted via the Hong Kong garrison's official Sina Weibo social media account. In the opening scenes, a soldier shouts in Cantonese \\"All consequences are at your own risk!\\" The video shows heavily armed troops shooting at mock citizen actors and making arrests; there are also depictions of tanks, helicopters, rocket launchers, automatic weapons, and water cannons being deployed in urban areas. The film closes with quotes from civilians, stating \\"The discipline of the military is very good\\" and \\"The PLA and people of Hong Kong are integrated.\\" The video was criticised by the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and users on LIHKG. Another video was released on 6 August in which the People's Armed Police conducted what state media said was an anti-riot drill in Shenzhen. An article by the AFP said that the exercise \\"instantly attracted online attention given the close resemblance between the drill and the ongoing clashes in adjacent Hong Kong.\\" On 16 November, approximately 50 unarmed PLA soldiers in T-shirts and shorts emerged from their barracks to clean up debris from violent clashes between protestors and police near Hong Kong Polytechnic University. A Reuters article said that the presence of the soldiers on the streets, even to clean up, risked \\"stoking controversy about Hong Kong’s status as an autonomous area.\\" == Taiwan reactions == In June 2019, President Tsai Ing-wen backed the protesters and said that as long as she remains the president, the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle can never be an option for Taiwan's future. Later, after the suspension of the extradition bill, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised the Hong Kong government for using Taiwan's unwillingness to extradite the suspect in the criminal case which the Hong Kong government had used to justify the extradition bill. The Foreign Minister of the Republic of China, Wu Zhaozheng, said that Taiwan would speak out if the Chinese or the Hong Kong government tried to suppress protesters with violence, and that the international community should not tolerate Beijing's crackdown on the protests. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party later issued a statement on Facebook on 12 August strongly condemning the violent acts of Beijing and the Hong Kong government across the moral bottom line. It rendered statements by Tsai Ing-wen and relevant government units that Taiwan will provide assistance in individual cases in the form of humanitarian rescue. President of the Executive Yuan Su Zhenchang later stated that the Republic of China cares about Hong Kong and gives the necessary care. On the one hand, it must guard Taiwan's sovereignty and freedom and democracy, so that Taiwan will not be violently suppressed for democracy and freedom like Hong Kong. In opposition parties, the Legislative Yuan party group including the Chinese Kuomintang Party, Time Power, and the People First Party issued a statement on 17 June in conjunction with the ruling party, calling on the Hong Kong government to respect the people's demands and to withdraw the fugitives bill, and disagreeing the Hong Kong government's use of force. In dealing with the mass movement, it called on the Hong Kong government to face the demands of the masses humbly and to minimise conflict. Chinese Nationalist Chairman Wu Dunyi issued a statement, hoping that the Hong Kong Government and mainland China will establish a communication channel with the protesters as soon as possible, seek consensus, and let the dispute end peacefully. Repeated clashes have also caused many Taiwanese to question the Chinese Communist Party, boosting the popularity of President Tsai Ing-wen, who went on to win the Democratic primary election. ==International reactions == ===Countries=== In light of the ongoing protests, several countries issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.  Australia  Foreign Minister Marise Payne said at the end of June 2019 that \\"(We) support the people's right to demonstrate peacefully and exercise their right to freedom of expression, and we call on all parties to exercise restraint and avoid violence.\\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison has questioned mainland officials' claims that terrorist demonstrations have emerged in Hong Kong. He said at a press conference in August 2019 that Carrie Lam must listen carefully to the voice of the protesters in order to resolve the dispute. The first Hong Kong-born member of parliament Gladys Liu also supported the protesters and called for peaceful dialogue to resolve the dispute. After the government announced that it would withdraw the motion, the opposition Labour Party Senate leader Wong Ying-yin welcomed the decision, but also called on the government to respond to the remaining four major appeals.  Canada  The Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on 12 June stating that Canada has been following up on this bill, and Canada reaffirmed that this demonstration was one of the largest demonstrations in history to show the public's attention to the bill. Stating that \\"Canada remains concerned about this bill as it has a potential impact on Canadian business confidence in Hong Kong and Hong Kong's international reputation. The statement calls on the Hong Kong Government to listen to the voices of citizens and the international community while safeguarding a high degree of autonomy And an independent judicial system.\\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was very concerned on the situation between Hong Kong and mainland China and called on China to bring peace, order and dialogue, stating: \\"we certainly call on China to be very careful and very respectful in how it deals with people who have legitimate concerns in Hong Kong.\\"  France  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called on Hong Kong authorities to renew talks with protesters to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis.  Germany  Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in June 2019 that it was a good sign that the majority of protesters have been peaceful \\"and we appeal to all concerned to ensure that things remain just as peaceful in Hong Kong\\". Merkel said in August 2019 that she hoped to end the conflict through friendly dialogue. It also means that the Constitution (Basic Law) and the protection of residents' freedom must be at the core of any dialogue.  Iran  Homejra Assadi, spokeswoman of Football Federation of Iran (FFI) urged FIFA to move a World Cup qualifier match against Hong Kong to a neutral venue from Hong Kong due to concerns over ongoing protests and citing safety fears from political unrest. Foreign Minister spokesperson Abbas Mousavi, has denounced the US' Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act as US intervention, though the protests themselves are local.  Israel  The Israeli Foreign Minister has urged its citizens living in Hong Kong to refrain from partaking in the protests for safety and security reasons.  Japan  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has cautioned Xi Jinping over recent turmoil in Hong Kong at the G20 Summit. Abe told Xi it was important for \\"a free and open Hong Kong to prosper under 'one country, two systems' policy\\".  Malaysia  Responding to a question from Hong Kong Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he was of the opinion that Carrie Lam should resign as the chief executive, fearing a repeat of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests where Mainland China's authorities used soldiers from other regions to take harsh action towards the protesters since they knew the soldiers in the area would be hindered in doing so, as many of them had relatives among the protesters. He added that Lam already knew \\"the consequences of rejecting [the extradition] law\\" as herself was in a dilemma when she has to obey her Mainland masters. Early in September, a supposed football friendly match between Hong Kong and Malaysia to be held in Hong Kong Stadium in So Kon Po was cancelled due to security fears from the Malaysian sides over the protests.  New Zealand  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern defended the right of pro-Hong Kong protesters to freedom of expression on New Zealand university campuses. In response to the travel disruption caused by protest action, MFAT has also issued a travel advisory for New Zealanders travelling to Hong Kong. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed his admiration for the courage of Hong Kong demonstrators in June and said that one country, two systems must be respected. On 14 August 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that an economic plan has been formulated due to the worsening conditions in Hong Kong and that New Zealanders in Hong Kong should be evacuated when necessary.  North Korea  North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that, \\"North Korea fully supports the stand and measures of China to defend the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the country and safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and concerns about foreign forces interference in Hong Kong issue.\\"  Pakistan  The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, \\"Pakistan believes Hong Kong's affairs are China's internal affairs and we believe stability and prosperity in Hong Kong would soon resume. We also believe that all countries should uphold international law and the basic norms of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\\"  Philippines  In August 2019, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte urged all sides to show restraint and Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello stated that the situation is being monitored to assess if there is a need to suspend deployment of Overseas Filipino Workers to Hong Kong following the arrest of a Filipino migrant worker suspected to be involved in the protest.  Serbia  Marko Djuric, vice president of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, accused the protests of being \\"hijacked by foreign forces to weaken China\\" & the \\"violence\\" of being \\"fascism\\" when criticising the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passed unanimously by the U.S. Congress.  Singapore  Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the protests were a \\"difficult issue\\" and hoped that both Hong Kong and the PRC would overcome the difficulties. During a media interview with Forbes, Lee remarked that the protestors' Five Demands were not meant to resolve problems, but to humiliate and bring down the HKSAR government. Hong Kong protesters’ five demands meant to ‘humiliate’ government, won’t solve city’s issues: Singapore PM , SCMP.com, 17 October 2019.Singapore had been crafting contingency plans in case the Hong Kong protests inspire unrest in the country.  South Korea  According to various Chinese state-affiliated media, President Moon Jae-in stated that affairs relating to Hong Kong and Xinjiang are China's internal affairs.  United Kingdom  In mid-July at Chatham House, former Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Sino-British Joint Declaration \\"needs to be abided by and continue to be respected\\" by China. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned \\"violent acts by all sides\\" but emphasized the right to peaceful protest, noting that \\"hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people had chosen this route to express their views,” and was met by criticism by the Hong Kong authorities. The London government has expressed that the actions of \\"a hard- core minority cannot be condoned.\\" regarding allegations of violence at the otherwise peaceful rallies Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, described Lam's decision to implement the anti-mask law as \\"crazy\\" and that should Lam continue to refuse to engage in dialogue, people may get killed by the police in subsequent conflicts. A former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong, Simon Cheng, reported in an interview with the BBC that he had been tortured by Chinese officials during his 15-day detention in China in August 2019.He had first been detained by mainland officials on 8 August at the immigration checkpoint of West Kowloon station for allegedly \\"soliciting prostitutes\\". According to Cheng, his captors, who he believed to be secret police, called him \\"a British spy and secret agent\\", and subjected him to torture in what he called a \\"tiger chair\\" to make him confess that he had been instigating unrest in Hong Kong on behalf of the British government. Cheng's statements were deemed credible by UK government sources. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab released a statement saying that he was \\"outraged by the disgraceful mistreatment\\". In response to the political and media backlash, Chinese state media later released footage of the confession of Cheng, and CCTV footage of him entering and leaving a clubhouse. Cheng stated that he had made the confession after he had been threatened by China's police that he would otherwise not be able to contact his family and be detained indefinitely. Cheng was granted asylum in the UK on 26 June 2020.  United States  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi with Hong Kong activists who have become prominent figures in the protests According to CNN and Financial Times reports, in June, President Donald Trump promised Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping that the US would remain quiet on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks continued. Also in June, the State Department told then-US general counsel in Hong Kong, Kurt Tong, to cancel a planned speech on the protests in Washington. On 1 August, President Donald Trump condemned the developing violence of the protests in calling the events \\"riots\\". He also said the US will not involve itself: \\"That’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.\\" In response, a bipartisan group of senators issued a statement to Trump, condemning \\"Beijing's efforts to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy\\". In the letter, they declared \\"Hong Kong's governance is not China's internal affair\\" and that if the U.S. fails to respond to Beijing's threats it would \\"only encourage Chinese leaders to act with impunity\\". Trump administration officials said the day after that the president had no intention to signal a policy change or an endorsement of China's position. On 19 August, after the massive protest in the day before, Trump warned China to solve the problem in a humanitarian fashion, saying, \\"It would be much harder for me to sign a deal if he did something violent in Hong Kong\\". The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, met with Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill in Washington on 18 September. Chinese media criticized her sharply for this meeting, accusing her of \\"backing and encouraging radical activists.\\" The United States House of Representatives unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act through a voice vote on 15 October 2019. On 14 November 2019, senators Jim Risch and Marco Rubio began a process for the United States Senate to pass the legislation. In November 2019, a version of the bill was also unanimously confirmed in the United States Senate in a voice vote with amendments that differ between the two versions. However, the two chambers of Congress need to work out the differences between the two versions of the legislation before it can be sent to President Donald Trump for approval. The Bill has now been fully approved and signed by President Donald Trump. Various U.S. Senators have expressed disapproval of corporate decisions related to the protests, including Apple's removal of the HKmap.live application from the App Store as well as video game developer and publisher Blizzard's suspension of an esports athlete from competing in events.  Vietnam  The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had stated that the protests are China's internal affairs.https://vtc.vn/thoi-su-quoc-te/trung- quoc-thong-qua-luat-an-ninh-hong-kong-viet-nam-bay-to-lap-truong-ar548714.html === International Organisations ===  United Nations  Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that “We are troubled by the high levels of violence associated with some demonstrations that have been taking place in the past days”, and “Freedom of peaceful assembly … should be enjoyed without restriction to the greatest extent possible. But on the other hand, we cannot accept people who use masks to provoke violence.” She also demanded the Hong Kong government to conduct \\"prompt, independent, impartial investigation\\" on the police's use of force against the protesters.  European Union  The European External Action Service said rights \\"need to be respected\\" in Hong Kong on 12 June: \\"Over the past days, the people of Hong Kong have exercised their fundamental right to assemble and express themselves freely and peacefully. These rights need to be respected\\".  International Trade Union Confederation  The International Trade Union Confederation issued a statement on 17 August 2019, calling on its 331 trade union organisations from 163 countries to protest to the embassies of the People's Republic of China and demand that the Hong Kong government release the arrested people and independently investigate human rights violations.  G7  45th Group of Seven meeting organised after the closing of the Group of Seven organisations issued a joint statement reaffirming the Sino-British Joint Declaration existence and importance to Hong Kong and asked to avoid violence. ===Solidarity protests=== Taiwan activists protest against extradition bill in Taipei, Taiwan. On 9 June, at least 29 rallies were held in 12 countries with protesters taking to the streets in cities around the world with significant Hong Kong diaspora, including about 4,000 in London, about 3,000 in Sydney and further rallies in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Toronto, Vancouver, Berlin, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Perth, Canberra, Melbourne, Brisbane and Taipei. In one of the biggest overseas protests, hundreds of demonstrators made of mostly Hong Kong immigrants filled the streets outside the Chinese consulate-general in Vancouver with yellow umbrellas, referencing the 2014 Occupy protests, and chanted against the extradition law. More than 60 people gathered outside the White House in Washington to protest against the bill. On 12 June, representatives from 24 Taiwanese civic groups, including Taiwan Association for Human Rights, protested outside Hong Kong's representative office in Taipei, whilst shouting slogans such as \\"Taiwan supports Hong Kong.\\" On 16 June, 10,000 Hong Kong students and Taiwanese supporters held a peaceful sit- in at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei to support the protests in Hong Kong. In Auckland and Adelaide, around 500 people gathered to demand Chief Executive Lam to withdraw the bill and apologise for her actions. On 17 June, 1,500 people protested outside the Chinese Consulate in Vancouver. On 23 June, 5,000 people held a rally in Taipei against Hong Kong's extradition bill. On 14 July a \\"Sing for Hong Kong\\" event was held in London. There was a clash between pro-democracy and pro-China supporters at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on 24 July. In response to the incident, the Chinese Consul-General in Brisbane, Xu Jie, reportedly praised Chinese students for confronting \\"anti-China separatist\\" protesters, prompting the Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to warn foreign diplomats not to interfere in free speech and protests in Australia. On 3 August, further solidarity protests occurred in UK cities including London, Manchester and Edinburgh, as well as Canadian cities of Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Winnipeg, Halifax, Ottawa and Calgary. On 10 August, around 100 Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Taiwanese, Uygurs, overseas Chinese and other New York residents held a rally outside the Chinese consulate. Over the 16–18 August weekend, solidarity pro-democracy protests were held in London, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Taipei, Berlin, Paris, Boston, Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto. On 30 August, hundreds of Tibetans marched in India's capital in a show of solidarity with protesters in Hong Kong. Taking a cue from them, many of the Tibetans carried umbrellas and wore black as they joined the New Delhi demonstration organised by the Tibetan Youth Congress. Protesters in the concurrent 2019 Catalan protests have claimed inspiration from, and solidarity with the Hong Kong protests. ===Counter-protests=== Simultaneously, counter-protests organized by pro-China and overseas mainland Chinese groups occurred in several cities in the Western hemisphere, including Sydney, Melbourne, Ottawa, Toronto, London, and Paris; some of which led to confrontations between the opposing groups and arrests.Hong Kong protest tensions heat up in Australia The Strait Times. 17 August 2019.Power, John Chinese-Australian group to rally against Hong Kong protests South China Morning Post. 16 August 2019Prentiss, Mairin Ottawa urged to support Hong Kong protesters at Halifax demonstration CBC. 17 August 2019Delitala, Albert & Rocca, Ryan Protesters face off at rally for Hong Kong in Toronto.

Earlier many Macau lawyers agree in principle that an extradition with Mainland China or Hong Kong is necessary, but the wording of such agreements would have to be carefully analysed. On 14 June, Macau Lawyers Association's President Jorge Neto Valente said that he supports the protesters against the proposed extradition law. He further stated that the best way to resolve the issue was to postpone the discussion of the bill. ===eSports=== Additionally, on 6 October 2019 the American video game developer and publisher Blizzard suspended Hong Kong player Chung Ng Wai's participation in a professional esports tournament of Hearthstone after attending an interview donned with a mask similar to those worn by protestors and uttering the phrase \\"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,\\" a slogan strongly associated with the protesters' demonstrations. Lee Shi Tian, a Hong Kong citizen, showed solidarity with Hong Kong protestors during the broadcast of the Magic: The Gathering Mythic Championship V 18 October. Wizards of the Coast and their parent company Hasbro allowed broadcast of his comments and masked appearance. ===National Basketball Association (NBA)=== The Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image that stated \\"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\\" in October 2019. The NBA subsequently apologized saying the tweet was \\"regrettable\\" and the Chinese Basketball Association cut ties with the Rockets. which drew criticism from US politicians and third-party observers as well as Mainland Chinese state-run media. ===Journalism=== Mainland China media An August 2019 article in the Washington Post reported that mainland Chinese state-run media portrayed the protests as extremely violent demonstrations, plotted by \\"foreign hostile forces\\" including United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and the CIA. A September 2019 article published in the Index on Censorship said that China was spinning its version of the Hong Kong protests to control the news. A November 2019 article in Deutsche Welle said that Mainland Chinese state run media reporting the Hong Kong protests had sharply criticized the protesters' actions and blamed Western media for what they said was its biased reporting. A June 2020 academic paper compared the discursive constructions of the Hong Kong protests in CNN and China Daily, saying that mainstream Chinese media supported China's bid to influence global opinion favorable to its undertakings. Publications in 2019 from The Conversation, Financial Times, Jamestown Foundation, and The New York Times described Mainland China's state- run media's reporting of the protests as disinformation and/or propaganda. Two articles in Quartz drew attention to the relationship between what it said were PRC and Russian propaganda campaigns and strategies. Hong Kong media The cover story of the Fall 2019 edition of Nieman Reports characterized the protests as a fight for a free press, noting the ways in which the city's independent news outlets adapted to an increasingly hostile media environment. In December 2019, a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists documented the ways in which China undermined media freedom in Hong Kong during the protests as part of what the organization said was its attempt to preserve press freedom. A December 2019 list that was published by the One Free Press Coalition which it said documented the month's most urgent cases of journalists whose press freedoms were under attack was topped by Sophia Xueqin Huang, a Chinese journalist who covered the protests in Hong Kong and was arrested in October 2019 on charges of \\"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\\" On April 2020, global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders released the 2020 edition of the World Press Freedom Index, which showed Hong Kong dropping seven places from 73rd in 2019 to 80th because of what the organization said was the city's its treatment of journalists during the demonstrations. An article in the Hong Kong Free Press said that the new ranking \\"marked a significant drop from 18th, where the city stood back when the index was created in 2002.\\" A May 2020 academic paper called the protests a \\"media-driven, tele-genic movement\\" with large numbers of amateur or citizen photojournalists and noted the democratic potential of the massification of Hong Kong journalism during the movement, but stated that the mass media also largely ignored the frequent use of racially-charged epithets, occasional anti-Mandarin violence, and other fascistic and xenophobic dimensions of the movement. A June 2020 opinion editorial by Reporters Without Borders criticized the passage of the Hong Kong national security law, with its secretary general calling for the world's democracies to take action to prevent Beijing from imposing the law that he said would be used as a means to prosecute journalists. Reuters reported that the law led to fears among Hong Kong's free media that they would be silenced and had echoes of China's own cyber crackdown. In response to the August 2020 arrest of pro-democracy media entrepreneur Jimmy Lai, an article in The Conversation said that the incident heralded an uncertain future for the remaining independent media in the territory. The arrest also drew criticism from the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong, the chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, and the Asia program co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Other international media A September 2019 article from Asia Times reported that international media outside of China have been overwhelmingly sympathetic to the movement to the point of strengthening the Chinese government's desire to control Hong Kong. A December 2019 report from the politically progressive media watchdog Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) said that US corporate media disproportionately focused on the Hong Kong protests with a single-minded narrative, while ignoring far more violent unrests around the world. Carrie Lam in a CNBC interview, as well as several Chinese media reports, cited the report as part of her accusation of foreign involvement behind the protests. A May 2020 academic paper described the Western coverage of the anti-government protests and its influence on Western politics as an example of mediatisation. The study cited the political orientalism of Western media, the colonial heritage of Hong Kong, and the Mainland Chinese media's clumsy dismissals of the protests as factors for the sympathy and attention given to the Hong Kong protestors by Western media. == References == Hong Kong Hong Kong ","title":"Reactions to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests"},{"id":"61597381","text":"Rosa 'New Dawn' is a light pink modern climbing rose cultivar, discovered by Somerset Rose Nursery in New Jersey in 1930.

She was in commission in the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) from 1913 to 1921, and was the first vessel the BOF ever operated on fishery patrols in the Alaska. Before the BOF purchased her, she was the commercial cannery tender Wigwam from 1895 to 1912. After her BOF career ended, she operated as a commercial motor tug with the name Foss No. 19 from 1922 to 1965 and with the name Kiowa from 1965 until she sank in 1978. == Early history == The vessel was constructed as the coal-burning commercial steamer Wigwam in San Francisco, California, in 1895.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Osprey, BOF's first Alaska patrol boat Under the ownership of the Alaska Packers Association, she became one of the first cannery tenders to operate in Alaska. At some point prior to her U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) service, the Alaska Packers Association rebuilt her to a high standard based on recommendations made by the Steamboat Inspection Service. ==Bureau of Fisheries== === Acquisition and characteristics === After the United States purchased Russian America from the Russian Empire in 1867 and created the Territory of Alaska, enforcement of whatever fishery regulations existed in Alaska fell to the revenue cutters of the United States Revenue-Marine, which in 1894 became the United States Revenue Cutter Service and was one of the ancestor organizations of the United States Coast Guard.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Early Fisheries Enforcement Patrol Boats (1912-39) On 14 June 1906, however, the United States Congress passed the Alien Fisheries Act to protect and regulate fisheries in the Alaska Territory by placing restrictions on the use of fishing tackle and on cannery operations in the territory and authorizing the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) to enforce the regulations. The BOF had no vessels suitable for fishery patrols in Alaska, and during the next few years relied on vessels borrowed from other United States Government agencies (such as the Revenue Cutter Service), on chartered vessels, and on transportation that canneries offered for free to BOF agents. This approach was not satisfactory for various reasons, such as the requirement for vessels of other government agencies to perform non-fishery-related functions, ethical concerns over accepting transportation from the canneries the BOF agents were supposed to regulate, and the difficulty of enforcing regulations when the local fishing and canning industry personnel warned one another of the approach of BOF agents who had accepted transportation on cannery vessels. Each year after the 1906 passage of the Alien Fisheries Act, the BOF requested more personnel and vessels with which to fulfill its regulatory and law enforcement responsibilities. By 1911, when the Alaska fishing industry reached an annual value of nearly US$17 million, it had become clear that the United States Government needed to make radical changes in how it enforced the provisions of the Alien Fisheries Act, including funding the acquisition of a fleet of dedicated fishery patrol vessels under the BOF. In the autumn of 1912, the BOF purchased Wigwam from the Alaska Packers Association for US$13,000 for use as the BOF's first Alaska fishery patrol vessel and renamed her USFS Osprey. Osprey had two masts, a steam winch on her forward main deck, a pilot house on her boat deck with quarters for three crew members, berths for six crew members in her forecastle, and accommodation for four crew members in her after cabin, which was finished in Spanish cedar and had folding berths. Her galley and dining room were on the forward main deck below the pilot house. She had a Scotch marine boiler and an compound steam engine which gave her an average speed of . Her dynamo was connected directly to a high-speed Corliss steam engine. For fuel, she could carry 7.5 tons of coal. Before placing Osprey in commission, the BOF had to await a Congressional appropriation to pay for a crew to man her, and meanwhile stored Osprey on the ways at Semiahmoo, Washington. The appropriation for a crew came into effect on 1 July 1913, and the BOF quickly relaunched Osprey at Semiahmoo, assigned a crew of six to her, commissioned her, and prepared her for her first voyage to Alaska as a BOF vessel. ===Operational history=== Osprey departed Washington on 8 July 1913 to steam north for her first season as a BOF patrol vessel in Alaskan waters. She was assigned Southeast Alaska as her operating area, with her home port at Juneau, Territory of Alaska, and by the end of 1913 had logged as a BOF vessel. Each summer, she enforced salmon-fishing laws and regulations in Southeast Alaska. The BOF soon encountered difficulties in operating Osprey as a patrol vessel. The Congressional appropriation to pay her crew required them to pay their own mess bills aboard ship, leaving crew members without enough pay left over to make employment aboard Osprey worthwhile, so crewing her with competent personnel was difficult. She could carry only 7.5 tons of coal, giving her only a radius, far too small to patrol the districts assigned to her in a large area like Alaska, and coal was expensive in Alaska, costing US$8.50 to US$12.75 a ton. As a coal-burner, she emitted a cloud of smoke from her stack that could be seen at a significant distance, and with few steam cannery tenders in service in Alaska, the sight of smoke on the horizon was almost a sure sign of the approach of Osprey, giving fishery violators ample time to evade detection and interception. Her aging boiler, installed when she was built in 1895, required constant maintenance – although the BOF never replaced it – and her seaworthiness was in question. The BOF's deputy commissioner, Ernest Lester Jones, spent 60 days aboard her in 1914 and – noting that she had only of freeboard amidships, a height of from her main deck to the top of her pilothouse, and most of her machinery above the waterline – reported that she was top-heavy, on one occasion in the autumn of 1914 rolling without warning onto her side in a strong wind, causing her engine room to flood. He described her as unseaworthy, confined to her dock on many days when her boiler was in need of maintenance, and dangerously unstable, unable to leave port whenever a strong wind was blowing. In 1915, after two inspectors found Osprey to be in a poor state of repair, the BOF believed that she would be condemned at Ketchikan, Territory of Alaska, but she avoided this fate and remained in service. In the spring of 1916, Osprey took part in stream investigation work at Wrangell, Territory of Alaska. After spending the summer of 1916 on her normal salmon enforcement duties in Southeast Alaska, she departed for Seattle, Washington, in October 1916 to undergo repairs there. She remained in Seattle for the rest of 1916 and throughout 1917. In January 1918, Osprey finally returned to Alaska. In the late spring of 1918 she came to the assistance of the boat Good Tidings, which had broken down during a storm, and towed her to Ketchikan. After the Canadian passenger liner ran aground on Vanderbilt Reef in Lynn Canal near Juneau, Territory of Alaska, and sank in a storm on 25 October 1918 with the loss of all 343 people on board – the worst maritime disaster in the combined history of Alaska and British Columbia – Osprey joined the BOF fishery patrol vessels and in a fruitless search for survivors that lasted into November 1918.AFSC Historical Corner: Auklet and Murre, 1917 Sister Patrol Vessels Retrieved September 17, 2018 In June 1919, the BOF transferred Osprey to Southcentral Alaska, where she patrolled until August 1919. The BOF found her so unseaworthy by that time that it sent her to Cordova, Territory of Alaska, to be laid up, and decided to spend no more money on significant repairs to her. Plans called for her to patrol for the last time during the 1920 fishing season, after which the BOF would condemn and sell her. She was beached near Cordova in the spring of 1920 to have her hull cleaned and copper painted in preparation for patrol work in the 1920 season, but on 25 May 1920 she settled into the gravel on the beach, rolled away from the shore onto her side, filled with water, and became partially submerged. About a week later, the U.S. Coast Guard cutter arrived to help. Osprey was refloated using a Bering River Coal Company scow and the water was pumped out of her. She patrolled off Southeast Alaska during the summer of 1920 and in September 1920 took part in salmon stream marking, bringing her BOF Alaska service to a close. In early 1921, USFS Auklet towed her to Seattle to be sold. According to a press report, Osprey was sold for US$550 at a public auction held in Seattle on 14 April 1921, but a May 1921 BOF bulletin claimed that the highest bid on 14 April, US$515, was too low, and the ship was not sold until a second auction on 29 June 1921 resulted in a winning bid of US$700. ==Later career== After her sale, the vessel became a commercial tug and may have reverted to the name Wigwam. By 1922, she had been resold to the Foss Launch and Tug Company, which rebuilt her to improve seaworthiness and replaced her steam engine and boiler with a Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine. Renamed Foss No. 19, she performed tug and towing services in both Puget Sound and Southeast Alaska, based at Ketchikan during her Alaska operations. She was the first Foss vessel to operate in Alaska. In the late 1930s, she began annual voyages to haul oil to communities in Southeast Alaska. Her engine was replaced around 1940 with a new Enterprise diesel engine powerful enough to allow Foss No. 19 to win many of the tug races she competed in during the 1950s. On 14 May 1965, Foss sold Foss No. 19 to Pat Stoppleman. Stoppleman renamed her Kiowa and replaced her engine with a Caterpillar D343 diesel engine. In 1967, Stoppleman sold Kiowa to Samson Tug & Barge, which based her at Sitka, Alaska. ==Loss== While towing a raft of logs to Wrangell, Alaska, with the Samson tug Calumet in Southeast Alaska on 29 October 1978, Kiowa suffered damage during a storm.alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (K) Calumet towed her to Herring Bay () on Frederick Sound in the Alexander Archipelago. The two tugs were still there on 30 October 1978, when the log booms broke up in bad weather, scattering the logs, and some of the logs tore open Kiowas stern. The 83-year- old Kiowa sank in of water without loss of life. Calumet rescued her crew. Kiowa was valued at US$80,000 at the time of her loss. == References == Category:Fishery protection vessels Category:Ships of the United States Bureau of Fisheries Category:Ships built in San Francisco Category:1895 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1920 Category:Maritime incidents in 1978 CAtegory:Shipwrecks of the Alaska coast ","title":"USFS Osprey"},{"id":"61597521","text":"Bettie Runnels (fl. 1897) was Louisiana's first female lawyer.

It was released in 1977. ==Background== The album presents the score without any cuts. It was recorded shortly after its musicians had performed the opera theatrically at the Holland Festival in 1976.Gramophone, February 1977, p. 1263 The Holland production was staged by the Netherlands Opera Foundation and produced by John Cox, with décor and costumes designed by Elizabeth Dalton.Strauss, Richard: Der Rosenkavalier, cond.

Herbert von Karajan, EMI LP SLS 810 and Georg SoltiStrauss, Richard: Der Rosenkavalier, cond. Georg Solti, Decca LP SET 418-21. Collectors might be lured to the new recording, he thought, by Frederica von Stade's Octavian, \\"a lovely reading by a favourite young mezzo\\". Musically, she sang with a tone that was ample, even and focused, and was as meticulous in her ensemble work as a violist in a great string quartet. Dramatically, she was equally effective in every chapter of Octavian's story - her outburst of anger with the Marschallin was \\"explosive\\", her banter with Sophie \\"perfectly delightful\\", her feigned inebriation as Mariandel \\"lovely to hear as well as comic\\". As Octavian's mistress, Evelyn Lear had \\"a timbre like old gold, a tenderness and teasing humour, many individual inflexions that recall no other Marschallin\\". Her singing fell short of technical perfection, but her acting was \\"attractive and skilful\\" and all her most important passages were executed \\"beautifully\\". Ruth Welting was guilty of a few vocal lapses too, perpetrating the occasional \\"flutter\\" above the stave, but her Sophie managed to be self-assertive while remaining \\"sweetly girlish\\". Jules Bastin endowed Ochs with a voice that was generous and equal to all Strauss's onerous demands. He deserved praise for his \\"attack and savory resonance, his smooth cantabile and his ripe enunciation of the text\\", though Solti's Manfred Jungwirth was both more accurate and funnier in his handling of Ochs's peasant idiolect. Derek Hammond-Stroud was a good Faninal overall, even if he sounded too young to be Welting's father and botched one note at his first appearance. José Carreras's Italian Singer was \\"too noisy\\". The many minor roles were all performed competently by a legion of Netherlanders. De Waart's Dutch orchestra, likewise, was unequivocally good. Its woodwinds were \\"crisp and savory\\", its brass \\"unusually firm and together and plump\\", its strings \\"active\\" and \\"stylish\\". De Waart sometimes set a pace that was too slow - in Ochs's climactic routing or in the duet \\"Mit Ihren Augen voll von Tränen\\", for instance - but his preludes were incandescent and his tempi in general \\"suitable and spirited\\". \\"The swagger of Ochs's entry in the second act [and] the elegance of the strings in the Letter Scene\\" were particularly worthy of note. Philips's production team had chosen to balance singers and instrumentalists without favouring either over the other, and had resisted the temptation to deploy \\"sound-effects or 'rhubarb' noises\\". In sum, whether the new album was preferable to its competitors was a matter of personal taste. Karajan's slightly abridged version was \\"enchanting\\" and \\"sparkling\\"; Solti's, complete, offered \\"unceasing brilliance\\" and Régine Crespin's Marschallin; de Waart's, also complete, was \\"less vivacious\\" than its predecessors but had von Stade's Octavian and the \\"confidence and style and operatic personality\\" that came from its theatrical origins.Mann, William, Gramophone, August 1977, pp. 339-340 Librettist Hugo von Hofmmannsthal in 1893 George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in October 1977. Pre-eminent among its singers was Frederica von Stade, he wrote, \\"an Octavian credible in all the guises of her mercurial role, who sings bewitchingly and whose warm, creamy tone soars above the staff with radiant ease\\". Evelyn Lear's resigned-sounding Marschallin was not as compellingly acted as would have been ideal, but was sung \\"exquisitely\\" with \\"many lovely phrases\\". Ruth Welting's Sophie was technically impeccable and vividly characterized though somewhat cool and thin of tone. As Ochs, Jules Bastin made up for his \\"limitations in range and resonance\\" by singing with a legato stylishness and by entirely submerging his Belgian identity into that of the Viennese baron. José Carreras was \\"refulgent\\" as the Italian tenor, if manifestly challenged by Strauss's climactic high C-flat. Derek Hammond-Stroud and the secondary cast were all at least satisfactory. Conducting, Edo de Waart brought \\"great affection to this music, along with a light touch, a great deal of tenderness, and, on the whole, just tempos\\". He elicited orchestral playing that was beautiful, consistently aristocratic and had the transparency of chamber music. The price of his restraint was that his recording seemed \\"somewhat lacking in passion\\". Philips's excellent engineering was wholly honest and innocent of any irritating trickery. The album as a whole was a fluent, conscientious, theatrically informed reading that deserved to be applauded, but it did not quite come up to the extraordinary standard set by Georg Solti's version on Decca.Jellinek, George, Stereo Review, October 1977, pp. 146-147 J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in April 1978. Frederica von Stade's Octavian was \\"vivid, stylish but feminine\\", he wrote, and Evelyn Lear's Marschallin \\"very touching in the quieter passages\\". But Ruth Welting's Sophie was \\"inadequate\\" and Jules Bastin's Baron Ochs \\"shallow toned\\". Although Edo de Waart \\"caught the youthfulness of the score with infectious zest\\", the weaknesses in his cast meant that his recording was no better than \\"a mixed pleasure\\"Steane, J. B., Gramophone, April 1978, p. 1678 Conductor Edo de Waart in 2008 Alan Blyth reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in December 1994. Its greatest asset, he thought, was Frederica von Stade's \\"beautifully sung, engaging, fully characterized Octavian\\", \\"perhaps her best performance on disc\\". She was as successful in portraying Octavian's comic dimension as his romantic and erotic ardour. The set's other three principals were less attractive. Evelyn Lear's reading of the Marschallin, although evidently the product of much reflection, was spoiled by a lack of emotional profundity and a voice that was unappealingly \\"worn and unfocused\\". Ruth Welting's Sophie was \\"keenly sung but slightly brittle and monochrome\\". Jules Bastin's enjoyably animated Baron Ochs was compromised by unconvincing Viennese diction and a timbre that was not deep enough for the role's requirements. The best performances in the minor roles came from José Carreras, in the high summer of his career, delivering an Italian Tenor of \\"outgoing élan\\", and Derek Hammond-Stroud as a convincing fusspot of a Faninal. The other minor parts were sung unexceptionably but without great distinction either. Edo de Waart's \\"lithe\\" conducting resisted the temptation to wallow at climaxes and elicited orchestral playing of Mozartian elegance. The album's audio quality was \\"clear and warm\\" but placed the soloists further back on the soundstage than was usual.Blyth, Alan, Gramophone, December 1994, pp. 160-162 Blyth mentioned the album in a survey of the opera's discography in Gramophone in May 2000. \\"The 1976 Philips set, unavailable at present, is no great loss. Except for the ... graceful conducting of Edo de Waart and Frederica von Stade's ... Octavian, it is an undistinguished affair with a poor Marschallin and Ochs.\\"Blyth, Alan, Gramophone, May 2000, p. 39 Patrick O'Connor reviewed a Decca reissue of the album on CD in Gramophone in August 2003. \\"In the title role\\", he wrote, \\"Frederica von Stade is at the peak of her considerable form. This, surely, must be exactly the sort of voice Strauss had in mind for the part\\". Evelyn Lear's Marschallin had \\"grace and gentle good humour\\", although not the sumptuous timbre needed to make the most of the role's moments of greatest sublimity. Ruth Welting was a \\"vivid\\" Sophie. Jules Bastin avoided the danger exaggerating Baron Ochs's absurdity and was admirably precise in his enunciation. Edo de Waart delivered a performance that was notable for its comedic awareness and its feeling of unity. O'Connor, Patrick, Gramophone, August 2003, p. 75 De Doelen, Philips's recording venue David Patrick Stearns included the album in a survey of the discography of the opera in Gramophone in May 2011. \\"Frederica von Stade's light, honeyed mezzo,\\" he wrote, [conveys] Octavian's impetuosity like no other. No recording so effectively captures the sense of two frightened teenagers - von Stade and Ruth Welting - beyond their ken.\\" Jules Bastin's baritonal timbre was positively an asset to his Baron Ochs. The orchestra played with as much champagne gaiety as if they had been performing Die Fledermaus. If Philips had been able to tape Evelyn Lear's Marschallin on some of the singer's better days, their album would have been the best studio recording of the opera ever made.Stearns, David Patrick, Gramophone, May 2011, p. 70 Stearns revisited the album in Gramophone in October 2011 when it was reissued on CD by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra's own label. \\"Vocally\\", he wrote, \\"Frederica von Stade is at her peak in a particularly tormented, emotionally mature portrayal of Octavian\\". It was true that the \\"vocal freshness\\" of Evelyn Lear's Marschallin had its ups and downs, but she gave a lively performance that was better than most critics had acknowledged. Ruth Welting's Sophie was \\"just fine, vocally and theatrically, if not that distinctive\\". It was an advantage to Jules Bastin that his timbre was as baritonal as it was: where deeper basses muddied Baron Ochs's music in a \\"pitch-obscuring rumble\\", his lighter tone enabled listeners to enjoy a \\"flood of character details from his considerable theatrical imagination\\". José Carreras abused his glorious voice by shouting his aria instead of singing it.Stearns, David Patrick, Gramophone, October 2011, p. 101 Bernardo Bellotto's 1758 painting of Vienna as seen from the Belvedere is an image of the place and era in which the comedy of Der Rosenkavalier unfolds ==Track listing: CD1== Richard Strauss (!864-1949) Der Rosenkavalier (Dresden, 1911), Kömodie für Musik in drei Aufzügen (Comedy for Music in three Acts); libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal (1874-1929) Act One * 1 (3:35) Prelude * 2 (7:56) Wie du warst, (Octavian, Marschallin) * 3 (4:10) Marie Thérès'!

The exterior design involved five bays with an entrance flanked by pilasters on the ground floor; there were five french doors with fanlights interspersed by four Ionic order pilasters together with a central stone balcony on the first floor; there were three circular windows with a moulded architrave above them on the second floor and vases were erected at roof level. Internally, the principal rooms on the first floor were the main hall and the council chamber. Works of art contained in the guildhall included a silver gilt roundel dated 1563 bearing the arms of Sir Thomas Bell, a former mayor of Gloucester. King Edward VII visited the guildhall on 23 June 1909 before departing for the Royal Agricultural Show at the Oxlease Showground on Alney Island. The guildhall also received a visit by the Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Duke of Edinburgh, to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the granting of the city's charter by King Henry II, on 3 May 1955. For much of the 20th century the guildhall was the meeting place of the county borough of Gloucester; it continued to be the local seat of government following the formation of the enlarged Gloucester City Council in 1974. However, in 1985 the council decided to move their meeting place to a converted warehouse at Gloucester Docks. The ground floor was converted into offices in 1987; a lease on the floor was taken by a branch of Cheltenham & Gloucester which, in September 2013, evolved into a branch of TSB Bank. Meanwhile, on the upper floors, an arts centre was established; the council chamber was converted into a cinema with capacity to seat 100 people in 1991, while the main hall, which has a capacity to seat 400 people, is still available for public use. The rock band, EMF, recorded a video of their first single, \\"Unbelievable\\", which reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, in the main hall one night in 1990. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Gloucestershire Category:Buildings and structures in Gloucester Category:City and town halls in England Category:Government buildings completed in 1892 ","title":"Gloucester Guildhall"},{"id":"61597643","text":"HK Levice is a professional Slovak ice hockey club based in Levice, Slovakia.

He studied architecture at the University of Liverpool School of Architecture and qualified as an architect in 1906. First articled to Francis Redfern, Kenworthy worked for several leading architectural firms in England before starting his own practice in 1909 in Southport. ==Practice in Australia== In 1911 Kenworthy moved to Sydney, Australia, taking up a position in the New South Wales Government Architect's Office, where he remained until 1923, having risen to be Architect-in-Chief, Secretary's Department, Theatres and Public Halls Section. From 1914 to 1922 he was also a part-time lecturer in Architecture at the Sydney Technical College. Until 1951 an examiner for the Board of Architects and the Sydney Technical College, Kenworthy was made a Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, having also served on the Institute Council and Education Committee. In 1923, Kenworthy left the NSW Public Service and became a partner in the firm of Henry Eli White, where he worked on many significant projects in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and New Zealand, including fourteen theatres such as the State Theatre, Sydney, Newcastle Civic Theatre, St. James Theatre, Auckland, Hengrove Hall, Macquarie Street, Chalfont Chambers, Phillip Street, St Kilda's Palais Theatre and the Melbourne Athenaeum. He left White's firm in 1929 to start his own practice at 105 Pitt Street, Sydney, where he stayed until his death, working all manner of works though theatres were most prominent as \\"a recognised authority on the design and construction of theatres and auditoria generally\\", including the Cremorne Orpheum, Mudgee Regent, Hurstville Savoy, Bankstown Regent and the Port Macquarie Ritz. At a speech to the Institute of Architects at Science House in 1933, Kenworthy observed that the modern theatre building \\"should be designed for both stage plays and talking pictures, and entrances and foyers should be spacious, and not cluttered up with soda fountains and confectionery counters.\\" On his death at his Lindfield residence at age 69 in 1954, he was described as \\"a man of brilliant brain and kind heart ...

Mann & Co. on Grand Piano No. 16750 Th. Mann & Co. was a German piano factory, existing in Bielefeld, Germany from 1836 until 1942, as well as instrument shop for pianos and harmoniums with temporary branch offices in Gütersloh, Herford, Detmold, Rinteln and Paderborn. == Christian Wilhelm Volkening == (occasionally J. Volkening, * around 1807 in Hille, † October 26, 1858 in Bielefeld) Volkening was a apprentice with Andreas Streicher in Vienna. Following his apprenticeship he went with two other assistants, Klems and Sassenhof, to northern Germany. While Klems continued his work in Düsseldorf and Sassenhof in Bremen, Volkening founded his piano workshop 1836 in Bielefeld. As a young instrument maker in Bielefeld, Volkening presented his grand pianos and uprights at the General German Trade Exhibition in Berlin in 1844, where he exhibited an upright and a grand piano with Streicher's patent mechanics, and at the first industrial exhibition of all peoples in London in 1851. In Berlin, his instruments were noticed by the professional audience: Volkening „lieferte in einem sowohl durch Ton als Spielart sehr ansprechenden Flügel und einen Pianino um so Verdienstlicheres, als ihm in dem kleinen Städtchen wohl schwerlich vorzügliche Muster zu Gebote stehen.“ The following year Volkening received the bronze medal at the \\"Gewerbeproducenten\\" exhibition in Berlin. Volkening pianino number 154 Around 1840 Volkening made a mahogany veneered grand piano on vase-like legs and with maple inlaid jewelry, which was played by Franz Liszt on his concert tour in 1841. A personal inscription of Liszt testifies to this concert on the instrument: \\"Bielefeld - concert on November 13 F. Liszt.\\" The instrument is now in the collection of the Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig. After own statement of the later factory Th. Mann & Co Volkening made one of the first baby grand piano, which design idea was recognized by a Saxon princess at a concert in Bad Oeynhausen 1850/51 and afterwards brought to Dresden. C. W. Volkening founded his business allegedly in the so called \\"Kühneschen Haus\\" at Kreuzstraße 565 in Bielefeld and employed 6 assistants. == Theophil man sen. == (Occasionally also Theophilus Mann or Theodor Mann, * April 14, 1831, † June 21, 1913) Highlighted locations of Th. Mann & Co., published in \\"Plan der Stadt Bielefeld gez. von H. Gier, Bielefeld, Pfeffer 1886 Theophil Mann was born the son of a master ropemaker in Hildesheim. Following his schooldays, he completed a carpentry apprenticeship before gaining an insight into piano construction in the workshop of the court instrument maker J. H. Weykopf in Hanover from 1848 onwards. After a short period, he returned to Hildesheim and worked with organ builder Heinrich Schaper. In 1849 C. W. Volkening called him to Bielefeld. Under Volkening, Th. Mann studied the piano construction industry from the ground up. To deepen his knowledge, Mann made in 1853 visits in the workshops of Ernst Irmler junior in Leipzig, Eduard Voigt and Karl Rönisch in Dresden, Karl Schönberner in Bautzen, Alois Bieber in Munich and Carl Blädel in Stuttgart. After the death of Volkening, Theophil Mann took over the workshop and continued as \\"Pianoforte = Factory Th. Mann, Bielefeld\\". His goal was the production of high-quality pianos with a well-trained staff. In the beginning of the company Theophil Mann sen. employed nine workers. The production quality had an effect on the instrument sales, and its increase made it necessary to expand the workshop. In 1868 the new building at Oberntorwall 29 in Bielefeld was completed and the factory moved out of the building Kreuzstrasse 565. Like Volkening before, Th. Mann sent exhibits to numerous industrial exhibitions in Germany and abroad. At the Industrial and Art Exhibition in London in 1862, Theophil Mann showed \\"a pianino with the device (...) of a 'movable hammer chair' instead of the Pédales céleste.\\" Pianino number 1008 by Theophil Mann, around 1873. For the year 1871, it is noted in the catalog of the Vienna World Fair in 1873 that Th. Mann employed 20 workers and produced 120 instruments that year, the sale of which made a revenue 24,000 Thaler. In 1873, Th. Mann presented at the world exhibition in Vienna three pianos for which he received a medal for merit. A cross-stringed piano for 975 Reichsmark, a straight- stringed instrument for 822 Rmk and a diagonal-stringed piano for 675 Rmk were on display. The ingenuity of the instrument maker, the solid construction of the pianos and their \\"noble (soft) tone\\" were emphasized. Shortly before the arrival of Hermann Steinhaus, the pianoforte factory Th. Mann employed 40 workers. === Private Life === On September 14, 1896 Th. Mann and his wife Sophie Mann, b. Oldermann (born July 7, 1839, † January 7, 1915) celebrated their silver wedding with relatives, friends and employees. === Social Commitment === Theophil man sen. was on the board of the von Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten (today Stiftungen) and initiated, together with Friedrich von Bodelschwingh the society \\"Arbeiterheim\\", which had the goal to create cheap livingspace for factory workers in Bielefeld.

Mann & Co. == advertisement stamp (Occasionally Wilhelm Steinhaus, * July 17, 1850, † February 9, 1933) Hermann Steinhaus was offspring of a respected family from Barmen. Steinhaus came to Bielefeld at the age of 22 and joined the piano factory Th. Mann as partner. From 1972 the factory was trading under the name Th. Mann & Co or Th. Mann & Cie. In some publications, the name was shortened to Mann & Co. or Mann & Cie. So called \\"Stutzflügel\\" (baby grand piano) by Th. Mann & Co. from 1911. In 1875, Th. Mann & Co. began erecting new buildings at the nearby Friedenstraße and the fabrication was converted to steam operation, which resulted in an increase of the body of workers. In the early morning hours of October 19, 1879, a fire broke out in the engine room of the factory, which was located towards the Grabenstrasse. With great efford of the local fire brigades it could be contained and extinguished without spilling over to adjacent buildings. According to the company's own information, the damage was minor. H. Steinhaus and Th. Mann were able to increase the quality and quantity of production, which was reflected in numerous acquired medals. The company scored a bronze medal for pianos in Dusseldorf in 1880. At the Amsterdam Colonial Exhibition in 1883, the company won a gold medal for pianinos. Likewise at the Antwerp International Exhibition in 1885, Th. Mann & Co. scored \\"the golden medal as a prize of first class for their pianinos.\\" Th. Mann & Co also achieved a golden medal for pianos at the World's Fair in Brussels in 1888. Later, at the Düsseldorf exhibition in 1902 they were able to achieve a Silver Medal. In 1883 Th. Mann & Co. already employed 70 workers. === Social Commitment === Hermann Steinhaus worked for years as a presbyter of the Neustädter Marienkirchengemeinde in Bielefeld. == Theophil Mann jr. == (* 8 February 1873, † March 18, 1935) Advertisement of Th. Mann & Co in \\"Zeitschrift für Instrumentenbau\\" from 1. April 1911. Due to age, Th. Mann sen. retired in 1905, and his son, who studied at Steinway & Sons in New York, C. Bechstein in London and in Paris, took over the technical management of the company. Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, the factory employed 100 workers, who made a piano every five hours, whereby a wagon load was exported weekly by train. At this time Th. Mann pianos were shipped to England, Belgium, Italy and other European countries, as well as overseas. In 1926, the company celebrated its 90th anniversary with an elaborate jubilee publication. In the aftermath of the First World War and the loss of access to the world market, the factory operations were in 1930 finally reunited to the site Oberntorwall 29. As a result of the death of Hermann Steinhaus in February 1933, Theophil Mann jun. became sole owner of the piano factory. Despite the dissolution of the company, the name Th. Mann & Co. continued to exist as a trademark. == Helene Mann == (born Nacken, * October 7, 1878, † November 4, 1939) After the death of Theophil Mann jr., his wife continued the business. The 100th anniversary was celebrated in 1936 with an extensive festival program. == Max Porth == (* 1886, † 1943) In 1942 the Berlin merchant and piano dealer Max Porth bought the factory. With that, the procuration of Rudolf Rosenberger ended. By that time, a business was in progress. == End of Production == Nothing is known about the actual stop of production. The highest opus number recorded in the literature is stated to be 20,000 for the year 1938. In most cases 1938 or 1939 are mentioned for the year the production discontinued. The factory buildings were allegedly victims of the bombing in the Second World War, in which large parts of Bielefeld city center were destroyed. Aerial views of the 1950s show a vacant lot on the site of the parent company. Furthermore, the object Oberntorwall 29 is listed as totally destroyed for the post-war period.

Founded in the 10th or 11th century, it was remodeled and rebuilt several times until it acquired its final architectural style by 1846. The church was almost completely destroyed in the 1991 Racha earthquake, only a portion of its wall remaining standing amid a rubble. The monastery is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. The Jruchi church at the headwaters of the Jruchula, a right-bank affluent of the Qvirila River near the modern-village of Tskhomareti, Sachkhere Municipality, on what historically was a frontier between the regions of Imereti and Racha. Exactly when the church was built is unknown; epigraphic analysis of a surviving church inscription as well as the style of sculpted architectural elements suggests the 9th/10th or 11th century as the most likely time of its construction. At some point in the 16th or 17th century the church passed in possession of the Tsereteli, one of the leading princely families of the Kingdom of Imereti, who probably acquired it from the Palavandishvili. By that time, the church, originally set in a plan of a three-nave basilica, had been remodeled into a domed building. In the 1730s, dukes of Racha dispossessed the Tsereteli of Jruchi and converted the monastery into a military stronghold. Sometime between 1753 and 1763, King Solomon I of Imereti divested the duke of Racha of its new possession, reestablished the convent, and restored it to the Tsereteli. The church was substantially reconstructed and expanded, between 1804 and 1843, by the metropolitan bishop David Tsereteli during his long tenure in various clerical positions in western Georgia. The Jruchi monastery housed many treasured church items, both locally produced and brought from elsewhere in Georgia. These included, among others, two illuminated manuscripts of the Gospel books, known as Jruchi I, dated to 936, and Jruchi II, dated to the late 12th century. Under the Soviet rule, the monastery was abolished and its antiquities were removed for safekeeping to the museums in Kutaisi and Tbilisi. The church, left in disuse and disrepair, was heavily affected by rainfalls and moisture. In April 1991, it was devastated by a strong earthquake. Church services continued to be occasionally held at the ruins and the territory was cleaned of debris. In 2018, a full-scale restoration project was announced. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Imereti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox monasteries Category:11th- century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:19th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings ","title":"Jruchi monastery"},{"id":"61598186","text":"ESPN Major League Baseball (ESPN MLB) is a baseball game in 2004 for Xbox and PS2.

One commonly accepted definition of the biological species concept is that individuals or populations are members of different species if they are incapable of successful interbreeding. While D. albomicans and Drosophila nasuta are commonly referred to as distinct species, there appears to be little to no sexual isolation between these two Drosophila species. Instead, behavioural differences appear to reproductively isolate these two species.

Its precise date of construction is unknown, but it is thought to have been created a little later than its counterpart the Tamamushi Shrine. The sculptures inside are dated to the years around 710 (the end of the Asuka period and start of the Nara period) and have been designated a National Treasure. ==History== The precise date of the shrine is uncertain, but it is generally placed at the end of the Asuka period (710). A terminus ante quem is provided by the first documentary evidence for its existence, mention in the temple inventory of 747, the , which includes \\"two items taking the form of a palace building, one with a design of a Thousand Buddhas in repoussé metalwork, the other with a statue of gilt bronze\\" (宮殿像貳具 一具金泥押出千佛像 一具金泥銅像); the former is understood to be the Tamamushi Shrine, the latter the Tachibana Shrine. A fuller description is given by the monk in his , also referred to as the , his 1230s account of Shōtoku Taishi, prince, regent, culture hero closely associated with the early promotion of Buddhism in Japan, and founder of the temple. Kenshin refers to the shrine's black lacquered pedestal, floor of gilt bronze waves, with lotuses rising up from it, and to the three sculptures placed upon them; attributes its commissioning to Lady Tachibana, the mother of Empress Kōmyō (the shrine may have been bestowed upon Hōryū-ji by Kōmyō on her mother's death in 733); and locates it to the west of the Tamamushi Shrine. The similarly refers to a west shrine with an Amida Triad - and it is understood that the two shrines were located on the great altar of the Kondō for many centuries, until their modern relocation to the Gallery of Temple Treasures. ==Description== The wooden shrine is generously proportioned for the three images it houses. The top is decorated in the form of a canopy with two rows of overlapping cloth hangings and a row of triangles, in blue, three different reds, yellow, and black, on a white ground. When first constructed, the shrine may have been open on all four sides, the roof supported on columns, making its doors a somewhat later addition. Of the three pairs of doors, at the front and either side, the two at the front are more recent, one of the originals being in the Fujita Collection. They are painted on both sides with Niō and Shitennō guardians and boddhisattvas, in gold paste on a lacquer ground. The pedestal, with carved lotus petals at top and bottom, is painted with a pair of standing boddhisattvas with raised hands on the front, arhats on the narrower sides, and on the better-preserved back, a scene with three figures in different poses on lotuses, on a white gofun ground, produced from heated shells. As well as that of the Tang, strong Indian influence has been identified in these paintings, with Soper and Paine remarking that \\"the shrine reveals the many influences which were then current in Buddhism, as it reached Japan at the turn of the seventh century\\". On the floor of the interior is a bronze plaque with a depiction in relief of a lotus pond, with ripples and lotus leaves. It is punctured with three holes from which rise three lotus stalks, upon which are seated the so-called Lady Tachibana nenjibutsu (tutelary image for daily personal worship), a gilt bronze triad of Amida flanked by Kannon (on the worshipper/viewer's right) and Seishi. Behind, with two slots in the base plaque, is a tripartite hinged screen with five boddhisattvas and heavenly maidens in relief, and an openwork halo for the central image. As Kidder has observed, the size of the two flanking figures makes them \\"little different\\" from the single images produced for aristocratic families, of which there are many examples amongst the Treasures from Hōryū-ji at Tokyo National Museum, while as an ensemble this is the most ambitious overall programme in bronze to survive. Marking the pinnacle of contemporary bronze casting and carving also from technological perspective, the statues have been designated a National Treasure. ==Significance== Thanks to its connection with Lady Tachibana, the shrine stands alongside the Taima mandala as testimony to eighth-century female interest in Amidism. ==See also== * National Treasures of Japan (Sculptures) * Buddhist Monuments in the Hōryū-ji Area * List of Hōryū-ji Treasures at Tokyo National Museum * Tamamushi Shrine * Shōsōin == References == ==External links== * Glass plates of the Tachibana Shrine (Tokyo National Research Institute for Cultural Properties) * Hōryū-ji Daihōzōin (Gallery of Temple Treasures) * CiNii for articles about the Tachibana Shrine (search term: 橘夫人) Category:Japanese sculpture Category:Asuka period Category:National Treasures of Japan Category:Hōryū-ji ","title":"Tachibana Shrine"},{"id":"61598328","text":"Lauris is a given name.

It aired on September 18, 2019, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Ryan Murphy & Brad Falchuk, and directed by Bradley Buecker. ==Plot== In 1970, three camp counselors are about to have a threesome in a cabin but one of the female counselors hears jingling. A mysterious figure enters, and the trio are stabbed to death. As the scene opens more widely, it reveals the sleeping campers have also been killed. In 1984, Xavier Plympton leads an aerobics class for Montana Duke, Ray Powell, Chet Clancy, and Brooke Thompson. Xavier describes the terror that the Night Stalker is wrecking on Los Angeles and says he is escaping to the re-opening Camp Redwood to avoid the murders. The others are convinced to join him as counselors at the camp. Brooke declines at first, but relents after she is assaulted in her home by a man claiming to be the Night Stalker. The next morning, the group goes on a road trip to Camp Redwood. At a rest stop, the gas station attendant warns the group that they are going to die, after discovering they are headed to the camp. The group's vehicle hits a man lying in the road. The group agrees to take him with them to get him medical attention. The camp's owner, Margaret Booth, instructs them to take the injured man to the infirmary, where the camp's nurse, Rita, tends to him. Margaret takes the counselors on a tour and explains the rules. They encounter Chef Bertie, an original camp counselor who volunteered to re-open the camp with Margaret. That night, the counselors gather around a fire, and Rita tells them of the incident that closed the camp 14 years before. The accused killer was Benjamin Richter, aka Mr. Jingles, a Vietnam veteran who was discharged dishonorably. Rita claims there were 10 victims, but Margaret approaches and corrects her that there were only nine; she was the sole survivor. She was the star witness at Jingles' trial, and he was sent to a mental institution. Brooke finds the amnesiac man awake and guides him back to bed. He is confused about the camp reopening, and warns her that something bad is going to happen. Trevor Kirchner, the activities director, arrives in their cabin. Later, he and Montana begin a sexual encounter in the lake but are interrupted by approaching car headlights at the edge of the lake. At a facility for the criminally insane, Dr. Hopple is informed that Richter has escaped. Three hours earlier, Richter, in his cell, lured in an orderly, whom he strangled to death. Hopple finds a newspaper clipping in the cell announcing the reopening of the camp. The gas station attendant, Roy, is repairing a car from underneath, and Richter crushes him by lowering the jacks. Richter takes his truck and drives to the camp. In the infirmary, Brooke finds the amnesiac man impaled on a hook and is pursued by Richter. She reaches the others, but they do not believe her; the hiker's body is missing when they investigate. Unable to sleep, Brooke hears the pay phone ringing (despite the hiker having said earlier the lines were down). She answers it and hears the jingling of keys, while being observed by the Night Stalker from afar. ==Reception== \\"Camp Redwood\\" was watched by 2.13 million people during its original broadcast and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. These results make this episode the lowest-rated season premiere in the series' history. The episode received largely positive reviews.

The opening credits are a thing of '80s beauty, and Buecker must have been studying the '80s slasher playbook because he nails the tone and shooting style, right down to recreation of some of the flaws of the genre.\\" He concluded his review by adding, \\"As solidly as Roanoke nailed reality television, 1984 nails the slasher sub-genre. For the most part, it avoids winking at the camera, Matthew Morrison's Trevor aside, and the episode works as a great setup for what's to come.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. She criticized the writing, saying, \\"Ryan Murphy appropriated the writing budget... and spent it all on thong leotards, shimmer stockings, and sleeveless polyester turtlenecks,\\" but she enjoyed the performances and look of the cast. She also noted and appreciated the references to classic horror films, citing I Know What You Did Last Summer, and calls the scene where Ramirez attacks Brooke \\"creepy\\". She ended her review by giving a positive opinion about the episode cliffhanger, commenting, \\"Because it’s 1984! Excess is in!\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 8.1 out of 10 and wrote, \\"American Horror Story: 1984 kicks things off with a story designed to dive back into '80s horror and remind us how fun and freaky the slasher genre can be. For the first time in a while, a bunch of decent (ish) characters are up on the chopping block, instead of the show's usual parade of vicious and cruel creeps. This suggests the season won't be a harsh hornet's nest full of nasty nightmares, like many previous installments have been, but instead a medium- spicy ride full of crowd-pleasing chills.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes ","title":"Camp Redwood (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"61598352","text":"Nawel Chiali (born 28 June 1991) is an Algerian rower.

In 1877 the station was abandoned. The whale stations had large kettles for rendering whale blubber into Whale oil, called tryworks. California's migrating whales were hunted in small boats from the station. Gray whales, as large as 36 tonnes, was the normal target. Hunting Gray whales in small boats was a very dangerous occupation, as many hunters were killed or injured. John Brown Whaling Company also operated at Portuguese Bend, starting in 1869. The last hunt was in 1885 due to the lack of the over hunted whales. Captain Joseph Clark is believed to have started the whaling industry in 1864.

The plant was introduced into the United Kingdom by Cants of Colchester rose growers in 1972. 'Just Joey' was inducted into the Rose Hall of Fame as \\"World's Favourite Rose\\" in 1994. ==History== Cants of Colchester, the oldest firm of commercial rose growers in Great Britain, was founded by Benjamin Cant in 1765. The nursery, 'Benjamin R Cant & Sons', was located in Mile End, now a northern suburb of Colchester. The firm originally sold a variety of plants, seeds, bulbs and trees. With the rise in popularity of roses in the mid 1800s, Benjamin R. Cant (1827-1900) initiated a rose breeding program at the nursery in 1875. By 1880, Cant had become a very successful rose exhibitor in England. Cant's nephew, Frank Cant (1857-1928), left the family business to establish his own nursery in Colchester in the early 1880s. The two Cant families became fierce competitors. The rivalry between the two nurseries lasted until the 1960s, when their descendants decided to merge the two family businesses into one company. The 'Benjamin R Cant & Sons' of Mile End Colchester and 'Frank Cant & Company' of Stanway, Essex became the 'Cants of Colchester' under the leadership of Cant family descendant, Roger Pawsey. Cants of Colchester has introduced several popular rose varieties, including Rosa 'English Miss', Rosa 'Alpine Sunset' and Rosa 'Goldstar'. 'Just Joey' was bred by Roger Pawsey and named in honor of his wife, Joey. The cultivar was created from parent hybrid tea roses, 'Fragrant Cloud' and 'Dr. A.J. Verhage'. The plant was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1972. 'Just Joey' was used to hybridize the following plants: Rosa 'Abbaye de Cluny', (1995), Rosa 'Apricot Candy', (2006), Rosa 'Bronze Star', (2000). 'Just Joey' was inducted into the Rose Hall of Fame as \\"World's Favourite Rose\\" in 1994. ==Description== 'Just Joey' is a tall, upright shrub, 5 to 6 ft (152—182 cm) in height with a 3 to 4 ft (90—121 cm) spread. Blooms are large, 4—5 in (10—12 cm) in diameter, with 26 to 40 petals. Flowers are borne mostly solitary or in small clusters, and bloom form is slightly ruffled. The flowers are a creamy orange or apricot color, with shades of dark copper. All petals eventually fade to cream. The rose has a strong, sweet fragrance and medium, glossy, leathery foliage. Bloom color is richest in cool weather. 'Just Joey' blooms in flushes from spring through fall. The plant does well in USDA zone 7b to 10b. ==Awards== * Rose Hall of Fame, (1994) ==See also== *Garden roses *Rose Hall of Fame *List of Award of Garden Merit roses ==References== ==Bibliography== * Just Joey ","title":"Rosa 'Just Joey'"},{"id":"61598486","text":"Travante António Williams (born July 29, 1993) is a professional basketball player who plays for Sporting CP.

It is a Grade II* listed building and is the meeting place of the Salisbury City Council. ==History== The first guildhall, known as the \\"Bishop's Guildhall\\", was built on the initiative of the Bishop of Salisbury, Simon of Ghent, in around 1314. It was so-called because this was the place where the bishop would exercise his feudal rights. A second building, known as the \\"Council House\\" was built by the Merchants Guild to the north of the original building in 1585. After the Council House was burnt down in a fire at a banquet, it was rebuilt, with a gift from Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor, in 1780. In 1785 the bishop gave up his rights as clerk of the market and in return was released from his obligations to maintain the guildhall.Salisbury: Improvement Act 1785 c. 93 This enabled the old Bishop's Guildhall, which had become dilapidated, to be demolished. The current building, which was designed by Sir Robert Taylor and William Pilkington, was built on the site of the former Bishop's Guildhall and completed in 1795. The design involved a portico with Doric order columns with triglyph frieze above; tall arched windows were inserted on each side of the portico. A grand jury room was added in 1829. There was a bomb explosion outside the guildhall in September 1884; according to the judge, the defendants had been \\"motivated by a mischievous desire to alarm the public\\". The building, which had been the meeting place of the municipal borough of Salisbury throughout much of the 20th century, became the headquarters of Salisbury District in 1974. == Present day == After the abolition of the district in 2009, the guildhall became the meeting place of the newly created Salisbury City Council. Princess Diana visited the guildhall on 14 May 1991, and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited, in the aftermath of the Salisbury nerve agent attack, on 22 June 2018. Works of art in the guildhall include a portrait by John de Critz of James VI and I, a portrait by Peter Lely of John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset and a painting by George Cole depicting a view of Salisbury from Harnham Hill.

She has been awarded the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, Thieme Award and was selected by the University of Chicago as a Rising Star in Chemistry. == Early life and education == Kalow is from Newton, Massachusetts. She studied chemistry and creative writing at Columbia University. She played the flute for the Columbia University Wind Ensemble. She worked with James L. Leighton on the synthesis of isocyclocitrinol and on an enantioselective imino-Nazarov reaction. During this placement she became more interested in a research career. She was awarded the Chemistry Undergraduate Award and Brownstein Writing Prize. She worked as an intern at Merck Research Laboratories, where she investigated trifluoromethylation using metal catalysts. In 2008 Kalow joined Princeton University as a graduate student with Abigail Doyle. Together they worked on asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination. She used cooperative catalysis in fluorination reactions, which allowed for selective radiofluorination. Her work was awarded an American Chemical Society Division of Organic Chemistry Graduate Fellowship. == Research and career == In 2013 Kalow joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral fellow with Timothy M. Swager. She worked on telechelic P3HT synthesis, as well as miktoarm polymers using ring-opening metathesis polymerisation. Kalow became interested in the use of complex emulsions in enzyme sensing, as well as self-assembly of block copolymers. She joined Northwestern University in 2016. She is a member of the National Science Foundation Center for Sustainable Polymers. Her work considers organic synthesis and polymer chemistry, and is interested in photoresponsive materials. This includes creating polymers with controlled chain lengths using selective photoexcitation. To achieve this, Kalow is developing photochemically gated junctions, which allow spatiotemporal control of junction dynamics. These junctions permit for transient regions of fast and slow exchange dynamics, which operate over long length scales. Her group are also developing hydrogels that can be controlled using light. In 2017 Kalow was named a Searle Fellow at Northwestern University. === Selected publications === Her publications include; * * * === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 2019 National Science Foundation CAREER Award * 2019 American Chemical Society PMSE Young Investigator * 2018 3M Non- tenured Faculty Award * 2018 Thieme Chemistry Journal Award * 2017 Air Force Research Laboratory Award * 2015 University of Chicago Rising Star in Chemistry She is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. == References == Category:American women chemists Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology fellows Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Julia Kalow"},{"id":"61598631","text":"350px Cromwell with the Coffin of Charles I is a partially-varnished c.1831 watercolour by Eugène Delacroix, now in the Département des Arts graphiques of the Louvre in Paris. ==Production== The work was painted as a reaction against Paul Delaroche's Cromwell and Charles I, exhibited at the 1831 Paris Salon, the first to be held after the July Revolution and Louis-Philippe I's seizure of power - Delacroix's own Liberty Leading the People had been exhibited at the same Salon.

Delacroix's work imitated Delaroche's historical realism but as a small watercolour not a huge canvas. It also added Delacroix's own romanticism, which attempted to revive the past by evoking emotion.Historical Abstracts : 1775-1914, vol. 45, no.s 3-4, American Bibliographical Center, Clio, 1994, p. 906. Unlike Delaroche, Delacroix preferred to imagine an evolving and troubled Cromwell on the edge of the scene not at its centre, finding the coffin by accident.

It recalls the watercolour style of Delacroix's friend Richard Parkes Bonington, even down to the theatrical curtain above Charles' head. Unlike in Delaroche's work, all but Charles' head is unseen, recalling his beheading. Delaroche ignored the criticism of his work and showed Cromwell again in his Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers in 1836, which was so strongly savaged by the critics that Delaroche never exhibited at the Paris Salon again and barely exhibited outside it either. Delacroix's work was acquired in December 1942 from Raphaël Gérard for 8750 Reichsmarks (175,000 francs) for the Museum Folkwang in Essen, but was returned to the Louvre in 1948 as part of the first consignment of looted art to leave Düsseldorf. After its return to France it was assigned to the Louvre. ==References== == Bibliography == * L’Invention du Passé.

It is a sequel to Top Gear Pocket. ==Gameplay== The player tries to overtake a computer- controlled opponent. Top Gear Pocket 2 is racing video game where the player drives rally cars through closed-circuit courses. The player starts in the last position and must overtake a number of opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence before crossing the finish line on the last lap. Points are awarded to the player depending o the position they finish a course. These can be used to buy or upgrade cars, which have four attributes: acceleration, top speed, handling, and braking. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where two players can race against each other. The Game Link Cable is required for multiplayer. ==Development and release== Top Gear Pocket 2 was developed by Kemco as a sequel to Top Gear Pocket. The game uses an enhanced version of its predecessor's engine. Unlike its predecessor, the game cartridge does not feature a built-in rumble feature, but includes a battery which allows players to save their progress. Top Gear Pocket 2 was released on February 1, 2000 in North America. In Europe, the game was released as Top Gear Rally 2. ==Reception== Top Gear Pocket 2 received generally favorable reviews from video game publications. At the time of its release, IGN reviewer Craig Harris considered it one of the best racing games on the Game Boy Color, stating that the game had been \\"tweaked and refined as a quality racing game\\", and concluding that its increasing difficulty offers a proper challenge as players progress through the game. However, he criticized the multiplayer mode because of its \\"catch-up\\" feature, noting that the \\"only real challenge is trying to keep behind the other person and guess when the final stretch approaches so you can win.\\" AllGame criticized the car attributes for being unbalanced, noting that the top speed is the only one that has a significant impact on the gameplay, but still considered the game enjoyable to play due to its sensation of speed. The British video game magazie Planet Game Boy highlighted the game's speed and pace, especially as better cars are unlocked, while the Spanish official Nintendo magazine Nintendo Acción praised the graphic improvements over its predecessor, stating that the cars are more detailed and that sharp curves and elevation changes are better animated. ==References== ;Notes ;Citation ==External links== * Category:2000 video games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Game Boy Color-only games Category:Kemco games Category:Vatical Entertainment games Category:Off-road racing video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Top Gear series Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Top Gear Pocket 2"},{"id":"61598671","text":"Romeo Panciroli (born 21 November 1923 – 17 March 2006) was an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church who worked in communications until 1984 and then in the diplomatic service of the Holy See. ==Biography == He was born in Reggio Emilia on 21 November 1923 and grew up in San Polo d'Enza. On 11 June 1949, he was ordained a priest of the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus. He worked in Verona on the Comboni monthly magazine Nigrizia and then in Rome as secretary to the central committee for the Holy Year of 1950. He returned to Verona and taught ethics and philosophy and moved to Rome again to work for Messis Film, which produced documentaries and films. From 1959 to 1964 he worked at the apostolic delegation in Lagos, Nigeria.

In: Larousse Dictionnaire de la Musique. Édition 2005, p. 193. The songs cover most of his creative years, from the early 1860s to 1890, when the illness which would kill him prevented much composition. He came late to music as a profession, but – although being an exceptional pianist – he had no trappings of a formal training: no conservatoire studies, no Prix de Rome, \\"none of the conventional badges of French academic musicians, by whom he was regarded as an amateur\\" (in the best sense).Crichton, Ronald. Chabrier – high spirits and a soft heart. Opera, September 1991, p. 1028-1033. There are forty-three published songs by Chabrier. He began composing these mélodies when he was about twenty- one; the first nine were written between 1862 and 1866. Chabrier never set any verse by his friend Verlaine (although they did collaborate on two opéras- bouffes Fisch-Ton-Kan and Vaucochard et fils Ier), but among the better-known poets whose verse Chabrier did set in these early songs were Théodore de Banville (\\"Lied\\") and Alfred de Musset (\\"Adieux à Suzon\\").Johnson, Graham. Musique adorable! The songs of Emmanuel Chabrier. (The Hyperion French Song Edition). Booklet accompanying Hyperion CDs CDA67133/4, 2001. Chabrier gave up his job at the Ministry of the Interior in 1880; as a full-time composer he set texts by Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Catulle Mendès, Edmond Rostand and his wife Rosemonde Gérard, as well as lesser-known poets, and these songs were often intended for notable singers, such as Lucien Fugère, Émile Engel, Jeanne Granier, Ernest Van Dyck and Paul Lhérie.Delage, Roger. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999. Catalogue des oeuvres, pp. 685–715. In a 1891 letter to Madame Colonne, wife of the famous conductor, Chabrier wrote \\"I'm not a natural writer of romances, which is unfortunate, because the song, agreeably warbled in salons is, at the present time, the only way for a French composer to more or less pay the rent.\\" None of his songs were a commercial success. ==Introduction== While not on the level of his contemporaries Fauré and Duparc, some of Chabrier's songs are \\"unique in the nineteenth century for their wit and satirical humour\\". Examples such as the \\"Villanelle des petits canards\\", the \\"Ballade des gros dindons\\", and the \\"Pastorale des cochons roses\\" (from the Six mélodies of 1890) \\"anticipated by some years the twentieth-century reaction against Romantic song\\".David Tunley: The New Oxford History of Music. Romanticism 1830-1890, vol IX, IX Solo song (b) France, p. 703. Ravel claimed that \\"it is impossible to hear two of his chords without attributing them at once to him, and to him alone\\". French composer Henri Barraud asserted that he was \\"the most gifted inventor of unimagined harmonies, of rare combinations of timbres, the most vigorous colourist and the most straightforward melodist\\".Bernac, 1970, p. 81. Enoch, his publisher, tried to get Chabrier to simplify what they judged to be complex piano parts which would discourage amateurs (and thus reduce sales); despite objections from the composer an edition with easy accompaniments was issued by them.Delage, Roger: \\"Chabrier Mélodiste\\", in: Emmanuel Chabrier: Ostinato rigore – Revue internationale d'études musicales, No. 3, 1994 (Paris: Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre), p. 68. All are strophic songs, but the rhythm is usually cleverly modified in each stanza to suit the prosody of the literary text. They require, together with perfect precision, a supple, elegant style of interpretation, slightly whimsical; as remarked by Poulenc, a \\"laisser-aller contrôlé\\".Bernac, 1970, p. 81. The singer Claire Croiza (1882-1946) argued that in Chabrier's mélodies there is \\"a male quality that a woman singer can never give entirely. It must be a man who drinks well and eats well\\". She continued, \\"There is a basic roundness, and frankness. Fugère knew how to sing Chabrier. He brought to it his own roundness, his joviality.\\"Claire Croiza: The Singer as Interpreter (Paris: Gollancz, 1989), p. 78–79. The pianist and scholar Graham Johnson comments in relation to several of the songs that the demands on the singer, particularly in range of expression, can be extreme, for example \\"Ivresses!\\". In his book on the composer, his spiritual descendant, Francis Poulenc, contends that the difficulty for many singers – amateur and professional – is that Chabrier's songs fall half-way between the concert platform and the stage. He cites Jane Bathori, Roger Bourdin and Pierre Bernac as singers of his time who sought to keep their spirit alive in performance.Francis Poulenc: Emmanuel Chabrier (Paris/Geneva: La Palatine, 1961), p. 108–109. A complete edition of the 25 original songs (excluding the regional folk song arrangements), edited and with an introduction by Roger Delage, was published in 1995 (Heugel, Paris), including two which had never before been published, Le Pas d'armes du roi Jean and Ivresses.Jacques Girard: Emmanuel Chabrier: d'Ambert à Paris (Champetières: Éd. de la Montmarie, 2009), p. 194–195. ==Early songs== Victor de Laprade Théodore de Banville Couplets de Mariette – « Son absence me désespère » (Mariette's song : \\"His absence makes me despair\\") (1862) – anon. Mariette laments the loss of her partner of 15 years. Johnson sees a precursor of the \\"Chanson de l'alouette\\" from Act 1 of Le Roi malgré lui. Darius Milhaud inserted the song, with new words by René Chalupt, into a production of Une éducation manquée for Diaghilev in Monte Carlo in 1924.Buckle, Richard. Diaghilev. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1979, p. 414. L'Enfant – « L'enfant est roi parmi nous » (\\"The child rules us as a king\\") (1862) – words by Victor de Laprade (from Idylles héroïques, 1855). Parents welcome the arrival of a baby, and an impending exacting presence in the home. Ronde gauloise – « J'ai vu la fille du meunier » (\\"I saw the miller's daughter\\") (1862) – anon. The song evokes a bourrée folk song as a young man gives voice to his love. Le Sentier sombre – « Il est un sentier sombre au fond de nos vallées » (\\"There's a shady path down in the valley\\") (1862) – anon. A country lad recalls his first love. Lied – « Avec ces traits harmonieux » (\\"with these harmonious features\\") (1862) – words by Théodore de Banville ('Inviolata' from Améthystes, 1862). Another love song, where the performers are instructed to sing \\"con passione\\". Chants d'oiseaux – « Quand nous chantons nos amours » (Bird songs :\\"When we sing about our love\\") (1862) – words by Victor de Laprade (in the Livre troisième of Rose Mystica from Idylles héroïques, 1855). Johnson regards it as \\"one of Chabrier's earliest masterpieces – a perfect example of his musical conjuring\\". Predating the barnyard songs, in this second Laprade setting, a bird in a tree comments on the vicissitudes of human love. Sérénade – « La plus charmante femme » (\\"The most charming woman\\") (1862) – words by the painter, sculptor and poet Auguste de Châtillon (from À la Grand'Pinte, 1860). A man sings of his obsessive love. Adieux à Suzon (1862) – words by Alfred de Musset (1852; later set by Bizet in 1866). A man's vigorous farewell to his love which ends in \\"renunciation and gentle melancholy\\" (Johnson). Musicologist Winton Dean describes Bizet's version as a \\"delightful setting of a half-tender, half-mocking love poem\\",Dean, Winton. Bizet. J M Dent & Sons Ltd, London, 3rd edition, 1978 reprint, p153. but Delage considers that Chabrier's setting, with its triple rhythm, sly chromaticism in the bass line, all part of an \\"allegro risoluto ed appassionato\\" captures better the mood of the poet.Delage, 1999, p. 79 Ah! petit démon (« Ha, little devil ») (1862) – words by Auguste de Châtillon (from À la Grand'Pinte, 1860). The second Châtillon setting concerns the 'little devil' who comes to steal the singer's grapes at midnight. ==The developing songwriter== Victor Hugo Le pas d'armes du roi Jean – « Ça! qu'on selle » (\\"Right, saddle-up\\") (1866) – words by Victor Hugo (Ballade XII from Odes et Ballades, 1826). The song is about a page who falls in a tournament. The young Saint-Saëns set fourteen of Hugo's 32 verses in 1852; Chabrier set eight. \\"One must admire Saint-Saëns's skill in making a long and effective piece out of unpromising material [...] how much better Chabrier captures, right from the start, the spirit of the festive joust with music which rattles jovially between the hands\\", Johnson comments. Chabrier regularly sang this song at the Marquise de Ricard's Parnassian salon. It evokes the galop of a horse and plays on ambivalence between modal and tonal harmony, creating new and strange effects.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 59. Ivresses! Grande Valse – « Viens! je veux les caresses » (\\"Come, I want your caresses\\") (1869) – words by Léon Labarre. The song is about uncontrollable physical love with wild and impassioned pleas for wine and kisses; Delage describes the words of this song as \\"improbable\\" (« invraisemblables ») but Chabrier manages through two gay and rhythmic waltzes to evoke the world of the café-concert. The music reappears subsequently in his Suite de valses of 1872.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p59. After a vivace introduction, interrupted by a mysterious andante, the first waltz mimes musically an ardent, unbuttoned love. The second waltz 'espress. Ed appassionato' starts after a short recitative like passage ; the first waltz returns with new harmonies. Notes on the score (cymbal, timpani, violins) indicate that Chabrier had an orchestration in mind.Delage Fayard 1999 p126. Steven Huebner notes that Chabrier's melodies (instrumental and vocal) are frequently combined with chromatic decoration, citing as an example 'Ivresses'.Huebner, Steven: 'Chabrier, Emmanuel', The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. S. Sadie and J. Tyrrell (London: Macmillan, 2001), v, 403-408. L'invitation au voyage (1870) – « Mon enfant, ma sœur, songe à la douceur d'aller là-bas » (Call to expedition : \\"My child, sister, think how sweet to go over there\\") words by Charles Baudelaire (from Les Fleurs du mal, 1855, 1857), set at the same time by Duparc (two verses only). This is about lovers escaping to a place of luxury, calm and sensuality. Chabrier's longest song contains an obbligato part for bassoon. Chabrier savoured the richness of full 9th harmonics; the phrase \\"d'aller là-bas vivre ensemble\\" in this song is \\"set to a succession of 9th chords with root movement by a 5th. The whole song is a study in such harmonies where Chabrier pays particular attention to the colour of the 9th in different registers of the keyboard and even the voice\\". Sérénade de Ruy Blas – « À quoi bon entendre les oiseaux des bois ? » (\\"Why listen to the birds from the woods\\" – the most tender bird sings in your voice...) (1873, published in 1913) words by Victor Hugo (from Act II of Ruy Blas, 1838; off-stage voices of laundrywomen). Set in 17th century Spain; the music follows the text closely. It features a lively ritournelle between the verses and a close of softness and mystery, briefly and unexpectedly turning to the sub-dominant, very typical of the composer. A rich and lavish accompaniment sets out it apart from the typical French romance, ranging – with embellishments, shades of modal hue and chromaticism – across the whole keyboard.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p60. Composed in the same year as Chabrier's ground-breaking Impromptu for piano, Roy Howat writes that it could easily pass for Wolf.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music – Debussy, Ravel, Fauré, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p363, n32. ==Full-time composer== Sommation irrespectueuse – « Rire, étant si jolie, c'est mal » (Disrespectful address : \\"Laughter, being so pretty, is wrong\\") (1880) – words by Victor Hugo (Sommation irrespectueuse, VIII. of L'éternel petit roman, VI. from Les Chansons des Rues et des Bois, 1865). This dark song was composed in August 1880 when the Chabriers were on holiday at Saint-Pair-sur-Mer; another poem from the same Hugo collection at the same time inspired Idylle, the sixth Pièces pittoresques. The song was premiered at the Société Nationale de Musique on 9 April 1881 by Léon Melchissédec, like Chabrier from Auvergne. Modal colouration is present again, though Delage contends that Chabrier's use of modes differs from his younger friend Fauré, in coming from \\"popular music imbibed in childhood, rather than through formal study of 16th century music\\".Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3 , 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 61. Howat remarks that this song, with echoes of Mussorgsky (specifically \\"In the corner\\", no.2 from The Nursery), is probably the earliest example of the assimilation of contemporary Russian musical syntax into French music, and which Chabrier would have been exposed to only via scores, as Mussorgsky's songs were not heard in Paris until the mid 1890s.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music – Debussy, Ravel, Fauré, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p. 127. Johnson adds that the verses 16 to 18 are \\"set to some of the most frantic music in all Chabrier\\". Credo d'amour – « Je crois aux choses éternelles » (Love creed : \\"I believe in things eternal\\") (1883) – words by Armand Silvestre ('Credo' from La chanson des heures, 1878). A few years previously Chabrier had begun work with Silvestre on Le Sabbat, a two-act opéra comique, which was not completed. The words reflect the composer's regular praise of the female sex. It is dedicated to Mme Enoch, wife of one of his publishers.Desaymard, Joseph. Un Artiste Auvergnat – Emmanuel Chabrier. Imprimeries G Mont-Louis (Clermont-Ferrand), Librairie Fischbacher (Paris), 1908, p. 63 Index Bibliographique – Oeuvres d'Emmanuel Chabrier. \\"España\\" – « À Séville, séjour où les roses » (\\"In Seville, where the roses bloom\\") (1883) – the words by Eugène Adenis were written to fit the most famous work by Chabrier, his orchestral rhapsody of 1883, one of several arrangements of the work. Tes yeux bleus (1883) – words by Maurice Rollinat (from Les névroses, 1883). The song is about the pleasures of sensual enjoyment. With words by a close colleague, Chabrier seems here to have absorbed the musical language of the love duets from Tristan und Isolde, which he had seen and heard in Munich in 1880. The song was first heard in public in 1887 at the Société Nationale. Although Wagnerian techniques abound – unorthodox scales and cadences, rhythmic ambiguities between and – Chabrier retains his own voice. The manuscript carries a sub-title romance, implying the old French form, which is highlighted by use of the title words as a refrain.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 62. Howat sees a precedent here for the Adagio assai second movement of Ravel's G major concerto « with its undercurrent of across its slow metre ».Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music – Debussy, Ravel, Fauré, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p. 195. Maurice Rollinat One writer has noted that it is an example of Chabrier's gift \\"one which eluded so many of his contemporaries – of allowing his music to be suffused by the influence of Wagner whilst still retaining his own distinctive voice\\". Although the music includes clear allusions to the German composer – a pulsating quaver accompaniment, extended, arching vocal lines, and the echoes of the Liebestod in the final bars – Chabrier adds \\"with the lightest of touches, other dimensions which are entirely his own such as the delicate cross-rhythms in the accompaniment.Christopher Glynn. Programme note for 'Une rare émotion – The songs of Maurice Ravel and his circle'. Wigmore Hall, 15 January 2012. This is the only song to have been orchestrated by Chabrier – for strings.Delage 1999 p. 706-707. Lied – « Nez au vent, cœur plein d'aise » (\\"Into the breeze, happy at heart\\") (1886) – words by Catulle Mendès (from Philoméla, 1863) This the second Chabrier song with this title, but on a very different subject matter; marked \\"gaiement\\", it concerns an encounter between Berthe and an elf in the woods who tempts her to go and pick strawberries off the beaten path. In his book on Chabrier, Poulenc wrote \\"I know of nothing so insolent in French song\\".Poulenc, Francis. Emmanuel Chabrier. La Palatine, Paris/Geneva, 1961, p. 109 (\\"Je ne sais rien d'aussi impertinent dans la mélodie française\\". He also describes the poem as \\"fripon\\", or \\"roguish\\" and the whole song as \\"d'une fantaisie extraordinaire\\". Bernac describes this as a \\"gay, naughty, (and very 1890s) little poem, so wonderfully expressed musically\\", and recommends a strict tempo with no rubato.Bernac, 1970, p. 85. Delage points out that Berthe has lost her way in the uncertain tonality of the opening ritournelle; only rediscovering it in bar nine. Although in couplets, each one is varied according to the words enlivened by the melody straying into different registers while the accompaniment frees itself into roguish dissonances.Delage 1999, p. 353. Chanson pour Jeanne – « Puisque les roses sont jolies » (\\"Since the roses are pretty\\") (1886) – words by Catulle Mendès (from Intermède, 1885) It was in connection with this song (entitled 'Romance') that Chabrier wrote a notable letter to his publishers Enoch in which he vouched that its music \\"is certainly music of today or tomorrow, but not of yesterday\\", adding \\"This romance, you doubtlessly won't understand any of it, at first glance; I will play it to you in three weeks... do not make a judgement until you have studied it\\". It was dedicated to Émile Engel, who had created the rôle of Armel in Chabrier's Gwendoline in April 1886 and remained a friend.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 63. Although the song is basically strophic, the composer creates modulations by juxtaposition of a differing melodic vision and adding foreign notes to ordinary chords of the scale.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 64. Chabrier's subtly equivocal harmonies here are so original in their application that they had a profound effect of the musical development of Ravel.Gerald Larner. Programme notes, Wigmore Hall Song Recital Series, 10 February 2011, Wigmore Hall, London. In his 'Esquisse autobiographique' of 1928, Ravel wrote \\"the Habanera [Ravel, 1895] embodies many of the elements which were to dominate my later compositions, and which through Chabrier's influence (as for instance in the \\"Chanson pour Jeanne\\") I have been able to crystallize\\". Ravel brought this song to his harmony classes under Pessard.Roland-Manuel. Maurice Ravel. Dennis Dobson Ltd, London, 1947, p. 22 and 20 (translated from the French 1938 edition by Cynthia Jolly). Markings \\"dolce\\" and \\"espressivo\\" predominate. Bernac considers this as \\"another mélodie extremely rubato. The numerous changes in tempo, the dynamics and nuances are carefully indicated and should be observed\\".Bernac, 1970, p. 83. == Les plus jolies chansons du pays de France == In 1888 Chabrier arranged sixteen French folk songs for an anthology called Le plus jolies chansons du pays de France. He was among the first important composers at this time to work in this way with folk songs, a pioneer for Ravel, Bartók, Britten and others. Johnson comments that Chabrier's touch in these pieces is \\"deceptively light and restrained\\", but that the piano writing adds enormously to the charm of the music. *Les Métamorphoses – 'Chanson canadienne' (No.7) – Canada a circular song in where the lovers 'transform' themselves until they eventually catch each other. *Sur le bord de l'île – 'Chanson champenoise' (No.13) – from Champagne. A girl drops her gold ring in the river and a young man drowns trying to rescue it. *Les Filles de trente ans – 'Chanson angoumoisine' (No.16) – from Angoumois …are too old and have missed out on love. *Marion s'en va-t-a l'ou – 'Chanson auvergnate' (No.19) – from Auvergne ; a song also found in Poitou and Angoulême. *La Mie du voleur – 'Chanson agenoise' (No.20), where a girl refuses the hand of a swordsman in favour of a thief. *Que les amants ont de la peine! – 'Chanson poitevine' (No.21) – from Poitou – the tribulations of lovers. *Le Flambeau éteint – 'Chanson nivernaise' (No.24) – from Nivernais (a song also found in Nordic countries), where the torch in the title lures the handsome youth to death by his lover's father. *Joli dragon – 'Chanson languedocienne' (No.25) – from Languedoc where a handsome soldier, courted by a lady, returns to his own land where the girls are prettier. *Nique nac no muse! – 'Chanson normande' (No.26) – from Normandy. The title words are nonsense, but a man is overcome by the beauty of his sweetheart. *La Bien-aimée – 'Chanson angoumoisine' (No.29) where a girl wanders by the river with three young men. *La Mort de la brune – 'Chanson franc-comtoise' (No.31) – from Franche-Comté. An elegy on a dying girl. *Les Garçons de Bordeaux – 'Chanson bordelaise' (No.32) is a sailor's song. *Bergère et Chasseur – 'Chanson poitevine' (No.33). A huntsman fails to seduce a shepherdess, whose lover is in the king's service in Paris. *La Fleur dorée – 'Chanson agenoise' (No.34) compares the yellow flowers of the field with a gold flower in the heart. *Entrez, la Belle en vigne – 'Chanson saintongeoise' (No.35) – from Saintonge. A young woman hesitates to enter the vineyard because of the thorns, but is persuaded by the offer of gloves. *Le Déserteur – 'Chanson poitevine' (No.36) ==Late songs== 6 mélodies (1890) come just before the onset of the degeneration of Chabrier's health as he completed his last piano work, the Bourrée fantasque, and struggled to get his opera Briséïs committed to manuscript. Of these six, a group of four songs with a linking theme is what Chabrier called his \\"volailleries\\" [fowl songs], to lyrics by Edmond Rostand and Rosemonde Gérard, with subjects including fat turkeys, little ducklings, pink pigs and chirping cicadas. Rollo Myers comments that these songs \\"could have been written by no one else\\", and that in the four \\"farmyard songs\\", as they are more usually referred to, Chabrier \\"made musical history\\" where \\"the salient features of each of the creatures portrayed are underlined with a most disarming mixture of irony, humour and realism\\". Although Offenbach (1842) and Lecocq (among others) had set some of La Fontaine's animal fables to music, Chabrier \\"introduced a new note into contemporary French music\\", prefiguring Ravel's Histoires naturelles.Myers, Rollo. Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. Associated University Presses, Cranbury, 1970, p. 90-91. Although he did not complete others in a similar vein, Coquelin Cadet wrote to Chabrier asking him to write a Ballade des Veaux (also referrred to by Chabrier as Valse des Veaux).Delage p. 528 Portrait of Edmond Rostand.jpgRostand Rosemonde Gérard.jpgand Gérard Ballade des gros dindons – « Les gros dindons, à travers champs » (1889) – words by Edmond Rostand (according to Delage the verse may have been written expressly for Chabrier). It is marked \\"bêtement\\" (stupidly). Compared with other Chabrier songs, the Ballade lacks harmonic complexity; but it is full of humour – the turkeys \\"seem to essay the steps of a habanera, while the serenade from Don Giovanni sounds out where one would least expect – like a punch on the nose\\". Delage muses that Chabrier's friend Manet, whose Les Dindons was first seen in 1877, causing mad laughter from its first viewers, may have planted a seed in the composer's mind.Delage, Roger. Chabrier Mélodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore – revue internationale d'études musicales. No.3 , 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 67. Bernac comments \\"The ritornello imitating comically the mandolin accompaniment of the serenade of Mozart's Don Giovanni should be played with no rubato at all, no hurry, flatly and fatuously\\".Bernac, 1970, p. 86. It is dedicated to Jeanne Granier. In Chabrier's Cocodette et Cocorico (1878) the singers were a rooster and a hen. Villanelle des petits canards – « Ils vont, les petits canards » (1889) – words by Rosemonde Gérard (from Les Pipeaux); marked \\"très simplement et très rythmé\\", Johnson asks \\"has there ever been a more witty use of syncopation and silence in musical characterization?\\". Bernac again argues for \\"precise and immutable\\" rhythm and tempo in this song.Bernac, 1970, p. 88. It is dedicated to Mily-Meyer, although Chabrier was not satisfied with her interpretation.Chabrier E. Correspondance. Ed Delage R, Durif F. Klincksieck, 1994. 90-46. Pastorale des cochons roses – « Le jour s'annonce à l'Orient » (1889) – words by Edmond Rostand from Les Musardises. It is dedicated to Lucien Fugère. As dawn breaks, a farmboy takes a drift of pigs along a path, who proceed to play all day until they are led back to their bed where they all fall asleep. Huebner notes the \\"naive pastoral 5ths\\" which underpin \\"long dissonant chords in the right hand\\". Les Cigales – « Le soleil est droit sur la sente » (1889) – words by Rosemonde Gérard (from Les Pipeaux). The monotonous chirping in the piano dissonances. The cicadas have \\"more soul than viols and sing better than violins\\". The piano part suggests the grating of the cicadas in the warm atmosphere of the south of France at noon.Bernac, 1970, p. 89. Johnson draws a comparison with the song Les Grillons by Bizet, where the younger composer anticipates Chabrier with an « astonishing tour de force in the manner of the lively cicadas of Chabrier ».p24 Myers sees Ravel's harmonic formula for the grillon winding up her watch in his Histoires naturelles is \\"an actual crib of Chabrier's ingenious way of suggesting the shrill chirping of the cicadas\\".Myers, Rollo. Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. Associated University Presses, Cranbury, 1970, p. 92. Delage goes further, saying that the \\"extension of what one finds in the astonishing accompaniment of the song Les Cigales, with its minor seconds under direct attack, bursts forth in Jeux d'eau and Ondine\\".Delage, Roger. Ravel and Chabrier. Musical Quarterly, 1975, p. 550. It is dedicated to his niece Isabelle Jacmart. Manuel Rosenthal made orchestrations of the piano part of the volailleries, which were then performed by Madeleine Grey with Rosenthal conducting at the Concerts Colonne in 1935.'Concerts Colonne' (M.P.)

The markings are \\"appassionato, con fuoco\\" and \\"très joyeux\\". The poet adores all the flowers but above all he is in love with lilacs and roses. In 1909 Reynaldo Hahn made a recording of this song, accompanying himself at the piano.Worldcat entry for vocal recordings by Hahn accessed 20 April 2019. It is dedicated to Chabrier's friend Ernest Van Dyck. In a letter of January 1890, Chabrier wrote to the dedicatee ('Nénerst') that the song is an \\"irresistible salon outpouring\\", and included a sketch of the first four bars of the vocal part.Chabrier E.

One writer called it \\"one of the most beautiful of all evocations of a voyage to mythic Cythera\\", through its \\"yearning chromatic harmonies and swelling and rocking rhythms\\". Bernac describes the poem as \\"mediocre and rather unimportant\\", but the singer requires a lyricism \\"approaching caricature\\".Bernac, 1970, p. 82. Howat sees echoes of this song in Debussy's \\"Le balcon\\" of the same year.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music – Debussy, Ravel, Fauré, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p. 84. Ninon Vallin, accompanied by Alberto de Pierlas, recorded \\"L'Île heureuse\\" in 1933, and Hahn accompanied himself in 1909 and 1927.Discographical data from search for Chabrier songs in The CHARM Discography, Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, , accessed 2 July 2019. ===Other vocal works=== Duo de l'ouvreuse de l'Opéra-Comique et de l'employé du Bon Marché (Duet of the usherette from the Opéra-Comique and the employee of the Bon-Marché department store) is a comic vocal work for soprano and tenor, with piano accompaniment.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The site was previously occupied by St Mary's Abbey and came under crown control on the dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s: it was then gifted by Queen Mary to the City of Salisbury in gratitude for the city's support in securing her marriage to King Philip of Spain in 1554. The foundation stone was laid by the former Speaker of the House of Commons, Viscount Eversley on 22 December 1871. The new building was designed by Jeffery and Skiller in the Gothic Revival style and built by Joseph Bull & Sons. The design for the central section involved a flight of steps leading up to an arcaded entrance on the first floor, three mullion windows on the second floor with a tall clock tower above flanked by angle pavilions. Statues of local historical figures were erected on the front of the building at second floor level. It was officially opened by the Lord Chancellor, Earl of Selborne, on 18 May 1873. An extension to the west of the original building, built to the designs of John Colson with a flint-work frontage, thereby creating a new banqueting facility, was added in 1893. The banqueting facility was subsequently renamed the King Charles Room. The guildhall, which was the meeting place of the municipal borough of Winchester continued to serve as the local seat of government after the enlarged City of Winchester was formed in 1974. In June 2009, a large room in the guildhall was extensively refurbished with financial support from a legacy left by the Marchioness of Winchester; the money had been left on condition that it would be used to build a public hall in her honour, complete with a full-length portrait of her. In accordance with her wishes, the room was renamed the Bapsy Room in her honour and a huge portrait of her in her state robes by Frank Salisbury was given pride of place in the room. When a portrait of King Charles I, hanging in the King Charles Room, was restored in 2017, it was revealed that the portrait was originally a depiction of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans by Peter Lely which had been over-painted by another painter with an image of the King. Other paintings in the King Charles Room include a portrait of King Charles II, also by Peter Lely, and a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Edward Halliday.

It was also one of the most powerful hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic Ocean in terms of 1-minute sustained winds, with these winds peaking at 185 mph (295 km/h). In addition, Dorian surpassed Hurricane Irma of 2017 to become the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record outside of the tropics. It was the fourth named storm, second hurricane, the first major hurricane, and the first Category 5 hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian struck the Abaco Islands on September 1 with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h), tying with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the highest wind speeds of an Atlantic hurricane ever recorded at landfall. Dorian went on to strike Grand Bahama at similar intensity, stalling just north of the territory with unrelenting winds for at least 24 hours. The resultant damage to these islands was catastrophic; most structures were flattened or swept to sea, and at least 70,000 people were left homeless. After it ravaged through the Bahamas, Dorian proceeded along the coasts of the Southeastern United States and Atlantic Canada, leaving behind considerable damage and economic losses in those regions. Dorian developed from a tropical wave on August 24 over the Central Atlantic. The storm moved through the Lesser Antilles and became a hurricane north of the Greater Antilles on August 28\\\\. Dorian proceeded to undergo rapid intensification over the following days to reach its peak as a Category 5 hurricane with one-minute sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of by September 1\\\\. It made landfall in the Bahamas in Elbow Cay, just east of Abaco Island, and again on Grand Bahama several hours later, where it remained nearly stationary for the next day or so. After weakening considerably, Dorian began moving northwestward on September 3, parallel to the east coast of Florida. Dwindling in strength, the hurricane turned to the northeast the next day and made landfall on Cape Hatteras at Category 2 intensity on September 6\\\\. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before striking first Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland with hurricane-force winds on September 8\\\\. It finally dissipated near Greenland on September 10\\\\. From August 26 to August 28, the storm affected several parts of the northernmost Lesser Antilles. Damaging winds primarily affected the Virgin Islands where gusts reached . Extensive precautionary measures were taken to mitigate damage, especially in Puerto Rico, where one person died. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, impacts from the storm were relatively minor. In preparation for the storm, the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia all declared a state of emergency and many coastal counties from Florida to North Carolina issued mandatory evacuation orders. Damage in the Bahamas was catastrophic due to the prolonged and intense storm conditions, including heavy rainfall, high winds and storm surge, with thousands of homes destroyed and at least 77 direct deaths recorded, 74 of which occurred in the Bahamas. The true death toll is unknown with 245 people still missing as of April 2020. Dorian is the costliest disaster in Bahamian history, estimated to have left behind $3.4 billion in damage. ==Meteorological history== On August 19, 2019, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) identified a tropical wave—an elongated trough of low air pressure—within a monsoon trough over Guinea and Senegal in western Africa. Convective activity associated with the wave was limited by an abundance of Saharan dust in the region. Propagating west over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, the system remained disorganized for several days. On August 23, a defined area of low pressure consolidated at the surface and thunderstorm activity increased. The system acquired sufficient organized convection to be classified as Tropical Depression Five at 15:00 UTC on August 24\\\\. At this time the system was situated 805 mi (1,300 km) east-southeast of Barbados. A deep ridge imparted continued westward movement of the depression, steering it toward the Lesser Antilles. A small cyclone, it soon developed a defined inner-core with a 12 mi (18 km) wide eye-like feature. This marked the system's intensification into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Dorian by the NHC. Thereafter, moderate wind shear and surrounding dry air limited further organization. Rainbands gradually wrapped more around Dorian on August 25–26, though convection remained inconsistent. Dorian continued moving west and made landfall at 01:00 UTC on August 27 in Barbados, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain. It then started moving northwestward toward Saint Lucia. At 11:00 UTC of the same day, Dorian made landfall on the island of Saint Lucia as a tropical storm, briefly disrupting the core of the storm, before entering the Caribbean Sea. The storm underwent a center relocation further north, to the west of Martinique, causing the island to experience tropical storm-force winds as well. Dorian had been predicted to travel northwest and pass over or near the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico, possibly allowing their mountainous terrain to weaken the tropical storm. At that time, dry air and wind shear were expected to prevent Dorian from attaining hurricane status—although just barely. However, Dorian took a more northerly track than expected, causing it to pass to the east of Puerto Rico and hit the US Virgin Islands. On August 28, Dorian intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as it approached the US Virgin Islands, where hurricane-force winds were recorded; at 15:30 UTC that day, Dorian became a hurricane and made landfall in Saint Croix and a few hours later, at 18:00 UTC, Dorian made landfall on Saint Thomas at a slightly higher intensity. However, the hurricane's small size prevented mainland Puerto Rico from experiencing hurricane- or tropical storm-force winds, although this was not the case for the Spanish Virgin Islands. Once the system moved north past the Virgin Islands, the storm entered a more favorable environment. On the next day, the system started to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 2 status early on August 30. Rapid intensification continued, and the storm eventually reached major hurricane status several hours later, on the same day. This strengthening trend came to a halt for the remainder of the day, but soon resumed. The system continued strengthening, and on August 31, Dorian attained Category 4 major hurricane status. Dorian reached Category 5 intensity on the following day. On the morning of September 1, a dropsonde deployed by a NOAA aircraft measured a wind gust of at the surface. With one-minute sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) and a minimum pressure of , the NHC noted that Dorian was the strongest hurricane in modern records to affect the northwestern Bahamas. Hurricane Dorian as seen from the International Space Station on September 2, 2019 The amount of precipitation produced by Hurricane Dorian from August 27 to September 9. At 16:40 UTC on September 1, Dorian made landfall on Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas, with one-minute sustained winds of , wind gusts over , and a central barometric pressure of , as Dorian reached its peak intensity during landfall. Storm chaser Josh Morgerman observed a pressure of in Marsh Harbour. Dorian's forward speed decreased around this time, slowing to a westward crawl of . At 02:00 UTC on September 2, Dorian made landfall on Grand Bahama near the same intensity, with the same sustained wind speed. Afterward, Dorian's forward speed slowed to just , as the Bermuda High that was steering the storm westward weakened. Later that day, the storm began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle to the north of Grand Bahama; the Bermuda High to the northeast of Dorian also collapsed, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama. Around the same time, the combination of the eyewall replacement cycle and upwelling of cold water caused Dorian to begin weakening, with Dorian dropping to Category 4 status at 15:00 UTC. Due to the absence of steering currents, Dorian stalled north of Grand Bahama for about a day. Dorian subsequently weakened to a Category 2 storm on September 3, before beginning to move northwestward at 15:00 UTC, parallel to the east coast of Florida, with Dorian's wind field expanding during this time. While moving northwestward, Dorian gradually reorganized. At 06:00 UTC on September 5, Dorian moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and completed its eyewall replacement cycle, reintensifying into a Category 3 hurricane off the coast of South Carolina. However, several hours later, Dorian encountered high wind shear, causing the storm to weaken to a Category 2 hurricane early on September 6. Then, at 12:35 UTC that day, Dorian made landfall in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of . Afterward, Dorian began to transition into an extratropical cyclone as it quickly moved northeastward, completing its transition on September 7. The storm maintained its intensity, due to baroclinic processes, generating Category 2 hurricane-equivalent winds. Several hours later, at 7:05 p.m. AST on September 7 (23:05 UTC on September 7), Dorian made landfall on Sambro Creek, Nova Scotia, as a Category 1-equivalent extratropical storm, before making another landfall on the northern part of Newfoundland several hours later. By 11:00 p.m. AST on September 8 (03:00 UTC on September 9), Dorian had moved into the Labrador Sea, 375 miles off the coast, moving northeastward at , with wind speeds of , maintaining tropical storm-strength winds. As Dorian no longer posed a threat to Atlantic Canada at that time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the storm. On September 10, Dorian's extratropical remnant dissipated off the coast of southern Greenland. ==Preparations== ===Caribbean=== Prior to Dorian's arrival in the Lesser Antilles, local governments issued various tropical cyclone warnings and watches across the islands. LIAT cancelled multiple flights across the Lesser Antilles due to the storm and airports across the Virgin Islands temporarily suspended operations. Many of the threatened islands suffered devastating impacts in 2017 from Hurricanes Irma and Maria, lending to greater vigilance. In Barbados, thirty- eight shelters opened island-wide, with 103 residents seeking refuge in them. All public services were suspended for the duration of the storm. Homeless persons were transported to shelter by emergency personnel. On August 26, St. Lucia prime minister Allen Chastanet announced that the nation would \\"shut down\\" for the duration of Dorian. In Dominica, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit ordered all public sector workers to remain home and prepare for the storm. The Ministry of Public Works mobilized heavy machinery and the police were placed on high alert. Puerto Rico Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency for the territory on August 27. The following day, the Puerto Rico National Guard was activated to support any relief operations related to the storm. Fears centered around the still-unstable power grid which was largely destroyed by Maria; hundreds of utility workers were deployed to quickly fix any outages. In some areas, power lines remained affixed to palm trees. An estimated 30,000 homes still had damaged roofs from the 2017 hurricane. Territory-wide, 360 shelters with a collective capacity of 48,500 persons opened; 24,000 cots were distributed to these shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the United States Virgin Islands on August 28. Curfews were enacted for the British and United States Virgin Islands for the duration of the hurricane. ===Bahamas=== A warning to take immediate cover was issued on the NHC Twitter account, at 11a.m. EDT on September 1, 2019, as Dorian made landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas, at 16:40 UTC as a Category 5 hurricane. Samuel Butler, the Royal Bahamas Police Force assistant commissioner with responsibility for Grand Bahama and the Northern Region (Abaco, Bimini and the Berry Islands), told residents \\"if you do not heed to the warning [...] we know that the end could be fatal\\" and Don Cornish, the administrator with the City of Freeport told others seeking shelter at Old Bahama Bay Hotel \\"that is not a good idea [...] reconsider that decision\\". ===Mainland United States=== President Trump at a FEMA briefing on the hurricane Florida On August 28, Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 26 counties in the hurricane's expected path. This later expanded to the entire state on August 29\\\\. First responders distributed sandbags in many counties. Residents began stocking up on supplies throughout the state. In Brevard County, locals worked to trim large tree branches to protect power lines. The University of Central Florida, Stetson University, Rollins College, and Daytona State College cancelled classes between August 30 and September 3. In addition, the Florida Institute of Technology, University of North Florida, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Atlantic University, University of South Florida, Florida International University and the University of Miami cancelled classes for at least one day on top of the three-day Labor Day weekend. When it became apparent that Dorian would near the Florida coastline, a tropical storm watch was issued for the Florida east coast from Deerfield Beach to Sebastian Inlet on August 31. It was upgraded to a tropical storm warning a few hours later.

Virginia On September 2, Virginia governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency ahead of Dorian's anticipated impact on coastal Virginia. On September 3, a tropical storm watch was issued for the Delmarva Peninsula. This was upgraded to a warning a day later as Dorian's track became more apparent.  Maryland and Delaware  On September 4, as Dorian's large size was expected to potentially bring tropical storm conditions to southern Maryland and Delaware, in correspondence with the upgrading of the tropical storm watch in effect for the Delmarva to a warning, a tropical storm watch was issued for areas south of Fenwick Island, and areas of the Tidal Potomac River south of Cobb Island, as well as areas south of Drum Point. In Ocean City, Maryland, officials closed the seawall and removed items from the beach and boardwalk; swimming restrictions were also put into place. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, swimming restrictions were also put into place, while the portion of the weekend Sandcastle Contest to take place on September 6 was cancelled.  New England  As Dorian was pulled to the northeast by a passing cold front, the storm passed just 150 miles (240 km) offshore of New England. As a result of this near-miss, a tropical storm watch was issued on September 5 from Woods Hole to Sagamore Beach, including Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts. It was upgraded to a warning later the same day. On September 6, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern coast of Maine from Bar Harbor to Eastport.  Elsewhere  In Tennessee, Bristol Motor Speedway opened one of their campgrounds free of charge to evacuees of Hurricane Dorian. Along the Jersey Shore in New Jersey, officials in Margate City prepared sandbags in case of flooding from the storm while officials in Brigantine removed lifeguard stands and boats from the beach.  Alabama controversy  On September 1, President Donald Trump tweeted that multiple states, including Alabama, \\"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\\" By that date, no weather forecaster was predicting that Dorian would impact Alabama, and the eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the Atlantic coast. Trump was apparently relying on information that was several days old. Twenty minutes later, the Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tweet that appeared to contradict Trump, saying that Alabama \\"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian\\". Over the following days Trump insisted repeatedly that he had been right about the hurricane threatening Alabama. President Trump displays the altered map in a video published by the White House on September 4, 2019 On September 4 in the Oval Office, Trump displayed a modified version of the National Hurricane Center's August 29 diagram of Dorian's projected track. The modification was done with a black Sharpie marker to extend the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama. Trump said he did not know how the map came to be modified. The incident resulted in the hashtag \\"Sharpiegate\\" trending on Twitter. Later the same day, Trump tweeted a map dated August 28, showing numerous projected paths of Dorian. Trump falsely asserted \\"almost all models\\" showed Dorian hitting Alabama, even though the map showed most predicted paths would not enter Alabama. On September 6, NOAA published an unsigned statement which supported Trump's initial claim that Alabama was a target of the storm and criticized the Birmingham NWS office for denying it. It was later revealed that NOAA had been ordered to issue such a statement by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and that he had been told by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to get NOAA to support Trump's original statement that Alabama was threatened. This direct White House involvement raised questions about political influence over NOAA, and is under investigation by multiple agencies including NOAA's acting chief scientist, the inspector general of the Commerce Department, and the House of Representatives committee which oversees NOAA. ===Atlantic Canada=== As Dorian approached Atlantic Canada, hurricane and tropical storm warnings were issued for Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. On September 6, the Halifax Regional Municipality encouraged residents living along the eastern shores of Nova Scotia to evacuate, citing expected high winds, heavy rainfall, and waves up to in height. The Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office implored residents to secure easily dislodged objects to prevent high winds from turning them into projectiles, drawing comparisons to Hurricane Juan in 2003. Nova Scotia Power set up an emergency operations center and mobilized 1,000 personnel, including forestry crews, damage assessors, as well as power line technicians from adjacent provinces, to prepare for Dorian's impacts. WestJet, Air Canada, and Porter Airlines issued travel advisories for the weekend and waived rebooking fees for flights to and from affected areas. ==Impacts== { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" + Deaths and damage by territory ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Territory !

In Barbados, winds reached , downing trees and power lines. Isolated interruptions to power occurred on St. Lucia; no damage occurred otherwise in the nation. In Martinique, heavy rains—peaking at in Rivière-Pilote—and winds up to caused some damage, though overall damage was negligible. Heavy showers in Dominica left multiple communities without power and water. Rainfall extended north to Guadeloupe were accumulations reached in Matouba. Striking the Virgin Islands as an intensifying hurricane, Dorian brought strong winds and heavy rains to the region. Buck Island, just south of Saint Thomas, experienced sustained winds of and a peak gust of . Wind gusts on Saint Thomas reached . Island-wide blackouts occurred on Saint Thomas and Saint John, while 25,000 customers lost power on Saint Croix. The high winds downed trees across the islands. Along the coast, multiple boats broke from their moorings and washed ashore. Some flooding occurred on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. Downed trees knocked out power to some residences on Virgin Gorda. Because the hurricane moved farther northeast than initially anticipated, its effects in Puerto Rico were relatively limited. A man in Bayamón died when he fell off his roof trying to clean drains in advance of the storm. ===Bahamas=== Hurricane Dorian's destruction in the Bahamas Animated greyscale satellite loop of 2019's Hurricane Dorian from intensification to landfall Rainfall accumulation from Dorian Damage from Hope Town, Bahamas Increased tides were experienced in the Bahamas ahead of the storm, with rip currents occurring as well. On September 1, 2019, hurricane conditions arrived in some of the Abaco Islands. A few hours later, destructive conditions arrived, with Hurricane Dorian making landfall as a Category 5 hurricane at 16:40 UTC, becoming the strongest hurricane in modern records to strike the northwestern Bahamas. Around 12:30pm AST, Category 5 winds arrived at the Bahamas with the eyewall. Gusts of over also occurred. Devastating storm surge of up to 23 feet swept away many buildings and submerged a large part of the affected areas. At 7:00 (UTC) on September 2, 2019, Grand Bahama International Airport was underwater. Minister of Agriculture Michael Pintard reported an estimated storm tide of at his home on Grand Bahama. The Bahamas prime minister, Hubert Minnis, said \\"This is a deadly [...] monster storm\\". Marsh Harbour received \\"catastrophic damage\\", according to an ABC News team. Over 75% of the homes had been damaged, Marsh Harbour International Airport's runway was underwater, there was significant flooding on streets and beaches, damage to trees and with some home's roofs ripped off entirely. The scene was described by an ABC reporter as \\"pure hell\\". An eight-year-old boy drowned in the storm surge, while the boy's sister was also reported to be missing. Four other people, along with the eight-year-old boy, were confirmed dead on the Abaco Islands, the prime minister told reporters on Monday. By Wednesday, the death toll had been raised to twenty, according to the prime minister. This soon increased to forty-three by Saturday. However, a Bahamas newspaper suggested that the actual death toll could be over 3,000. The local animal shelters were hit hard by the storm with the Humane Society of Grand Bahama's experiencing stronger storm surges than expected. Workers had attempted to help the animals before retreating to the attic crawl space but almost half of the 190 dogs in their care died in the flooding and some of the 85 cats died as well. The numbers of animals has varied with earlier reports claiming that there were 135 dogs and 155 cats in the shelters care, with 80 cats and 90 dogs surviving. It is feared that the Bahama nuthatch may have been wiped out by Dorian as it caused catastrophic damage to the Bahamian pineyards. Marsh Harbour Airport in Dorian's aftermath The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reported that as many as 13,000 homes were damaged or destroyed on Abaco Island. Extensive flooding is also believed to have caused water wells to be contaminated with seawater, creating an urgent need for clean water. Total damage in the country reached $3.4 billion. Property damage accounted for $2.5 billion; the nation suffered $717 million in economic losses; and $221 million was required for debris removal and cleaning a large oil spill. Around 11:24 UTC on September 2, 2019, total power was lost on the island of New Providence, the following day at 1:50 (UTC) 40% of power had been restored. Tropical storm conditions continued into Monday, September 2. At 2p.m. EDT, a sustained wind of and a gust of at a NOAA Coastal Marine observing site at Settlement Point on the west end of Grand Bahama Island. On September 3, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis stated, \\"Our urgent task will be to provide food, water, shelter, safety and security. Additional food will be delivered by NEMA tomorrow.\\" He went on to say that Dorian was \\"the greatest national crisis in our country's history.\\" The United Nations projected that as of Saturday, September 7, at least 70,000 people are homeless on Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands. On Thursday, September 12, over 1,300 people were missing or unaccounted for in the Bahamas, a number which plummeted from 2,500 over the previous two weeks. On September 26, the number of people missing in the Bahamas dropped to 600, while the official death toll rose to 56. By February 2020, the death toll rose to 74; including 63 in Abaco and 11 in Grand Bahama, with 282 people still reported as missing. ===Mainland United States=== The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated total damage in the United States to be in excess of $1.2 billion. Florida Dorian and Florida's east coast at night on September 2 On September 2, Florida began experiencing tropical storm-force winds. At 18:00 UTC (2 p.m. EDT), the pier in Juno Beach recorded a wind gust of . One death occurred in the central coast barrier island town of Indiatlantic, when a man fell three stories while boarding up his home. During September 3 and 4, tropical storm force winds continued to move up the east coast of Florida, with the storm's eye staying about 100 miles away from landfall. Many areas along the Atlantic coast reporting gusts of over tropical storm force, especially at Cape Canaveral. At 8am EDT on September 4 at St. Augustine Beach, a sustained wind of and a gust of was reported. In Jacksonville, the city experienced tropical storm force winds on September 4 which blew around debris and knocked out power. A lifeguard rescued a woman pulled out by a rip current in Jacksonville Beach while other swimmers were ordered out of the water. South Carolina By September 5, tropical-storm force winds arrived. Dorian also produced some flooding, especially in Charleston. Over 160,000 buildings lost power. Two confirmed tornadoes were spawned in South Carolina by Dorian, including a tornado that was reported in Little River that damaged trees, roofing, and lifted a car. At the same day another tornado was reported in Myrtle Beach. North Carolina A fatality occurred in North Carolina on September 2, when an 85-year-old man fell off a ladder while boarding up his home, and another was confirmed dead on September 6, a 65-year-old man after he, too, fell off a ladder. On September 5, several tornadoes spawned by Dorian were sighted in Onslow County. At around 9a.m. EST that day a tornado touched down in the town of Emerald Isle, causing severe damage to a recreational vehicle park and some mobile homes. In total, 19 tornadoes were spawned by Dorian in North Carolina. Flooding from the storm washed out a road in Sampson County. On the next day, Dorian made landfall in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina as a Category 1 storm. Several people on Ocracoke Island were trapped in their attics by flooding from the storm surge, requiring rescue by boats. People were airlifted off the island to shelters on the mainland while food and water were brought in to residents on the island. North Carolina Highway 12 along Ocracoke Island suffered damage from flooding. More than 190,000 people in North Carolina lost power from the storm. The National Park Service Incident Management Team also reported that wave erosion from Dorian reshaped parts of the barrier islands in the Outer Banks. High waves swept away a herd of cows from Cedar Island; three cows survived after being carried away to Core Banks. A third fatality occurred on September 7 when a man died from injuries sustained in a chainsaw accident while he was trying to clear a fallen tree. Elsewhere Waves from the hurricane caused erosion to the beaches in Delaware. In Bethany Beach, the waves narrowed the beaches and also damaged dune fencing. The Jersey Shore saw gusty winds and rough waves from the storm. The State of Alabama received no rainfall or wind effects from Hurricane Dorian during its track up the continental coast. Effects in Cape Cod were minor, and in Maine, effects were brief, with high winds, surge, and heavy rain as Dorian's eye was passing over Halifax. ===Atlantic Canada=== Crane toppled by Dorian's hurricane-force winds on September 7, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On September 7, 2019, at 5p.m. EDT, Nova Scotia started to experience hurricane-force winds. By 7p.m. EDT, the center of the storm passed over Halifax while tropical storm conditions were being felt in Prince Edward Island. As of September 8, approximately 412,000 customers in Nova Scotia lost power, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the province, as well as 80,000 customers in New Brunswick. Flooding was reported, roofs were torn off buildings, and a crane collapsed onto a building being constructed. The collapse led to local evacuations for some residents and businesses. First responders evacuated 31 persons from a campground in Prince Edward Island early Sunday morning as it was inundated by storm surge. Though Dorian was post-tropical on arrival, winds off the coast of Nova Scotia were estimated to reach , equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane. Rainfall totals were highest in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, which received of rain. Various stations across Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island recorded rainfall amounts in excess of . Several stations recorded winds higher than , with the highest gusts recorded in Grand Étang, Nova Scotia, at . In the Cavendish area of Prince Edward Island National Park, 80 percent of trees suffered damage from the high winds, and storm surge caused of coastal erosion. Winds of also affected the Magdalen Islands of Quebec in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Seven thousand customers were without power there at one point, representing nearly all customers on the islands. On the night of September 7, a buoy off the coast of Newfoundland detected a rogue wave, which had been generated by Dorian's winds. Insurance damage across the region was estimated at C$105 million (US$78.9 million), with power grid damage in Nova Scotia alone accounting for $39 million (Canadian) by Nova Scotia Power, making it the costliest storm in Nova Scotia Power's history. ==Aftermath== U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents deliver relief supplies to the Bahamas Grand Celebration helped transport evacuees from the Bahamas to Florida US Customs agents examine documents for evacuees Bahamian prime minister Hubert Minnis praised the United States for \\"assisting us with all of our needs.\\" President Donald Trump assured the Bahamian prime minister of help in relief efforts. In September 2019, President Donald Trump stated that his administration is planning to extend temporary protected status to immigrants from the hurricane-hit Bahamas. There was confusion with the statement however, with the acting Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan stating that the US would \\"...accept anyone on humanitarian reasons...\\". Shortly after his statement Trump stated that no one would be allowed in without proper documentation, claiming \\"...the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren't supposed to be there\\" and the need to protect the US against gang members and drug dealers. The Bahamas Paradise, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and Carnival cruise lines started sending water bottles and meals to the Bahamas. The Grand Celebration offered to give a chance for evacuees to evacuate to Florida free of charge, given they have the proper documentation. On September 7, the Grand Celebration helped bring more than 1,100 evacuees to Florida. The company stated in a press release that \\"the cruise line spent nearly a full day clearing potential evacuees, including vetting their visa and passport documentation.\\" The Royal Caribbean International also helped deliver more than 43,000 water bottles and 10,000 meals to the Bahamas. The evacuation process was not without confusion as many evacuees who had boarded the Balearia Caribbean, were not told until the vessel had almost departed that anyone traveling to the United States without a visa must disembark. This caused many, including families with children to disembark. Blame for the confusion was placed on US Customs and Border Protection by the vessel who claimed to have been told that visa's were not necessary, and on the vessel by the US Customs and Border Protection who stated the vessel did not coordinate properly. As the hurricane had damaged or destroyed a majority of the Humane Society of Grand Bahama and killed many of the animals in its care, a GoFundMe was created in order to help renovate and aid the organization's locations. Surviving animals were airlifted to the United States in order to disperse them to other shelters while the organization was stabilized. About 300 military personnel from the Canadian Armed Forces were deployed to the Halifax area to assist with recovery. Parks Canada estimated that 80 per cent of the trees in the western, Cavendish segment of Prince Edward Island National Park were downed by the storm, as well as causing of coastal erosion. All public schools in Nova Scotia were closed on September 9 and 10. Public schools were closed across Prince Edward Island on the 9th, and most re-opened the next day. News reports stated that the Bahama nuthatch has been wiped out by Dorian as it caused impact on the Bahamian pineyards. ==Records== With sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h), Dorian is the strongest hurricane on record to strike the Bahamas since records began in 1851. Dorian is tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the highest sustained winds at landfall in an Atlantic hurricane; by the same metric, it is also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in 2005. As of pressure, it was the fifth hurricane with the lowest pressure upon landfall. Dorian is one of only two Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall on the Abaco Islands, the other having occurred in 1932, and is the only such storm on record to have impacted Grand Bahama. Additionally, Dorian featured the highest sustained winds in an Atlantic hurricane recorded at latitude (26.6°N), and was the strongest Atlantic-basin hurricane ever detected outside of the tropics, surpassing Hurricane Irma. Dorian also tracked the least distance in a 24-hour period recorded for an Atlantic major hurricane since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. The storm also impacted a single land area as a Category 5 hurricane for the longest duration recorded in the Atlantic basin, with portions of Dorian's eyewall striking Great Abaco Island and Grand Bahama with Category 5 winds for about 22 hours. == Retirement == The World Meteorological Organization manages hurricane names. Given the strength and destruction brought by Dorian, the name was expected to be retired. However, the 2020 meeting was online and shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting did not have time for storm name retirements. Selected storm names from the 2019 and 2020 tropical storm seasons will be considered in the upcoming 2021 meeting. ==See also== * List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes * List of Canada hurricanes * Tropical cyclones in 2019 * * 1928 Okeechobee hurricane – passed through the Lesser Antilles and the Bahamas as a major hurricane in September 1928, before curving northwards over Florida. * Hurricane Andrew (1992) – took a similar track and struck the Bahamas and south Florida as a Category 5 hurricane. * Hurricane Floyd (1999) – took a similar track and affected the Bahamas and the US East Coast. * Hurricane Joaquin (2015) – A Category 4 hurricane that also stalled over The Bahamas. * Hurricane Matthew (2016) – formed near Barbados and affected the Windward Islands, Grand Bahama, Florida and the Outer Banks in late September 2016. * Hurricane Isaias (2020) – Another hurricane that affected similar areas. == Notes == ==References== ==External links== The National Hurricane Center: * Archived 5-day Forecasts Track and Watch/Warnings Graphic * Advisory archive on Hurricane Dorian Dorian Category:2019 in the Caribbean Dorian (2019) Category:August 2019 events in North America Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Dorian Category:2019 natural disasters Dorian Category:Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Articles containing video clips Dorian Dorian Category:History of Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Natural disasters in Nova Scotia Category:Natural disasters in Prince Edward Island Category:2019 disasters in Canada Dorian ","title":"Hurricane Dorian"},{"id":"61598979","text":"Charles Fall (born March 12, 1989) is a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 61st District since 2019.

California cooler, also known as a Cooler Cabinet, is a type of cabinet used for the cool storage of food items popular in the western United States, in the late 19th and early 20th century. == Construction == Exterior vent of a California cooler The California cooler is constructed simply as an interior cabinet with slatted or screened shelves. Vents near the top and bottom allow outside air to circulate by the principle of natural convection. This results in convective cooling, which keeps perishable food items fresh. The outside vents are separated from the outside by a screen, preventing the incursion of insects, and downward slanting slats shut out rain. Often on a wall away from sun, they tend to be located near where food is prepared, such as in the kitchen. Modifications to work in more variable climates, such as a trap door to selectively draw air from a cellar, are possible. == Usage == These coolers are most commonly found on the west coast of the United States because they function particularly well in temperate climates. They are commonplace in west coast bungalows. Elsewhere in the United States other strategies were used for cool storage of food items. Cellars were used in the midwest, and larders were commonplace on the east coast. Fruits and vegetables would be placed directly on the slatted shelves to encourage airflow around them. Items such as milk bottles could be stored wrapped in a wet cloth. The rapid evaporation to the moving air could keep the milk sufficiently cool. Prior to the widespread usage of home refrigeration, iceboxes were used for the cool storage of food items. The California cooler could be used to free up valuable space in the ice box by storing items that didn't require as much refrigeration. Even after electric refrigeration came into play, they continued to be used to provide additional cool storage. Subsequent to the advent of refrigerants such as Freon in the 1930s, California coolers, along with ice boxes, waned in popularity. == Contemporary adaptations == Although some California coolers have been preserved, often they remain with vents to outside blocked off and are used as general storage. Many modern designers have completely removed the cabinets in renovations, however some have replaced the exterior vents with windows to bring light into the area, or even occasionally provide an opening for a cat door. == References == Category:Food storage ","title":"California Cooler (cabinet)"},{"id":"61598998","text":"The Battle of Reynogüelén may refer to: * Battle of Reynogüelén (1536) between Spaniards and Mapuches during the expedition to Chile of the conqueror Diego de Almagro. * Battle of Reynogüelén (1565) between Spaniards and Mapuches during the Arauco War.

He was educated at Harrow School from 1797, alongside John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer. ==Naval career== In 1803, he entered the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer, initially serving on the Isis in Newfoundland until 1805. He gradually rose up the ranks, first to midshipman in 1805, on the Pomone and Captain at Lisbon and home, as well on the Boreas and Lavinia in British waters and the Mediterranean. He was then elevated lieutenant in 1809, where he joined the Theban in 1810, assisting with the capture of a French merchant brig near Dieppe in 1811, and then surviving the ship's wreck in 1812 during a storm while it was en route to India. Shortly after, he was nominated acting commander of the Arrogant at Bombay, and then made commander of the Cornwallis in 1813. Later that year, he was made acting captain of the Jupiter, before moving to the Newcastle in 1815, where he was confirmed as captain in 1816. During this latter period, he is said to have attracted the attention of Napoleon, whom Meynell described as having \\"refined manners and gentlemanly bearing, joined with the frankness and openness of a sailor\\". He was seemingly paid off in September 1817, and then never returned to the seas despite expressing an interest to do so in 1821. However, by 1851, he was appointed as a rear-admiral, and then rose further to vice-admiral in 1857, and admiral in 1862. ==Political career== The cessation of his naval career led to Meynell being appointed as a gentleman usher quarterly waiter to George IV upon his coronation, with likely thanks due to Francis Ingram- Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford, the Lord Chamberlain, and his wife, the regent's mistress. Meynell was then elected Tory MP for at the 1826 general election and held the seat until 1847 when he did not seek re- election. During this period, he generally voted against Catholic relief and against the repeal of the Test Acts, and was mistakenly expected to vote for Catholic emancipation, when he in fact cast his vote in the opposite way on at least three occasions. Upon his retirement, he lived a \\"quite, unobtrusive life\\", eventually dying at the Grand Hotel du Louvre, Paris in March 1865, and then buried at the family vault in Ashley, Staffordshire. ==References== ==External links== * Category:UK MPs 1826–1830 Category:UK MPs 1830–1831 Category:UK MPs 1831–1832 Category:UK MPs 1832–1835 Category:UK MPs 1835–1837 Category:UK MPs 1837–1841 Category:UK MPs 1841–1847 Category:Irish Conservative Party MPs Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:1789 births Category:1865 deaths Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Royal Navy officers ","title":"Henry Meynell"},{"id":"61599047","text":"Michael W.

It was produced in large numbers from the 1950s. ==Design and development== The Oškinis BRO-11 was a simple, single-seat primary glider in the open girder style exemplified by the pre-war SG 38 Schulgleiter. It was more refined, with slotted ailerons and somewhat better-protected seating. Its high wing, mounted on top of the fuselage girder, was rectangular in plan and built around a single, wooden spar with plywood skin ahead of it, forming a torsion-resistant D-box, and fabric covering behind. The wing was braced to the bottom fuselage beam with a single strut on each side, assisted by drag wires from the nose. Narrow and very high aspect ratio ailerons were hung behind and below the whole trailing edge, leaving a slot between wing and aileron. The wing of the original production model, named Pionier, Lithuanian for Pioneer (or Pionerius, the plural) had a span of and an area of . The later Zylė (), alternatively known as the LAK-2, had a slightly larger wing with a span of and an area of , improving the glide ratio a little. The forward part of the fuselage was a wooden beam which extended aft to end under the wing trailing edge. At the nose there was a simple, semi-circular enclosure formed from two single-curvature surfaces. This gave the pilot, seated just under the leading edge, some protection from the wind, though not for his upper body or sides. The same beam was attached to the wing with an N-form cross-member and also carried the forward end of the horizontal upper fuselage member. The rear lower member ran upwards to meet the upper one at the tail. In addition, they were interconnected at mid-fuselage by a pair of vertical and diagonal struts. Immediately ahead of the tail the fuselage was fabric covered, though not elsewhere. Both variants had triangular tailplanes mounted on the upper frame with elevators which were rectangular in plan apart from a cut-out for rudder movement. Their little, triangular fins carried rather angular, quadrilateral rudders. The fuselages of the Pionier and Zylė differed only in their landing gear. The Pionier landed on the underside of the forward beam but the Zylė had a monowheel semi-recessed into its beam below the forward wing and a short nose skid. ==Operational history== The BRO-11 Pionier was very widely used across the DOSAAF; some 2000 were built between about 1955 and 1960. The date of the first flight of the Zile is not known exactly but was about 1968. Production began in mid-1969 and ended in 1979. Production numbers for this variant are not known. ==Variants== ;BRO-11 Pionier(ius): Original design, first flown in 1954 and some 2000 built in the later 1950s. ;BRO-11M (LAK-2) Zylė : Larger wing and a landing wheel.

She is an associate professor of mathematics at Spelman College, where she is the vice chair and former chair of the mathematics department. She is a member of the National Association of Mathematicians, as well as the Mathematical Association of America. ==Early life and education== Olubummo is originally from Ibadan in Nigeria, and is the oldest of three children of mathematician Adegoke Olubummo and hospital administrator Edak Olubummo; her father was the second Nigerian to earn a doctorate in mathematics. As a child, she was educated at the staff school of the University of Ibadan, where her father taught, and then at the International School Ibadan on the university campus. She earned a bachelor's degree with first class honours in mathematics from the University of Ibadan in 1980, and did her compulsory national service in the National Youth Service Corps as a mathematics teacher in Keffi. On the advice of her father Olubummo moved abroad for graduate study, choosing Yale University over the University of Oxford (to which she was also admitted) because of its financial assistance. She felt alone, isolated, and the victim of racial discrimination at Yale; she did poorly on her doctoral exams, and ended up leaving in 1983 with a master's degree. At the suggestion of a visiting African-American mathematics professor, Donald F. St. Mary, she transferred to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she completed her doctorate eight years later in 1991. Her dissertation, Measures on Empirical Logics and the Properties of Their Associated Dual Banach Spaces, was supervised by Thurlow Cook. ==Career== While working towards her doctorate, Olubummo taught mathematics at Smith College. There, in 1991, she met Sylvia Bozeman, who had been visiting Smith as part of an academic audit of the Smith mathematics department. On Bozeman's recommendation, she took a position as a lecturer at Spelman College, and in 2000 she was promoted to associate professor. She served as chair of the mathematics department at Spelman from 2006 to 2010. In 2009, she was awarded the Spelman College Presidential Award for Teaching Excellence, whilst in 2018 she was awarded the Carnegie Foundation Africa Diaspora Fellowship, allowing her to run a graduate level course in functional analysis at Kwara State University, Ilorin. She is currently a faculty member of the National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences, an organisation which aims to improve representation of minorities in Mathematics. Beyond her research, Olubummo is interested in increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics both in the US and in Nigeria. At Spelman, she led a National Science Foundation funded program, the Math Research and Mentoring Program, to encourage minority undergraduates in mathematics to go on to graduate study. In 2018, the Institute of International Education awarded Olubummo a Carnegie African Diaspora Fellowship, funding her travel to return to Nigeria and teach graduate-level mathematics as a visiting professor at Kwara State University. She has published (with Thurlow A. Cook) Operational logics and the Hahn- Jordan property. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Nigerian mathematicians Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st- century American mathematicians Category:African-American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:University of Ibadan alumni Category:Smith College faculty Category:Spelman College faculty Category:1960 births Category:American people of Yoruba descent Category:American people of Nigerian descent Category:International School, Ibadan alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:People from Ibadan Category:Nigerian emigrants to the United States Category:Yoruba women academics Category:Yoruba scientists Category:American women academics Category:African-American academics Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst alumni ","title":"Yewande Olubummo"},{"id":"61599372","text":"Bury St Edmunds Guildhall is a municipal building in the Guildhall Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. It is a Grade I listed building. ==History== The Guildhall is one of the largest and most impressive secular medieval buildings in the country, and a rare survival of a civic building from this period. The building, which was built with financial support from the wealthy Bury St Edmunds Abbey, dates back to 1220. The Bury Chronicle records that John of Cobham and Walter de Heliun visited the guildhall in 1279. The oldest part is the thirteenth-century stone entrance arch, within the highly decorative porch was added in the late 15th century. Its unique roof structure combines East Anglian queen posts with king posts and has been attributed to the fifteenth century, although some suggest it is midfourteenth century. Many timbers are covered in yellow ochre, usually a sixteenth-century feature. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the late 1530s, the guildhall passed to the control of the town of Bury St Edmunds. During the Second world War the Royal Observer Corps established a control centre in the guildhall. After the war the condition of the building deteriorated and it was placed in the Heritage At Risk register in the 1980s. In July 2015 the Bury St Edmunds Heritage Trust launched a project to convert the guildhall into a heritage centre. The project was undertaken at a cost of £2 million, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and the works, which involved access improvements and a new lift as well as repairs to the roof, walls and ceilings, were completed in 2018. The project enabled visitors to see the newly-refurbished courtroom, the banqueting hall, the Royal Observer Corps operations room and the Tudor kitchen. In 2019, dating of the roof and entrance door was requested by Historic England to inform on-going restoration work. Eighteen timbers were sampled from the roof, showing likely felling dates between AD 1263 and 1376. Two of the samples still had complete sapwood and were felled in the winter of AD 1376/77, implying that construction of the roof took place in AD 1377 or soon thereafter. The door boards were made from oak imported from the Baltic region, three samples indicating felling between AD 1253 and 1439, with the latest possible date of AD 1461. ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Suffolk Category:Bury St Edmunds Category:City and town halls in England Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1220 ","title":"Bury St Edmunds Guildhall"},{"id":"61599389","text":"Chase Foster Ealey (born July 20, 1994) is an American track and field athlete specializing in throwing events. ==Professional== Ealey is the 2019 US outdoor and indoor shot put champion.

The group originated with the 1985 exhibition Seven Young Sculptors before becoming an active collective of artists who worked and exhibited between 1985 and 1989. The group ended with the suicide of sculptor and leader K. P. Krishnakumar. Other notable artists included Alex Mathew, N.N. Rimzon, and Anita Dube, the only female and non- Keralite member. Heavily influenced by Marxist ideology, the artists emphasized interrogating established aesthetic and political norms while expressing the plight of marginalized and oppressed people. They rejected the revivalism associated with nationalist artists like Abanindranath Tagore and the Bengal School, preferring to use cheap alternative materials like cloth and plaster to reflect the lives of the poor in a postcolonial context. They also rejected the art market and the commodification of art, advocating for a radical, socially conscious form of art. ==History of the Group== The Association originated in the small, coastal state of Kerala, a site of Marxist activity in the 1970s and 1980s. At the Trivandrum College of Art, Krishnakumar, Mathew, Rimzon and associates protested the declaration of a State of Emergency in 1975. They advocated for the necessity of politics in art, inspired by the emotionalism and anti-realism of German Expressionism. After Mathew and fellow Trivandram alumni K. M. Madhusudhanan began studying in Baroda, Krishnakumar joined them to continue his pursuit of a Marxist, subversive Indian art. In Baroda, Krishnakumar formed The Radical Painters' and Sculptors'Association, leading its first official exhibition, \\"Questions and Dialogue\\", curated by Vivan Sundaram. The exhibition directly challenged the Narrative/Figurative Movement popularized by the Baroda School, established by the seminal exhibition \\"A Place for People.\\" This challenge proved highly controversial, and \\"Questions and Dialogue\\" became the last time the Association exhibited in Northern India. Specifically, \\"Questions and Dialogue\\" challenged the Baroda School's ideas about drawing on Indian art history as a resource for contemporary artists. Instead, the group offered a more subversive perspective on Indian art history that acknowledges inequalities between regions, castes, and classes. For example, Krishnakumar's sculpture \\"Vasco de Gama,\\" inspired by his time in Goa, uses contemporary materials like painted plaster to draw parallels between European colonialism and the emergence of capitalism in twentieth-century India, a contrast to the more idealistic perspective of Geeta Kapur's essay in the \\"A Place of People\\" catalogue. In 1989, the group hosted an art workshop and camp in Alapad, a village in Kerala. With local artists and villagers, they worked on paintings and sculptures and held discussions about art and modernity. After the art camp, the group held a series of meetings in which members heavily criticized the direction of the Association and the leadership of Krishnakumar. After conflicts between members turned violent, the group voted to freeze activity for a year and disband. Humiliated and devastated, Krishnakumar took his own life. ==Influences== In addition to being heavily influenced by German Expressionism, the group, especially Krishnakumar, also drew inspiration from Western artists like Pablo Picasso and Auguste Rodin. However, the group did not have a unified, singular aesthetic, but instead drew from a wide variety of sources. For example, N.N. Rimzon draws inspiration from classical Jain and Buddhist sculpture to create austere, apparently sacred sculptures that elude easy categorization. == Gallery == Boatman by k.p. krishnakumar.JPGBoatman by K.P.

Khlong Yisan can be regarded as both a natural canal and a man-made canal. In the part of the man- made canal believed to have been dug at the late of King Mongkut (Rama IV)'s reign. It flows from here to the Gulf of Thailand, which is about 5–6 km (3.11–3.73 mi) away. The word Yisan presumably derived from \\"Pasan\\" (ปสาน) which distorted from the word \\"Bazaar\\" in Persian, which means marketplace. Because Yisan has been a center of commerce since ancient times and was a junk boat stop. While some academic believe that the word Yisan is likely to come from Chinese \\"一 山\\" (pinyin: Yī shān), which means \\"one hill\\". Yisan's history is older than other areas of Samut Songkhram. Yisan community dates back to the Ayutthaya period there are many excavations of ancient pottery found. Its name appears in the records of two foreigners since the early Rattanakosin period, namely Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix a French cleric which he spelled the name of Yisan as Isan, and Scottish's John Crawfurd. There is a folk tale telling about the three Chinese brothers who sailed to Siam (now Thailand). But the junk had sunk before reaching the shore, the three brothers then swim, scattered in different directions and separated to live in different places. The oldest brother went to live in the Khao Takhrao, Ban Laem District and last brother went to live in Khao Iko, Khao Yoi District, Phetchaburi Province. While the middle brother went to live in Yisan and became Phophu Si Racha, a sacred Buddha image at Wat Khao Yisan in present day. Previously, Yisan residents does not contain fresh water for consumption, because the water source of this area is brackish water. Therefore causing locals to have a career that is different from the normal is to row a boat to pump fresh water from other areas such as Khao Takhrao, Bang Tabun in Phetchaburi Province. This occupation was called \\"lom nam\\" (ล่มน้ำ). Like other traditional professions, this occupation is about to disappear because of the replacement of tap water. ==Geography== Most of the area is mangrove forest approximately 27 km (16.78 mi) from center of Amphawa District, and 79 km (49 mi) from Bangkok. Considered to be the largest and southernmost part of the district. Yisan is believed to have been a small island in the Gulf of Thailand, which was close to the mainland. Until there has been a change in geological ridge, eventually became a part of the mainland.

Considered by many critics as the founder of the \\"Yellow Earth School\\" of painting, he served as President of Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts and Vice Chairman of the China Artists Association. His portrait of Mao Zedong has been printed on the fifth series of the renminbi since 1999. == Early life and education == Liu was born in October 1933 in a small village in Shengzhou, Zhejiang, Republic of China. He showed artistic talent from a young age, and aspired to become an artist in elementary school when he first heard of da Vinci, whose name sounds similar to \\"Wenxi\\" in Chinese. Liu was introduced to Chen Wangdao, the President of Shanghai's Fudan University, and painted his portrait. Impressed by his skills, Chen recommended him to study at Shanghai Yucai School, which was known for nurturing artistic talent. After studying at Yucai for three years from 1950, he entered Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art) in 1953, where he was taught by Pan Tianshou and other renowned artists, especially Fang Zengxian and Zhou Changgu, founders of the Zhe style of guohua painting. == Career == Upon graduation in 1958, Liu taught at Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts, later serving as its president from 1991 to 1997. As a transplant in Shaanxi province, Liu immersed himself in the \\"Yellow Earth\\" culture of Northern Shaanxi (Shaanbei), and made about 80 trips to 26 cities and counties in the region. Many of his works were inspired by the earthy culture of Shaanbei. He was elected a Vice Chairman of the China Artists Association in 1998. In 2003, he was named one of the 100 \\"National Famous Teachers\\" of China. From 2004 until his death, he served as President of the Yellow Earth School Research Institute and President Emeritus of Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts. In politics, Liu served as Vice Mayor of Yan'an and was a delegate to the 7th and 8th National People's Congresses. == Works and influence == Trained in the socialist-realist style that dominated the early PRC era in Shanghai and Hangzhou, Liu developed a personal style that was influenced by the traditional nianhua aesthetic. His works combine Western perspective projection with a paler and plainer background, and he was considered one of China's most technically competent painters of the socialist-realist style. Many art critics consider Liu as the founder of the \\"Yellow Earth School\\" of painting, pointing to his works since the 1960s, including Four Generations () and Chairman Mao and the Shepherd (), which were highly influential at the time. However, this is disputed by his detractors, who perceive a lack of cultural depth in his works, and criticize the stagnation or regression of his artistic skills since the 1980s and 1990s. Liu's portrait of Mao Zedong is universally known in China as it has been featured on the fifth series of the renminbi, China's national currency, since 1999. == Personal life == Liu painted the portrait Mao Zedong thousands of times and came to mimic Mao's appearance. According to his wife Chen Guangjian, he loved the Mao suit and loathed trying on any other clothes.

She fought to liberalise Tasmania for women and she often petitioned the government to implement these changes. ==Early life== Edith Alice Waterworth was born on 18 October 1873 in Castleton, Lancashire, England, the daughter of Henry Hawker and Irish born Emma (née Hamilton). Waterworth's family eventually moved to Queensland, Australia and she was educated at Brisbane Girls Grammar School. ==Career== Waterworth became a teacher and she taught at state schools for years. ===Politics=== In 1922 and later in 1925 Waterworth ran two unsuccessful campaigns for the Parliament of Tasmania. During these two unsuccessful campaigns for the parliament, Waterworth's campaign ran on a platform for widows, deserted wives and for their children. She also advocated for the admission of women on juries and to be made justices in addition to cross-examination changes for women. For health-related issues, Waterworth campaigned for better maternity hospitals and bush nursing services and for a domestic science training centre. Her 1922 vote percentage (6.5 per cent of the primary vote), was the highest per cent of a vote that a female candidate got in a such an election in Australia until 1955 when Amelia Best became the first female elected to the House of Assembly. Despite these unsuccessful campaigns, Waterworth became president of the Women's Non-Party League in 1929. In 1943 she ran unsuccessfully for the Tasmanian Legislative Council. Waterworth was also a member of the Women's Criminal Law Reform Association. ===Advocacy=== Waterworth attended advocacy events like the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in Washington, DC in 1924 and the International Alliance of Women for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship in Berlin in 1929. In 1935, Waterworth embarked on a fundraising tour throughout Tasmania for the King George V and Queen Mary maternal and infant welfare appeal. Her motto for this was 'Make Motherhood Worthwild' Waterworth advocated that the betterment of women in their homes would improve the falling birthrates. Waterworth helped create and chair the Tasmanian Council for Mother and Child through her bridging the welfare work for women. Moreover, she founded the Child Welfare Association in 1917 due in part to her views eugenic views. Despite being known to campaign for women's rights, Waterworth also campaigned for boys too. In 1925, she was appointed to a committee by the Australian government to report on the workings of the Boys' Training School (aka State Farm and School for Boys). The committee recommended that the boys be encouraged instead of harshly disciplined and classified based on certain facts like age, mental health, qualifications and behaviour. They also asked for the Navy to accept boys from reformatories. These changes sought to touch up the 1918 Children of the State Act to be more innovative and gentle. ==Further career== Waterworth was also on the National Council of Women and the Free Kindergarten Association and the Board of Censors of Moving Pictures. She was a columnist in The Mercury where she was outspoken and earned the nickname 'Mrs Hot Waterworth'. Waterworth was also a eugenicist. and she also stated that sex offenders were not normal mentally and she called for them to be cured via operations. She was appointed O.B.E in 1935 in recognition of her work in maternal and child welfare. ==Personal life== Waterworth was married to John Newham Waterworth for 46 years until his death on 3 August 1949 and they had three children together. She died on 6 November 1957 in Sandy Bay. == References == Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Australian columnists Category:Women columnists Category:Australian women activists Category:Australian women's rights activists Category:1873 births Category:1957 deaths Category:19th-century Australian writers Category:19th-century Australian women writers Category:People from Rochdale Category:Australian women journalists Category:English people of Irish descent Category:Australian schoolteachers Category:Australian women educators Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:19th-century Australian educators Category:20th-century Australian women writers Category:20th-century Australian educators Category:20th-century Australian writers Category:19th-century women educators Category:20th-century women educators ","title":"Edith Alice Waterworth"},{"id":"61600269","text":"Raise Your Hands, Dead Man, You're Under Arrest is a 1971 Italian-Spanish western film directed by León Klimovsky, produced by Sergio Bergonzelli, scored by Alessandro Alessandroni, and starring Peter Lee Lawrence as Sando Kid, Helga Liné, Espartaco Santoni, and José Canalejas.

He is a founder of a number of companies, such as Fortigent (formerly Convergent Wealth Advisors and CMS Financial Services) in 1994, Advizent in 2012 (which shut down a year later), and Advice Period in 2013 (which was named \\"Best Wealth Planning Firm\\" at Family Wealth Report Awards 2019). He is an early investor in a number of fintech firms, such as Betterment, Quovo, Wealthbox, and Advizr. He has appeared widely in the finance and business press, and at conferences in the financial services and fintech industries. He has served on CNBC's Digital Financial Advisor Council. == Convergent Wealth Advisors == Lockshin was CEO for Convergent Wealth Advisors for 18 years (and chairman through 2014), during which time the company became one of the largest RIAs in the industry. In 2011, while he was at Convergent, he was named the \\"No. 1 Independent Financial Advisor\\" in the United States by the financial weekly newspaper Barron's. Lockshin resigned as Convergent chairman in 2014, after the suicide of its CEO David Zier. == Awards and Recognitions == Lockshin has been recognized repeatedly by Barron's for his excellence as a financial advisor, including as #1 in California twice and #1 nationally. His awards and recognitions include: * Barron’s Top Financial Advisors 2013 – State by State (#1 in California) * Barron’s Top Independent Advisors 2012 (#2 Nationally) * Barron’s Top Financial Advisors 2012 – State by State (#1 in California) * Barron’s Top Independent Financial Advisors 2011 (#1 Nationally) * Barron’s Top Independent Financial Advisors 2010 (#5 Nationally) *The Wealth Management Industry Award for RIA Thought Leader of the Year for 2019 == Writing == Lockshin has written articles for CNBC, and writes a regular column in Barron's called The Tech Whisperer. He wrote the book Get Wise to Your Advisor, which exposes conflicts of interest in the financial advice industry, and argues that individual investors, even very wealthy ones, are often not well-served by their advisors. He has made a number of predictions about the future of the financial services industry, including that over the next few years there will be a rapid evolution of fintech, and that this will result an increased focus on and need for \\"unconflicted advice.\\" He predicts that investment automation will be disruptive, making it ever harder for investment advisors to compete with Robo-investing and AI and the big financial firms who use them. He has said that the financial services industry is having a \\"Kodak moment,\\" meaning that much of the industry, and especially individual investment advisors, are ignoring technological changes just like Kodak ignored the photography industry transitioning from film to digital. == Controversy == Lockshin has repeatedly criticized the financial services industry for its inherent conflicts of interest, its over-reliance on active investing, its low standards, and its excessive fees. (He contends that estate planning and tax planning are much more important for clients.) He argues that many investment advisors should not be trusted. He is critical of broker-dealers because they are not required to act in their clients best interests, unlike a registered investment advisor who is a fiduciary. == References == ==External links== * Steve Lockshin Personal Website * AdvicePeriod Category:Living people Category:Financial planners Category:American investors Category:Financial technology companies Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Steve Lockshin"},{"id":"61600361","text":"Martin Joseph Damm (born 30 September 2003) is an American junior tennis player.

Recognising the power of the new media (as large circulation fashion magazines such as Vogue and Cosmopolitan were exploding in popularity), Kayser devoted a great deal of time and energy into domestic and even international advertising - a move that brought immediate returns and rapid expansion.

In addition to his large mill in Brooklyn, most of the mills were in New York state (Hornell, Walton, Sidney, Owego, Schenectady, Binghamton, Amsterdam, Syracuse, Buffalo, Monticello and Rockville Center).

The title functions as both an adventure game where players chase and capture Carmen, and an educational game where players learn about Japanese geography and history.

The game was developed around the same time as Where in Time was being developed in the United States, and its purpose was to help local students study Japanese history and geography. The game featured the template of Where in the World with some changed data. ==Gameplay and plot== As with other games in the series, Japan sees the player follow clues in locations around Japan to track down Carmen's henchmen and eventually Carmen herself. Players require a correct warrant to successfully arrest the perpetrator. ==Critical reception== Eco News noted that the game is realistic in the sense that the number of days it takes to track the thief changes as the travel distance increases; while noting the software is difficult for elementary school students with little knowledge of geography, the magazine argued it was targeted toward junior high students. ==References== ==External links== * Let's Play *Newspaper article about game Category:1989 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Carmen Sandiego Category:Children's educational video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:NEC PC-9801-only games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in Japan ","title":"Carmen Sandiego in Japan"},{"id":"61600746","text":"The bust of Robert S.

It broadcast with an effective radiated power of 2,000 watts, with a format of oldies and rock music. WBBY-FM's troubles began in earnest in December 1977, with a dispute between William S. Bates, the majority stockholder, and the other owners of the station. On the 9th, the owners obtained a restraining order against Bates, saying he had \\"brought ridicule and disgrace\\" to the station, insulted customers, and made obscene gestures. The Delaware County court found that Bates likely suffered from a mental condition. Among the other shareholders of Mid-Ohio Communications was Ken Bates, William's son. The restraining order was never delivered. Four days later, Bates was spotted at the station at 5:45 am. The news director, on site at the time, called the sheriff's office. He barricaded himself in his son's office and the facility and did not leave for 10 hours. Bates continued to be a thorn in WBBY-FM's side. In February 1979, he stole equipment from the station, forcing it off the air. In May, he served a 10-day jail sentence and was fined $500 for violating the restraining order. Not long after, it became the jazz station of record for Columbus, a format it would hold for the rest of its life. In 1981, William R. Bates's share of WBBY-FM was involuntarily transferred to the QNP Corporation, a business of Richard (Carl) Nourse, as a result of divorce proceedings. The extent of Nourse's involvement in the station became the central factor in years of new legal proceedings that followed. In 1982, its license renewal was designated for hearing alongside a competing proposal for the frequency from Metro Broadcasting, Inc. While WBBY initially was to lose its license, Metro dropped out of the running when it was bought out by Nourse, and the administrative law judge approved the renewal of WBBY's license despite a new finding: that Nourse, who was claimed to be the station manager spending 40 hours per week at WBBY, was actually working full-time at his family's car dealership in Marietta, Ohio, away. The FCC Review Board, however, did not agree. In July 1986, it ruled that WBBY should lose its license. The review board, using an automotive metaphor, wrote that Nourse had been a mere \\"hood ornament\\" at WBBY-FM, spending most of his time in Marietta. After several appeals, the full FCC unanimously agreed with the review board in February 1990, finding \\"a pattern ... of deliberate concealment and false statements\\" by Mid-Ohio. WBBY-FM ceased operations December 31, 1990, resulting in 20 job losses. ==References== ==External links== * FCC History Cards for WBBY-FM BBY-FM Category:Westerville, Ohio Category:Radio stations established in 1969 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1990 Category:1990 disestablishments in Ohio Category:1969 establishments in Ohio Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States BBY-FM ","title":"WBBY-FM"},{"id":"61600840","text":"Snoody Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Mississippi.

Throughout his career, Shillington was the scorekeeper for a total of 971 games, including regular season, playoffs, and Mann Cup games. He was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a builder in 1977. ==Career== As a kid growing up in Vancouver, Shillington saw his first senior lacrosse game during the 1946-47 season. He began playing junior lacrosse under the direction of Reginald \\"Pop\\" Phillips. Although he enjoyed playing lacrosse, Shillington was forced to quit to take a job as a night copy boy at the Vancouver Sun. To increase his income, he also wrote one-paragraph game reports on minor and junior lacrosse games, then started adding league stats every couple of weeks. Shillington then accepted a job as the newspapers police reporter and researcher with the Joint Coordinated Law Enforcement Unit. Despite this, he still kept a log of statistics on lacrosse games as a hobby. Shillington later recounted the 1951 Mann Cup between the Peterborough Timbermen and Vancouver Combines, dubbing it the Mann Cup Follies for the league's \\"continually flip-flopped in its decision-making\\" and intolerable conditions the players played in. In 1953, Shillington became one of the founders of the Renfrew Athletic Club and later the Fraser Lacrosse Commission. While working as Secretary of the Renfrew Athletic Club in 1954, he was contacted by Art Daoust, head of the Lacrosse Junior league, to record stats for the league and write the occasional story. After proving to be successful at this task, Shillington was contacted by Tom Gordon, head of Inter City Lacrosse League (ICLL), in 1957, to be the ICLL statistician. His position with the ICLL began with the Vancouver Minor Association in 1955–1960. In total, he spent 31 seasons as league statistician with the ICLL and Western Lacrosse Association (WLA). Shillington would later be named the Official Canadian Lacrosse Association Mann Cup Statistician. Shillington recounted having to once score a game from the penalty box while two players attacked each other with sticks over his head. In 1970, he was awarded the Art Daoust Merit Award. In 1977 he was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a builder. In 1980, Shillington awarded the Norm Kowalyk Trophy as Executive Of The Year by the Western Lacrosse Association. That same year, he published Who's Who In Lacrosse. Due to his statistical background, Shillington was asked to help two Ontario historians in 2002 research lost statistical information from Ontario Senior “A” lacrosse games that were never recorded or compiled. Beginning in 2008, the Western Lacrosse Association's CKNW \\"TOP DOG\\" Trophy for the Winners of League Play was replaced by the Stan Shillington Trophy.

W. Decker with the San Antonio Dynamo in 1891 at the Pomona Water Powerplant The Pomona Water Power Plant, built in 1892, was the first AC power plant in California. It fed electricity to the Pomona Valley, and was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.514) on November 25, 1953. ==Description== The Pomona Water Power Plant was built by the San Antonio Light and Power Company. The Pomona Water Power Plant is located near Mount Baldy Village, California in Los Angeles County on Camp Baldy Road, San Antonio Canyon. Using alternating current the hydroelectric power plant was able to send AC power over long distance power lines at very high voltages. San Antonio Creek was used as the power source for the one phase dynamo alternator's power. The system was unlike Thomas Edison's low voltage Electric power distribution system, started in 1882, that could not use long distance power lines. San Antonio Light and Power Company was the idea of the first president of Pomona College, Dr. Cyrus Grandison Baldwin. Baldwin joined businessman Henry Harbison Sinclair in starting San Antonio Light and Power Company. A.W. Decker was hired to be the chief engineer of the project. Decker had been train in the use of AC power and worked on the Mount Lowe Railway, above Pasadena. George Westinghouse's company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation built the high-voltage transformers need to increase the power plants voltage to 10,000 volts for the long distance power lines that fed the city of Pomona 14 miles a way. The system started on Nov. 28, 1892, was so successful that a 29-mile line was add to fed power to San Bernardino, California. The San Bernardino power line was at the time the world's record for long-distance commercial electric transmission. Pomona Water Powerplant worked great, but Southern California rain and snow, the source of the power, is not guaranteed each year. The location of the power plant was not in place where a dam to store water for dry period could be built. As such, the power plant was not successful in future years. A.W. Decker's next project was at the Mill Creek project run by the Redlands Electric. There he used a system of three-phase power that was more efficient. It went on line on Sept. 7, 1893.

Agwu is a naturalized American citizen, tenured faculty at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, part of the City University of New York, and was a director of the college's Center for Excellence in Teaching, Learning and Scholarship. ==Early life and education== Agwu was born in Enugu, Nigeria, the daughter of two teachers; Jacob Ukeje Agwu from Nigeria, and Europa Lauretta Durosimi Wilson, from Sierra Leone. In the Nigerian Civil War, her family supported the Biafran side, their home in Umuahia was damaged by Nigerian bombers. In 1968, Agwu, her mother, and her siblings left Nigeria on the final evacuation plane taking Biafrans to a refugee camp in Equatorial Guinea, and were moved from there to camps in Liberia and Sierra Leone. They left the refugee camps for her grandmother's house in Sierra Leone, but it had burned down, leaving them homeless. Most of her family returned to Nigeria after the end of the war in 1970, rejoining Agwu's father who had left the government service to become a farmer. Agwu stayed behind in Freetown, Sierra Leone as a student at the Fourah Bay College Primary School and then at the Annie Walsh Memorial School. In 1980, Agwu returned to Nigeria. She studied mathematics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, earning a bachelor's degree with honours in 1984. On the recommendation of two of her university teachers, James O. C. Ezeilo and Isabelle Adjaero, she went to the University of Connecticut for graduate study, the same university where Adjaero earned her PhD. Agwu started her studies there in 1987, after working as a government statistician and as a lecturer at Kaduna Polytechnic. Agwu completed a master's degree in mathematics at the University of Connecticut in 1989. She moved to the Syracuse University, where she completed her Ph.D. in mathematics education in 1995. Her dissertation, Using a Computer Laboratory Setting to Teach College Calculus, was supervised by Howard Cornelius Johnson. At Syracuse, her course of studies also included gender studies and multicultural education, and she was president of the African Students Union and of the Association of International Students. ==Career and contributions== Agwu was appointed Coordinator of the Teaching and Learning Center at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. In 2009, Agwu served a term as New York City branch president of the American Association of University Women, with an agenda of encouraging girls and women in STEM fields and of improving health in minority communities. In 2014 she returned to Nigeria on a visit sponsored by a Carnegie Africa Diaspora Fellowship. Agwu's interest in ethnomathematics stemmed from her development of a discrete mathematics course that would cover the college's requirement that students take a writing-intensive course. Her work in this area includes using storytelling to allow mathematics students to relate better to the material, and examining the mathematical structure of Ndebele dolls, African textiles, and the game of Mancala. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Nigerian mathematicians Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:African-American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Ethnomathematicians Category:University of Nigeria alumni Category:University of Connecticut alumni Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Kaduna Polytechnic faculty Category:City University of New York faculty Category:Annie Walsh Memorial School alumni Category:People of the Nigerian Civil War Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:People from Enugu Category:Nigerian emigrants to the United States ","title":"Nkechi Agwu"},{"id":"61601141","text":"Barbara Tennant (19 May 1892 – 18 March 1982) was an English actress.

She moved to North America as a young actress and dancer with the Ben Greet company, and lived in Montreal while touring in various theatrical productions. == Film career == Tennant appeared in over a hundred silent films, many of them short productions, between 1912 and 1928. Her first film was Chamber of Forgetfulness (1912), and her last film credit was in A Jim Jam Janitor (1928). Other notable appearances were as Maid Marian in an adaptation of Robin Hood (1912) with Alec B. Francis and George Larkin; in Into the Wilderness (1914) and The Price of Malice (1916), both directed by Oscar A. C. Lund; as the title character in M'Liss (1915), based on a story by Bret Harte; The Better Wife (1919), starring Clara Kimball Young; in Captain January (1924), starring Baby Peggy; and in The Devil Dancer (1927), featuring Anna May Wong. Tennant worked at Eclair Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, between 1911 and 1915. By 1919, she was based in Los Angeles, working with producer Jesse Hampton. She was ill for a few years, effectively ending her career momentum, though she made a comeback in 1922, and she appeared in films as late as 1931. \\"I love it all so,\\" she explained. \\"I can't leave it.\\" == Films in the news == Tennant was in one of the first films rejected by the British Board of Film Classification in 1913, when she starred as the Virgin Mary in The Crimson Cross, apparently violating rules about the depiction of religious figures. In 2011, the Russian government presented ten American silent films, previously considered lost, to the Library of Congress. One of those films, Circus Days (1923), starred Tennant and Jackie Coogan. ==Partial filmography== * Robin Hood (1912) * Lady Babbie (1913) * The Closed Road (1916) * What Every Woman Wants (1919) * The Better Wife (1919) * The Golden Gallows (1922) * The Infidel (1922) * The Masquerader (1922) * Bulldog Courage (1922) * The Love Gambler (1922) * Deserted at the Altar (1922) * The Drug Traffic (1923) * Circus Days (1923) * The Old Fool (1923) * Poisoned Paradise: The Forbidden Story of Monte Carlo (1924) * Captain January (1924) * The Street of Tears (1924) * You Can't Get Away with It (1924) * Borrowed Finery (1925) * Hearts and Spangles (1926) * The Wreck (1927) * Your Wife and Mine (1927) * The Clown (1927) * The Devil Dancer (1927) * Possessed (1931) == References == == External links == * * * A clip from Mack Sennett's The Divorce Dodger (1926), featuring Barbara Tennant, at Internet Archive.

It orbits its parent star once every 11 hours, and its radius is 1.32 times that of Earth. It has a low albedo, indicating that its surface may resemble that of the Moon or Mercury. LHS 3844 b probably does not have an atmosphere as almost no heat goes to its night side, and it has a dayside temperature of . The presence of cloudy atmosphere with cloud tops above pressure level of 0.1 bar cannot be excluded though. In order to explain the lack of atmosphere, it has been proposed that the planet was formed interior to the star system's snow-line, because if it formed beyond the snow-line it would have carried volatiles, on the surface and in a thick atmosphere, that according to models on atmospheric loss should have been enough to sustain an atmosphere to the present. The planet probably also formed with a volatile-poor outgassing mantle, in a stagnant lid regime, because if the mantle was similar in constitution to Earth's, with plate tectonics, then it should still have a thick atmosphere, unless the red dwarf star consistently flared at an uncharacteristically extreme rate not yet considered in atmospheric loss models. An alternative explanation for the lack of atmosphere could be through a large impact event, one with enough momentum to strip the planet of its atmosphere and a large portion of its mantle. In order to explain the non replenishment of volatiles via comets back onto the planet, it is also proposed that perhaps there is an outer gas giant in the star system. == See also == * List of exoplanets discovered in 2019 == References == Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2018 Category:Exoplanets Category:Terrestrial planets Category:Indus (constellation) ","title":"LHS 3844 b"},{"id":"61601195","text":"Discospermum reyesii is a species of genus Discospermum, which are flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.

He claimed that the Iranians initially attempted to put the plan into motion on Thursday. However, Iran did not have a reaction. ==Incident== According to the report of Syrian military by the official Sana news agency, At 23.30 aircraft defenses were detected from Golan heading towards the area around Damascus. According to the IDF sites in the town of Aqrabah, southeast of Damascus, near the city's airport was targeted. As a result of the strikes, several Military Intelligence units, air force squadrons, and air defense units were put on high alert. Supplementary air defenses forces were deployed to northern Israel for a precautionary measure. As Syrian state TV announced, Syrian air army had responded to \\"hostile\\" targets over Damascus, they reported that \\"most of the hostile Israeli missiles were destroyed before reaching their targets\\". As the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group mentioned, several missiles targeted positions maintained by foreign forces, while others were downed by air forces.

It consisted in an attempt by the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary) to cross the mountains to the south of Brassó (Brașov). Although the Central Powers captured the town of Predeal itself, the Romanian defenses in the pass prevented any further advances. ==Background== Following the Battle of Brassó (Brașov), General Alexandru Averescu arrived in the region to assume command of the Romanian 2nd Army, replacing General Grigore C. Crăiniceanu. Averescu had orders to defend a line which would stop the Germans from entering the passes that led into central Romania. However, Averescu pragmatically rejected this. Instead, he insisted on withdrawing within the passes themselves, where the German superiority in artillery could be greatly reduced.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, pp. 358-360 The Central Powers forces in the area consisted in the XXXIX Corps, under the command of General Hermann von Staabs.

Infantry fighting followed the bombardment on 14 October, but the Central Powers thus far had achieved very little. In capturing the frontier heights, the Central Powers found themselves in Romanian crossfire from the surrounding forests to the west and the Clăbucetul heights from the east. On 20 October, the Central Powers attempted an outflanking attack to the west of the Romanian positions, which failed completely. Resuming their slow and steady frontal operations, the Central Powers pushed on towards the town of Predeal. On 23 October, after an entire day of fighting, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians captured the town's railway station, but it was not until two days later that the last Romanian units withdrew from the southern outskirts of Predeal.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, pp. 442-443 The Predeal Pass was protected near its northern entrance by the town of Predeal, which was subjected to a heavy German artillery bombardment in mid-October. The town itself was ultimately seized in heavy fighting, but the Romanian defenders pulled back into the pass itself. Inside the pass they took up positions that could not be broken. The terrain greatly restricted the use of artillery, removing the main asset of the Central Powers. Both sides resorted to frontal attacks, which resulted in steadily amounting losses but had no impact on the front line.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, pp. 362-363 On 13 October, an Austro- Hungarian attack in the Pass was repulsed.The Year 1917 Illustrated, Headley Bros.

Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 158 The Romanian defense in this section of the front was brilliant, and by the first days of November the Central Powers had not advanced more than 4 miles across the Romanian border.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 244 Thus, as an attempt to break through into the Wallachian Plain, the Central Powers operations in the Predeal sector had proved a failure. Semi-official German sources admitted that \\"the Rumanian defends his country with unsparing energy\\".The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 443 In order for Falkenhyan to win a complete victory at the earliest possible moment, it was necessary to force the passes in the center of the Carpathian arc. Namely, the passes between Törcsvár/Bran and Buzău. If that had been achieved and the railway between Buzău and Ploiești seized, Romania would have been split in two, with Wallachia separated from Moldavia.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted responsibility for the attacks on 20 August 2019, claiming that \\"Iran is not immune anywhere\\". Israel confirmed responsibility for the strikes on 22 August 2019, which was later followed by a US confirmation. A senior researcher at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies stated that an upcoming election and indications that the United States may start talks with Iran, could be reasons why Israel had \\"stepped up the pressure\\". == Reaction == The Israeli military said it does not comment on \\"foreign reports\\". Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah labeled the attack as a \\"suicide mission\\" and announced that other Israeli drones will be targeted over Lebanon. Ron Ben- Yishai reported for Ynet that the drones were Iranian-made, apparent by their models. Amos Harel, writing for Haaretz, stated that the attack was attributed to Israel and damaged an Iranian-supplied planetary mixer used for making \\"propellants that can improve the engine performance of missiles and increase their accuracy.\\" The Guardian cites sources saying that Israel sent the drones to \\"disrupt efforts by Hezbollah to fit advanced guidance systems to rudimentary rockets.\\" == Aftermath == Israeli jets made low altitude flights over Sidon, according to the Lebanese National News Agency.

If action by the Community should prove > necessary to attain this objective and this Treaty has not provided the > necessary powers, the Council may adopt provisions with a view to > facilitating the exercise of the rights referred to in paragraph 1. The > Council shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article > 251. 3\\\\. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to provisions on passports, identity > cards, residence permits or any other such document or to provisions on > social security or social protection. Further clarifications as to the meaning of Article 18 TEC amongst others were introduced by Directive 2004/38/EC. (Meanwhile, Swiss citizens are covered by a separate bilateral agreement whereby they are treated basically the same as EEA nationals.) This is the basis of the UK's Immigration EEA Regulations 2006, and the subsequent replacement regulations of 2016. EU Free Movement law is a constantly evolving and changing, which ensures that these regulations need to evolve frequently and this is shown by the significant number of amendments issued by Statutory instruments from the UK Government. Member states are bound by the EC treaties to implement Directives into national law. However, a significant amount of case law (or precedents), often predating the directive, and the historical development (see Freedom of movement for workers) must also be taken into account to correctly interpret EU law. Still, ambiguities in the Directive and misinterpretation by the member states exist Press release for the commission report which may require further clarification through national courts and the European Court of Justice. Due to the teleological interpretation of EU Law, more situations are brought under the scope of EU law and consequently provide free movement rights to those who would not otherwise have been given those privileges. For example, in Gerardo Ruiz Zambrano v Office national de l’emploi (ONEm), the CJEU held that the non-EEA carer of a child who is a Union Citizen would derive rights of residence from the treaty directly and it would therefore be unlawful to refuse a residence card to that carer if \\"such decisions deprive those children of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of European Union citizen\\". Essentially, because the child would be forced to leave the EU with his carer/parent, then they would be deprived of their own rights to move and reside freely within the Member states, that situation would be contrary to EU law and therefore EU rights are extended to the carer. These situations are considered under Regulation 16. ==Terminology and applications== The EEA Regulations define a number of terms in addition to the terms in the Directive 2004/38. { border=\\"1\\" +Terminology ! EEA Regulations !! Directive 2004/38 !! Meaning - EEA Family Permit  Visa  Entry clearance for non-EEA citizens - Extended Family Members  Beneficiaries  Other family members or dependants, partners in a durable relationship } { border=\\"1\\" +Applications ! Application !! Applicant !! Result !! valid for -  VAF5  non-EEA  EEA family permit  6 months -  EEA1  EEA  Registration certificate  5 years or envisaged period of residence if less -  EEA2  non-EEA Residence card  5 years or envisaged period of residence if less -  EEA3  EEA  Permanent residence card  No limit -  EEA4  non-EEA  Permanent residence card  10 years } ==Core and extended family members == The definition of Core family member (of an EEA national) only includes a spouse or civil partner, children under 21, or dependant children of any age and dependent parents. A person outside of this definition (especially unmarried partners) may fall under the category \\"extended family member\\". These include dependants of the EU citizens, members of the household, and a partner in a \\"durable relationship\\". While the Directive 2004/38 requires member states to \\"facilitate entry\\" for extended family members, the details are not defined and the Directive does not seem to grant any rights to extended family members. UK regulations state specific criteria for extended family members, including unmarried and same-sex partners. Once an extended family member has been issued with an EEA family permit, Residence Card or Residence Certificate, they are regarded under UK regulations as family members as defined by Regulation 7(3). ==British Citizens== EU Free movement rights do not generally apply to family members of British citizens when they are resident in the United Kingdom: this is known as the \\"wholly internal rule\\". Family members of British Citizens are expected to apply under the national immigration law (called the \\"Immigration Rules\\") which are separate from the implementation of the European law (the \\"EEA Regulations\\"). This can result in situations where family members of EU nationals are treated more favourably than those of British Citizens. For example, applications for 2.5-year leave to remain as a spouse under the Immigration Rules are in excess of £1000 for a 2.5 year period, with an additional NHS surcharge of £250; the applicant must have passed an English language test; the sponsor needs to show a minimum income requirement of around £18,000 per annum; and there is no access to public funds like unemployment benefits. In contrast, an application under the EEA Regulations currently costs £65 and is valid for 5 years, and the applicant has recourse to public funds as long as their sponsor continues to exercise free movement rights. The primary situations where British citizens are considered as EU citizens for the purpose of settlement are defined in Regulation 9, the most prevalent situation is known as the Surinder Singh route to citizenship, which is where the British Citizen has lived and exercised Free-movement rights in another EU state before returning to the UK. While it is possible to switch from the UK law to the European law, this does reset the clock for acquiring permanent residence. The legal situation of extended family members during this switch is uncertain, because they have to conform to both laws. Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. The EEA national is considered settled when having attained permanent residence. ==References== ==External links== * Current consolidated version — EEA Regulations * Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 — UK Government * Image of an EEA Registration Card. * Image of an EEA Registration Certificate.

It is a Grade I listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace an earlier guildhall which had been destroyed in a fire on 23 January 1421. The new building, known as the \\"Stone Hall\\", which was designed with a steep arched roof, a large window and chequered patterned exterior, was built between 1422 and 1428. It was established as a meeting place for the Guild of the Holy Trinity, a religious group of merchants in the town. Following the suppression of the chantries and religious guilds under King Edward VI in 1547, the eastern part of the undercroft was converted into a prison in 1571 and the western part was converted into a house of correction in 1618. An extension with a porch on the ground floor, which was designed with the same chequered patterned exterior, was built to the west of the original structure in 1624. The arms of Elizabeth I, which had been removed from St James' Church, were mounted above the main window over the porch in 1624, and the arms of Charles II were erected on the gable in 1664. The building was extended further to the west along Queen Street, on the site of a former public house, to create municipal offices in 1895. On 25 January 1946 the guildhall received a visit from Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Elizabeth (subsequently and collectively referred to as the \\"three queens\\"). The town hall continued to serve as the meeting place of the King's Lynn Borough Council until 1974, when it became the headquarters of King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council. Queen Elizabeth II visited the guildhall, as part of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne, on 9 February 2012. Following extensive restoration works costing £2.6 million, which were financed by the Heritage Lottery Fund, by the Borough Council and by other donors, the Duke of Gloucester visited the guildhall to mark the completion of the works and officially open the \\"Stories of Lynn Exhibition\\" on 31 March 2017. Important artifacts and other works of art held in the building include King John's charter to the Burgesses of Lynn (c.1204), the medieval King John's Cup (c.1325) a window sill from the house of Walter Coney, a former mayor of Lynn, (15th century) and the first portrait painted of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (c.1937). ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Norfolk Category:City and town halls in England Category:Government buildings completed in 1428 ","title":"King's Lynn Guildhall"},{"id":"61601734","text":"Commitment () is a 2019 Turkish drama film directed by Semih Kaplanoğlu.

The rank was introduced in 1987 as part of a new modified ranking system. Currently, there is no equivalent for the rank of second brigadier general in other countries but the rank of second brigadier general lies under the NATO equivalent code of OF-6. It is the lowest ranking general officer rank in the armed forces of Iran and lies between the ranks of colonel and brigadier general. However, the equivalent rank in the Iranian navy is the rank of flotilla admiral.“An Interview with the IRGC’s Deputy of Human Resources” (in Persian), Basirat, July 4, 2010, http://bit. ly/2FHnCpK In Persian, the word second brigadier general translates to sar-tip dovom. Sar translates to head or commander, tip translates to brigade, and dovom translates to two. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Iranian Law Enforcement Forces (NAJA) also use this rank; the difference is in salutation. Second brigadier generals of the regular military (Artesh) are referred to as amir sar-tip dovom. While second brigadier generals of the IRGC and NAJA are referred to as sar-tip dovom pasdar. The addition of pasdar distinguishes the three branches of the Iranian armed forces as pasdar translates to guardian, a term often given to IRGC and NAJA personnel.Saeid Golkar, The Evolution of Iran’s Police Forces and Social Control in the Islamic Republic, Middle East Brief 120 (Waltham, MA: Crown Center, 2018), 3, https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB120.pdf For IRGC personnel, promotion to the rank of second brigadier general, takes three years, while for the regular military (Artesh) it takes four.

Members of the SDG had a lively but orderly discussion about that week's topic. Every member had obviously studied the assigned books and articles in advance, and the discussion leader scheduled for that week led the discussion. SDGs are the central learning activity of the PLATO Society. The peer-led, seminar-style discussion in a 14-member SDG adds a social aspect to learning, because differing viewpoints illuminate topics in useful and unexpected ways. There can be plenty of laughter, but at its heart an SDG is a pure, mentally-stimulating intellectual exercise. SDGs are scheduled in three 14-week terms per year. SDGs can be 14, 10, or 7 weeks in length. (Members select 7-week SDGs to help schedule their vacations.)PLATO:FAQs:If I travel frequently... accessed August 22, 2019. An SDG divides up its topics at the start of a term so that each member can be the discussion leader in a specific week. An SDG meets for two daytime hours on a weekday. SDGs originate with proposals from members on topics in art, biology, economics, history, literature, movies, music, political science, psychology, science, or technology.Kathy Seal. \\"You're Never Too Old to Learn\\", Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1986; subscriber accessed August 22, 2019.Hal Denner. \\"UCLA PLATO Society\\", Jewish Journal, August 24, 2000; accessed August 22, 2019.

Each Colloquium is held in the early afternoon in a large auditorium away from the PLATO facility, is announced in advance, and is open to the public, as well as to PLATO Society members, at no charge.PLATO:Colloquia; accessed August 22, 2019. Video recordings of all Colloquia from 2013 to the present are viewable in the video gallery on the PLATO Society website. The PLATO Society has a variety of extracurricular activities for members. They include monthly day trips to local places of interest, informal lunchtime presentations, social events, an annual three-day meeting at an outdoor retreat venue, group foreign travel, and non-sponsored interest groups.PLATO:Programs; accessed August 22, 2019. ==Administration and governance== The PLATO Society is independent and self-governed. Its Board of Directors, elected annually to one-year terms by the membership, includes the president, other officers, and the heads of seven standing committees. Members perform nearly all operational tasks, including proposing SDGs, serving as coordinators, handling financial and facility matters, staffing the visitors' desk, and staffing committees that oversee development of SDGs, seek coordinators, handle SDG registration, develop Colloquia, and run noncurricular programs.PLATO:Governance:How We Operate; accessed August 22, 2019. ==References== Category:Educational organizations based in the United States Category:Retirement Category:Adult education in the United States Category:Age and society ","title":"PLATO Society of Los Angeles"},{"id":"61601874","text":"Eddie Williams (1932 \\\\- May 8, 2017) was President of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies from 1972 to 2004.

It consisted in a German offensive that was successfully repulsed by the Romanians, who then carried out a largely unhindered tactical retreat. ==Background== In late September, a Romanian pilot landed behind the German lines and was taken prisoner. The message he carried revealed the location of a relief column which was supposed to come in the aid of the battered Olt Corps. On 29 September, General Erich von Falkenhayn (the overall Central Powers commander in Transylvania) issued orders to strike against this threat, which was represented by the Romanian 2nd Army. For this operation, he planned to attack along the valley of the Olt River, using the XXXIX Reserve Corps and the I Reserve Corps (German 89th Infantry Division and Austro-Hungarian 71st Infantry Division), supported by cavalry.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, p. 353 The Second Romanian Army, under General Grigore C. Crăiniceanu, had its forces halved in mid-September, when three of its divisions were shifted South. The I Reserve Corps was part of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army at the time of the battle. The Romanians had a decisive numerical advantage: 30 battalions against 13.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 56-57 and 117 Kőhalom was the district capital of the eponymous district of the Nagy-Küküllő County. The town was taken by the 2nd Romanian Army on 16 September.The Times, 1917, Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 223 ==Battle== On 2 October, General Curt von Morgen attacked the Romanian 3rd and 6th Divisions northwest of Kőhalom. The German 89th Division, composed largely of older men from the Berlin area, took a beating and fell back.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 117 The 89th Infantry Division saw initial success, rapidly overcoming Romanian defences north of the Olt. Unfortunately for the Central Powers, the 71st Austro-Hungarian Infantry Division failed to keep up with the German division, exposing the latter's flank to a determined counterattack by elements of four Romanian infantry divisions. Amidst horn blows and loud shouts, the 89th Infantry Division was thrown off the heights in a bayonet attack within moments. The German columns streamed back, pursued by the triumphant Romanians. Reserves were dispatched but they were scattered by Romanian artillery before they could provide any aid. Every attempt by the 89th Division to take up a firm position was in vain, as Romanian masses pressed incessantly against its thinned ranks. Powerless to hold back this Romanian assault, the Germans fell back to Hégen (Brădeni) and Jakabfalva (Iacobeni). Eventually, the Romanian troops ceased their pursuit. They gathered their prisoners, captured weapons and other war booty and pulled back to the high ground behind them. The Romanian charge threatened to sweep away the German line, and only lack of reserves caused the attack to be called off. By the end of the day, after having suffered heavy losses, the Germans were back at their line of departure. German cavalry to the south also ran into determined resistance and failed to make any progress. German leadership doubted that the positions of the I Reserve Corps' two divisions could be held if the Romanians attacked again. However, to the surprise of the German commanders, the Romanians did not exploit their success against the I Reserve Corps. Instead, they used this check that they had inflicted against the Germans to withdraw to the east, pursued by the XXXIX Corps and the German Cavalry (Kavalleriekorps Schmettow). Nonetheless, the unexpected Romanian withdrawal prevented the Germans from pinning down their opponents.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, pp. 353-354 The Berlin report of 2 October acknowledged the Romanian success. The Romanian units captured 800 German prisoners and 8 machine guns.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 230 ==Aftermath== The Germans pursued the Romanians as they retreated, reaching the eastern end of Bucsum (Bucium). There, a German artillery battery was ordered to fire on the railway station at Ósinka (Șinca), where a locomotive was just departing. The German guns could not find their range, however. They fired in vain at the train, first at a range of 5,500 meters, then at 6,000 meters before a final attempt at 6,300 meters. The regimental commander ordered the battery to gallop behind the village and take up positions to fire on the train. The battery galloped frantically: limbers were thrown about, the observers' wagon was often on two wheels, the battery's vehicles racing out of the village. Shortly after leaving the village, an ammunition wagon overturned, its gunners flying into the air over the roadside ditch into a field. Despite the battery's best efforts, the train had vanished from their sight. However, after climbing a hill, the battery spotted a lot of Romanian infantry and supply wagons moving towards the Geisterwald from the village of Ósinka. Panic erupted in the midst of the Romanian troops and their horses as the first shells landed. The Romanians counterattacked, and despite being driven from the hill twice, they pressed on their assault as soon as German fire ceased. A Romanian battery opened fire as well, but the duel was brief, as the Germans had run out of ammunition by then. The German battery was saved by the arrival of supporting infantry, which it had overtaken one hour prior.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, pp. 354-356 The largest settlement involved in the operations was Fogaras (Făgăraș). Crăiniceanu's 2nd Army had taken the town – capital of Fogaras County – on 16 September. However, in accordance with the general Romanian withdrawal from the region, Crăiniceanu fell back from Fogaras on 4 October.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, pp. 231 and 242 The Romanian victory at Kőhalom checked the Germans long enough to ensure an almost uncontested Romanian withdrawal, save for the efforts of one German battery which had overtaken its infantry by an hour. The Germans encountered new Romanian defenses only late on 4 October, along the Western slopes of the Perșani Ridge (), in a forest known to the Germans and Austrians as the Geisterwald. Here, a new battle would begin early on 5 October.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, pp. 354-356 Kőhalom was taken by the 71st Austro-Hungarian Division during the late night of 5 October, after battling the retreating Romanians in the heights north of the town. Further to the southwest, the German 89th Division resumed its advance that same day, crossing the Olt unopposed.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 117 Despite the small number of Romanian prisoners during the retreat (or at least, small compared to comparable German battles against the Russians), General Grigore C. Crăiniceanu was dismissed from the command of the 2nd Army and replaced by Alexandru Averescu.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, p. 358 On 4 October, the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army transferred von Morgen's I Corps, with its two divisions, to von Falkenhayn's 9th Army. Austria-Hungary was, on paper, heavily involved in this battle, but in actuality its own forces did nothing. Its 1st Army controlled von Morgen's I Reserve Corps, which comprised both a German infantry division (the 89th) and an Austro-Hungarian infantry division (the 71st). However, the two divisions advanced in parallel, with the Austro-Hungarian one apparently lagging behind. Its failure to advance alongside the German 89th Division was the very catalyst of the Romanian successful counter-attack. For all intents and purposes, the German 89th Division was on its own during this battle.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, pp. 353-354Michael B.

The branding was first announced in January 2015 when, following a similar deal made by NBC, Spike announced they would air monthly fight cards by the Haymon Boxing-created \\"Premier Boxing Champions\\". The branding would eventually be phased out after Spike's deals with PBC and Glory ended, leaving only the network's mixed martial arts coverage. ==Coverage overview== The branding came about from a rotation of live combat sporting events on Spike that were commonly aired on Friday nights, which included mixed martial arts cards from the Viacom-owned Bellator MMA promotion, and kickboxing events by Glory. On those weeks in which there weren't any live fights, Spike intended on broadcasting “shoulder programming” designed to introduce viewers to fighters’ backstories and build momentum for grudge matches. In 2015, Spike and Premiere Boxing Champions signed a two-year agreement, with negotiations for a third year in 2017 that never made it into the final paperwork. The branding debuted on March 13, 2015 with Spike's first PBC fight card. Spike's final PBC card aired on January 13, 2017. David Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Communications at Spike TV, said that one of the reasons for Spike deciding to discontinue its commitment to PBC was “a general dissatisfaction with the quality of cards being provided by PBC founder Al Haymon.” ===Commentators=== Antonio Tarver, who served as a member of Spike's broadcast team, explained that \\"I remember back in the day when fighters started their careers on NBC. Network TV. That's how legendary stars were made. I think NBC and Spike are going to do the same for today's fighters.\\" Joining Tarver on commentary was co-analyst Jimmy Smith, Dana Jacobson as host, Thomas Hearns as the pre-fight analyst, and Scott Hanson as play-by-play announcer. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Boxing television series Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2017 American television series endings Category:Spike (TV network) original programming ","title":"Friday Night Lights Out"},{"id":"61602006","text":"Vaughen Isaacs (born ) is a South African rugby union player for the in the Currie Cup and the in the Rugby Challenge.

John Brown Gribble FRGS (1 September 1847 – 3 June 1893) was an Australian minister of religion, noted for his missionary work among Aboriginal people in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. His appointment in Western Australia was cancelled within a year due to hostility from squatters and others who had Aboriginal employees. ==History== J. B. Gribble c. 1890 Gribble was born at Redruth, Cornwall, a son of miner Benjamin Gribble (1810–1866) and Mary Gribble, née Brown (1808 – 20 January 1887), and as a young man emigrated with his parents to Victoria, Australia. He was devoutly religious, and early chose the life of a Congregational Minister, serving in Rutherglen, Victoria around 1876, and in 1878 moved to Jerilderie, so was there at the time of the Kelly gang's occupation of the town (February 1879). According to one account, Kelly admonished Steve Hart for taking Gribble's watch, on the grounds it was an inferior make, also that Gribble interceded with Kelly on behalf of a girl, whose riding horse the gang had appropriated. ===Warangesda=== Gribble was concerned at the number of local Aboriginal girls and women who had cohabited with white men, to be abandoned when they became pregnant. He determined on setting up a refuge where these women and their children were cared for, away from degrading influences, especially of alcohol. He lamented the fact that Victoria, with one tenth the Aboriginal population of New South Wales, had many Church and State missions, yet the larger colony had none, with the exception of the Maloga Aboriginal Mission School, run as a private philanthropy by Daniel Matthews and his brothers. Thanks to Gribble's efforts, and supported by the people of Darlington Point, an area was set aside by government as an Aboriginal reserve, dubbed Warangesda, a portmanteau of an Aboriginal word and \\"Bethesda\\", to mean \\"house of healing\\" or \\"house of mercy\\", and superintended by Gribble, who with his friend J. J. Lloyd and a handful of Aboriginal men performed the construction work. His church at Jerilderie was Presbyterian, and at Rutherglen he regularly officiated at a church of that denomination, but he maintained membership of the Congregational Union of Victoria, and in any case, the mission had to be non-denominational to receive aid from the New South Wales Government. In 1880 the mission received government assistance, and was visited by the (Anglican) bishop of Goulburn, Mesac Thomas. Gribble joined the Anglican church, was made a stipendiary reader in 1880, deacon in 1881 and priest in 1883. In 1883, following a drop in financial support for the mission, he announced his resignation as superintendent, declaring his intention to start a mission in Western Australia, but was coerced into remaining. His health was failing however, and in March 1884 he left to recuperate in England, returning the following January much invigorated. While in England he was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and published a booklet Black but Comely . . ., a plea for support of Australian Aboriginal missions based on his Sydney lectures, with a foreword by the Archbishop of Canterbury. ===Western Australia=== Four months later Gribble announced that he had been invited by the Anglican church in Western Australia to found a similar mission on the Gascoyne River, and with John Rushton, a Warangesda missionary, as his assistant, left for Shark Bay in July, travelling by ship to Fremantle, train to Perth, then the steamer Otway to Carnarvon. Not to be confused with the Orient Line ship, this SS Otway traded WA and SA 1878–1892. After a generally cordial reception by managers of the various sheep stations on the way to Dalgetty Reserve on the Kennedy Range, where a large area had been set aside for the Mission, he built a house and native hut, sunk a well, and conducted well-attended church services. Rushton obtained a position as teacher at the local school, and had nothing further to do with Gribble. Mrs Gribble and their five youngest children would arrive some five months later. Trouble started in December 1885 when Gribble held a lecture \\"Only a Blackfellow\\" at St Georges Hall, Perth, and aired some of his criticisms about the way Aborigines were treated up north. The settlers were outraged and (despite the West Australian 's advice to give him a long rope) called a public meeting at Carnarvon to discuss his allegations. The audience was hostile, and when Gribble attempted to speak he was howled down. The West Australian then came down heavily on the side of the settlers, and refused to publish Gribble's version of events. With the consent of his bishop, he favoured its competitor, the Daily News, with a copy of his journal, which included a number of personal observations and accounts from sympathetic residents. Extracts published by the Daily News included cases he witnessed of Aborigines being tied together with chains, shackled round the neck. Among other abuses he described how illiterate Aborigines were induced to sign, with a pencil mark, a contract for life to dive for pearls, then were traded like slaves. On the sheep and cattle stations, Aboriginal men were assigned to squatters in a system not unlike the earlier \\"assigned convict\\" system of the eastern colonies, and females were taken as concubines and further ill- treated. And not all abuses were at the hands of individual settlers. He instanced the Flying Foam massacre, a retaliatory raid in the Pilbara region at which many Aborigines were slaughtered, partly corroborated by one David Carly. A systematic boycott of Gribble and his Mission began, subsequently extended to anyone bold enough (labelled \\"sneaks\\") to support him. A petition was drawn up and sent to the bishop, requesting removal of this priest who was interfering with the native labour system. Gribble was then obliged to travel to Perth to defend himself before the bishop and the Missions Committee. During the voyage on the steamer Natal he was threatened and assaulted by a group of squatters and pearlers, and forced to barricade himself in his cabin. Efforts to report his tormentors were stonewalled by officialdom, Perth lawyers, and possibly Governor Broome himself. Back at Carnarvon efforts were made to prevent building supplies he had purchased being unloaded. The Missions Committee viewed Gribble's \\"Letters to the Editor\\" detailing these events with \\"unqualified condemnation\\", and instructed him to have all his future correspondence vetted by them, a condition which offended his \\"Christian manhood\\". In June 1886 Gribble left for Sydney to put his case to the Anglican primate (bishop Alfred Barry) and the Board of Missions, but when the ship docked at Adelaide he was greeted with a telegram from the Missions Committee of Perth, who had met in his absence and decided to dispense with his services. So the Galilie mission ran from 28 August 1885 when Gribble arrived in Carnarvon to 1 July 1886 when he was sacked. His wife and youngest children were still at the mission station. His dismissal was welcomed by sections of the Perth press, to whom Gribble was a defiant, tactless, prying, boastful interloper. The West Australian carried a similar editorial. To alleviate his financial situation, a position (critics said a benefice) was found for him in Bulli, New South Wales. He proceeded to sue The West Australian and its publishers Harper and Hackett for £10,000 for libel (several tens of millions in today's money), having called him a \\"lying, canting humbug\\" and much else. He also considered suing the Mission Committee for wrongful dismissal and the Dean of Perth for the wrongful revocation of his licence, which could only be applied for immorality. The court case The trial date was set back to 5 May 1887 to accommodate the West Australian, to the evident delight of its competitor, the Daily News. Rather than being heard before a jury as is usual for a libel case, the case was heard by Chief Justice Onslow and Justice Stone, sitting in banco, and went for a little over a month. Many witnesses testified as to the basic truth of Gribble's allegations, and the Chief Justice, summing up, was apparently about to decide for the plaintiff, when he astounded the audience by finding for the newspaper, saying that Gribble had shown little restraint in presenting hearsay knowledge as fact. His associate was more condemnatory and found against Gribble, with costs. Gribble had cited a number of cases where aboriginal employees had been treated in a reprehensible manner, but most of those had been dealt with by the authorities, and did not reflect on the Colony as a whole. He had used the fact of a dearth of half-caste children, despite the widespread intimacy between settlers and Aboriginal girls and women, as evidence of (widely rumoured) infanticide. At least one newspaper had a good word for Gribble, saying he might have lost in court, but had won admiration from much of the country, and had stirred government into tightening the laws regarding employment of native labour. The West Australian and Western Mail were ecstatic, declaring the decision a victory for the Colony, gloating that Gribble had a day or two later \\"left the colony in a clandestine manner\\". The Governor of Western Australia, F. Napier Broome, who had earlier been criticised for an un-statesmanlike reference to Gribble's journal, now weighed in on the side of the newspaper, echoing its line that Gribble's attack had been on the whole Colony, and made available for publication detailed defences of his Government and the settlers. ===Return to New South Wales=== Gribble resigned his Bulli post in July 1888 and was promptly appointed travelling missionary general (or general superintendent of missions) by the Aborigines Protection Association of New South Wales, and set about founding a mission at Copeland for the natives in the Barrington River region. He spent time inspecting the Warangesda, Maloga, Cumroogunga and Coudah mission stations, finding residents at Cumroogunga the most advanced academically. He found so many problems in the management of these facilities that the Daily Telegraph concluded that the only way Gribble could be satisfied with a mission was if he were \\"superintendent, missionary, manager, council and collector all in one\\". Gribble resigned. In 1889 Gribble founded the church of St Stephen at Barmedman in the parish of Temora, with an Aboriginal home and a rectory \\"Illaville\\" about a kilometre from Temora on the road to Young. He stipulated that the church building would be available to any Protestant group for church services. The rectory, like the church, was of all timber construction, and burned to the ground six months later. That September, Gribble and Rev. Guelter Soares of Adelong (Gribble's old church) exchanged parishes. ===North Queensland and last days=== In June 1891 Gribble visited the Bellenden Ker Range with the aim of establishing an Anglican mission to the Aboriginals in the area, where he was well received by officials but encountered lassitude and great need among the original inhabitants. He left Adelong to commence his mission early in 1892. The mission station, rather than at Bellenden-Ker, was established at Cape Grafton. In September 1892 he suffered an attack of malaria accompanied by pleurisy, greatly affecting his lungs, and was admitted to Cairns Hospital. He returned to the mission station, and instructed his eldest son, Ernest Gribble, to take charge of the mission while he hopefully recovered in the milder climate of Sydney. In November he visited his old parish at Adelong, and in January 1893 was admitted to the Prince Alfred Hospital, where he was assessed as beyond help, and returned to his residence. He died aged 45, either at his residence, on Silver Street, Marrickville, or at the Prince Alfred Hospital. His remains were interred at the Waverley Cemetery. ==Recognition== *His headstone in Waverley Cemetery is inscribed \\"The Blackfellows' Friend\\" *A monument was erected to his memory at Yarrabah, Queensland. ==Publications== * * * ==Family== John Brown Gribble married Mary Anne Elizabeth Bulmer (29 March 1848 – 19 September 1928); they had four boys and five girls who grew to adulthood: *Rev.

Riley was granted his Certificate of Freedom in 1831.Riley's convict years can be followed via UK Prison Hulks Registers 1802–49—Justitia Register 1803–36; \\"Free Settler or Felon\\" website at jenwilletts.com; NSW Convict Indents—Bound Indentures 1823–26; NSW Convict Musters 1800–49—General Muster, 1825; Butts of Certificates of Freedom, 1831, Dec; Sydney Gazette, 1 September 1825, p. 3, and 12 January 1832, p. 1; Sydney Herald, 16 January 1832, p. 4. His ship is generally referred to as \\"Minstrel (2).\\" Through the 1830s and early 1840s Riley published verse – mainly comic and satirical – in Sydney newspapers, either anonymously or under various pseudonyms including J. R., Dick Lightpate, A Child of Song, Owen Bulgruddery, Felix M’Quill, Caleb Menangle and Felix.See Vening, pp. 143-4 for further details. During this time he became associated with the Hume family, explorers and settlers of southern New South Wales. He was schoolmaster to the children of Francis Rawdon Hume (brother of Hamilton Hume) at Rockwood, Appin, and to the family of Hume relative George Barber at Glenrock, Marulan. Riley published several poems dedicated to Hume family members, most notably an elegy for Barber, drowned trying to cross flooded Towrang Creek in a winter storm in 1844,“The Horseman Who Faced the Storm” was printed in The Weekly Register of Politics, Facts and General Literature, 4 January 1845, p. 6, and republished twice in the Goulburn Herald: once (16 December, 1848, p. 4) attributed to Felix, and a second time (3 October 1860, p. 4) attributed to Harry Dashboard. A manuscript version, apparently in Felix’s hand, is in “Elegiac Pieces by Felix” in Hamilton Hume–Papers, 1840-1855, Ferguson Collection, NLA, MS 3575. and a lament for John Kennedy Hume, killed in a fight with bushranger Thomas Whitton in the streets of Gunning on 20 January 1840.\\"Lines, Written as a tribute…to the memory of the late John Kennedy Hume, Esq…\\" appeared in the Australasian Chronicle, 8 October 1842, p. 1. A manuscript version is in \\"Elegiac Pieces by Felix,\\" NLA MS 3575. == Fisher’s Ghost == Frederick Fisher disappeared from his Campbelltown farm in June 1826. Foul play was suspected, and a police search led by Aboriginal tracker Gilbert finally found his remains in a boggy creek nearby. Fisher’s friend George Worrall was accused of his murder, tried and hanged in 1827. The affair was reported in the newspapers of the day,See, for example, The Australian, 11 November 1826, p. 2; 3 February 1827, p. 3 and 7 February 1827, p. 2. but James Riley’s verse account was the first to introduce a new and sensational element based on local rumour: the appearance of the ghost of the murdered man on a Campbelltown bridge, pointing to where his body would be found. The story of Fisher’s Ghost continues to exert a fascination today.See Further reading Riley’s poem “The Sprite of the Creek!” first appeared anonymously in 1832Hill’s Life in New South Wales, 14 September 1832, p. 3 (with title misprinted “The Spirit of the Creek!”); full version with author’s corrections, 21 September 1832, p. 4. and again – this time with an explanatory letter and extensive footnotes – under the pen-name Felix in 1846.Bell’s Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer, 27 June 1846, p. 1. == Felix’s comic verse == As Felix, Riley also produced comic verse, most notably two serio-comic epics, \\"The Luprechaun; or, Fairies' Shoemaker, An Irish Legend of '98\\"Bell’s Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer, 11 October 1845, p. 4; 18 October 1845, p. ?; 25 October 1845, p. 4; and 1 November 1845, p. 4. Reprinted in the Goulburn Herald attributed to Harry D––––, 10 and 14 March 1860, p. 4. Riley’s source was probably the second part of the story \\"Superstitions of the Irish Peasantry.–No. V. The Luprechaun,\\" The Dublin and London Magazine, July 1825, pp. 195–7, which was reprinted in Sydney in The Currency Lad, 3 November 1832, p. 4. and \\"Billy McDaniel; or, 'The Ould Fellow' Balked. An Irish Legend\\", an Asmodean tale in which Billy rescues a young bride at a country wedding from the clutches of the devil.Bell's Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer, 10, 17, 24 and 31 July and 7, 14 and 21 August 1847, p. 4. This is a retelling in verse of the tale \\"Master and Man\\" from Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland by Thomas Crofton Croker (1825), which was reprinted in the Sydney Gazette, 12 June 1830, p. 4. It is likely that Riley was also the \\"Felix McQuill\\" who wrote “The Luckless Journey; or, One Half Pint Too Much”, a cautionary tale set in the time of Governor Macquarie.Australasian Chronicle, 20 September 1842, p. 2; 22 September 1842, p. 1; and 24 September 1842, p. 2. See also Webby, p. 48 and Vening, p. 144. However Felix's crowning achievement was arguably the Humbuggawang Despatches, a series of prose and song satires on New South Wales politics of the 1840s and '50s, particularly the progressive causes of extension of the franchise, a halt to the transportation of convicts, separation from British rule and a federated Australian republic. The despatches are in the language (and eccentric spelling) of stockman-poet Tim Donohue, Felix's uproarious Irish-Australian friend, from the wilds of the Murrumbidgee River. The sporting and satirical newspaper Bell's Life in Sydney carried twenty despatches over the years 1847 to 1859. == The Gundagai flood == Riley’s most widely-known piece – and the only published one to which he attached his name – was “The Gundagai Calamity,” a lament for the destruction of the town of Gundagai in the Murrumbidgee River flood of the night of 24 June 1852.Goulburn Herald, 28 August 1852, p. 6, and reprinted widely in NSW newspapers. It was written at Francis Rawdon Hume’s home Castlesteads, at Boorowa, only a few weeks after the events described. The poem would reappear regularly in NSW newspapers over the next eighty years. == Harry Dashboard == Around 1848 Riley adopted the pen-name \\"Harry Dashboard\\", a term he took from the board at the front of a carriage which shielded its occupants from the muck dashed up by the horses. Harry wrote comic and satirical verse from places in the Murrumbidgee region of southern NSW: Boorowa, Gunning, Bobbera and “Yassville” (probably an imaginary place in or near Yass), and his work appeared mainly in Goulburn and Yass newspapers. His subjects are sometimes local – the woeful state of the roads and bridges , the eccentricities of Brummy the coach driver, a mock ode for the local policemen – but the best are satires on colonial politics and prominent figures: the gold mania, Chinese immigration, speculation in railways, the absurd Bunyip aristocracy proposal of W. C. Wentworth, the demagoguery of John Dunmore Lang and sly digs at the work of Harry's poetical rivals Henry Parkes and Charles Harpur. Riley’s last poem as Harry Dashboard was published in 1860.\\"The Horseman Who Faced the Storm\\", Goulburn Herald, 3 October 1860, p. 4 (a reprint of the poem by Felix which had appeared in the Weekly Register of 1845 and the Goulburn Herald of 1848). His fate is not known with certainty, but the evidence of his former pupil Mary Bozzom Kennedy, daughter of Francis Rawdon Hume, suggests that Riley died \\"alone and friendless\\" around that year.Mrs. Mary Kennedy, \\"Recollections of an Australian Squatter's Wife, 1832-1912\\", State Library of NSW, A 2105, microfilm CY1338, Draft C typescript, p. 20A. See Vening, p. 147. Despite the fact that his work was confined to the newspapers, Riley’s output shows him to be a fine humourist, an adroit rhymester and a sharp commentator on matters local and national. His work has yet to be properly recognised. == Selected individual works == Anonymous * The Sprite of the Creek!

It is a Grade I listed building. ==History== The guildhall was established as a meeting place for the Guild of the Holy Cross, a religious group of merchants in the town. It was sited adjacent to the 13th century guild chapel which was the place of worship of the merchants. The building, which is timber-framed with plaster infill, was completed in around 1417; the design made extensive use of jettied timber framing and featured a entrance to left end bay with iron gates at ground floor level and six leaded windows at first floor level; there was a wing to the south-east. Internally, the design involved a main hall, with a stone floor and chamfered ceiling beams, on the ground floor and two rooms, with spine beam, on the first floor. Originally the ground floor hall displayed iconography depicting God the Father flanked by Mary, mother of Jesus and John the Evangelist. The wing to the south-east is thought to have been used as an armoury. Following the suppression of the chantries and religious guilds under King Edward VI in 1547, the local borough council petitioned for control of the building and secured ownership of it in 1553. The council used the ground floor hall as their main offices and also as a court of record, so that local commercial disputes might be resolved. The medieval iconography was whitewashed as part of the Government's reformation policy in 1563. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ground floor hall was used for public assemblies, including theatre performances, but also continued to be used as the meeting place of Stratford-upon-Avon Borough Council until meetings were transferred to larger facilities at Stratford-upon-Avon Town Hall in Sheep Street in 1843. Meanwhile, the first floor rooms were used for teaching by the newly re- founded King's New School from 1560. William Shakespeare attended the school as a child, although he is thought to have left at an early age, in the early 1570s. The facility, which continues to be used by King Edward VI School, was restored, at a cost on £1.8 million, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, between July 2015 and April 2016. The restoration included treatment of the timbers and conservation of the medieval iconography and also revealed an additional unexpected medieval painting of John the Baptist. The guildhall was then opened to the public for the first time in April 2016. ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Warwickshire Category:Government buildings completed in 1417 Category:City and town halls in England ","title":"Stratford-upon-Avon Guildhall"},{"id":"61602116","text":"Xu Guang (; born June 1960) is a Chinese politician who spent his whole career in north China's Henan province.

He was the strongest of ten giant warriors in King Dutugemunu's army. After the battle, he contributed to rebuilding Kudumbigala Monastery, gifted to Buddhist monks. ==Taxonomy== The species is closely related to C. gotaimbarai, C. ingerorum and C. kumarasinghei. ==Ecology== The species was discovered from area lies between 12 and 67 meters above sea level of Kudumbigala Sanctuary, Ampara. Individuals are restricted to rock outcrops and the interior of granite caves in forested areas. It is sympatric with Calodactylodes illingworthorum and Hemidactylus hunae. Researchers identified the species is Critically Endangered due to low numbers and density. ==Description== An adult male is 27.9 mm long. Dorsum homogeneous with smooth granular scales. Chin, gular, pectoral and abdominal scales are smooth. There are 25– 27 belly scales across mid body. Tubercles on posterior flank are weakly developed. Para vertebral granules linearly arranged. Body short and slender. Head large and depressed. Snout relatively long. Pupil round. Head, body and limbs are light grey to light brown dorsally. There are five irregular black bands on the dorsum. Oblique black line present between eye and nostrils on both sides. A dark longitudinal line is present on occipital area. Lateral surfaces of trunk covered with irregular cream spots. Tail grayish white with three faded brown cross-bands. ==Media controversy== Several Sri Lankan media as well many parliamentarians criticized the usage of national hero's name for specific name. The argument was largely due to unknowing about binomial nomenclature in zoological taxonomy among people. They indicated that the usage of heroes' names gives by equating the national heroes to geckos. However, researchers neglect that sentence and explained that the name is given only to honor the personality. ==References== Category:Reptiles of Sri Lanka nandimithrai Category:Reptiles described in 2019 ","title":"Cnemaspis nandimithrai"},{"id":"61602147","text":"Wiedemannia simplex is a species of dance flies, in the fly family Empididae. ==References== Category:Empididae Category:Insects described in 1862 Category:Diptera of North America ","title":"Wiedemannia simplex"},{"id":"61602149","text":"Mifta Uddin Chowdhury Rumi A politician and former justice of Sunamganj District of Sylhet Division of Bangladesh.

He was the shortest of ten giant warriors in King Dutugemunu's army in stature but with enormous power.

Individuals are restricted to rock outcrops and granite caves in forested areas. It is sympatric with Calodactylodes illingworthorum and Hemidactylus hunae. Researchers identified the species is Critically Endangered due to low numbers and density. ==Description== An adult male is 32.9 mm long. Dorsum homogeneous with smooth granular scales. Chin, gular, pectoral and abdominal scales are smooth. There are 23–25 belly scales across mid body. Tubercles on posterior flank are weakly developed. Para vertebral granules linearly arranged.

Lateral surfaces of trunk covered with three to four irregular cream white spots.

The argument was largely due to unknowing about binomial nomenclature in zoological taxonomy among people. They indicated that the usage of heroes' names gives by equating the national heroes to geckos.

This concerto was completed just before the onset of a series of strokes that affected him greatly for the rest of his creative life, marked by his Concerto for Three (1994). This stroke took place exactly three months after the first performance of the preliminary version, which took place in Moscow on 20 April 1985, by the dedicatees Oleh Krysa and Tatiana Grindenko, with the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra conducted by Saulius Sondeckis. The final, revised version of this concerto, however, was first performed in East Berlin on 9 December 1985, by the Dresden Chamber Orchestra under Manfred Scherzer. == Structure == This concerto is divided into five movements and has a typical duration of 24 minutes. The titles of each movement are taken from the tempo indications marked at the beginning. The movement list is as follows: The concerto is scored for two solo violins, four first violins, four second violins, three violas, two cellos, a double bass, a harpsichord, a celesta, a piano, and a set of four church bells tuned to play B-flat, A, C, and B. This concerto is a great example of the style Schnittke developed over the years, which he coined polystylism. === First movement === The first movement consists of two opposing sections: the \\"museum\\" (tonality) and the \\"uncertain present\\" (atonality). Even though Schnittke labelled the beginning of the first movement as neo-classical, most scholars tend to agree that it has more baroque or neo-baroque references than neo-classical ones. The concerto starts in G minor, but its chord progression doesn't come anywhere near a cadence, and keeps drifting further from the original key in thirds: E major, A major, F major, D major, B-flat major, G major, C minor, and A major. The second section, marked by the sudden sound of the BACH bells in measure 28, announces the \\"explosion of the museum\\". From this point onwards, the BACH motif keeps repeating and its intervallic content collapses and keeps pushing all instruments to their lower pitch. === Second movement === The multiple references to the BACH motif lead to a chaconne-like movement where chord progression keep repeating and expanding. The two soloists present different monogram rows, each of which is followed by its harmonic partner. Given the fact that the soloist do not play the rows simultaneously, there is little overlapping and cacophony. For this reason, the listener has time to identify each row as a separate entity. === Third movement === The third movement divides its musical forces into three groups: the soloists, the harpsichord and the strings. The movement starts again with the BACH row with the addition of scales. Each group presents different monogram rows until bar 65, where all rows from all instruments are played simultaneously both by the strings and the soloists. This leads to an ever-shifting chaotic texture which is progressively disintegrated by the surfacing of the D major triad chord, triggering a final atonal outburst and settling onto a unison D which puts an end to the movement in a complete reversal from the first movement. The next movement is expected to be played attacca. === Fourth movement === This movement also starts with the BACH motif played by the harpsichord, which is set to disrupt the apparent sense of tonality stemming from the last bars of the previous movement. From measure 8 to measure 91, the harpsichord and the strings play quasi-tonal material, while the soloists play atonal material. The end of the movement is marked by a short cadenza played by both soloists. === Fifth movement === The final sounds of the fourth movement serve as a bridge to the last movement, where harmonic rows start sounding simultaneously and each string part begins to arpeggiate. Each instrument starts to progressively slow down and, as in the third movement, the entrance of the D pedal signals the eventual collapse of the atonal material. == References == Category:Compositions by Alfred Schnittke Category:1985 compositions Category:Concertos for multiple instruments ","title":"Concerto Grosso No. 3 (Schnittke)"},{"id":"61602257","text":"Samuel Nicholls (1870–1912) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for West Bromwich Albion where he won the 1892 FA Cup Final, scoring in a 3–0 win against Aston Villa. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1912 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:English Football League players Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players ","title":"Sammy Nicholls"},{"id":"61602264","text":"The 1967 Cardiff City Council election was held on Thursday 11 May 1967 to elect councillors to Cardiff City Council in Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales. It took place on the same day as several other county borough elections in Wales and England. The previous elections to this one were in May 1966 and the next elections would be in May 1968. The election saw the Conservatives taking a significant number of seats back from the Labour Party, as well as winning every new seat. ==Background== Cardiff County Borough Council had been created in 1889. Cardiff became a city in 1905. Elections to the local authority were held annually, though not all council seats were included in each contest, because each of the three councillors in each ward stood down for election in rotation. The council also comprised aldermen who were elected for a six-year period by the councillors. The local government elections took place in the context of Harold Wilson's Labour UK government struggling with cabinet splits over their plans to join the European Common Market. ==New wards== Two new Cardiff electoral wards of Rhiwbina and Whitchurch were created for this election, following the transfer of these areas from Cardiff Rural. Three councillors were elected for each of these wards at this election, increasing the numbers on Cardiff City Council by six. Because each of the three councillors in every ward stood down for re-election in rotation, the winners of the Rhiwbina/Whitchurch polls would sit for three years before standing down, the second placed candidates would sit for two years and the third- placed candidates would need to stand for re-election in 12 months time. ==Overview of the result== Twenty-three seats in 19 electoral wards were up for election in May 1967. In a \\"landslide election\\" the Conservative Party gained their biggest ever majority on the council, taking 4 seats off the Labour Party, one of the Liberals and winning all six new seats in Rhiwbina and Whitchurch. Gains included the traditionally Labour seat in the South ward, taken by 36 votes. Labour group leader, Alderman Lyons, blamed Independent candidates splitting the Labour vote. The council gained its first ever black councillor, Manuel Delgado, in the Splott ward. It also gained a brother and sister combination, with Trevor Tyrell joining his sister, Bella Brown, in the Canton Ward. Plaid Cymru were fielding a large number of candidates for the first time in Cardiff and polled well in Plasmawr and the two new Rhiwbina/Whitchurch wards. ===Council composition=== Immediately following the election the Conservatives had a majority of 18 on the council, though after aldermanic elections the balance on the city council was expected to be 50 Conservatives and 26 Labour representatives. 11 Conservative aldermen were elected on 22 May, with the two Labour aldermen standing for re-election losing their places. Conservative alderman Layton Lougher was also replaced. ==Ward results== Contests took place in every ward at this election. In most wards one council seat was up for election, but in Rhiwbina and Whitchurch three seats were available. ===Adamsdown=== ===Canton=== ===Cathays=== ===Central=== ===Ely=== ===Gabalfa=== ===Grangetown=== ===Llandaff=== ===Llanishen=== ===Penylan=== ===Plasmawr=== ===Plasnewydd=== Olwen Watkin had won the previous election for the Liberal Party. ===Rhiwbina=== ===Riverside=== ===Roath=== ===Rumney=== ===South=== ===Splott=== Manuel Delgado became Cardiff's first ever black councillor. ===Whitchurch=== * = 'retiring' ward councillor for re-election [a] = vote figure missing from results ==References== Cardiff City Council Category:Council elections in Cardiff Category:1960s in Cardiff ","title":"1967 Cardiff City Council election"},{"id":"61602288","text":"ModicogrylliniOtte D, Alexander RD (1983) Monographs Acad. nat.

(As with Qinghai Lake, the Chinese word for \\"sea\\" is sometimes used to translate the Mongolian naɣur (), which was once used ambiguously for all large bodies of water.) The lake is also known as (\\"Jade Pond of the Queen Mother of the West\\") from an old legendary location in the Kunlun Mountains and sometimes confused with Lake Hala in the Qilian Mountains. ==Geography== Lake Heihai is located about south of the city of Golmud in Golmud County, Haixi Prefecture, Qinghai Province, at an elevation of or above sea level in western China. It lies in a valley roughly long and wide between the Kunlun Mountains (highest elevation about ) to the south and the Burhan Buda (highest elevation about ) to the north. Earthquakes are common, as the lake lies near the major long Kunlun Fault. Covering , it stretches about from east to west and north to south. The deepest point is around below its surface. Two main streams feed into the lake, with a catchment of around . Meltwater flows from two small glaciated areas in the Kunluns. The west is about , the east about ; both appear to have retreated roughly since 1970. The outflow to the east is the source of the Kunlun River, the upper stretch of the Golmud River. With mean annual precipitation of and high evaporation rates, the lake's water is mesohaline. The mean annual temperature is , so much of the surrounding countryside is permafrost alpine grassland, supporting dwarf cinquefoil and winterfat shrubs and sparse sedges and grasses. Polygonum sibiricum occupies moist saline sites close to the lake; drier land further from shore is characterized by Kobresia robusta on the sandier north side and Poa pachyantha on the south side. ==History== During the Pleistocene, sediment from glaciers in the Kunlun temporarily blocked outflow of the valley's main meltwater stream, forming the present lake. Particularly strong winds weathered and shaped the surrounding rocks from 10080,000 years ago. At its maximum extent, an Ice Age glacier filled most of the present valley, which increased its catchment about . At times, probably around 50 kya, 13 kya, and 11.6 kya, Lake Heihai overflowed the present elevation difference to join with the smaller lake to its west, increasing its catchment by another and leaving lacustrine sediments across of now-dry land. During the mid-Holocene, from around 84,000 years ago, the climate was wetter and warmer, possibly from increased influence from the Indian or East Asian monsoon. By the late Holocene, the monsoon was no longer able to reach the lake and its environment became drier and windier again. ==Culture== As the largest present lake in the Kunlun Mountains, it has become identified with the \\"Jade\\" or \\"Turquoise Pond\\" important in various myths involving the Queen Mother of the West. Lake Heihai has a stone temple to the Queen Mother and a large slab reading \\"Xiwangmu Yaochi\\". ==See also== * List of lakes in China ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * . * . * . * . * . * . ==External links== * A map of the Heihai's catchment Heihai ","title":"Lake Heihai"},{"id":"61602334","text":"Subay () is a rural locality (a village) in Sharipovsky Selsoviet, Kushnarenkovsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

As a two- year-old she raced six times, winning one minor race and running third in the Fantasy Stakes. In the following year she developed into a top-class performer in autumn as she took the Shion Stakes and Shuka Sho. As a four-year-old she won the Queen Stakes and the Fuchu Himba Stakes as well as being placed in both the Dubai Turf and the Hong Kong Cup. In 2019 she became the first Japan- trained horse in 19 years to win a major race in the United Kingdom when she won the Nassau Stakes. ==Background== Deirdre is a bay mare with a white blaze and white socks on her hind legs bred in Hokkaido by Northern Farm. As a yearling she was consigned to the 2015 Select Sale and was bought for 22,680,000 JPY by Touji Morita. The filly was sent into training with Mitsuru Hoshida. She was from the third crop of foals sired by Harbinger, a British horse who was rated the best racehorse in the world in 2010 when he won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes by eleven lengths. Since retiring to stud in Japan his other foals have included Blast Onepiece, Mozu Katchan (Queen Elizabeth II Cup) and Persian Knight (Mile Championship). Deirdre's dam Reizend showed very little racing ability, failing to win in four starts but was a half-sister to the dam of Logi Universe, and a granddaughter of the outstanding racemare Sonic Lady. Sonic Lady was not, technically, a Thoroughbred as her female ancestry could not be traced to one of the foundation mares of the breed. She was a product of the half-bred Verdict family, whose ancestry could be traced no further back than an unnamed Perion mare foaled in 1837. So many non-thoroughbreds from this family won major races that the descendants of the Perion mare were admitted to the General Stud Book in 1969 as Half-Bred Family 3. Members of this family include Quashed, Attraction and Sonic Lady's great-grandmother Lucasland, the winner of the July Cup in 1966 ==Racing career== ===2016: two-year-old season=== Deirdre began her track career by running second in a maiden race over 1400 metres at Chukyo Racecourse on 2 July and then finished fourth in a similar event over 1600 metres at the same track three weeks later. After a summer break she returned on 15 October to record her first victory in a maiden over 1400 metres at Niigata Racecourse. The filly was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 for the Fantasy Stakes at Kyoto Racecourse and came home third of the twelve runners, beaten one and a half lengths and a head by Mi Suerte and Show Way. In her two subsequent races that year Deirdre finished fourth in the Shiragiku Sho at Kyoto on 27 November and second in the Tsuwabuki Sho at Chukyo on 17 December. ===2017: three-year-old season=== Deirdre's trainer Mitsuru Hashida Deirdre began her three-year-old season by running third in the Kobushi Sho at Kyoto in February and then finished second to Rising Reason in the Listed Anemone Stakes at Nakayama Racecourse in March. In the Grade 1 Oka Sho at Hanshin Racecourse on 9 April she started at odds of more than 207/1 but exceeded expectations as she produced a strong late run to finish sixth behind Reine Minoru, beaten less than three lengths behind the winner. After winning the Yaguruma Sho at Kyoto on 7 May Deirdre finished fourth to Soul Stirring, Mozu Katchan and Admire Miyabi in the Yushun Himba two weeks later. After a break of over two and a half months Deirdre returned in August with a win in the HTB Sho over 2000 metres at Sapporo Racecourse. At Nakayama on 9 September the filly started favourite for the Grade 3 Shion Stakes, a race which serves as a trial race for the Shuka Sho. Ridden as in most of her previous starts by Yasunari Iwata she came from eleventh place on the final turn to win by a nose from Caribbean Gold with Port Vendres a further nose away in third place. Christophe Lemaire took the ride when Deirdre contested the Grade 1 Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto on 15 October and was made the 5.3/1 third choice in the betting behind Aerolithe (NHK Mile Cup) and Fan Dii Na (Flower Cup). The other fifteen runners included Lys Gracieux (second in the Oka Sho), Mozu Katchan, Rabbit Run (Rose Stakes), Reine Minoru and Caribbean Gold. Deirdre started slowly and raced towards the rear before making progress approaching the final turn. She was angled to the left in the straight and produced a strong late run to take the lead inside the last 100 metres and win by one and a quarter lengths and a nose from Lys Gracieux and Mozu Katchan. After the race Lemaire said \\"I think the filly was in top condition today, she was on her toes in the post parade which just shows how keen she was to go out there and run, and I was quite confident going into this race. Her break wasn't good and we had to race further back than we had hoped but the pace was fast which worked for us and she gave a terrific run in the stretch\\". On her final run of the year Deirdre ended her season in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Kyoto in November in which she was matched against older fillies and mare. She made some late progress but never looked likely to win and came home twelfth of the eighteen runners behind Mozu Katchan. In January 2018, Deirdre finished fourth behind Soul Stirring, Mozu Katchan and Aerolithe in the polling for the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly. In the official Japanese rankings she was rated level with Mozu Katchan, two pounds behind Soul Stirring who was the top-rated three-year-old filly. ===2018: four-year-old season=== On her first run of 2018 Deirdre took on male opposition and came home sixth behind the four-year-old colt Clincher in the Grade 2 Kyoto Kinen over 2200 metres on 11 February. She was then sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Turf over 1800 metres at Meydan Racecourse on 31 March. Starting a 20/1 outsider she raced in mid-division before staying on strongly in the straight to finish third behind Benbatl and Vivlos. On her return to Japan the filly started favourite for the Queen Stakes over 1800 metres at Sapporo on 29 July and produced a strong late run on the outside to win by three lengths from Frontier Queen with Soul Stirring a neck away in third. After a late summer break Deirdre returned to the track for the Grade 2 Fuchu Himba Stakes at Tokyo on 15 October and started the 1.3/1 favourite ahead of ten opponents including Lys Gracieux, Soul Stirring, Jour Polaire (Victoria Mile), Crocosmia (winner of the race in 2017) and Frontier Queen. With Lemaire in the saddle she raced towards the rear of the field before making steady progress in the straight and ran down Lys Gracieux in the final strides to win by a neck. Deirdre ended her season with a trip to Hong Kong to contest the Hong Kong Cup over 2000 metres at Sha Tin Racecourse. Starting the 1.8/1 favourite she kept on well in the straight but went down by a length to the front-running Glorious Forever. In January 2019 Deirdre finished runner-up to Lys Gracieux in the voting to determine the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare at the JRA Awards for 2018. In the official Japanese rankings she was rated level with Aerolithe, one pound behind Lys Gracieux who was the top-rated older female horse. ===2019: five-year-old season=== Deirdre began her fourth season in the Grade 2 Nakayama Kinen over 1800 metres on 24 February when she started favourite but came home sixth of the eleven runners behind Win Bright. After her defeat at Nakayama, the mare embarked on an international campaign. At Meydan in March she ran for the second time in the Dubai Turf and ran fourth to Almond Eye, Vivlos and Lord Glitters. In April at Sha Tin she started a 20/1 outsider for the Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 2000 metres and kept on well without ever looking likely to win to take sixth place, four and a quarter lengths behind the winner Win Bright. In the summer of 2019, Deirdre was sent to race in England. On 19 June at Royal Ascot she started the 33/1 outsider of the eight runners for the Prince of Wales's Stakes and finished sixth behind Crystal Ocean in a race run on soft ground in heavy rain. Mitsura Hoshida commented \\"The rain right before the race really hurt us... She just ran out of gas in the end and it got tough for her... she left everything out there. We couldn’t have asked for more out of her.\\" At Goodwood Racecourse on 1 August Deirdre was partnered by Oisin Murphy when she went off at odds of 20/1 for the Group 1 Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs. She was attempting to become the first horse trained in Japan to win in the United Kingdom since Agnes World won the July Cup in 2000. Her eight opponents included Hermosa, Mehdaayih (Prix de Malleret), Maqsad (Pretty Polly Stakes), Channel (Prix de Diane) Sun Maiden (Hoppings Stakes) and Nyaleti (German 1,000 Guineas). After being restrained towards the rear of the field Deirdre began to make progress on the inside on the final turn but looked unlikely to find a clear passage until the front running Mehdaayih hung left entering the final furlong. The Japanese mare produced a late challenge to take the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a quarter lengths. Her trainer's daughter Seiko Hashida Yoshimura said \\"It was a glorious day and everything just fell right for her. Goodwood is very different to Japanese racecourses, which are usually oval-shaped [but] we were sure that she would like this track and it worked out very well. The quicker ground was another important factor for her today and it is very special to win a Group One event in Britain\\". Murphy commented \\"You can see she is an absolute queen. She is a big, masculine type of a horse and I'm not surprised she was able to carry the 60 kilos which is more than what she is used to\\". Murphy partnered Deirdre in the mare's three remaining races of 2019. In September she was sent to Ireland for the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown and finished fourth behind Magical after a \\"terribly unlucky\\" run which saw her repeatedly blocked as she attempted to obtain a clear run. In the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October she stayed on well in the straight to take third place behind Magical and Addeybb. As in the previous year, Deirdre ended her campaign in Hong Kong where she contested the Hong Kong Vase on 8 December and produced a sustained run from the rear of the field to finish fourth behind Glory Vase, Lucky Lilac and Exultant. ===2020: six-year-old season=== On 29 February Deirdre started as favourite in the first race to be held on the newly-laid turf track at King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh. Ridden by Oisin Murphy, she came a close second to Port Lions. After the race she returned to her base in Newmarket, with trainer Mitsuru Hashidare saying that the ultimate aim of the season was the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Japan Category:Racehorses trained in Japan Category:Thoroughbred family B3 ","title":"Deirdre (horse)"},{"id":"61602546","text":"Río Piedras is a rapid transit station in San Juan agglomeration, Puerto Rico.

It is a Grade I listed building. ==History== By the late 14th century, Thaxted was at the centre of the local cutlery trade. It is thought that the Guild of Cutlers contributed to the cost of the building, which the listed building details prepared in 1967 suggests, was completed between 1390 and 1410. However, dendrochronology indicates that much of the timber used in the building actually dates to the late 15th century. The design made extensive use of jettied timber framing: on the ground floor the building was arcaded to allow markets to be held; the first floor, which jutted out over the pavement on three sides, featured four small gothic windows on each side and the attic floor, which jutted out further, featured two small bay windows on each side. A large oak post was erected in the centre of the market area on the ground floor area to support the structure above. Internally the principal room was the meeting hall on the first floor at the front of the building; at the back of the building was a staircase on the left and a sealed off area known as the \\"old cage\\" on the right. The cage was probably used as a village lock-up as evidenced by its original doorway on the ground floor and the barred window grates on the first floor. The guildhall was used as meeting place for the town which flourished after receiving a charter from Queen Mary I in the mid-16th century but then declined after the charter was rescinded when King James II fell from power in the late 17th century. The building was restored at that time and converted into a school, remaining in that use, as Thaxted Grammar School, until 1878. Further refurbishment work, including timber restoration, was carried out in 1911 and again, as part of European Architectural Heritage Year, in 1975. In 2008 the guildhall was used for a Design Statement Exhibition, which sought local opinions to guide local development. Works of art in the guildhall include a portrait of the prominent British Christian socialist and local priest, the Reverend Conrad Noel, by Frank William Carter. There is also a small museum in the building exhibiting photographs and objects associated with the town and its development over time. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Grade I listed buildings in Essex Category:Thaxted Category:Guildhalls in the United Kingdom Category:Local museums in Essex Category:Timber framed buildings in Essex ","title":"Thaxted Guildhall"},{"id":"61602560","text":"Universidad is a rapid transit station in San Juan agglomeration, Puerto Rico.

The Belgian music site \\"Dansende Beren\\" in a review: \\"Jett Rebel plays a catchy pop song that is the result of a minimalist line-up. However, he makes that minimalism shine, adds his voice to it and you have the recipe for success. On June 8, 2018, Jett Rebel released his second single Good Boy. Two days later, a music video followed. NPO Radio 2 named Good Boy to 5 star track on June 18, 2018 and NPO 3FM makes Good Boy the new 3FM Megahit on June 22, 2018.

Lennart Koster in review for Nieuweplaat felt \\"About 7 we can be brief: Jett Rebel did it. A banger of a record, with which he both returns to the music he made years ago, and manages to surprise.

Funky, rousing rhythms and supple melodies are also reminiscent of Stevie Wonder at times of Songs in the Key of Life. And before you know it you have a record full of references to musical heroes, but one that has nothing of its own. Jett Rebel knows how to avoid that pitfall. He makes a record that is unmistakably his own. The temptation is great to give Jett Rebel a 7, but that would do the record an injustice. 7 is a wonderful, world-class album.\\" The album was in the Dutch Album Top 100 for three weeks, foreign listings are unknown. ==References== Category:Jett Rebel albums Category:2018 albums ","title":"7 (Jett Rebel album)"},{"id":"61602580","text":"The Uasin Gishu people were a community that inhabited a plateau located in western Kenya that today bears their name. They are said to have arisen from the scattering of the Kwavi by the Maasai in the 1830s. They were one of two significant sections of that community that stayed together. The other being the Laikipiak with whom they would later ally against the Maasai. ==c.1830 Origins== According to narratives told to Thompson in 1883, a community referred to as \\"Wa-kwafi\\"(Kwavi) fragmented following a series of misfortunes that befell them \\"about 1830...\\". Thompson notes that the original home of the 'Wa-kwafi' was \\"the large district lying between Kilimanjaro, Ugono and Pare on the west, and Teita, and Usambara on the east. The Kwavi had been attacked by the Maasai while enfeebled by their 'misfortunes', the result being that the community was broken up and scattered to various corners. According to Maasai traditions recorded by MacDonald (1899), in taking over the plateau, the Uasin Gishu conquered a people he referred to as 'Senguer' and almost annihilated this community. ==Uasin Gishu - Siger war== ===Historicity=== According to Maasai tradition, the Uasin Gishu front conquered a group of people who occupied the Uasin Gishu plateau, this community is remembered as Senguer. Other Maasai traditions concur with this assertion, noting that the Loosekelai (i.e Sigerai/Siger) were attacked by an alliance of the Uasin Gishu and Siria communities. Finding congruence with Maasai traditions, are Kalenjin traditions. The Kalenjin occupy the area around Uasin Gishu and according to certain narratives of origin, such as that recorded by Chesaina (1991) they were once attacked by the Uasin Gishu, causing the Kipsigis and Nandi to split. A tale which was recorded by Hollis (1905), starts \\"At a time when the Maai occupied some of the Nandi grazing grounds\\". It is presumed that this was the Uasin Gishu plateau and that Nandi place names on the plateau were superseded by Maasai names. This is evinced by certain \\"Masai place-names in eastern Nandi (i.e Uasin Gishu border) which indicate that the Masai had temporary possession of strip of Nandi roughly five miles wide\\", these include Ndalat, Lolkeringeti, Nduele and Ol-lesos, which were by the early nineteenth century in use by the Nandi as koret (district) names. However, micro-Kalenjin tradition turn the above narratives on their heads. They concur on key points, notably an incoming population and an enfeebled population (in some cases known as Segelai) holding out in what were then dense forests around the plateau. The key difference is that the Kalenjin communities as seen as the incomers. Kipsigis traditions such as those recorded by Orchadson (1927), state that at a time when the Kipsigis and Nandi were a united identity, they moved southwards through country occupied by 'Masai'. Orchadson notes that this was \\"probably the present Uasin Gishu country\\". Here, they accidentally got split in two by a wedge of Masai who Orchadson records as being \\"Uasin Gishu (Masai) living in Kipchoriat (Nyando) valley\\". Accounts from Hollis however refer to a \\"branch called 'L-osigella or Segelli [who] took refuge in the Nyando valley but were wiped out by the Nandi and Lumbwa...It was from them that the Nandi obtained their system of rule by medicine-men. Though seemingly disparate, the totality of these narratives are in congruence with the large scale movement of pastoralists from the plains into the forested areas, assimilation of forest-dwelling communities and wide-spread identity shift. A widespread trend across the region as the Mutai of the 19th-century dragged on. ==Territory== According to Kalenjin and Maasai traditions, the territory of the Uasin Gishu people extended over the Uasin Gishu and Mau plateaus following the conquest of these regions from the 'Senguer' or Siger. This period also saw the fragmentation of Loikop society. ==c.1870 Maasai - Kwavi war== Thompson (1883) noted that the 'Wa-kwafi' of Guas'Ngishu and those of Lykipia allied together to make war on the Maasai. He was advised that this was about fifteen years before then i.e c.1870. Hollis in his account of the Maasai recorded similar narratives occurring about the same time. He notes \\"that about 1850 the Turkana drove the most westerly branch of the Masai from the west, to the south of (Lake Turkana)\\". He states that \\"somewhere about the same period - at the time an old man can remember according to the native expression - the Masai dwelling on the Uasin Gishu plateau attacked those of Naivasha\\". The Maasai of Naivasha would later ally with those of Kilimanjaro. ===Assimilation of Laikipiak=== According to Thompson's account the war lasted several years, during which time famine came upon the 'Wa-kwafi' causing large numbers to move to Njemps and Nyiro. \\"Only a remnant of the Wa-kwafi of Lykipia were left, and these contrived to make peace\\". ===Annihilation of Kwavi identity=== Thompson states, that following the extinction of Laikipiak identity, \\"The Masai swept from north to south, and left not a man in the entire land, those who escaped the spear and sword finding refuge in Kavirondo\\". MacDonald's portrayal of the force of attack parallels Thompson's account, ==Diaspora== MacDonald noted that the survivors of this conflict were at that time scattered remnants in 'Nandi, Kavirondo or Ketosh'. Thompson (1883) noted that there was a district of Masai country known as Guas' Ngishu. ==Legacy== The conflicts between the Guas' Ngishu/Masai and Wakwafi form much of the literature of what are now known as the Iloikop wars. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Kenya ","title":"Uasin Gishu people"},{"id":"61602593","text":"Lissemys ceylonensis, the Sri Lankan flapshell turtle, is a freshwater species of turtle endemic to Sri Lanka. ==References== ==External links== Category:Lissemys Category:Reptiles of Sri Lanka Category:Reptiles described in 1856 ","title":"Lissemys ceylonensis"},{"id":"61602607","text":"Sky Crime is a British pay television channel owned and operated by Sky, a division of Comcast.

The complex is from 1803 and consists of a building facing the street as well as a warehouse in the courtyard. Both buildings were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1989. The warehouse stands on a three-storey brick cellar which from its construction in the middle of the 19th century and up until the 1930s was used for the storage of first butter and then cheese. A restaurant and a commercial art gallery are now based in the ground floors of the two buildings. ==History== The origins of the name is unknown but it is probably derived from the German surname Krebs and refers to an owner in the 17th century or earlier. The building was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 and the site was then left empty for eight years. The current building at the site was constructed in 1803 for Marthe Kirstine Obel, a widow who ran a game monger on Gammeltorv. Her tenants included captain lieutenant M. Bille and military auditor A. Hjelm with family. By 1809, Obel had sold the property to a string merchant named Lange. 10 years later the property had changed hands again and was now owned by timber merchant J. F. Faber. The property was by 1825 owned by his widow and all her tenants seems to have been women. dolph Erichsen, a flour and grain dealer from Skindergade, purchased Krebsegården from Mrs. Faber in 1858 and his own home was from then on located on the first floor. The property was in 1876 ceded to a farmer, probably as security for the grain dealer's debts, but he sold it again a few months later. The new owner was merchant Johan Poulsen. He sold it to a police officer in 1889 The ground floor was over the decades home to various grocery stores, a taylor, a horse meat outlet and a coffee dealer. The three-storey cellar under the warehouse was for decades used for the storage of butter by H. A. Jersin while the office of his butter wholesale business was located on the first floor of the building fronting the street. In 1897, it was acquired by Ferdinand Olsen, the manager of the Rasmussen brother's furniture shop in the building, who had himself been a tenant in the complex for some time. H. A. Jersin's office relocated to the warehouse and the apartment on the first floor of the main wing was instead taken over by Olsen for his personal use. The three-storey cellar under the warehouse was later taken over by Emil Jacobsen and up until the 1940s used for the storage of cheese. The Olsen family would own the property for more than eighty years. Bernard Olsen and Oda B. Olsen had no children and Oda B. Olsen left the property to their relatives Ida Kingsted and her husband Ole Ole Kongsted. Ida Kongsted had lived in the apartment on the second floor since 1973. Olsen's furniture rental service was based in the ground floor of the building until 1955. The prmises were then taken over by a record store, Intona, and then in 1961 by B. Anthony's antiquarian book store Rådhusantikvariatet. The name of the book shop was in 1975 changed to Byens Antikvariat by Richard Sørensen. Byens Antikvariat was later succeeded by an antique shop and then by a fashion shop.

The church is built sometime between the 12th and 14th centuries, but reflects an earlier Georgian practice by having a semi-open aisle—an ambulatory—terminating in an apse to the east of the main nave of the building. The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. == Location == The church of the Prophet Jonah is situated in the village of Ienashi, at 1360 m above sea level, in the Latali territorial unit of the Mestia Municipality, at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus. This part of Svaneti was known as Free Svaneti in the 19th century. There are no contemporary literary sources on the construction and history of Ienashi. The church and the items preserved in it were first described, in greatest details, by the scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili during his expedition to Svaneti in 1910. == Layout == Eastern façade. The Ienashi church is built of evenly cut limestone blocks. It is a hall church, with an ambulatory running on three sides and terminating in an apse on the east. The interior is divided up into bays by a pair of two-step pilasters which support a vaulted arch. The church is lit by windows cut in the sanctuary apse and central west wall; a window in the south wall is blocked by an outer annex attached to the wall. Arched niches flank the window in the apse. There are two doors, on the south and west. The church has two annexes, both arched in the interior and covered with architraves on the exterior. The façades are scarcely decorated in stonework. The building is based on a two-step socle and crowned by a pronounced cornice. The interior is adorned with a series of frescoes, but they are heavily damaged. The style of the paintings is a local take on the late Byzantine Palaeologan art. Depicted are the Savior, the cross of Golgotha, David, Solomon, Jonah and the whale, the saints Peter and Paul, the Church Fathers, and an unidentified royal person, probably Constantine I of Imereti (). The church formerly housed many unique items; some of them were lost in a series of burglaries, others were recovered and removed for safekeeping to the Svaneti Museum of History and Ethnography in Mestia. Among these items were the Ienashi Gospel book—a 13th- century illuminated Georgian manuscript—as well the icons with gilded and silver elements, such those of the Savior and the saints George and Theodore, and precious metal crosses, one being an Italian import of the 13th–14th century. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:14th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Svaneti ","title":"Ienashi church"},{"id":"61602930","text":"Josef Kahl (31 March 1913 - 23 February 1942) was a Czech ski jumper.

The DMZ was administered by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and their military councils and enforced by United States Armed Forces and Turkish Armed Forces personnel. The buffer zone collapsed in early October 2019, before it was fully implemented, when Turkey dismissed the agreement on 1 October and the United States abandoned the effort on 6 October after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria, allowing for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's planned ground incursion into the region. The subsequent Turkish offensive on 9 October rendered the buffer zone fully obsolete. The failed Turkish-U.S. arrangement was replaced on 22 October 2019 with the separate Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone, negotiated between Russia, Turkey and the Syrian government. == Background == SDF-controlled territory (green) and Turkish-controlled territory (red) The Syrian Democratic Forces are an armed participant in the Syrian Civil War and serve as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. The SDF is composed of numerous groups, most prominent among them being the YPG and YPJ and their political branch, the PYD, which Turkey considers a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organization which Turkey considers a terrorist group and with which it has engaged in armed conflict since the breakdown of peace negotiations in 2015. For this reason, Turkey views the entire SDF as nothing more than an extension of the PKK. This has led Turkey to intervene twice against the group, first by invading Northern Syria to prevent the linking of SDF-held areas and later by starting a full-scale attack against the SDF in Afrin. As a result of the Turkish operations, Turkey has established an occupation zone in northern Syria, which was made the target of an SDF insurgency. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has frequently expressed a desire to forcefully remove the SDF from the Syrian-Turkish border. On the other hand, the SDF became one of the United States' main Syrian partners in the military intervention against ISIL, leading to U.S. troops being stationed along SDF-held territories, thus preventing a Turkish invasion. At the same time, US President Donald Trump has expressed his intention to disengage from the Syrian Civil War, initially ordering all US personnel in Syria to be withdrawn, before later deciding to leave a small contingent, at the behest of his military advisors. Nonetheless, the US is keen on maintaining good relations with Turkey, which had by that point already been strained by the refusal of the US to extradite Turkish dissident Fethullah Gülen (whom Turkey accuses of masterminding the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt) and the Turkish purchase of S-400 missile systems from Russia, as Turkey is considered NATO's key member in the Middle East. US and Turkish forces conduct a joint patrol outside left The US and Turkey had previously clashed diplomatically over the issue of the SDF-held city of Manbij, with Turkey wanting to purge the city of the YPG units stationed there. The result was a 'Manbij Roadmap' being agreed to by Turkey and the US, which would eventually entail a YPG withdrawal from the city. The roadmap, however, was never implemented and the YPG never withdrew. Turkey accused the US of dragging its feet and sabotaging the implementation of the roadmap, vowing to never enter into a similar deal in the future. Relations between Turkey and the SDF became increasingly hostile in mid 2019, with the SDF joining forces with the Syrian Government to repel a Turkish-opposition military operation near Tell Rifaat. The deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, Michael Mulroy said at the Council on Foreign Relations that the United States cannot carry out its strategy in Syria without partners such as the mostly Kurdish SDF, who \\"bore most of the burden in destroying the Islamic State's caliphate\\". He said that the United States must not leave before stabilizing the area. \\"And if we don't do that, we will be back there, for sure, doing this again,\\" Mulroy said. \\"We owe it to the people that live there, who have beared unspeakable burdens, and we owe it to the men and women that are going to come after us at the State Department, at the Defense Department, that we don't just leave this undone.\\" == Negotiation process == === Preliminary negotiations and initial failure === During summer of 2019, the Turkish president announced that Turkey could \\"no longer wait\\" and would not tolerate continued SDF presence on the Turkish-Syrian border. He stated that if the US did not agree to a deal that would remove the SDF from those areas, Turkey would unilaterally launch a full-scale invasion against SDF-held territories east of the Euphrates river, establishing a Turkish- occupied \\"security zone\\" along the border - something that US leadership viewed as \\"unacceptable\\". With the Turkish army massing along the border, the Trump Administration decided to enter into negotiations with Turkey over establishing a \\"safe zone\\", which would fundamentally address the SDF presence in Northern Syria. The two sides initially failed to make any headway, with the US initially offering a -deep zone under joint US-Turkish control, while Turkey demanded a -deep zone under sole Turkish control. === Deal reached === On 7 August 2019, Turkey said it reached a framework deal with the United States, that would prevent a unilateral Turkish invasion of northern Syria. The initial first steps reportedly included the creation of a 'joint operations centre', which would coordinate the establishment of a \\"peace corridor\\" along the Syrian side of the Syrian-Turkish border, while still leaving details about the size and scope of the \\"peace corridor\\" undefined and ambiguous. == Terms of the agreement == Map of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, between which the buffer zone was established in northern Syria In mid August 2019, the head of the Syrian Democratic Forces revealed that the two sides had agreed on the specifics of the safe zone deal. They were listed as follows: * A buffer zone (also referred to as \\"safe zone\\" or \\"peace corridor\\" by some parties) would be established in the areas between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (notably excluding the Manbij area) in Northern Syria, totaling in about 115 km of the border between the two countries. * The zone would be deep in most areas, while in a few limited areas would be expanded to deep. The expanded part of the zone would be located between the towns Serêkanî and Tell Abyad. The 14 km portion of the zone may be extended by in the last stage of the implementation of the deal, reaching at its deepest point and being designated as a \\"security belt\\". Within the \\"security belt\\" regular SDF (including YPG and YPJ) units would be allowed to remain in their positions, but would have to withdraw all heavy weapons. No hostile actions or acts of aggression would be permitted within the buffer zone. * YPG and YPJ forces would withdraw from the 5-9-14 km area of the buffer zone entirely, leaving the areas they withdraw from under the military control of the SDF military councils and the civil control of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (the latter of which represents a confirmation of the status quo). * Turkish reconnaissance aircraft would be allowed to monitor the zone, but Turkish warplanes would not be allowed to enter and no airstrikes would take place. * The SDF would dismantle the border fortifications it has constructed along the Syrian-Turkish border. * The US and Turkey would conduct joint military patrols along the buffer zone, but would not occupy territory. Separate Turkish patrols would not be permitted. * The joint US-Turkish operations center would oversee the implementation of the deal and coordinate actions between the two parties. * Some of the Syrian refugees currently housed in Turkey would start to be relocated to the areas within the zone. *Turkey would refrain from any incursions into Northern Syria. *Turkey would not establish any observation posts in Northern Syria, as it had done in Idlib. All observation posts would have to be built on the territory of the Republic of Turkey. The SDF later clarified that the majority of the zone would include rural areas and military positions, but not cities and towns. == Implementation timeline == On 14 August 2019, Turkish observation drones began surveillance flights over the buffer zone. Syrian Democratic Forces dismantling border fortifications in northern Syria under the supervision of U.S. soldiers, 22 August 2019 On 22 August, the SDF began dismantling border fortifications along the Syrian-Turkish border under U.S. supervision. On 24 August, Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar reported that the U.S.-Turkish combined joint operations center (CJOC) was fully operational, adding that joint helicopter flights would begin that same day. *The first joint U.S.-Turkish helicopter flight took place, with two generals, one from the U.S. Army and one from the Turkish army, flying on the same helicopter. On 26 August, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that joint U.S.-Turkish patrols within the zone would begin \\"soon\\". === Planned SDF withdrawal begins === On 27 August, the first stage of the planned Kurdish withdrawal came into effect, with YPG units leaving their positions and withdrawing along with their weapons from Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. On 31 August, Turkish president Erdoğan threatened that Turkey would \\"implement its own plans\\" if Turkish soldiers are not allowed to control the buffer zone in Northern Syria within two or three weeks. On 4 September, the SDF's Ras al-Ayn military council (composed of local fighters loyal to the SDF) began joint patrols with U.S. personnel around the town, following the withdrawal of regular SDF units from the area a week prior. *Turkish president Erdogan described the buffer zone as \\"nothing more than a name\\". Despite Erdogan's statement, his spokesman stated that Turkey had already completed its preparations for the implementation of the \\"U.S.-Turkish joint operational plan\\". *An SDF executive council co-chair stated that the buffer zone had gone off to a \\"good start,\\" but insisted that Turkey must withdraw its troops from the border before \\"calm could prevail\\". On 5 September, U.S. and Turkish helicopters conducted a third round of joint aerial reconnaissance patrols within the buffer zone. *The Turkish president expressed his desire to resettle one million refugees (out of the 3.6 million residing in Turkey at that point) within the buffer zone. He accused the international community, namely the European Union, of not providing help with the refugee burden. He threatened to \\"open the gates\\", implying to let all of the refugees freely emigrate, if Turkey did not receive support for its plans in the buffer zone. He then demanded that joint U.S.-Turkish (ground) patrols within the zone begin by the last week of September. On 6 September, Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar announced that joint U.S.-Turkish ground patrols within the zone were due to begin on Sunday, 8 September. === Joint ground patrols begin === The first U.S.-Turkish joint ground patrol as part of the Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement On 8 September, Turkish and United States Armed Forces personnel conducted their first joint ground patrol starting from the perimeter of Tell Abyad, close to the Turkish town of Akçakale.Turkey, US begin ‘safe zone’ joint patrols in north Syria Six Turkish armored vehicles were involved in the patrol, along with several American armored vehicles, with the U.S. vehicles leading the way. The patrol headed to a Kurdish- controlled base to inspect it and to ensure that trenches and sand berms had been removed. *The Syrian government vehemently condemned the initiation of joint patrols, stating that it viewed them as representing a flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. *The Turkish President expressed dissatisfaction with the buffer zone, accusing the United States of creating the buffer zone for the benefit of the YPG, instead of Turkey. On 10 September, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu accused the United States of \\"stalling\\" the implementation of the zone and reasserted the threat that Turkey would unilaterally invade Northern Syria, if it deemed it necessary. He further demanded that the safe zone be expanded to 32 km, rather than the 5-9-14 model being implemented at that point by the U.S. and SDF. On 12 September, the U.S. military was reported as considering the proposition of sending about 150 additional troops to Northern Syria in an attempt to \\"reduce tensions\\" between the SDF and Turkey. A Pentagon spokesman however stated that the U.S. \\"posture\\" in Syria would remain \\"unchanged\\". On 18 September, Turkish president Erdogan stated Turkey was seeking to settle 2 to 3 million refugees within the border zone (up from one million from his 5 September statement). He reiterated the repeated Turkish threat to \\"implement [Turkey's] own plans\\" if he deemed that \\"no results [had] come\\" from the deal in two weeks. On 19 September, the U.S. military was reported to have continued arming YPG forces, despite repeated Turkish objections. The United States Department of Defense confirmed that it was continuing to supply \\"tailored\\" arms and vehicles to the Syrian Democratic Forces in general, stating that it was providing monthly reports to Turkey as to what arms and vehicles were sent to the group. On 24 September, U.S. and Turkish troops conducted their second joint ground patrol within the buffer zone. * Two Turkish Air Force F-16 jets were allowed to peacefully fly over the buffer zone area within the framework of the U.S.-led Operation Inherent Resolve. * Turkish president Erdogan spoke before the United Nations General Assembly, stating that 3 million Syrian refugees could be resettled within the buffer zone, if it is extended all the way to Raqqa and the Syrian Government- held city of Deir ez-Zor. He also held up a map, which depicted a deep \\"safety corridor\\" in Northern Syria - reiterating the Turkish demand for an immediate extension of the buffer zone up to 30 km. ** The Syrian Democratic Forces denounced the Turkish President's statement, considering his proposed relocation plan for 3 million refugees as a form of demographic war and 'ethnic cleansing'. === Turkey dismisses Buffer Zone, threatens invasion === On 1 October, the Turkish-imposed deadline for the fulfillment of Turkish demands expired without satisfaction, casting uncertainty on the future of the Buffer Zone and leaving the region once more under threat of a Turkish incursion. On 5 October, the Turkish President warned that a full-scale Turkish invasion of Northern Syria could start that same or following day, after defining the joint U.S.-Turkish ground and air patrols as \\"a fairy tale\\". He further stated that the Turkish military had already prepared for the attack and had received plans for the invasion. * Rojava officials warned that any such attack could risk the re-emergence of ISIL, as SDF units would have to leave their garrisons in the recently secured former ISIL strongholds in order to face the invasion. At the same time, SDF officials warned that they would \\"not hesitate to turn any unprovoked attack by Turkey into an all- out war on the entire border and defend our people\\". * United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper gave an ambiguous statement on the Turkish threat, stating that the United States was \\"working to make the security mechanism functional\\". * U.S.-led coalition jets intensively overflew the Syria-Turkish border, while SDF units were reported to have started constructing new trenches and fortifications south of the border in anticipation of an attack after having previously demolished its own fortifications along the border as part of the Buffer Zone deal. Meanwhile, the SDF military councils along the entire border were placed on alert and began preparing to resist Turkish forces. === U.S. forces withdraw, SDF pledges to fight === On 7 October, a White House Office press statement noted that Turkey would be \\"moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria\\" and declared that while U.S. forces would not support the operation, they would withdraw from the area and permit it to take place. The statement reportedly suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump approved of the Turkish offensive after Turkish President Erdogan assured him that Turkey would take over the detention of ISIL prisoners held in SDF captivity. Trump's sudden approval of a Turkish incursion was seen as a reversal of the objectives of the Buffer Zone agreement and was received controversially within the United States. Spokesmen of the SDF said the U.S. move was a \\"stab in the back\\" and asserted that the SDF would \\"defend north-east Syria at all costs\\". Following the announcement of his approval of a Turkish operation, Trump tweeted a threat to Erdogan in which he stated that if Turkey took any action that he, in what he considered to be his \\"great and unmatched wisdom\\", deemed \\"off limits\\", he would \\"totally destroy and obliterate\\" the Turkish economy. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham stated he would \\"introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria\\". Graham said he would also \\"call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate\\". The SDF sent a large number of reinforcements from Raqqa and northern Deir ez-Zor toward the Syrian-Turkish border, particularly around the areas of Ras al-Ayn and Tell Abyad. Several thousand residents of the SDF-held city of Kobanî came out in a demonstration against Turkish threats. On 8 October, SDF officials expressed their intentions to negotiate with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a deal that could see the entry of Syrian Army units into SDF-held territories, which they hope would forestall the planned Turkish invasion. Syria's Foreign Minister urged Kurdish forces to hand over several areas controlled by them to the Syrian Government, stating that should they refuse to do so, they would be faced with \\"abyss\\" in the face of Turkey. Masoud Barzani, senior politician in Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government, urged Russia to intervene in the crisis in order to prevent \\"further suffering and pain of the Kurdish people in Syria\\". === End of demilitarization and beginning of Turkish offensive === On 9 October, Turkish President Erdogan announced that the offensive against the SDF, Operation Peace Spring, had begun. * The Syrian Government strongly condemned the Turkish operation, accusing Turkey of \\"disgracefully\\" violating international law, as well as Syria's territorial integrity. * The Syrian Democratic Forces urged the international community to implement a no-fly zone over Northern Syria, in order to prevent \\"an imminent humanitarian crisis\\". == Analysis == The Kurdish Rudaw Media Network asserted that Turkey does not have a pressing \\"security concern\\" for a buffer zone at all, noting that Turkey had managed to successfully prevent any border crossings during the Siege of Kobanî without the need for a buffer zone. The Turkish Ahval agency reported that joint US- Turkish patrols suggested that the United States was \\"submitting\\" to Turkish demands and thus providing Turkey an 'entrée' into even more demands. The Central Asia-Caucasus Institute's Turkey Analyst publication reported that Turkish authorities may view the buffer zone as a way to \\"move beyond Kobanî\\" and restart the by that point highly troubled US- Turkey relations, while giving political leverage to US President Donald Trump to continue delaying the implementation of US congress-mandated sanctions against Turkey, which were voted in due to the Turkish purchase of S-400 missile systems from Russia. The conservative US Washington Examiner described the establishment of the buffer zone as \\"appeasement\\", which it dubbed \\"a terrible idea\\". The publication described Turkish intelligence as \\"deeply flawed and politicised\\", claimed that members of Turkish President Erdogan's family and even Erdogan himself might have \\"supported\\" both ISIL and Al-Qaeda and asserted that Turkey's previous incursion into Northern Syria had ended in \\"anti-Kurdish ethnic cleansing\\". The Israeli Jerusalem Post newspaper described the establishment of the buffer zone due to Turkish threats as a \\"rewriting of international law\\", which implicitly recognized a \\"right to invade\\" and would have great implications for other world conflicts by allowing militarily powerful nations to unilaterally assert themselves over weaker ones. == Russian-Turkish buffer zone == On 22 October, the Turkish and Russian presidents met and reached a deal aimed at concluding the Turkish offensive, based in part on the first buffer zone deal, but with significant changes and excluding the United States. == Reactions == === National === * — The Syrian Government strongly condemned and categorically rejected the deal, dubbing it a \\"blatant attack\\" on the nation's national sovereignty, as well as a violation of international law. * — Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu warned that Turkey would not allow the plans for the implementation of the buffer zone to \\"stall\\" and cautioned that Turkey would not tolerate a repetition of the unenforced Manbij roadmap. Cavusoglu further pleged to clear the buffer zone of \\"YPG terrorists\\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan expressed dissatisfaction with the size, scope and implementation timeline of the deal numerous times and has threatened to void the agreement, as well as allow free refugee migration to Europe, if the deal's terms are not altered and interpreted more in line with Turkey's vision for the zone. * — The US embassy in Turkey released a statement, in which it noted that US and Turkish military delegations had met and agreed to work together to address Turkey's 'security concerns'. * - Russia warned of what it deemed were efforts to divide northeastern Syria and added that any legitimate agreement would require the approval of the Syrian Government. Russia urged dialogue between the Syrian Government and Rojava as a means to prevent the partition of Syria. However, several weeks later, during a visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his support for a buffer zone in principle, stating that Turkey had been shouldering a \\"huge refugee load\\" and had \\"legitimate concerns\\" over the security of its southern borders. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented that Russia \\"always supports\\" de-escalation agreements, but insisted that all such agreements \\"respect Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the rights of the Arab tribes, traditionally living around the Euphrates.\\" * - Iran condemned the agreement, considering it a \\"provocative and worrying step\\", which it deemed to violate the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. * - Shortly before joint US-Turkish ground patrols within the zone were due to begin, Denmark announced that it would be sending Danish army troops and medical personnel to SDF-held areas in Northern Syria, in what the Danish Government dubbed a move assist SDF and 'residual' U.S. forces in their fight against ISIL. The United States Department of Defense welcomed this announcement. === Non-state groups and organizations === * Syrian Democratic Forces — The SDF announced support for the deal, stating that they were ready to support its implementation and would \\"strike to ensure the success of efforts towards implementing the understanding ... with the Turkish state\\". At the same time, the co-chair of the foreign relations department at the Syrian Democratic Council has stated that the SDF would not tolerate any advance of Turkish troops, nor of their allied armed groups. * - The Syrian opposition, of which Turkey is one of the largest backers, supported the Turkish position by demanding that the safe zone be expanded to between . The opposition Syrian Interim Government aspired to one day control the zone, stating that they had three files of 120 pages each, which documented a plan to govern the zone, should they somehow come to occupy it at some point in the future. == See also == * American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War * Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War * Turkish occupation of northern Syria * 2018 Idlib demilitarization * 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria * Syrian peace process == Notes == == References == == External links == * Category:Syrian Civil War Category:2019 in Syria Category:August 2019 events in Syria Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2019 Category:Politics of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria Category:Syrian Democratic Forces Category:Syrian Kurdistan Category:Demilitarized zones Category:Aleppo Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Raqqa Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Al-Hasakah Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Syria–Turkey relations Category:Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War ","title":"Northern Syria Buffer Zone"},{"id":"61603048","text":"Nils Hjelmström (29 August 1915 - 17 October 2003) was a Swedish ski jumper.

Bright was born in Queen's Square, Bristol on 18 January 1784. He was the oldest son of Richard Bright (1754–1840), a merchant and banker in Bristol, and Sarah , and the older brother of the physician Richard Bright, who described Bright's disease. His grandfather was Henry Bright (1715–1777), a Bristol merchant active in the Jamaican slave trade, Mayor of Bristol in 1771–72. He was educated at Reading School and Peterhouse, Cambridge (admitted 1801, graduated B.A. 1807, M.A. 1810) and elected to a fellowship at Peterhouse in 1810. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1804, he was called to the bar in 1810, practising as a barrister on the western circuit. Elected MP for Bristol in 1820 as a Whig in the West India Interest, Bright generally opposed the Tory government of Lord Liverpool. However, he was mindful of constituency considerations, and in May 1820 supported the Western Union Canal bill as \\"eminently advantageous\\". The Slave Trade Act 1807 had outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire, but had not abolished slavery. The attitude of Bright's constituents in Bristol is characterised by an anonymous pamphlet letter addressed to Bright in 1823, which argued against the immediate abolition of slavery. Bright was a member of the West India Committee, and of a committee formed in 1823 to resist moves towards emancipation. He complained of \\"gross exaggerations\\" in the Southwark anti- slavery petition. After the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, in 1836, Bright collected slave compensation for Edward Smith of the Haughton Pen Estate in Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica. He was re-elected in 1826 but stood down in 1830, being \\"tired of it and the expense\\". He succeeded to his father's estates in Herefordshire and Hampshire in 1840, inheriting also a one-fifth share of the Jamaican property and a one-seventh share of the residue.

In April 1799 extra ballast (in the form of 200 pieces of ballast iron) was bought and added to the Hvide Ørn to make the ship stiffer in handling. On 29 April a storm in Livorno harbour saw the ship driven ashore. The damage was repaired under van der Osten's professional supervision. As Captain Kaas' health improved slightly and then deteriorated he was replaced as captain by van Osten on 14 August 1799 and travelled back to Denmark with Triton. Hans Kaas died as Triton arrived back in Copenhagen on 5 October 1799. *Jan David van der Osten , captain, took command of Hvide Ørn in July 1799 when the previous captain, H M Kaas, took sick leave. His last report before leaving Livorno on 23 December 1799 was that the ship was in good order and the crew all well.Topsøe-Jensen Vol 2 page 281 *Johan HohlenbergTopsøe-Jensen Vol 1 page 587, junior lieutenant, younger brother of the ship's designer, went down with the ship. *Other officers lost with the ship were Robert Ferdinand Moltke Lynch, senior lieutenant,Topsøe-Jensen Vol 2 p126 Jacob Meyer, second in command, Topsøe-Jensen Vol 2 p180 and Joost von Hemmert, senior lieutenant.Topsøe-Jensen Vol 1 page 563 ==Loss== The ship left Livorno on 26 December 1799 and disappeared on the night of 29/30 December in a hurricane force storm 18 Danish miles (One Danish mile = 7.532 Km) west of Corsica.This reference gives two near-contemporary references to the loss.

She Was in a relationship with lawyer, then mayor of Dunkirk Charles Valantin. Together they formed an unorthodox couple for that period of time; lived together without being married. == Biography == Born in Catillon-sur- Sambre (Nord Department), Démarez had a quite modest background, coming from a below middle-class family of textile workers living in a hamlet. She obtains her first diploma from the hamlet's own primary school in August 1890.Tourisme Cambrésis, cité dans la bibliographie She quits school to follow her parents' path as textile workers but later, she finds out that she is able to go back to school so she takes her chances.Démarez (Olympe), Le Cateau-Cambrésis, (1878–1964) – Profession libérale – Avocate », dans Bernard Schaeffer, Dictionnaire des Femmes du Nord, Publi-Nord, 2003, p.162-164. In 1898 Démarez is 20 years old, it is also the year of her debut in teaching. She starts working 180 kilometers away from her birthplace, which is rather out of ordinary considering the place and time and the difficulty to travel. She starts working as a school teacher first in Petit-Fort-Philippe (Graveline's hamlet) from 1898 to 1901 and then in Dunkirk from 1902 to 1908. At the age of 30, she quits teaching and the security that comes with the teacher profession, following her inclination for studying law, while these studies were just opening for the female students and even though they had the right to study it wasn't easy to find other female students. To support herself and to finance her studies, she starts working as a secretary at the office of Charles Valentin, a young 27 years old lawyer, recently registered at the Dunkirk bar association.Christian Vincent, « Olympe Desmarez, première avocate du Nord », dans Cent ans de vie dans la région, Tome 1 ː 1900–1914, La Voix du Nord éditions, 17 November 1998, p.85 After obtaining her associate's degree in law, in 1913 she obtains her bachelor's degree from law school. Her relationship with Charles Valentin evolves ː he is no longer just his employer but also her lover and her companion. Despite this cohabitation lifestyle, which is not really common in their bourgeois entourage, the couple is very honorably respected in Flanders. On 20 September 1939, Charles Valentin was victim of a serious traffic accident in the Lille suburbs. Despite the care of Oscar Lambret, a prominent Lille surgeon, his condition worsened. Olympe Démarez then asked the deputy mayor of Lille Charles Saint-Venant to marry them. Her husband died shortly after the ceremony. The motivations of the two spouses are not known, but it is possible to suppose the will of Olympe Démarez to remain faithful to this man by bearing his name and the will of Charles Valentin to secure the future of the woman who gave him all during their 25 years of companionship allowing her officially as his wife, to inherit from her husband. During WWII Démarez goes back to her hometown and takes care of the refugee children. After the French Liberation, Dunkirk's mayor engages her to reorganize the city's archives. Women acquired the right to vote in 1944, and voted for the first time in the municipal elections of April 1945 (Women's right to vote). Olympe Démarez-Valentin, widow of the former mayor, becomes the first woman to be elected to the municipal council of Dunkirk at the end of these first elections open to women, which means being able to vote and to be able to get elected. Which was great for Démarez to get elected at the first opportunity. She continued to participate in public meetings ant to the events organized by her political family during ceremonies of homage to her husband on the anniversary of his death. Démarez died on 5 September 1964 at the age of 86. == Career == Démarez started to work as a school teacher first in Petit-Fort-Philippe (Graveline's hamlet) from 1898 to 1901 and then in Dunkirk from 1902 to 1908. It was 2 February 1914, before the Douai Court of Appeal, Démarez was declared officially a lawyer, 14 years after Jeanne Chauvin first female lawyer in France. After Démarez there wasn't any other (new) female lawyer in France until 1920. But because of the close encounter of the \\"great war\\" one does not find its trace then on any table of the bar association of the jurisdiction of the Court. It is therefore only after the end of hostilities, on 17 November 1920, that a new applicant will appear in the name of Adrienne Gobert who will enter the bar of Lille, however never exercise the profession. Démarez had to put her law career aside to help his companion's political agenda to defend his cause but she prepares all the paper work single handedly. She started later working at the town hall to reorganize the archives before saying goodbye to a career well-served and a lifetime of achievement. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1964 deaths Category:20th-century French women lawyers Category:20th- century French lawyers Category:People from Nord (French department) Category:French city councillors Category:20th-century French women politicians Category:20th-century French politicians Category:Women city councillors ","title":"Olympe Démarez"},{"id":"61603540","text":"Ford Lake is a fresh water artificial reservoir located in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The lake was created from the construction of Ford Lake Dam (originally known as Rawsonville Dam) along the Huron River in the early 1930s. The lake is named after business magnate Henry Ford. The lake covers an area of and has a maximum depth of near the eastern end. The lake continues the flow of the Huron River, beginning approximately at the Interstate 94 bridge crossing in the city of Ypsilanti and ends at Ford Lake Dam along Bridge Road in Ypsilanti Township. A short distance after the Ford Lake Dam, the Huron River continues into Belleville Lake, which itself is a reservoir created by the French Landing Dam and Powerhouse. ==Recreation== Ford Lake is a recreational site for boating, personal watercrafts, canoeing/kayaking, and fishing. Portions of the Border-to-Border Trail run along Ford Lake and are popular among bicyclists. There are four public lakeshore parks within Ypsilanti Township: Ford Lake Park, Huron River Park, Loonfeather Point Park, and North Bay Park. The only boat launch for motorized vessels on the lake is within Ford Lake Park. Common fish within Ford Lake include bullhead catfish, channel catfish, common carp, crappies, northern pike, smallmouth bass, suckers, sunfish, bluegill, walleye, white bass, and yellow perch. The lake was once used by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to stock various fish, including tiger muskellunge, which are no longer present in Ford Lake. The largest fish caught in Ford Lake is a common carp recorded in the state's Master Angler Entries at 36.25 inches (97.08 cm) long. ==Health concerns== \\"Do not eat the fish\\" advisory posting along North Bay Park Ford Lake often experiences algal blooms late in the summer, which must be frequently tested to determine their level of toxicity. The Washtenaw County Health Department and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services monitors the water quality and issues advisories when the bacteria levels in the water may pose a health threat. Most algal blooms are green algae and pose no threat, but accumulating cyanobacteria and perfluorooctanesulfonatecan (PFOS) can result in harmful algal blooms that can have negative health affects. When this bacteria is present, prolonged contact with the water is not advised, although occasional contact with PFOS is not considered a health concern. Regardless of water quality, swimming is not a common recreational activity on the lake. When algae levels reach a high enough level to pose a threat, a \\"Do Not Eat\\" fish advisory is issued and posted at all access points along Ford Lake. Boating and fishing are still allowed, but fishermen are advised to catch and release only. ==References== Category:Bodies of water of Washtenaw County, Michigan Category:Reservoirs in Michigan Category:Ypsilanti, Michigan ","title":"Ford Lake (Michigan)"},{"id":"61603541","text":"Robert Gore (1810 – 4 August 1854) was an Irish Whig politician and naval officer.

It became fully operational on October 23, 2003 in BBN's laboratories, and in June 2004 was fielded through dark fiber under the streets of Cambridge and Boston, where it ran continuously for over 3 years.\\"The DARPA Quantum Network\\", Chip Elliott, December 2004. The project also created and fielded the world's first superconducting nanowire single- photon detector. It was sponsored by DARPA as part of the QuIST program,DARPA Quantum Key Distribution Network. and built and operated by BBN Technologies in close collaboration with colleagues at Harvard University and the Boston University Photonics Center. The DARPA Quantum Network was fully compatible with standard Internet technology, and could provide QKD-derived key material to create Virtual Private Networks, to support IPsec or other authentication, or for any other purpose. All control mechanisms and protocols were implemented in the Unix kernel and field-programmable gate arrays. QKD-derived key material was routinely used for video-conferencing or other applications. The DARPA Quantum Network was built in stages.Final report, page 2. In the project's first year (year 1), BBN designed and built a full QKD system (Alice and Bob), with an attenuated laser source (~ 0.1 mean photon number) running through telecom fiber, phase-modulated via an actively stabilized Mach-Zender interferometer. BBN also implemented a full suite of industrial-strength QKD protocols based on BB84. In year 2, BBN created two 'Mark 2' versions of this system (4 nodes) with commercial-quality InGaAs detectors created by IBM Research. These 4 nodes ran continuously in BBN's laboratory from October 2003, then two were deployed at Harvard and Boston University in June 2004, when the network began running continuously across the metro Boston area, 24x7. In year 3, the network expanded to 8 nodes with the addition of an entanglement-based system (derived from work at Boston University) designed for telecom fibers, and a high-speed atmospheric (freespace) link designed and built by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In year 4, BBN added a second freespace link to the overall network, using nodes created by Qinetiq, and investigated improved QKD protocols and detectors. Finally, in year 5, BBN added the world's first superconducting nanowire single-photon detector to the operational network. It was created by a collaboration between researchers at BBN, the University of Rochester, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology; that first 100 Mhz system ran 20x faster than any existing single-photon detector at telecom wavelengths.\\"Quantum key distribution with high-speed superconducting single-photon detectors\\", Robert H Hadfield, Jonathan L Habif, Lijun Ma, Alan Mink, Xiao Tang, Sae Woo Nam, Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference, 2007. In that final year, BBN also collaborated with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to implement, and experiment with, a proof-of-concept version of the world's first quantum eavesdropper (Eve). When fully built, the network's 10 nodes were as follows.\\"The Networking in Quantum Networking\\", Chip Elliott, 2018.

All were integrated into a single, production-quality protocol stack. Authentication was based on public keys, shared private keys, or a combination of the two. (The shared private keys could be refreshed by QKD-derived keys.) Privacy amplification was implemented via GF[2n] Universal Hash. Entropy estimation was based on Rényi entropy, and implemented by BBBSS 92, Slutsky, Myers / Pearson, and Shor / Preskill protocols. Error correction was implemented by a BBN variant of the Cascade protocol, or the BBN Niagara protocol which provided efficient, one-pass operation near the Shannon limit via forward error correction based on low-density parity-check codes (LDPC). Sifting was performed either by traditional methods, run-length encoding, or so-called \\"SARG\\" sifting. It also implemented two major forms of QKD networking protocols.Final Technical Report, Chapters 14 and 15. First, key relay employed \\"trusted\\" nodes in the network to relay materials for key distillation between the two endpoints. This approach permitted nodes to agree upon shared key material even if they were implemented via two incompatible technologies; for example, a node based on phase-modulation through fiber could exchange keys with one based on polarization-modulation through the atmosphere. In fact, it even permitted transmitters to share key material with other (compatible or incompatible) transmitters. Furthermore, the raw key material could be routed by multiple \\"striped\\" paths through the network (e.g. disjoint paths) and recombined end-to-end, thus erasing the advantage that Eve would gain by controlling one of the network nodes along the way. Second, QKD- aware optical routing protocols enabled nodes to control transparent optical switches within the network, so that multiple QKD systems could share the same optical network infrastructure. == Selected papers == * \\"Building the quantum network\\", Chip Elliott, in New Journal of Physics, July 2002. * \\"Quantum cryptography in practice\\", Chip Elliott, David Pearson, Gregory Troxel, ACM SIGCOMM 2002. * \\"Path-length control in an interferometric QKD link\\", Chip Elliott, Oleksiy Pikalo, John Schlafer, Greg Troxel, Proceedings AeroSense 2003, Volume 5105, Quantum Information and Computation, 2003. * \\"The DARPA Quantum Network\\", Chip Elliott, December 2004. * \\"Current status of the DARPA Quantum Network\\", Chip Elliott, Alexander Colvin, David Pearson, Oleksiy Pikalo, John Schlafer, Henry Yeh, SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing 2005. * \\"Building a QKD Network out of Theories and Devices\\" (slide presentation), David Pearson, * \\"The DARPA Quantum Network\\", C.

Walsh was challenging incumbent Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, along with former Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld. Walsh had been a strong supporter of Trump's during the 2016 election but had gradually become disenchanted with the President, describing him as \\"morally unfit\\". In view of Trump's high popularity among Republicans and Walsh's own history of controversial statements, Walsh was considered a long-shot candidate for the nomination. He announced the suspension of his campaign on February 7, 2020, after poor results in the Iowa caucuses. ==Background== ===Congressional tenure (2011–2013)=== Joe Walsh was elected to the United States House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections, defeating three-term incumbent Melissa Bean by 291 votes in an upset election. Though he received little support from establishment Republicans and the Illinois Republican Party, Walsh enjoyed strong support from members of the Tea Party Movement which propelled him to victory. During his time in Congress, Walsh gained national notoriety for his criticism of President Barack Obama and the Obama Administration. His comments often made headlines for being sharp and occasionally racially-motivated. Walsh was defeated for reelection in 2012 by Tammy Duckworth. During that race, Walsh again made national headlines when he criticized Duckworth for discussing her military experience so much on the campaign trail. (Duckworth was seriously injured in a helicopter crash during the Iraq War, leading to a double leg amputation and loss of some sensation in her right hand, among other injuries.) Walsh stated, \\"Now I’m running against a woman who, my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, the men and women who served us, it's the last thing in the world they talk about.\\" Parallels were later drawn between Walsh's comments and Donald Trump's comments during his 2016 campaign in which Trump stated John McCain was not a \\"war hero\\" because \\"he was captured.\\" Duckworth defeated Walsh 55% to 45%. ===Radio show host and Trump supporter=== Following his retirement from Congress, Walsh began hosting a Conservative talk radio show, The Joe Walsh Show. Though initially only broadcast in the Chicago radio market, the show was eventually nationally syndicated by the Salem Radio Network. Walsh again made several controversial statements during his radio program. In August 2019, Walsh stated \\"I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but...I’ve said racist things on Twitter. There's no doubt about it. And an apology is not enough.\\" After the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Walsh's Twitter account was temporarily suspended after he made statements critical of Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement that were perceived as threatening. During this period, Walsh became an outspoken supporter of then- presidential candidate Donald Trump. Walsh initially endorsed Kentucky Senator Rand Paul in the 2016 Republican primaries but supported Trump once he had secured the nomination. On October 24, 2016, Walsh wrote on Twitter, \\"On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?\\" Following Trump's Inauguration, Walsh criticized some of Trump's Cabinet selections for having ties to Goldman Sachs, although he remained supportive of the President. ===Increasing critique of Trump and campaign speculation=== Walsh publicly rescinded his support for Donald Trump in July 2018 after the Helsinki Summit between Trump and President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Walsh stated \\"I will never support Trump again,\\" calling him \\"a danger to this country.\\" Walsh was one of the few Republican supporters of the Special Counsel investigation conducted by Robert Mueller to determine the presence of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Shortly before announcing his presidential campaign, Walsh stated in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin \\"I don't know how anybody can read this report and think, 'This is behavior that we want in our president...'Criminal behavior, who knows? But, boy, dishonest, immoral, unethical? Heck yes it is. And I’ll tell you, Brooke, every Republican on Capitol Hill agrees with what I just said. They can’t say that publicly.\\" Walsh had begun discussing the need for a conservative to challenge Trump in 2020 as early as December 2018 and began to discuss the potential for his own run early in the summer of 2019. Following the Senate vote not to require witnesses at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump on January 31, Walsh said that the vote was \\"Absolutely cowardly\\", and \\"I’m a Republican running for president;... these Senate Republicans... deserve to pay a big price.\\" ==Campaign== After months of speculation, Walsh officially announced he would challenge Donald Trump on August 25, 2019, via a post made on Twitter and a video released on his website, alongside an interview on ABC's This Week. Walsh commented his candidacy was more focused on Trump's character than it was on the issues, stating, \\"I'm running against Trump because he's morally unfit. Period. It's about Trump. It's not about the issues. It's about Trump.\\" In another interview, Walsh referred to the election as a \\"referendum\\" on Trump. In an interview with MSNBC shortly after announcing his candidacy, Walsh said that, should he be unsuccessful against Trump, he could be persuaded to vote for the Democratic nominee in the general election. He added \\"I will never vote for Donald Trump again.\\" Due to President Trump's high approval ratings among Republican voters and Walsh's controversial past statements, he is considered a long-shot candidate for the presidency. Walsh began apologizing for his past controversial statements, including rescinding his remarks that Barack Obama is Muslim. Trump's approval rating among Republicans has remained above 80% since the end of 2017. On August 26, 2019, a day after announcing his campaign for president, Walsh announced he had lost his national radio syndication contract with the Salem Radio Network. Walsh's show will still air on Chicago's WIND until his paperwork to run is officially filed, then will likely be suspended or discontinued. Walsh stated that without his radio show, he planned to campaign \\"full time\\". On September 6, 2019, Walsh appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher where host Bill Maher condemned a report that Republican primaries and caucuses were being canceled in the states of South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, and Kansas before remarking that Walsh would have lost anyway. On November 8, 2019, Walsh said in an interview that he would be more \\"pro-Israel\\" than Trump and stated that he would push for a one-state solution from Jordan to the Mediterranean if elected president. In an interview with CNN on February 7, 2020, Walsh announced he was suspending his campaign after receiving only 1.1% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh called the Republican Party a \\"cult\\" and suggested that he would likely support the Democratic nominee in the general election, stating he would rather have a devout socialist win the election than Trump. According to Walsh, no one could beat Trump in a Republican primary, because Trump supporters had become \\"followers\\" who think that Trump \\"can do no wrong\\", after absorbing misinformation \\"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and — more importantly — they don't care.\\" ==Endorsements== ==References== ==External links== * Official campaign website Walsh ","title":"Joe Walsh 2020 presidential campaign"},{"id":"61603609","text":"Egidio Lari (8 March 1882 – 17 November 1965) was an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church who worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See.

The armistice of 22 June 1940 signed by officials of Nazi Germany and the French Third Republic outlawed all French radio broadcasts in Nazi-occupied France and made those active in the Zone libre subject to special authorization. Philippe Pétain, leader of the collaborationist Vichy state, obtained from the Germans the creation of two radio stations in the Zone libre: Radio nationale in 1940 and La Voix de la France in 1941. Radio Nationale broadcast from the Vichy Casino, hence its nickname Radio-Vichy. Pro-Nazi journalists from the antisemitic weekly Je suis partout—Alain Laubreaux and Lucien Rebatet, working under the direction of Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour—were among the founders, and gave through their programs an extremist image of the Vichy regime among the French, contradicting the initial Pétainist strategy. As the head of Radio-Vichy, Tixier-Vignancour offered a large broadcast time to collaborationist Marcel Déat. Concerned not to shock the listeners with excessive propaganda, Pierre Laval eventually dismissed the team in September 1940. Laval entrusted the direction of information to René Bonnefoy, who became in charge of developing the themes of the Révolution Nationale over the radio. In the summer of 1940, a \\"radio war\\" (guerre des ondes) broke out, marked by oratory battles between the \\"totalitarian radio stations\\" (Radio Paris and Radio-Vichy) and the \\"resistant\\" BBC and Radio Londres which increased the power of their transmitters and the intensity of slogans, in response to radio jamming and threats to listeners by the Germans. From 1942, Philippe Henriot was the main propagandist of the station. On 26 August 1944, the French Forces of the Interior invaded the recording studio of Radio Nationale in the city of Vichy, which definitively ceased broadcasting. == References == Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1944 Category:Public radio in France Category:Radio stations established in 1940 ","title":"Radio Nationale (France)"},{"id":"61603689","text":"Onychostoma uniforme is a species of cyprinid in the genus Onychostoma.

At the first meeting with Bear regarding the book, he was told that it should be a \\"classic Greg Bear giant – in the vein of Eon, Anvil of the Stars and so on\\", but inspired by Halo and its extended universe. The book and author were announced on April 6, 2009. 343 Industries' General Manager, Bonnie Ross, stated that the back and forth with Bear made \\"the whole experience better\\", and was preferable to assigning the author his task with no feedback. Halo franchise development director Frank O'Connor stated, \\"The enigma of the Forerunners is really at the heart of the drama and mystery of the Halo universe ... in all the games and the books so far we've only scratched the surface of the terrible events that engulfed the Forerunners and the Galaxy they protected 100,000 years ago\\". Although nothing was forced upon Bear in terms of story templates, he had numerous and comprehensive discussions about the history of the Halo universe and the major events of the Forerunner history had already been established through the information hidden in Halo 3. O'Connor said that the book is meant to have a \\"hard sci-fi\\" feel with a \\"hint of space opera, in the mold of Banks, Reynolds and Bear himself.\\" The book's cover was designed by Sparth, an artist at 343 Industries known for his \\"futuristic vistas\\". The artwork was taken directly from art made for Halo 4. O'Connor explained that the cover was intended to \\"capture the essence and scope of the book and more importantly, the Forerunner universe.\\" The art is supposed to convey \\"the sense of wonder that all our main protagonists feel at the scale and scope of Forerunner technology.\\" On July 19, 2011, Tor Books revealed the cover, title, and release date of the second book in the Forerunner Saga. On October 12, 2011 the book was completed and submitted to the publisher. On December 28, 2011 the first chapter of the book was made available on the publishers website and chapters 2, 3, and part of 4 were made available on the Halo Waypoint website. Video game website Kotaku was given a five-minute audio clip of the book being read by Tim Dadabo, who voiced the character of 343 Guilty Spark in previous Halo games. At a Comic-Con panel on the Halo Universe, Frank O'Connor stated that the book would have \\"resonant connections\\" with Halo 4. Bear stated that the interactions of the humans and the Forerunners were some of his favorite parts of the Forerunner trilogy. On April 12, 2013 Tor Books ran a promotion giving away the entire book trilogy to one participant. Greg Bear posted on his site on May 3, 2012 that the third book of the Forerunner trilogy would be released in January and had a working title of Halo: Silentium. The book had its title, first cover and release date announced by Tor Books on July 11, 2012, with a release date of January 8, 2013, for the hardcover, e-book and audio book. On August 25, 2012 Bear stated the book was complete and in revision. On November 8, 2012 Bear stated that he had finished writing the book. Release was later moved off to March 2013 until the release of Halo 4 to avoid revealing any plot details about the game. From February 13, 2013 to the books release, encrypted messages were sent out from the halo waypoint website that allowed fans to unlock additional halo content, and were also included in the paperback and e-book versions. A week before the books release, an excerpt of the first chapter was posted on the publishers website, and the second was on the Halo Waypoint website. Bear used the Forerunner designs and images from the Halo video games as an inspiration, and it showed him there had to be an emphasis on builders within the Forerunner civilization. The books cover was designed by Sparth, in a collaboration with Gabriel Garza, and with design help for the Didact sphere provided by Glenn Israel. ==Synopsis== ===Setting and characters=== The Forerunner Saga takes place approximately 100,000 years before the 26th century setting in the Halo universe, telling the story of the ancient and powerful civilization known as the Forerunners, divided into ranks based on occupations, such as Builders, Warriors, and Lifeworkers. They were preceded by an enigmatic race known as the Precursors. The books revolve around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting, two humans—Chakas and Morning Riser—and other important Forerunners, including the Warrior Didact and Lifeworker Librarian. ===Cryptum=== Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting visits the human planet Erde-Tyrene (Earth), intent on discovering treasures left by the Precursors. With the aid of two human guides, Chakas and Morning Riser, Bornstellar visits a ring island where they find a cryptum—a Forerunner stasis vessel. Inside is the Didact, who after recovering from his hibernation, conscripts Bornstellar, Chakas, and Riser on an interstellar quest given to him by the Librarian. Bornstellar learns that the Forerunners fought a war with humankind 10,000 years prior. After their defeat, the Librarian saved the human race from extinction (they were instead stripped of their technology) and planted a genetic command known as a \\"geas\\" in them, the cause of Chakas and Riser's subconscious knowledge that led Bornstellar to the Didact. The Didact and his makeshift crew travel to an ancient Precursor planet, Charum Hakkor, where humans had once also settled. The Didact is disturbed to find that many of the Precursor structures on the planet, thought indestructible, have fallen into ruin. The Didact also discovers that a prisoner, protected by Precursor and human containment methods, has escaped. They travel to the nearby planet of Faun Hakkor, another formerly human-settled world, to find it stripped of all sentient life. The Didact sponsors Bornstellar's first mutation—a vital part of Forerunner growth—imprinting his personality, tactics, and memories upon Bornstellar. The Didact's party are captured and imprisoned by Forerunner Builders, under the command of Faber, the Master Builder. Bornstellar is returned to the care of his father because of his family's status and power. Bornstellar learns his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos—massive ringworld weapons. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such weapons, leading to his exile. Bornstellar is called to the Forerunner Capital to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial. He stands accused of crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else. Just as the trial is about to begin, the Forerunner artificial intelligence Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and attempts to assume control of the Halos and use them against the Capital. In the ensuing battle several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs enacting failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape and is recovered by the Librarian and her Lifeworkers. The Librarian informs Bornstellar that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner on Charum Hakkor was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate them; the Timeless One seeks revenge. ===Primordium=== Primordium is told through flashbacks, with a damaged Forerunner AI recovered by a human crew. This Forerunner AI, 343 Guilty Spark, was once the human Chakas, and relates his tale through flashbacks. After Chakas, Riser, Bornstellar, and the Didact were taken prisoner by The Master Builder, Chakas and Riser ended up on the Halo ring known as Installation 07. Chakas is also carrying the imprint of Forthencho, a human general during the Human-Forerunner war. Chakas befriends Vinnevra and her grandfather Gamelpar and the three of them proceed to follow Vinnevra's geas to find a safe place. Unbeknown to them, the installation’s beacon had been reset and they now head towards The Primordial’s lair - The Palace of Pain. They soon reach their destination and witness the Primordial guiding all the humans who had followed their geas to the Palace of Pain. After witnessing The Primordial, they decide to head in the opposite direction and after a long journey they reach the shores of an ocean. There they find a ruined city with Forerunner corpses and a Gravemind locked in a cell pleading for death and freedom. After crossing the ocean, the trio are found by a Lifeworker who accompanies them with several other humans and a giant ape named Mara. While sleeping at night in the refugee center, Chakas is greeted by Riser who warns him not to trust the Lifeworker. Later it is revealed everyone except the three of them are illusions cast by the monitors who are there to extract their spirits and store them as monitors. After breaking out of the illusion they are joined by Riser while Gamelpar dies due to old age. Forthencho converses with the spirit of Yprin Yprikushma within Riser who was responsible for excavating Precursor ruins and moving the Primordial to Charum Hakkor, which Forthencho has disapproved of. The group is finally brought to The Palace of Pain by a transport, where they are greeted by Mendicant Bias. The spirits within all humans are extracted and Mendicant Bias promises them revenge on Forerunners. Those who oppose are killed. Forthencho lies to Bias that Chakas has agreed to help them and they are transported to the Silent Cartographer. As Halo is on a collision course with a nearing planet they try to save it by interfacing Chakas through an infected Forerunner into Halo's system. A fleet led by the Didact then appears from the other side of the planet and the Didact purges Mendicant Bias from Installation 07. Chakas then merges with the Didact to move the halo through a portal. To do so, however, the halo must drop several pieces of itself, thus reducing its diameter to its current size. The Halo survives and Chakas and The Didact visit The Primordial, who has been imprisoned in a reverse time capsule (which speeds up time experienced within enclosure). He reveals that Precursors have decided Forerunners are not meant to inherit the Mantle (they have failed their test), but humans have been selected to be tested now instead; once Forerunners are eliminated, humans will be tested by Flood to check their worthiness for inheriting the Mantle. Didact then disintegrates the Primordial by turning the time dial to full and Chakas is converted into a monitor and is pleased to learn that his friends survived. The story ends with the now powered down monitor been ejected out into space, but not before a partial memory imprint of Chakas/monitor is transferred into the ship's computer. Shortly thereafter he takes control of the ship. It is then revealed that it was Chakas who was converted into 343 Guilty Spark. He is now seeking the spirits of Riser and Vinnevra, for whom he seek the Librarian.. He puts the ship's crew to sleep and takes off. ===Silentium=== Silentium is framed with the in-universe conceit of collected Forerunner testimony and investigations recovered by 26th century humanity. The files in question are said to have been extracted from two sources: the carapace of a deceased Catalog (designated Forerunner remains #879) and a damaged monitor. Both the \\"Bornstellar Relation\\", the fictional document that encompasses the narrative of Halo: Cryptum and ONI's recovery of 343 Guilty Spark which acts as the framing device for the plot of Halo: Primordium, are referenced. On Erde-Tyrene, Catalog observes the evacuation effort of the planet. Catalog is here to investigate the Battle of the Capital, which resulted in the deaths of the entire Old Council, and demands a testimony from both the Librarian and her husband - the IsoDidact, formerly Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting. However, a warning of an approaching Flood fleet results in the IsoDidact having to leave to defend the territory, so Catalog is sent off with the Librarian. While it accompanies her, she tells it about the events that led to her becoming a Lifeshaper, and her growing split from the original Didact due to their differing opinions about humanity. Over a thousand years earlier, shortly before the Ur-Didact went into exile, he and the Librarian gathered together at their estate on the world of Nomdagro. An associate of Haruspis visited their home and helped guide the Ur-Didact in the Cryptum's preservation process. After the Didact's exile, things continued to deteriorate on the Forerunner political scene. To remain seen as an asset to the Master Builder, the Librarian proposed an expedition to a local galaxy known as Path Kethona to learn about the Flood's origins. Legend dictated that 10 million years ago, ancient Forerunners journeyed to Path Kethona, but actual records detailing this journey had long since vanished. The Old Council approved of this venture and the ship Audacity was constructed for the long journey to Path Kethona. The crew consisted of the Librarian, a Builder named Keeper-of-Tools, a Miner named Clearance-of-Old-Forests, and two Lifeworkers named Chant-to-Green and Birth-to-Light. Arriving at Path Kethona, the crew of Audacity would find it seemingly completely devoid of life. However, they discovered that Precursor architecture existed this far out of the Milky Way. Amongst the artifacts was a vast fleet of ancient Forerunner vessels of war. The Librarian and her crew scanned the Forerunner vessels and found nothing of true interest; any records inside had been destroyed thousands of years ago, as they were uploaded in binary. The Librarian, Keeper and Chant discovered a planet with a civilization of primitive Forerunners confined to the planet and lacking any form of advanced technology; however, the planet's ecology is completely based upon Forerunner genetics. The crew land on the planet to encounter the natives in person. As the Librarian meets the locals in person without armor. The Librarian queries an elder, Glow-of-Old-Suns about the origins of her people and is taken to a valley where she learns that the history of the natives is contained within a vast growth of moss - an organic Domain. By accessing this information reserve, she would learn that Warriors drove the Precursors to Path Kethona during the Forerunners' genocidal campaign against their creators ten million years earlier, and that the planet's inhabitants were descendants of Forerunners exiled there as punishment for refusing to partake in the destruction of the Precursors. Back in the present, the Ur-Didact emerges from a stasis-bubble on a broken-down Builder hulk drifting in a Burn, the designation for a Flood infected star system. Also on-board is a former Promethean named Sharp-by-Striking, another Catalog and a Builder named Maker-of-Moons. It is learned that Sharp lost favor with Faber and Maker was going to give Catalog testimony against Faber, so all three found themselves on the broken ship as well. Their destination is a Flood-infested world called Uthera Midgeerrd. Eventually a Precursor artifact with slithering star roads appears and threatens to destroy the ship. The Ur-Didact, willing to confront whatever lies in the Precursor artifact, remains on the ship while the others escape; only Catalog stays to accompany him. The Ur-Didact and Catalog are captured by the Gravemind and the Ur- Didact's sanity is severely shaken by the resulting encounter. The Gravemind then reveals the true nature of the Precursors. They did indeed reject Forerunners for the Mantle and intended for humans to hold it. The Forerunners did not accept this and drove the Precursors from the galaxy and beyond. Some Precursors survived by going dormant, others became powder that could regenerate their old selves in time, but time rendered it defective and it only created sickness and disease. The Precursors vowed that none of their creations would rise against them again and that all life would suffer and be in perpetual agony, through their new form as the Flood. Back in the Orion complex, Forerunner defenses continue to fall as formerly dormant Precursor artifacts across the galaxy begin to reactivate, with their immense power bolstering the Flood's already enormous forces. The Master Builder is revealed to be alive and well. He rescued the Ur-Didact, who was given power once again. A meeting occurs on Nomdagro between the IsoDidact, Ur-Didact and Librarian that does not go well. Arguments ensue and the Ur-Didact reveals the Gravemind drove him mad and that he would not let humans attain the Mantle. The Flood arrives and ravages Nomdagro as the Audacity and Mantle's Approach leave towards the greater Ark, now the last bastion of the ecumene. On the greater Ark, Omega Halo is there in anticipation for a Flood assault. A power struggle ensues between the IsoDidact and other Forerunner commanders who think the Ur-Didact should instead lead them. The Master Builder manages to regain control for him and the IsoDidact by revealing that the Ur-Didact is being used as a pawn for the Gravemind; after Faber had recovered him, the Ur- Didact conveyed him a sadistic message from the Gravemind which had absorbed Faber's family. A massive Flood fleet led by Mendicant Bias arrives and chaos erupts. In that confusion, the Ur-Didact uses a Composer to compose human populations being stored on Omega Halo and retreats towards Requiem. The Librarian follows behind him, grieving for the loss of her humans. Monitor Chakas is tasked with saving the rest of the humans on the Ark and taking them to the lesser Ark, still hidden from the Ur-Didact and the Flood. The IsoDidact and the remaining Forerunner commanders with Faber in tow go to the Halo and activate it to buy time. Although the pulse destroys some of the Precursor star roads and part of the Flood fleet, both the greater Ark and Omega Halo are soon destroyed by the star roads. Faber remains behind while IsoDidact and the other commanders attempt to escape, but they begin to plummet to their deaths as the Halo is torn apart. Chakas manages to save the IsoDidact and takes him to the lesser Ark via Faber's personal slipspace portal. At the lesser Ark, the remaining six Halos are assigned their monitor caretakers in preparation for their distribution across the galaxy, Installation 07 having been deployed years prior. The IsoDidact has a brief conversation with Chakas, in which he gives him his new designation, 343 Guilty Spark, and assigns him to Installation 04. The IsoDidact then asks Chakas if he would fire the rings, were it his choice, but receives no response. On Requiem, the Librarian sneaks aboard with the Audacity by trailing behind the Mantle's Approach. Requiem's defenses also view her as a friendly and let her in. The Librarian finds Endurance-of-Will, a Promethean and former love interest of the Ur-Didact. Endurance reveals that the Ur- Didact is using the essences of the composed humans and Prometheans to build an army of mechanical Promethean Knights, with which he plans to defeat the Flood and eradicate all species who might challenge the Forerunners in the future. Despite resenting her for being chosen by the Ur-Didact instead of her, Endurance is eventually convinced to help the Librarian take down the Ur- Didact and seal him in a Cryptum. Once done, the Librarian tasks Endurance to watch over the Didact for as long as she can. As she leaves Requiem for Earth, the Librarian is confronted by a large group of Knights and wonders if Endurance chose to become one herself. The Librarian then draws the Flood towards Earth to allow the IsoDidact to fire the seven Halo rings. She sends Chant-to-Green off to the lesser Ark with the planet's remaining humans and passes her title of Lifeshaper on to Chant while remaining on Earth herself. During her last days on Earth, the Gravemind sends down ancient human essences, including the Lord of Admirals, to reveal that the Domain was created by the Precursors as the collection of wisdom from over 100 billion years of knowledge and that it was ingrained in Precursor architecture for safekeeping. In short, the Domain is the mythical Organon. Sadly, the Librarian realizes that the Halos will destroy all of this, and that without the Domain, the Ur-Didact will spend the eons to come in complete silence, dwelling on his own rage and madness. As she watches the Portal's construction, she sincerely hopes humanity will one day inherit the Mantle. At the lesser Ark, the IsoDidact activates the rings while Offensive Bias fends off Mendicant Bias' fleet, allowing the rings to fire before the latter can reach the Ark. In the end, 343 Guilty Spark reflects on the Halos working their power throughout the galaxy. In that instant, he receives the first signals of a young, previously unknown civilization, which is swiftly extinguished by the Array's pulse. Compartmentalization processes then erase large portions of Spark's memory and he forgets his old life. Epilogue A code to a hidden audio epilogue, titled \\"Rebirth\\", is included in the form of Forerunner symbols featured in some of the chapter headings for the novel. The code can be used on Halo Waypoint to unlock a forty-minute narration by Greg Bear, describing the reintroduction phase from the perspective of Riser. Having survived the destruction of the greater Ark, Riser, Vinnevra and other humans are relocated on Installation 00 among many other species, where Forerunners watch over them until they are returned to their homeworld. At Riser's request, his people are relocated on a series of islands. Riser meets with the IsoDidact one last time before the Forerunners leave and the humans begin settling in their new home. Days after, a new code was revealed, adding 5 additional minutes to the epilogue, describing the trial of Mendicant Bias after its defeat at the Battle of the Maginot Sphere. ==Release and reception== In the weeks before release, Tor Books released Chapter One for free, and Chapter Two was made available on the Halo Waypoint website. Tor also ran giveaways of the other Halo novels and action figures. An unabridged audio book, narrated by Holter Graham, was released alongside the print edition on January 4, 2011. Upon release Greg Bear did book signings attended by Frank O'Connor. Following its release, Cryptum reached number 22 in the New York Times Best Seller List in the Hardcover Fiction category. It also spent five weeks on the Los Angeles Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list, reaching number 17. Publishers Weekly noted that the book was a bestseller in the hardcovers category in early September 2011 at Borders. Cryptum was met with varying reviews. Dr. Nigel Seel of sciencefiction.com called it tired, unoriginal and boring, saying, \\"It's hard to care about the flimsy characters, the plot is wearily over familiar, the hero is passive throughout and overall, not enough happens.\\" He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow, concluding, \\"This is one for the die-hard Halo fans.\\" Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans, but praised Graham's narration. Portland Book Reviews Missy Wadkins felt differently. She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting history lesson. Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel's by recommending it to all science fiction readers, not just Halo fans. Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel; he complimented Bear's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting on too much and ruining the suspense. At San Diego Comic-Con on July 14, 2012 Bear signed copies of the book. Halo: Primordium was on the New York Times Bestseller List: Hardcover Fiction for the week of January 7, 2012 at number seventeen. The Los Angeles Times had the book on its Bestseller List for two weeks, at number 16 and then at number 14 for the weeks of January 22 and January 29. Publishers Weekly listed the book at number seventeen on their Bestsellers Hardcover Fiction for the week of January 16, 2012. Story Hobby reviewed the book and gave it an 80% rating, calling the book a \\"big improvement\\" over the previous title, citing the exciting conclusion and more human centered story, but called the plot \\"weak\\". Book Loons called it \\"slow\\", and said it was only with those familiar with the source material, but that the audio book was very good, and that it had an excellent surprise ending. The book debuted at number eight on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list and number thirty-five the following week. On the New York Times \\"Combined Hardcover and Paperback Fiction\\" List it was listed at number twenty four for the week of April 7. The book entered USA Todays Top 150 books on March 28, 2013, and peaked at number 128. On July 14, 2012 at San Diego Comicon, Greg Bear signed books from the Forerunner Trilogy and a fan won a poster of the book cover. The day the book was released, Bear signed copies at the University of Washington, and three days later at the Mysterious Galaxy Bookstore. The book was one of Barnes and Nobles March 2013 \\"Bestseller's Picks\\" On April 12, 2013 Tor Books ran a promotion giving away the entire book trilogy to one participant. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 science fiction novels Category:2011 American novels Category:Novels based on Halo (franchise) Category:Novels by Greg Bear Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Forerunner Saga"},{"id":"61603824","text":"Kenneth Marshall Watson (born September 7, 1921) is a theoretical physicist and physical oceanographer.

It was released in 1981. ==Background== The album was recorded shortly after a series of theatrical performances of the opera at Covent Garden in January 1980.Alan Blyth, Gramophone, October 1981, pp. 603-604 Covent Garden's staging, a co-production with English National Opera, was produced by John Copley and used sets designed by Stefanos Lazaridis and costumes designed by Michael Stennett.http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/production.aspx?production=1610&row;=1 The singers on the album and in the opera house were the same, except that in the theatre Jonathan Summers was Albert and John Dobson was Schmidt. ==Recording== The album was recorded using analogue technology in February 1980 in London.Massenet, Jules: Werther, cond. Colin Davis, 416 654-2 ==Packaging== The covers of the LP, cassette and CD versions of the album all feature the same photograph, taken by Mike Evans, showing Carreras and von Stade on stage at Covent Garden during the opera's final act. ==Critical reception== ===Reviews=== Jules Massenet photographed by Eugène Pirou in 1895, three years after Werther was first performed (in a German translation) Alan Blyth reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in October 1981, comparing it with recordings of the opera conducted by Riccardo ChaillyJules Massenet: Werther, cond. Riccardo Chailly, Deutsche Grammophon LP, 2709 091 and Michel PlassonJules Massenet: Werther, cond. Michel Plasson, EMI Records LP, SLS5183 He approved of most of Davis's principal soloists almost unreservedly. Robert Lloyd was a \\"sonorous, flexible Bailiff\\", \\"idiomatic in French\\". Isobel Buchanan's Sophie expressed the \\"young girl's unspoilt views on life with forward, bright tone - just right\\". Thomas Allen's Albert was \\"ideal\\", with enunciation as good as Lloyd's and \\"controlled, velvet tone\\", a figure as persuasive in his reverent devotion to his betrothed as in his paternalistic concern for his infatuated rival. As Werther, José Carreras sang with an Italianate timbre, prodigious breath control and meticulous attention to every nuance of Massenet's markings, and also gave a heartfelt performance as an actor. He was \\"absolutely inside the role\\" of the moody, reckless writer, \\"rich and impassioned in 'O nature', properly distraught and urgent in 'J'aurais' [and] poetic in the Ossian stanzas\\". His version of the character was clearly superior to Placido Domingo's vehement but broad-brush portrait for Chailly, and the pointed but reedy-voiced and sometimes self-indulgent performance given by Alfredo Kraus for Plasson. Frederica von Stade was not quite as impressive. She sang with sensitivity and with \\"much feeling and tenderness\\", and was vastly preferable to Chailly's Elena Obraztsova. But she had too few colours in her vocal paint-box and too little passion to supply what the role of Charlotte required. There was \\"something a little precious and 'arty'\\" about her reading. Plasson's Tatiana Troyanos used her words more eloquently and sang her music more affectingly. Colin Davis was a sensitive conductor, revealing the score's subtleties and its debts to Wagner and Berlioz, equally adept in the tranquil contentment of Act 1 and the melodrama of Act 3. The album's recording quality was good, with the balance of the voices and the orchestra well judged and skillful management of sound effects and off-stage voices. All in all, the set was a welcome one, and had obviously profited from the artists' experience of performing the opera together on stage. Whether readers would prefer it to Plasson's would depend on their opinions of Carreras vis à vis Kraus and von Stade vis à vis Troyanos. George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in March 1982. Frederica von Stade, he wrote, seemed untroubled by the technical challenges of Charlotte's music. She was \\"an absolute pleasure to listen to, though a bit cool and distant for [his] taste - too much the proper, dutiful wife to make her agonizing dilemma fully believable\\". As Charlotte's sister, Isobel Buchanan was \\"a charming Sophie who [did] not overdo her girlishness\\". José Carreras's Werther had both strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, \\"the dark timbre of [Carreras's] attractive voice [helped] in creating a manly figure out of Goethe's at times annoyingly self-pitying hero\\". On the negative side, Carreras's reading of \\"O nature\\" was laboured, and many of his higher notes were inelegant. Thomas Allen, by contrast, was excellent in every respect, with a timbre youthful enough to be apt for the young man that Albert was meant to be. The secondary roles were taken satisfactorily too, although the children's chorus could have sung more euphoniously. The orchestra played with \\"passion and refinement\\" under the \\"strong hand\\" of Colin Davis. A \\"masterly orchestral colorist\\", he managed Massenet's \\"subtly sensuous orchestral idiom with a sure and sensitive command\\". His tempi were not the sprightliest ever heard in Werther, but he gave the opera enough momentum to counterbalance its tendency towards a weepy misery, and his reading had certainly gained from the \\"ensemble spirit\\" that he had elicited when performing the work at Covent Garden. In sum, the album was a good one, if arguably not the equal of Georges Prêtre's more animated account with Nicolai Gedda and Victoria de los Angeles.Jules Massenet: Werther, cond. Georges Prêtre, Angel Records LP, S-3736 (The opera itself, although apparently becoming Massenet's most popular, was distinctly inferior to his Manon.)George Jellinek, Stereo Review, March 1982, p. 88 A poster advertising Werther's 1893 first performance in French Hilary Finch reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in February 1987. Her opinion of Frederica von Stade's Charlotte echoed Blyth's and Jellinek's. \\"So far as style, line and inflection [were] concerned\\", there was nothing in von Stade's performance that could be criticized. But her Charlotte was deficient dramatically. She had conveyed the young woman's \\"essential simplicity of character\\", but she had had less success in finding \\"the shadows in the role\\". She lacked the \\"darker tinta\\" that might have enabled her to \\"bring a greater sense of the undercurrent of emotional conflict as it [grew] towards the last two acts\\" of the opera. The album's other principals could be praised unequivocally. José Carreras was a dynamic Werther rather than a figure of introspective lyricism. Thomas Allen gave Albert a richness of inner life that it was unusual to encounter in the role. And Isobel Buchanan provided a \\"small-scale, straightforward Sophie, a real oiseau d'aurore ready to fly away into the emotion of each changing moment\\". The Covent Garden orchestra played as well as they knew how, \\"the solo detail and the velocity of their every response to Massenet's flickering orchestral palette [operating] as if with heightened awareness under the scrutiny of the laser beam\\". Colin Davis's conducting paced the opera \\"superbly\\", heightening and relaxing the tension of its words and music so that its drama was compulsively engrossing from its first bar to its last.Hilary Finch, Gramophone, February 1987, pp. 1177-1178 Richard Fairman mentioned the album in a survey of Massenet's operas in Gramophone's 2000 Awards issue. \\"Probably the nearest to an all-round modern recommendation\\", he wrote, \\"remains Colin Davis's 1980 set on Philips, which judiciously balances high emotion and restraint.\\"Richard Fairman, Gramophone, Awards Issue 2000, p. 50 ===Accolade=== In the Gramophone Record Awards of March 1982, the album won the prize for Engineering and Production. John Borwick wrote that \\"It is a studio recording, yet the engineers have recreated the theatrical atmosphere perfectly, with an excellent feeling of distance where appropriate (off-stage voices for example), and the orchestra is beautifully balanced. While half a dozen [other] recordings scored close to full marks, the sum of the virtues revealed in this Philips recording just tipped the scales in its favour.\\"John Borwick, Gramophone, March 1982, p. 1225 ==Track listing: CD1== Jules Massenet (1842-1912) Werther (Geneva, 1892), drame lyrique in four acts with a libretto by Édouard Blau (1836-1906), Paul Milliet (1848-1924) and Georges Hartmann (1843-1900) (writing as Henri Grémont), after Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (\\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\") by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) * 1 (4:01) Prelude Act One * 2 (7:34) Assez!

Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require that the sequential data be processed in order. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the Transformer does not need to process the beginning of it before the end. Due to this feature, the Transformer allows for much more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduced training times. Since their introduction, Transformers have become the model of choice for tackling many problems in NLP, replacing older recurrent neural network models such as the long short- term memory (LSTM). Since the Transformer model facilitates more parallelization during training, it has enabled training on larger datasets than was possible before it was introduced. This has led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which have been trained with huge general language datasets, and can be fine-tuned to specific language tasks. == Background == Before the introduction of Transformers, most state-of-the-art NLP systems relied on gated recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs and gated recurrent units (GRUs), with added attention mechanisms. The Transformer built on these attention technologies without using an RNN structure, highlighting the fact that the attention mechanisms alone, without recurrent sequential processing, are powerful enough to achieve the performance of RNNs with attention. Gated RNNs process tokens sequentially, maintaining a state vector that contains a representation of the data seen after every token. To process the n^{th} token, the model combines the state representing the sentence up to token n-1 with the information of the new token to create a new state, representing the sentence up to token n. Theoretically, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, if at every point the state continues to encode information about the token. But in practice this mechanism is imperfect: due in part to the vanishing gradient problem, the model's state at the end of a long sentence often does not contain precise, extractable information about early tokens. This problem was addressed by the introduction of attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms let a model directly look at, and draw from, the state at any earlier point in the sentence. The attention layer can access all previous states and weighs them according to some learned measure of relevancy to the current token, providing sharper information about far-away relevant tokens. A clear example of the utility of attention is in translation. In an English-to-French translation system, the first word of the French output most probably depends heavily on the beginning of the English input. However, in a classic encoder-decoder LSTM model, in order to produce the first word of the French output the model is only given the state vector of the last English word. Theoretically, this vector can encode information about the whole English sentence, giving the model all necessary knowledge, but in practice this information is often not well preserved. If an attention mechanism is introduced, the model can instead learn to attend to the states of early English tokens when producing the beginning of the French output, giving it a much better concept of what it is translating. When added to RNNs, attention mechanisms led to large gains in performance. The introduction of the Transformer brought to light the fact that attention mechanisms were powerful in themselves, and that sequential recurrent processing of data was not necessary for achieving the performance gains of RNNs with attention. The Transformer uses an attention mechanism without being an RNN, processing all tokens at the same time and calculating attention weights between them. The fact that Transformers do not rely on sequential processing, and lend themselves very easily to parallelization, allows Transformers to be trained more efficiently on larger datasets. == Architecture == Like the models invented before it, the Transformer is an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of a set of encoding layers that processes the input iteratively one layer after another and the decoder consists of a set of decoding layers that does the same thing to the output of the encoder. The function of each encoder layer is to process its input to generate encodings, containing information about which parts of the inputs are relevant to each other. It passes its set of encodings to the next encoder layer as inputs. Each decoder layer does the opposite, taking all the encodings and processes them, using their incorporated contextual information to generate an output sequence. To achieve this, each encoder and decoder layer makes use of an attention mechanism, which for each input, weighs the relevance of every other input and draws information from them accordingly to produce the output. Each decoder layer also has an additional attention mechanism which draws information from the outputs of previous decoders, before the decoder layer draws information from the encodings. Both the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of the outputs, and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps. === Scaled dot- product attention === The basic building blocks of the Transformer are scaled dot-product attention units. When a sentence is passed into a Transformer model, attention weights are calculated between every token simultaneously. The attention unit produces embeddings for every token in context that contain information not only about the token itself, but also a weighted combination of other relevant tokens weighted by the attention weights. Concretely, for each attention unit the Transformer model learns three weight matrices; the query weights W_Q, the key weights W_K, and the value weights W_V. For each token i, the input word embedding x_i is multiplied with each of the three weight matrices to produce a query vector q_i = x_iW_Q, a key vector k_i = x_iW_K , and a value vector v_i=x_iW_V. Attention weights are calculated using the query and key vectors: the attention weight a_{ij} from token i to token j is the dot product between q_i and k_j. The attention weights are divided by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors, \\\\sqrt{d_k}, which stabilizes gradients during training, and passed through a softmax which normalizes the weights to sum to 1. The fact that W_Q and W_K are different matrices allows attention to be non-symmetric: if token i attends to token j (i.e. q_i\\\\cdot k_j is large), this does not necessarily mean that token j will attend to token i (i.e. q_j\\\\cdot k_i is large). The output of the attention unit for token i is the weighted sum of the value vectors of all tokens, weighted by a_{ij}, the attention from i to each token. The attention calculation for all tokens can be expressed as one large matrix calculation, which is useful for training due to computational matrix operation optimizations which make matrix operations fast to compute. The matrices Q, K and V are defined as the matrices where the ith rows are vectors q_i, k_i, and v_i respectively. \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\\\text{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\frac{QK^\\\\mathrm{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}}\\\\right)V \\\\end{align}  Multi-head attention  One set of \\\\left( W_Q, W_K, W_V \\\\right) matrices is called an attention head, and each layer in a Transformer model has multiple attention heads. While one attention head attends to the tokens that are relevant to each token, with multiple attention heads the model can learn to do this for different definitions of \\"relevance\\". Research has shown that many attention heads in Transformers encode relevance relations that are interpretable by humans. For example there are attention heads that, for every token, attend mostly to the next word, or attention heads that mainly attend from verbs to their direct objects. Since Transformer models have multiple attention heads, they have the possibility of capturing many levels and types of relevance relations, from surface-level to semantic. The multiple outputs for the multi-head attention layer are concatenated to pass into the feed- forward neural network layers. === Encoder === Each encoder consists of two major components: a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism takes in a set of input encodings from the previous encoder and weighs their relevance to each other to generate a set of output encodings. The feed-forward neural network then further processes each output encoding individually. These output encodings are finally passed to the next encoder as its input, as well as the decoders. The first encoder takes positional information and embeddings of the input sequence as its input, rather than encodings. The positional information is necessary for the Transformer to make use of the order of the sequence, because no other part of the Transformer makes use of this. === Decoder === Each decoder consists of three major components: a self-attention mechanism, an attention mechanism over the encodings, and a feed-forward neural network. The decoder functions in a similar fashion to the encoder, but an additional attention mechanism is inserted which instead draws relevant information from the encodings generated by the encoders. Like the first encoder, the first decoder takes positional information and embeddings of the output sequence as its input, rather than encodings. Since the transformer should not use the current or future output to predict an output though, the output sequence must be partially masked to prevent this reverse information flow. The last decoder is followed by a final linear transformation and softmax layer, to produce the output probabilities over the vocabulary. == Training == Transformers typically undergo semi-supervised learning involving unsupervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. Pretraining is typically done on a much larger dataset than fine-tuning, due to the restricted availability of labeled training data. Tasks for pretraining and fine-tuning commonly include: * next- sentence prediction *question answering *reading comprehension *sentiment analysis *paraphrasing == Implementations == The Transformer model has been implemented in major deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Below is pseudo code for an implementation of the Transformer variant known as the \\"vanilla\\" transformer: def vanilla_transformer(enc_inp, dec_inp): \\"\\"\\"Transformer variant known as the \\"vanilla\\" transformer.\\"\\"\\" x = embedding(enc_inp) * sqrt(d_m) x = x + pos_encoding(x) x = dropout(x) for _ in range(n_enc_layers): attn = multi_head_attention(x, x, x, None) attn = dropout(attn) attn = layer_normalization(x + attn) x = point_wise_ff(attn) x = layer_normalization(x + attn) # x is at this point the output of the encoder enc_out = x x = embedding(dec_inp) * sqrt(d_m) x = x + pos_encoding(x) x = dropout(x) mask = causal_mask(x) for _ in range(n_dec_layers): attn1 = multi_head_attention(x, x, x, mask) attn1 = layer_normalization(attn1 + x) attn2 = multi_head_attention(attn1, enc_out, enc_out, None) attn2 = dropout(attn2) attn2 = layer_normalization(attn1 + attn2) x = point_wise_ff(attn2) x = layer_normalization(attn2 + x) return dense(x) == Applications == The Transformer finds most of its applications in the field of natural language processing (NLP), for example the tasks of machine translation and time series prediction. Many pretrained models such as GPT-3, GPT-2, BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa demonstrate the ability of Transformers to perform a wide variety of such NLP-related tasks, and have the potential to find real-world applications. These may include: * machine translation * document summarization * document generation * named entity recognition (NER) * speech recognition * biological sequence analysis In 2020, it was shown that the transformer architecture, more specifically GPT-2, could be fine-tuned to play chess. == References == Category:Artificial neural networks ","title":"Transformer (machine learning model)"},{"id":"61603980","text":"Erkki Rajala (12 March 1923 - 5 December 1977) was a Finnish ski jumper.

She was captured by agents of the National Guard in November, 1976. Her detention was kept secret and from that moment on she was considered \\"disappeared\\" until she was murdered inside the clandestine jails of the National Guard on October 17, 1979, after being tortured for three years. She is now remembered for her courage and determination in favor of the unprivileged lower classes. == Early years == Lil Milagro de la Esperanza Ramírez Huezo Córdoba was born in San Salvador on April 3, 1946 to philosopher and professor Tránsito Huezo Córdoba de Ramírez and José Ramírez Ávalos, who had three more children together: Luz América, Amada, and José Napoleón. Lil entered the University of El Salvador (UES) to pursue a doctorate in Case law and Social science in 1963. Despite having finished the program, Lil decided not to graduate as a form of protest against a political system that she considered unjust and oppressive, and which she had no desire to serve. == Years in clandestinity == Lil Milagro started as head of the Juventud Demócrata Cristiana in 1966. Her early years in politics were marked ideologically by Christian socialism, though later on she was heavily influenced by Marxism. In 1970, after finishing her studies at UES, Lil decided to leave her home in San Jacinto, where she lived with her parents, and began her life in clandestinity. In 1971, she appears as part of a small movement called simply \\"El Grupo,\\" which formed the core of the organization that in March 1972 would become the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), in the midst of a turbulent electoral process. In 1975, Lil Milagro, together with Costa Rican Eduardo Sancho (a.k.a. Fermán Cienfuegos) and other fellow guerrilla fighters, decides to abandon the ERP and found a new political movement called Resistencia Nacional (RN). This separation was due to several ideologically-motivated clashes within the ERP that resulted in the execution of the revolutionary leader and poet Roque Dalton and Armando Arteaga, both in the hands of the ERP's high command. Lil and Roque had maintained a romantic relationship that ended abruptly in with Dalton's death. == Kidnap and death == An early morning in November 1976, Lil Milagro is captured by members of the now-extinct Guardia Nacional (GN) during a search of the house where she had been staying in San Antonio del Monte, Sonsonate. Professor Manuel Rivera, member of the executive council of the National Salvadoran Association of Educators (ANDES 21 de junio), is also captured and killed, receiving two bullets; Lil, on the other hand, gets shot in the head but survives. Unconscious, she was dragged by her captors as if she were dead, which prompted eye-witnesses to the event to declare her deceased the day after. She was taken to facilities of the Customs Police, where she was tortured using Truth serum. In late-December, 1976, Lil Milagro is transferred to the secret prisons of the National Guard, where she would again be tortured. She remained in these prisons, living under extreme, inhumane conditions,Informe de la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, OEA. Caso 2892, Capítulo III. El Salvador, 1978. until she was murdered on October 17, 1979, two days after the coup d'état that overthrew President Carlos Humberto Romero and placed the Junta Revolucionaria de Gobierno in power. Her remains were never given back to her family. == Her legacy == Lil Milagro de la Esperanza Ramírez Huezo Córdoba is one of the many martyrs left by the violent Salvadoran Civil War, which ended with the Chapultepec Peace Accords signed on January 16, 1992, more than 12 years after her death. Several organizations have taken Lil's name, e.g. the Women's Association for Democracy \\"Lil Milagro Ramírez\\" and the Women's Rights Commission \\"Lil Milagro Ramírez\\" (CEMUJER), among others. Her love for literature was recorded in the many poems she wrote, including some for children. A collection of poems by Lil Milagro was published in 2003 by the Literature Department of the University of El Salvador (UES), titled “Del Hombre, del tiempo y del amor.” A biographical book is currently being prepared, which will include newly- discovered documents such as letters about her militancy, correspondence while living in clandestinity, photographs, etc. == See also == * Salvadoran Civil War * Chapultepec Peace Accords * History of El Salvador * Latin America–United States relations == References == === Bibliography === *Martínez, Ana Guadalupe: Las cárceles clandestinas.

Architecturally an unremarkable hall church, its most recognizable feature is a series of frescoes painted on both internal and external walls, dated to the 14th–15th century. Beyond religious scenes and portraits, the paintings include a rare illustration of episodes from the epic romance on Amiran-Darejaniani. The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. == Location == The Crucifixion, a fresco on the northern internal wall. The Lashtkhveri church stands at the southwestern edge of the village of Lashtkhveri (Laštxver), at 1380 m above sea level, in the Lenjeri territorial unit of the Mestia Municipality, at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus. This part of Svaneti was known as Free Svaneti in the 19th century. There are no contemporary literary sources on the construction and history of Lashtkhveri. The church and the items preserved in it were first described, in details, by the scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili during his expedition to Svaneti in 1910. == Layout == Amiran-Darejaniani, a fresco on the northern outer wall. The Archangel is a small and architecturally simple hall church, based on a two-step socle and built of neatly cut limestone blocks. The nave is divided up into two nearly equal bays by a pair of arched pilasters. The building can be entered from the west through a rectangular doorway with an internal arched tympanum. The church is lit by four windows, cut one each in the sanctuary and west wall and two in the east wall, one of them shedding light directly on the fresco depiction of an equestrian Saint George on the opposing wall. The sanctuary contains two arched niches, on either side of the window. The window frames on the exterior are decorated in carved stonework. The church is crowned by a simple cornice. Annexed to the west wall is a chamber built at a later date and roofed with blocks of wood. === Frescoes === The church is avidly adorned with frescoes, dated to the latter half of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th. The style of the paintings is a local take on the late Byzantine Palaeologan art, executed in a characteristically coarse manner. Inside the building, the conch and walls bear a series of frescoes depicting a Christological cycle, church fathers, and various saints. The outer walls also contain frescoes—now partly faded—including the hunting of Saint Eustace on the east façade, haloed horsemen on the south, the Deesis on the west, and uniquely, scenes from the medieval Georgian romance Amiran-Darejaniani on the north. The paintings are accompanied by explanatory inscriptions in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:14th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Svaneti ","title":"Lashtkhveri church"},{"id":"61604061","text":"¥eah ¥eah ¥eah No is the third official EP by multi-instrumentalist and Dutch singer Jett Rebel. The EP was released on January 18, 2019 without any announcement. The first and only single of this EP was launched on June 7, 2019, Waiting For The Weekend. This coincided with Rebel's first encounter in England. On June 11, 2019, Rebel put on his first show in Notting Hill Arts Club in London. ==Single== In an interview with the Ventsmagazine, Rebel explains what Waiting For The Weekend is about, The song is about the drag of everyday life, the boring life. I feel so many of us are waiting for the “weekend”. Personally I don’t really have this separation between weekdays and weekend anymore, because I work all the time. If I happen to have a real day off, it’s usually rather a Monday or Tuesday. “The Weekend” so the weekend is whenever we are free to be who we wanna be, and to do what we wanna do. '' ==Recording== ¥eah ¥eah ¥eah No was recorded live at the Wisseloord Studios. For the second time Rebel went into the studio with the power trio Jett Rebel 3, this time with drummer Willem van der Krabben and bassist Xander Vrienten. This is also the 2nd time Rebel chooses not to do everything on his own, just like in 2016 when recording the album Don't Die On Me Now. \\"Everything you hear on the record sounds exactly as it should be, Rebel says to music news from the UK\\". For this EP there are 3 extra tracks played live but in the end they didn't make it to the EP. Tracks: Lady On The Hill, Bleed Me An Ocean and Slowdancer. These tracks are regularly played live during performances at festivals or a tour. Something he does more often during his live shows, performing unreleased work. ==Track listening== All songs written by Jett Rebel # # \\"Waiting For The Weekend\\" - 1:58 # \\"Take Me\\" - 3:23 # \\"Dancing Through The Room\\" - 3:34 # \\"Do You Want Me\\" - 3:29 # \\"I See You\\" - 4:25 ==Personnel== The EP is written, composed, arranged and produced by Jett Rebel. Audio engineering by Felix Tournier. Mixing by Peter Kriek. Darcy Proper did the mastering in the Wisseloord Studios. Recorded live: * Jett Rebel - Lead vocals, guitar * Xander Vrienten - Bass guitar * Willem van der Krabben - drums The EP ¥eah ¥eah ¥eah No is only available digitally. The artwork concept is by Jett Rebel, the picture on the cover was photographed by Jens van der Velde: \\"Jett Rebel artistically challenged me to ask more gray than black in this picture for his latest EP ¥eah ¥eah ¥eah No. Fortunately, the picture was taken in daylight. One take, not a post-production, just like he recorded his tracks\\". ¥eah ¥eah ¥eah No has been released on record label Baby Tiger Records, his own label. ==Reception== The English media has paid particular attention to the ¥eah ¥eah ¥eah No EP. The reviews were positive. RT Lee in review for Subba-Cultcha: With ‘Waiting for the Weekend’ Jett Rebel is serving up a perfect slice of 50s rock ‘n’ roll infused punk-pop. It’s big, it's sexy and it's glamorous. A guaranteed, solid-gold earworm of a single, ‘Waiting for the Weekend’ shouts open road, top down, summer-time fun – play & repeat.

Their home was in an area surrounded by Tory neighbors, and after her older sons went off to fight, Rosanna and her younger children were left unprotected. She was proud though, to have four of her sons fighting for liberty and independence. Back at home, Rosanna and her daughters often had to hide food, and slept with pistols or weapons under their pillows in the chance that they might need them. One night in 1780, the Farrow household was awoken by a voice at their gate that informed them that three of the Farrow sons had been captured by the British and were imprisoned at the Ninety-Six District, South Carolina. Hearing that the British Colonel John Cruger would be willing to release her sons in exchange for British prisoners, Rosanna Waters Farrow sprung into action. She gave her daughters directions to keep the windows and doors closed, and to allow no one except friends into the home. She grabbed a rifle, saddled the one remaining horse on the property, and rode off into the darkness of the night to rescue her sons. She arrived at the patriot camp, and petitioned James Williams (Revolutionary War) to grant her six of the captured British soldiers and a guard to make the exchange. He granted her this request, and she set off towards the British camp. Rosanna was just in time, as the British were preparing to hang her sons at sunrise. It is reported that at the close of the exchange Rosanna Waters Farrow told Colonel John Cruger \\"I have given you two for one, Colonel Cruger, but understand that I consider it the best trade I ever made, for rest assured hereafter the 'Farrow boys' will whip you four to one.\\", “Rosanna Farrow, a South Carolina Revolutionary War Heroine.” Colonial Quills, n.d. https://colonialquills.blogspot.com/2011/10/rosanna-farrow-south- carolina.html. , Waters, Philemon Berry, Herbert M.

It was recognised by the Aero Club of Great Britain making it Britain's first official air show. == Creation of the show == The organising committee of the Lancashire Aero Club at Blackpool in 1909 In the six years following the Wright Brothers's first powered flight aviation had spread across the world. France had become the centre of European flight. In July 1909, Louis Blériot became the first person to cross the English Channel in a powered aircraft. In August 1909, inspired by the accomplishments of the French, Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the Daily Mail wrote to the Blackpool Corporation suggesting they hold their own air show. The Mayor of Blackpool led a delegation to the Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne in Rheims and in early September the Corporation started planning for their own event. Over £6000 in prize funds was raised, primarily the Corporation, Lord Northcliffe and Sir Thomas Lipton. In order to run the event, the Lancashire Aero Club was formed in August 1909. The club then leased land from a local golf course about south of Blackpool. The golf course was converted over the course of six weeks, with the Ministry of Labour paid for 200 unemployed men to build the course, complete with grandstands, a clubhouse and hangars. == The event == The club aimed to attract the leading airmen of the age. French pilots including Henri Farman, Louis Paulhan, Hubert Latham, Henri Rougier and Alfred Leblanc entered, as did British pioneer Alliott Verdon Roe. === 18 October === Around 60,000 spectators attended the first day of the event. The day was sunny with light breezes, which made for good conditions for flying. Roe made the first attempt at a flight, in a triplane of his own design, but he failed to take off. Farman was the first to fly at the event, completing half of the main circuit using \\"Gypaète\\" – a plane owned by Paulhan. At his second attempt Farman became the first pilot to complete a full circuit of the course; Paulhan then took over his aircraft plane and flew another lap. Later in the day, Farman flew seven laps at a maximum recorded speed of . Rougier recorded the day's longest flight at nine laps – a distance of – in his Voisin aircraft. Leblanc flew one lap in his Blériot Aéronautique aircraft. === 19 October === The second day of the week suffered from higher winds which increased during the day. The first flight was by Latham, who crashed his Antoinette after half a lap. Roe managed two short flights in the early afternoon, followed by Paulhan who completed eight laps of the course in difficult conditions. === 20 October === Mortimer Singer attempted a flight in his Voisin around noon on the third day, but failed to take off, as did Blackpool Councillor A. Parkinson in his Blériot aircraft. Farman then took off, and completed 24 laps of the course before cramp caused him to land. He had flown in 1 hour 32 minutes, recording the longest flight of the week. === 21, 22 and 23 October === No flying took place on Thursday, 21 October due to high winds. Friday morning saw further wind, but Latham managed two complete laps in his repaired Antoinette in the afternoon. Heavy rain on Saturday 23 October meant that Latham's was the last flight of the originally scheduled Week. === 25 October === Because several days had been lost during the official Week, the organising committee decided to extend the event on the following Monday and Tuesday. Monday 25 October saw further wind and rain, and the extended event was officially canceled. However, the afternoon saw enough improvement in the weather that several pilots attempted flight, though only Roe was able to take off, and he only managed a short flight of about . == Prizes == The Manchester Guardian newspaper offered a cup and £100 for the slowest complete circuit of the course won by Latham for a lap at . Michelin gave £1000 towards the prize for the longest distance travelled, the total amount being £2000. This was won by Farman. Farman also won the £400 Daily Sketch prize for highest speed over any three laps, and the Daily Mail £1000 prize for the fastest lap. ==Notes== == Bibliography == * == References == Category:Airshows in the United Kingdom Category:Blackpool Category:Aviation history of the United Kingdom ","title":"Blackpool Aviation Week 1909"},{"id":"61604493","text":"Dilesi railway station () is a railway station outside the town of Dilesi, in Boeotia, Greece.

She moved to the Universities Space Research Association in 1995, where she spent six years as a staff scientist. In 2001 she became a scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center. She studies the Van Allen radiation belts during geomagnetic storms and active times. She has studied the ring current and their role in magnetosphere – ionosphere coupling. Example of her Neutral Atom Imaging work Fok developed the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere model (CIMI), a bounce-averaged kinetic model that can calculate the plasma fluxes within the ring current regions of the radiation belt. Fok's CIMI model is currently being used to predict the fluxes observed by the Van Allen Probes. CIMI takes in information about magnetic fields, electric potentials, quiet-time conductances and solar wind speed, and outputs information about ion fluxes, plasmasphere density and ionspheric potentials. Using the model Fok found that the main phase pressure of the magnetosphere was not created by the solar wind, but instead dominated by energetic protons from the plasmasphere. Fok was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for the development of CIMI. Her citation read “For creation of state-of-the-art numerical models that account for the complex couplings between the solar wind, radiation belts, ring current, ionosphere and magnetosphere\\". Alongside creating the CIMI model, Fok works on Neutral Atom Imaging, and her modelling tools were used in both the IMAGE and TWINS missions. === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 2011 NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal * 2019 Elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union === Selected publications === Her publications include; * * * == References == Category:Living people Category:Chinese University of Hong Kong people Category:NASA people Category:Eastern Michigan University alumni Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:Fellows of the American Geophysical Union Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mei-Ching Fok"},{"id":"61604535","text":"Gubernatorial elections were held in Massachusetts on November 2, 1926.

Ely, an unsuccessful candidate for Governor in 1922, was tapped by the party leadership so that the party could present an ethnically diverse and geographically balanced ticket. On August 28, Dooley dropped out of the race and endorsed Ely in order to unite the party. As Dooley did not exit the race before the August 13 deadline for withdrawals, his name remained on the ballot, however it was believed that Dooley's support of Ely would result in Ely easily winning the primary. Dooley ended up winning the primary with the support of Irish Americans. Dooley refused the nomination as did Ely, who believed the means to be an embarrassment (but officially cited his mother's illness as his reason for declining). Dooley was replaced on the general election ballot by Fall River Mayor Edmond P. Talbot.

Picture from the National Archives of Norway. The Førergarde ('leader guard' in Norwegian) was the personal guard of Vidkun Quisling, the leader of the puppet Norwegian government during World War II. The Førergarde was founded in April 1942. At first, it numbered about 150 people personally selected by Quisling from the members of Hird, the paramilitary wing of the fascist Nasjonal Samling party (NS). They were his most trusted fighters, also performing special tasks. Over time, the unit grew to the size of a company of 250-300 people. They were also recruited from the front veterans of the Volunteer Norwegian Legion and SS-Polizei-Battaillon 506. On August 17, 1943, the Førergarde, together with the police and the Hird organization, formally joined the Norwegian Armed Forces. The organization was headed by sveitfører Per Carlson (April 20, 1942 - April 1, 1944), Sverre Henschien (until February 1945) and sveitfører Sophus Kahrs (until May 9, 1945).

Released in 1981 on the Misfits' EP 3 Hits from Hell, the song was written by frontman and vocalist Glenn Danzig while in jail in Brixton, England with then-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele. After having traveled to the United Kingdom for an ill-fated tour with the British punk rock group the Damned in late 1979, Danzig and Steele were arrested for their involvement in a fight, inspiring them to create the song. ==Background== The Rainbow Theatre in London, where Glenn Danzig and Bobby Steele were arrested in December 1979 In June 1979, the Misfits shared a bill with the Damned during a performance at the nightclub Hurrah in New York City. After the gig, Misfits bassist Jerry Only briefly spoke with vocalist David Vanian of the Damned, along with the Damned's management, about the idea of the Misfits supporting the Damned during the latter's scheduled six-date tour of England that fall. On November 21, 1979, the Misfits flew to the United Kingdom for the tour, but the Damned, having scheduled a different opening act for their tour, was not expecting the Misfits' arrival. Nevertheless, the Damned's management booked the Misfits for the tour. Problems soon arose for the Misfits—they did not receive any payment for performing on the tour, and they felt that the instruments and equipment supplied for them were substandard. The Misfits first opened for the Damned on November 23 at De Montfort Hall in Leicester, England. Not long after, the Misfits cancelled their remaining appearances on the Damned tour. On December 2, Danzig and then-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele went to watch the Jam perform a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, where they were confronted by a group of skinheads. Steele left to find help from authorities, and Danzig armed himself with either a glass bottle or a broken shard of glass from one of the venue's windows. Both he and Steele were arrested, and they spent two nights in jail in Brixton, England. According to Steele in 1993, \\"I just turned to Glenn [in the cell and] said, 'We should make a song about this called \\"London Dungeon\\"'. We were like sitting in this cell, it was like ten feet perfectly square, you know, solid painted walls, it was real echoey in the room [...] and we were just like slapping the beat out on our legs and humming [...] Glenn took it from there.\\" Steele and Danzig were released from jail on December 4. On December 15, then-Misfits drummer Joey Image flew back to the United States by himself, effectively quitting the band. On December 18, the rest of the Misfits returned to New Jersey. ==Recording and release== \\"London Dungeon\\" was first recorded in August 1980 at Master Sound Productions in Franklin Square, New York, and was released as the A-side of the Misfits' EP 3 Hits from Hell in 1981. On their 1982 album Walk Among Us, as the track \\"Mommy Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight?\\" (which was recorded on December 17, 1981 at the Ritz in New York City) fades out, the opening of \\"London Dungeon\\" can be heard. \\"London Dungeon\\" was later reissued on the 1986 compilation album Misfits (also known as Collection I), which would later be included in the 1996 boxed set The Misfits. ==Critical reception== In 2012, Aaron Lariviere of Stereogum ranked \\"London Dungeon\\" No. 4 on his list of best Misfits songs, praising \\"The stuttering snare, the ominous bass, and that infectious, near- metal, goth-baiting guitar [...] Despite their origins and the roughshod execution of most of the songs, the Misfits were capable of serious songcraft, as proven here.\\" In 2015, \\"London Dungeon\\" was ranked No. 71 by the staff of the British magazine Time Out on their list of best songs about London. ==Personnel== The Misfits * Glenn Danzig – vocals * Bobby Steele – guitar, backing vocals * Jerry Only – bass guitar, backing vocals Production * Dave Achelis – engineering * Rich Flores – mastering ==See also== *Misfits discography ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Full lyrics of \\"London Dungeon\\" at MetroLyrics Category:1981 songs Category:Misfits (band) songs Category:Horror punk songs Category:Songs written by Glenn Danzig Category:Songs about London Category:Songs about prison ","title":"London Dungeon (song)"},{"id":"61604653","text":"King's Bounty II is an upcoming turn-based tactical role-playing game developed by 1C Entertainment and published by Deep Silver by that will be released on Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2021.

Either the imprisonment or the death of the sultan would have caused a panic among the Ottomans, which could have enabled Vlad to defeat the Ottoman army. However, the Wallachians \\"missed the court of the sultan himself\\" and attacked the tents of the viziers Mahmut Pasha and Isaac. Having failed to attack the sultan's camp, Vlad and his retainers left the Ottoman camp at dawn. Mehmed entered Târgoviște at the end of June. The town had been deserted, but the Ottomans were horrified to discover a \\"forest of the impaled\\" (thousands of stakes with the carcasses of executed people), according to Chalkokondyles. == Credits and personnel == * Attila Dorn – vocals * Matthew Greywolf – lead and rhythm guitar * Charles Greywolf – lead and rhythm guitar, bass guitar * Roel van Helden – drums, percussion * Falk Maria Schlegel – organ, keyboards * Jens Bogren – mastering * Sam Braun – engineer * David Buballa – engineer * Charles Greywolf – engineer * Matthew Greywolf – artwork, layout * Kristian \\"Kohle\\" Kohlmannslehner – engineer * Manuela Meyer – photography * Fredrik Nordström – mixing * Henrik Udd – mixing == References == == External links == * Category:Powerwolf songs Category:2015 singles Category:2015 songs Category:Napalm Records singles ","title":"Armata Strigoi"},{"id":"61604709","text":"To Hell in a Handbag: The Secret Lives of Canon Chasuble and Miss Prism is a 2016 play by Irish actor/writers Helen NortonHelen Norton at IMDb and Jonathan White.Jonathan White at IMDb It deals with two minor characters from Oscar Wilde’s play The Importance of Being Earnest.Event of the week: To Hell in a Handbag by Peter Crawley, The Irish Times, August 24, 2019 ==Plot== Much as Tom Stoppard did with two of Hamlet’s attendant lords in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, the play To Hell in a Handbag explores its protagonists lives when they are not onstage in Wilde’s original. Beginning with their walk “to the schools and back” in Wilde’s Act II, we begin to learn how these well- educated but impecunious individuals have survived on the lower rungs of Victorian society. Continuing with their time offstage in Act III, we learn that far from being the models of propriety they appear in public, both have been forced to make ends meet in less than ethical and legal fashion. They find themselves mutually dependent to ensure their survival. But no sooner has The Importance ended happily, than one of the duo turns the tables on the other. ==Productions== To Hell in a Handbag was originally seen in the Dublin Fringe Festival in September 2016. Supported by the Show in a Bag initiativeShow In A Bag Irish Theatre Institute of Dublin Fringe Festival, Fishamble: The New Play Company and the Irish Theatre Institute, it premiered at Bewley’s Café Theatre on September 14th 2016. In 2017, the production was revived at the original venue before travelling to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe where it played a sell-out run at the Assembly Rooms. It then embarked on a nationwide tour of Ireland.

In the Bag Theatre Company staged the play at the Two Sisters Arts Centre, Felixstowe, Suffolk. ==Reception== In its initial runs in Dublin and Edinburgh, the play received a universally positive response. The Irish Times said “Helen Norton and Jonathan White, actors and writers, have pulled off a coup with their enchanting visit to the outer rim of Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest” and that the play “packs extraordinary amounts of plot and top-notch gags into a compact package.”To Hell in a Handbag at Bewley’s Café Theatre Dublin Fringe reviews, The Irish Times, September 16, 2016 The Sunday Independent described it as “wickedly, side-splittingly funny, in a sophisticated, witty and elegant way” and “a joyous romp not to be missed, a worthy homage to its master and progenitor.”From refugees to a famous handbag Theatre & Arts, The Sunday Independent, 24 August 2019 The Observer called it a “comic gem” and “a hoot of an instant classic.”Edinburgh festival 2017 by Clare Brennan, The Guardian, 13 August 2017 ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Entry in Irish Playography Irish Theatre Institute * ‘Improving’ Oscar Wilde: To Hell in a Handbag Account of how the play came to be written by Jonathan White Category:Adaptations of works by Oscar Wilde Category:2016 plays ","title":"To Hell in a Handbag"},{"id":"61604714","text":"John C.

Mallinson, \\"Preserving Machine- Readable Archival Records for the Millenia\\", Archivaria , pp. 147-153 Also at Ampex, Mallinson developed the theory for structures with one-sided magnetic flux. One such structure is the Halbach Array which provides a means of generating powerful, well-confined magnetic fields with permanent magnets. The familiar decorative refrigerator magnet also takes advantage of one-sided flux. Also at Ampex, Mallinson oversaw the development of PRML, a new readback technique for magnetic recording.Computer History Museum: Ampex PRML Prototype In 1984, Mallinson left Ampex to become the founding director of the new Center for Magnetic Recording Research (CMRR)Center for Magnetic Recording Research, UC San DiegoCMRR Report Vol. 1, 1984: Inaugural issue at UC San Diego.

Originally described as a subspecies in 1918, it was recognized as a full species in 2010. It uses echolocation to navigate and find prey, and roosts in caves during the day. ==Taxonomy== Hipposideros atrox was described as a new subspecies of Hipposideros gentilis by Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen in 1918; he described H. gentilis in the same publication. The holotype had been collected by Arthur Lennox Butler in the Malaysian state of Selangor. Hipposideros gentilis has been recognized as a synonym of the Pomona roundleaf bat (Hipposideros pomona). In 1963, British mammalogist John Edwards Hill included H. atrox as a subspecies of the bicolored roundleaf bat (Hipposideros bicolor). However, in 2010 H. atrox was recognized as a distinct species for the first time, which was followed by the IUCN in 2019. ==Description== H. atrox has a forearm length of . Males have an average body weight of while females have an average body weight of . ==Biology and ecology== It is an echolocating species of bat, using constant frequency echolocation. The frequency of maximum energy is approximately 142 kHz. It roosts in sheltered areas during the day such as caves, which it cohabitates with other species of the genus Hipposideros ==Range and habitat== It is native to Southeast Asia where its range includes Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. It has been documented at a range of elevations from above sea level. ==Conservation== As of 2019, H. atrox is considered a least-concern species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because it has a wide geographic range; its population is presumably large; it tolerates human disturbance of the landscape; and it is not thought to be experiencing rapid population decline. ==References== Category:Taxa named by Knud Andersen Category:Hipposideros Category:Bats of Southeast Asia Category:Mammals described in 1918 ","title":"Hipposideros atrox"},{"id":"61604751","text":"An advert for Pearce & Plenty on Oxford Street, 1891 Pearce & Plenty was a chain of working class restaurants in London, formed in the late 19th century.

D.C. law at the time required that alcohol only be served to patrons sitting at a table, so a member of Congress took it upon himself to change the rules to allow for bars and barstool seating in the District. Management of the restaurant was taken over by the Valanos' son, John Valanos and his wife Vasiliki in 1989. Helen Valanos died in 2005, and Connie in 2012. The restaurant comprises two adjoining federal row houses on D Street NE, originally built in 1885. Prior to housing the Monocle it was home to the Station View Spaghetti House. The building is owned by the federal government. ==Connection to U.S. Politics== Given its proximity to the United States Senate and being one of only a few restaurants near the Capitol, The Monocle quickly became a meeting point for members of congress and special interest lobbyists. The Monocle welcomes members of all political parties and considers itself strictly non-partisan. A 1961 column in The Washington Post referred to The Monocle as a \\"dandy place to rubberneck and dine.\\" A 1985 article about the National Corn Growers Association notes the Monocle as a popular place to meet with peers to coordinate strategies, and according to one anecdote, get tipped off by Senate staff in the Monocle parking lot. Former vice president Walter Mondale once called the restaurant a place \\"where laws are debated, where policies are set, where the course of world history is changed.\\" ===Watergate=== The Monocle made an appearance in the testimony of Gerald Alch, former attorney for James W. McCord Jr., during the 1973 Watergate hearings. Alch and McCord discussed the CIA's involvement in the cover-up at the Monocle in December 1972. ===Present Day=== It's not uncommon for industry lobbying groups and the companies they represent to pay for meals and events at The Monocle. In 2012 former senator Russ Feingold was quoted as saying, \\"It's not that lobbyist themselves give huge campaign contributions, it's that they become conduits for collecting large contributions. So in Washington typically a member of the House or Senate will be having, quote, a ‘fundraiser’, and the lobbyist will bring in a few people and a bunch of checks, and this, you know, this is the same lobbyist who is arranging to have meetings to talk to this guy about policy in his office the next day—hopefully they’re not doing the same thing in the office because that’s illegal—but I mean, it’s across the street. You know, at the 201 Club or the Monocle.\\" Despite the modernization of other aspects of conducting federal business, the Monocle continues to be a location for exchanging ideas and influence. A government relations specialist is quoted in 2018 as saying, \\"How we do government relations now is essentially the same way we have always done it: people having drinks at the Monocle and chitchatting and exchanging paper.\\" One byproduct of the steady stream of notable patrons is that the Valanos family has been able to amass a large number of autographed headshots. The restaurant regularly has 300-400 of the more than 1,000 photographs on display, in a collection that is continually in rotation as politics evolve. ==References== Category:Restaurants in Washington, D.C.

In 2015, he had a successful trial with Bilbao-based youth club Danok Bat CF; it took until the latter part of his season there to establish himself in the team in the 'Juvenil' league, but by its end he had drawn interest from senior clubs. On 3 June 2016, after finishing his formation, Larrazabal signed for newly- promoted Segunda División B side Zamudio SD. He made his senior debut on 27 August 2016, playing the entire second half in a 1–3 home loss to Bilbao Athletic, and scored his first goal on 10 December by netting the last in a 3–1 home defeat of CD Toledo. He finished the campaign with three goals in 29 appearances, although Zamudio finished bottom of the table and were relegated. On 5 April 2017, Larrazabal agreed to a two-year contract with Athletic Bilbao, effective as of 1 July; upon arriving, he was assigned to the B-team. He spent two seasons with Bilbao Athletic in the third tier, playing regularly for the team and scoring nine goals in 2018–19. On 14 May 2019, Larrazabal agreed to a new two-year deal with the Lions, being definitely promoted to the main squad. He made his first team – and La Liga – debut on 24 August, coming on as a substitute for Óscar de Marcos in a 1–1 draw away to Getafe CF. On 2 October 2020, Larrazabal terminated his contract with the Lions, and agreed to a three-year deal with Segunda División side Real Zaragoza just hours later; Athletic also retained a two-year buyback clause. ==International career== Larrazabal made his debut for the unofficial Basque Country national team in May 2019, in a 0–0 draw away to Panama for which a small, youthful and inexperienced squad was selected. ==Personal life== Larrazabal's father is Aitor Larrazábal, who made over 400 appearances for Athletic Bilbao as a defender between 1990 and 2004 and later became a manager, and whose goal celebrations included producing a pacifier from his shorts to represent his baby sons. They met as opponents when Gaizka was playing for Zamudio and Aitor in charge of SD Amorebieta, and again when Bilbao Athletic faced Barakaldo CF. In 2002, Aitor lined up in the same Athletic Bilbao team as Aritz Aduriz, who was also on the field for Gaizka's debut for the club nearly 17 years later. The Larrazabals were the first father and son to play for Athletic since goalkeepers Carmelo and Andoni Cedrún, and the first to both feature for the Basque Country team since 'Periko' and Xabi Alonso. ==References* Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Bilbao Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda División B players Category:Danok Bat CF players Category:Zamudio SD players Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:Real Zaragoza players Category:Basque Country international footballers ","title":"Gaizka Larrazabal"},{"id":"61604854","text":"Madagascar–Spain relations are the bilateral and diplomatic relations between these two countries.

The phone is made of a solid polycarbonate body with a high-gloss finish, and is available in two colours: Black or Steel. The device front has a dewdrop notch and relatively thin bezels, with a chin at the bottom with the Nokia logo. The overall design and size are similar to that of the mid-range Nokia 6.1 Plus/X6.

It is a simple hall church which was extensively frescoed by Mikael Maglakeli in 1140. The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. == Location == The church of the Savior stands on a hilltop above the settlement of Matskhvarishi at the west end of Latali community in what is now Mestia Municipality, at 1360 m above sea level. This part of Svaneti was known as Free Svaneti in the 19th century. The church housed a collection of Byzantine and Georgian church items which were catalogued by the scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili during his expedition to Svaneti in 1910. == Layout == Matskhvar is a hall church, with an ambulatory annexed to the south façade. It is built of regular lines of well-hewn limestone block. Inside the church, a spacious bay is divided by a pair of two-step longitudinal wall pilasters from which springs a single arch, supporting the vault. The church is lit by four windows, one each in the sanctuary and west wall and two in the south wall. These latter two are arranged in an unusual manner: the western window is cut above the wall arch and the southern one below it. The church has three entrances—one each on the east, south, and north—rectangular in shape and topped by an arched tympanum internally. Arched niches flank the window in the sanctuary. The ambulatory was added to the southern end of the church at a later date. Of this structure only a sanctuary and arcade are original; it was remodeled in 1986. The outer walls are plain and were once plastered; the south façade bears traces of old frescoes. The south door is a 10th–11th-century decorative woodwork which is attributed by an accompanying inscription to Kvirike Agiduliani. === Frescoes === The coronation of Demetre I (photo by Jaba Labadze, 2018). The interior of the church is entirely frescoed, but the paintings are now damaged. They are dated by an inscription to 1140 and credited to Mikael Maghlakeli. The sanctuary is traditionally adorned with the Deesis. Below it is a group of the Apostles, while the walls of the nave and conch contain a Christological cycle arranged in three registers and a series of haloed horseman, a recurrent image in the medieval Svan mural art. In the western arch of the north wall there is a scene of coronation in which King Demetre I of Georgia () is shown being simultaneously blessed by Christ, crowned by the archangel Gabriel, and girded with a sword by two dignitaries, local eristavi. As the art historian Antony Eastmond has shown the depiction of Demetre's coronation celebrates the creation of royal power, while emphasizing the role of the local aristocracy. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:11th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Svaneti Category:11th-century establishments in the Kingdom of Georgia ","title":"Matskhvarishi church of the Savior"},{"id":"61604926","text":"350px Horse Frightened by a Thunderstorm or White Horse Frightened by a ThunderstormElisabeth Hardouin-Fugier, Le peintre et l'animal en France au XIXe siècle, Éditions de l'Amateur, 2001, 367 p., page 147 is a watercolour on paper work by Eugène Delacroix painted sometime between 1824 and 1829, most probably in 1824Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Eugène Delacroix, Hélène Lassalle, Agnes Mongan, Maurice Sérullaz, Ernst Goldschmidt, Palais des beaux- arts (Brussels, Belgium).

Jarcovjáková photographed nightlife, minority groups and marginalised people in the 1970s and 1980s in Prague and West Berlin, and made self portraits. She made diaristic work of her hedonistic lifestyle, and of the inhabitants of a clandestine gay bar that she visited almost nightly, in 1980s Prague, where the Communist state was institutionally homophobic. ==Life and work== Jarcovjáková was born in Prague in what was then the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Her parents were painters. She studied for an MA at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. At the end of the 1970s she undertook a creative residency in Japan for several months. In 1985 Jarcovjáková moved to West Berlin and in 1992 returned to Prague. She has been teaching photography since the 1990s, currently doing so at the College of Graphic Design and the Secondary School of Graphic Design (VOŠ a SPŠ Grafická v Praze) in Prague. Jarcovjáková's written diaries and photographs from Prague, West Berlin and Tokyo between 1971 and 1987, were published in the 2016 book Černé Roky (The Black Years). Between 1983 and 1985, Jarcovjáková photographed the inhabitants of a clandestine gay bar in Prague, called T-Club, which she frequented almost every night, using black and white film and a flash. Her other subjects at this time were herself and Vietnamese and Cuban economic migrants. Though sex between people of the same gender was decriminalised in Czechoslovakia in 1962, people continued to be imprisoned for being openly gay. Because the work depicted her own sexual deviance as well as that of people at T-Club, it was not shown until 2008 and was published in 2019 as Evokativ. Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, described the work as having an \\"edgy diaristic approach, laying bare a life lived recklessly amid a period of political repression\\" [. . .] \\"images that pay little attention to formal concerns, but nevertheless capture a time and milieu in an uncompromising way.\\" ==Publications== ===Publications by Jarcovjáková=== *Černé Roky: 1971–1987 = The Black Years: 1971–1987.

In the aftermath of the fall of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I and the consequent reorganization of ecclesiastical jurisdictions, Smets served as Apostolic Visitor to Baghdad in 1919–1921. On 13 January 1922, Pope Benedict XV named him Apostolic Delegate to Persia (now Iran). On 2 August Pope Pius XI appointed him a titular archbishop. He received his episcopal consecration on 28 October from Cardinal Willem van Rossum. While holding that diplomatic post, he also served as Apostolic Administrator of the Caucasus, though Bolshevik control forced him to reside in Tehran, where he witnessed the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925.

He was also notable as a patron of the painter Eugene Delacroix. ==Life== Portrait of Louis-Auguste Schwiter by Delacroix (1826-1830) - he was the general's son. Born at Rueil- Malmaison, he joined the Swiss Guards Regiment as a child on 31 July 1772. He rose to corporal on 31 December 1785 and transferred to the Constitutional Guard on 15 January 1792. On 6 September the same year he volunteered for a company of 'les Quatres-Nations', in which he was promoted to corporal five days later. On 23 September he became a sergeant in the Pont-neuf Battalion (later known as the 19th Paris Volunteer Battalion), rising to sergeant-major on 9 November, sub-lieutenant on 18 November and captain adjutant-major on 3 April 1793. He was attached to the 88th Infantry Demi-Brigade on 21 March 1794 as part of the armée de la Moselle, with which he was wounded on 30 December 1795 at the Siege of Mannheim. On 21 January 1796 he transferred to the 103rd Line Infantry Demi-Brigade and was captured by the Austrians in June 1796. He was freed on 19 July 1797 and rejoined his regiment, serving with the armies of the Rhine, Helvetia and the Danube between 1797 and 1801. He rejoined the army of Hanover in 1803 and was made a knight of the Légion d’honneur on 5 November 1804. He was put in command of a battalion of the 57th Line Infantry Regiment and took part in the Austrian, Prussian and Polish campaigns between 1805 and 1807. He was made colonel of the 55th Line Infantry Regiment on 22 June 1807 and baron of the empire on 10 September 1808. He was sent to the Peninsula in 1808, where was wounded again on 16 May 1811 at the Battle of Albuera. He was made an officer of the Légion d’honneur on 11 July 1811 and promoted to brigadier-general on 4 September 1812 and took command of the 2nd Brigade of the 4th Division of the French forces operating in southern Spain on 16 July 1813. His left leg was seriously wounded in the Siege of Pamplona and had to be amputated, after which he was allowed to return to France on 6 October 1813. The restored Louis XVIII made him a knight of the Order of Saint-Louis on 1 November 1814, but during the Hundred Days Napoleon put him in charge of organising the regiments of the 1st Military Division on 24 April 1815 and command of Le Havre on 11 May. He was retired from the army after Napoleon's final fall. He died at Nancy. ==References== ==Sources== *http://www.napoleon- series.org/military/organization/c_frenchinf6.html#Schwiter *http://thierry.pouliquen.free.fr/Generaux/gnxS.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20150122235845/http://thierry.pouliquen.free.fr/noblesse/NoblesseScSe.htm *http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD;_1=COTE&VALUE;_1=LH%2F2487%2F80 *Léon Hennet, Les volontaires nationaux pendant la Révolution, tome 3, Paris, Maison Quantin, 1906, p. 17. * Carnet de Sabretache, volume 5, Paris, J.

It supports a successful group of 44 people in Flintshire, Tri Ffordd, which produces handcrafted horticultural goods. In May 2013, it merged with Self Unlimited, another charity set up in the 1960s to provide support for people with learning disabilities. It runs a regular Sector Pulse Check on organisations providing social care that aims to provide an annual snapshot of the financial health of the sector. In June 2019 it submitted evidence to the Low Pay Commission that social care staff are being commissioned at significantly lower rates of pay, compared to local authorities. Social care is typically commissioned at the National Living Wage. The Department of Health and Social Care pays even its lowest paid staff significantly more. It produced a report with Tunstall Healthcare which was launched in the House of Lords in 2019 highlighting the untapped potential of assistive technology in social care which was welcomed by the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group. In July 2019 it called for an end to “perverse” commissioning practices that are “negatively impacting” productivity and financial stability in the adult social care sector. It said that input-based by-hour contracts gave “no incentive” for providers to innovate or deliver anything other than one hour of support. == References == == External links == *hft Category:Charities for disabled people based in the United Kingdom Category:Charities based in Bristol ","title":"Hft"},{"id":"61605249","text":"Mauritius–Spain relations are the bilateral and diplomatic relations between these two countries.

The associated faculty members, researchers, and students have been recognized for their research contributions, having been awarded 19 Nobel Prizes, four National Medals of Science, and two Wolf Prizes in Physics. Notable professors, researchers, and graduate students affiliated with the department include Albert Einstein, Richard Phillips Feynman, Joseph H. Taylor, Eugene P. Wigner, and John von Neumann. In addition, the department offers degree programs for bachelor's students (A.B.) and doctoral students (Ph.D.). ==History== In 1832, the first classes in physics at Princeton were taught by Joseph Henry, who later served as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and President of the National Academy of Sciences. Henry taught as a Professor of Natural Philosophy from 1832 to 1846, during which he earned a salary of $1,000 per year. Additional scholars that joined Princeton's physics department included Cyrus Fogg Brackett, William Magie, and Henry B. Fine. In 1873, Brackett became an adviser to the trustees in order to expand funding for scientific subjects. He later founded the department of electrical engineering and wrote the Textbook of Physics (1884) for his classes. In 1909, the Palmer Laboratory was established for use between the departments of physics and of electrical engineering.In 1925, four new professors were hired: Henry D. Smyth, Allen G. Shenstone, Louis A. Turner, and Charles Zahn. The hiring of these scholars sparked new interests in research on atomic energy and nuclear physics. In 1927, Arthur Compton was the first faculty member at Princeton win the Nobel Prize in Physics.The physics department officially became independent from the engineering school in 1929. Following this separation, professors Philip Morse and Robert Van de Graaff joined the faculty. Later, theoretical physics grew in popularity with the hiring of Eugene P. Wigner and John von Neumann. Along with Oskar Morgenstern, a professor in the economics department, Wigner and John Archibald Wheeler were part of the Princeton Three, who sought to establish a national science laboratory as part of the American space race. The department was once the home of Albert Einstein. Einstein first visited Princeton in 1921 where he delivered the Stafford Little lectures on the theory of relativity. The following year, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics. He then returned to the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in 1922. Einstein's office was located in room 109 Fine Hall. While Einstein was not a professor and did not teach classes, he worked on his theory of relativity at Princeton and occasionally gave lectures on his research. John Archibald Wheeler, a professor of physics at Princeton (1938-1976) was influential in spearheading interests in general relativity in the United States after World War II. He is known for pioneering the term black holes in 1967, identifying them as objects with gravitational collapse, alongside physicist Robert H. Dicke. He has also conducted research on wormholes and the one-electron universe hypothesis. ==Academics== ===Undergraduates=== The undergraduate curriculum offers flexibility for students interested in a wide range of subfields within the discipline. After completing a set of five prerequisite courses, students must take additional courses in quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, experimental physics, and complex analysis. Physics concentrators are required to complete a junior paper as a preliminary investigation into a senior thesis topic. Students are able to conduct research with faculty, either during the school year or the summer, through various programs at the university. Undergraduate courses are taught in small classes, and students receive direct feedback and support from faculty members throughout their time in the program. ===Graduates=== The graduate school offers a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in both theoretical physics and experimental physics. The strengths of the department include particle physics, gravity and cosmology, nuclear and atomic physics, and mathematical physics. ==Rankings== The Princeton Department of Physics is often ranked high in national and international rankings. According to US News, Princeton is ranked as No. 3 in Physics. In the World University Rankings 2019, Princeton was ranked as No. 1 in physical sciences. By research output, the department is tied for No. 1 with Harvard University, University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ==Notable alumni== Notable alumni are the following: * Kip S.

She has worked for environmental agencies around the world and is known for her work on American carbon culture and climate change. == Early life and education == === Early life === Susan Subak grew up in Oak Park, Illinois. She attended the Lowell School, the Beye School, and Oak Park and River Forest High School (OPRF). While attending OPRF, Subak and a friend started an environmental group — the Student Ecology Corp. The Student Ecology Corp aided the Oak Park Conservatory in collecting seeds that were later used to restore the prairie threatened by the expansion to the local mall. === Education === Subak earned a B.A. at Reed College and later received a Masters in Urban Planning from MIT. In 1995, Subak received her Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences from the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia. In Subak's masters thesis, Assessing Accountability for Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere, she calculates the net anthropogenic carbon release for 130 countries. This analysis provides the first data collection which accounts for carbon released by burning fossil fuels and clearing land. Subak's Ph.D. thesis/dissertation, Methane policy perspectives: towards improved emissions estimation, projection and control, combined the natural and social sciences to construct a more complete methane emissions model. == Research and career == === Research === Subak has 20 years of experience in the field of environmental science. She has had her research published in many peer-reviewed scientific and academic journals. A recent study by Subak for the Stockholm Environmental Institute is the first inventory of greenhouse gas sinks and sources by country. The study was published in Climatic Change. The study, National Greenhouse Gas Accounts: Current Anthropogenic Sources and Sinks, catalogs the major sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions for 142 countries by drawing on previous research from international databases. This inventory allows countries to create climate policies tailored to their specific needs and provides a reference against which countries can judge the effectiveness of their greenhouse gas emission policies. === Career === In the early 2000s, Subak worked at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia where she conducted and published research on the impact of weather on Lyme disease. At the National Center for Atmospheric Research Subak worked with scientists and water utility specialists to guide the response of water utilities to climate change. In the early 1990s Subak worked as a Senior Analyst at the Stockholm Environment Institute's Boston Center, where she created and updated a country-level greenhouse gas inventory. While working for the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the 1990s Subak published a study comparing the environmental and economic impacts of various beef production practices. Subak has also done research for, and in affiliation with, the European Commission, the United Kingdom’s Environmental Agency, the Swiss’ Federal Office of the Environment, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. == Books == In recent years Subak has published two books. The first, Rescue and Flight: American Relief Workers Who Defied the Nazis, published in 2010, tells the story of the Unitarian Service Committee, an offshoot of the Unitarian Universalists, committed to helping European refugees during World War II. Subak was inspired to write her book when she learned that the Unitarian Service Committee helped her Jewish father find refuge in the United States during the Holocaust. The second, The Five-Ton Life: Carbon, America, and the Culture that May Save Us, is an analysis of carbon culture in America. America emits nearly twenty tons of carbon per person, on average. However, some areas emit much less and some much more. By studying pockets of low carbon emissions, Subak brings to light the relationship between social and built environments and carbon footprint. == Awards and honors == In 2018 Subak won the Nautilus Book Award for her book, The Five-Ton Life: Carbon, America, and the Culture that May Save Us. The Five-Ton Life won Silver in the Green Living and Sustainability Category. The Nautilus Book Award is awarded annually to books in a variety of categories that “contribute to the body of knowledge and understanding for a better world.” Other notable recipients of the Nautilus book award include the Dali Lama, Desmund Tutu, and Amy Goodman. * Nautilus Book Award, 2018 * Junior Fellowship, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1983 == References == Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of East Anglia Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American environmentalists Category:Environmental scientists ","title":"Susan Subak"},{"id":"61605434","text":"Ciol or CIOL may refer to: *Chartered Institute of Linguists (CIOL) *Elio Ciol (born 1929), Italian photographer and publisher *Marcia Ciol, Brazilian- American statistician *Rita Ciol (or Sior), main character of anime series Sisters of Wellber ","title":"Ciol"},{"id":"61605463","text":"Tunstall Healthcare is a technology company established in 1957 which specialises in digital health and care services.

She is the creator of the YouTube channel Freelee The BananaGirl, where she talks about her diet, exercise and lifestyle. Her channel accumulated over 780 thousand subscribers and 330 million views. Ratcliffe started her channel to keep a record of her progress and to spread awareness about her diet techniques. In one video, she recalls some of her previous career path choices. She was a bartender, a promoter for an alcohol brand, a snack vendor at a movie theater, a receptionist and for some time she also worked at McDonald’s. She gained online popularity in 2014 after promoting a controversial \\"extreme\\" vegan diet. In 2017, Ratcliffe moved to the jungles of South America where she lives \\"off grid\\" with her partner. ==Popularity== Ratcliffe counters arguments against a high carbohydrate diet with examples of and references to the eating habits of the longest surviving Asian cultures. She maintains that a low fat and low salt diet is the key to effectively extracting nutrition from any kind of diet. It is worth noting that traditional Asian cuisine is typically higher in protein, fat, and salt than her suggested diet, with soy based protein, nuts, legumes, cooked cereal grains, seafood, eggs, modest amounts of poultry and pork often being included, as well as the use of heat. She has been featured in publications such as Men’s Fitness, Huffington Post, Daily Mail and News.com.au. Her YouTube channel is popular with around 780K+ subscribers and over 330 million views. She is also active on other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter where she has amassed a significant following. ===Nickname=== Freelee the Banana Girl draws her nickname from her signature diet, the frugivorous diet, which typically consists of eating mostly fruits. Ratcliffe's fruit of choice was always bananas, earning her the nickname 'Banana Girl'. The \\"Freelee\\" part came naturally as a combination of the word 'Freedom' and her name. === Controversy === The fruitarian diet promoted by Ratcliffe is not considered advisable by many, if not all, mainstream nutritionists. Specifically, there are concerns that raw vegan diets heavy in produce with very few sources of nuts and seeds are too low in protein, essential amino acids, fats, vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium, iodine, iron, and omega 3 fatty acids. These diets are also associated with higher risk of weight gain, diabetes, and tooth decay because of the high sugar content. Ratcliffe has been known for controversial, and scientifically unsubstantiated claims. After the death of teenage makeup guru, Talia Castellano (known as Taliajoy18 on Youtube), Ratcliffe published a video claiming that Castellano's death could have been prevented had she forgone chemotherapy in favor of a raw food vegan diet. Ratcliffe also claimed that chemotherapy was a dangerous, poisonous, and ineffective treatment for cancer. Ratcliffe has claimed that amenorrhea (the absence of her period) for nine months was a sign that her body was healthy and had fewer \\"toxins\\" to flush out via menstruation. In reality, amenorrhea in women of child-bearing age is frequently a result of low body weight, poor nutrition, disordered eating, and other illnesses. Additionally, maintaining living conditions resulting in secondary amenorrhea may result in infertility and osteoporosis, which is not always reversible. There is no scientific evidence that menstruation is a way for the body to \\"flush out toxins.\\" Ratcliffe has made many controversial statements criticizing the appearances of critics, other YouTube personalities, and overweight people in general. Ratcliffe posted a video in which she stated that more deaths were caused in the 9/11 terrorist attacks because of \\"obese people\\" blocking the doors, not allowing \\"fit people\\" to pass through. After the end of her relationship to fellow YouTube personality, Harley 'Durianrider' Johnstone, allegations emerged of physical abuse from both parties and emotional abuse on the part of Ratcliffe. In late 2019, Freelee was criticized for a response video she made to Emma Chamberlain's \\"what I eat in a day\\" video. She criticized Chamberlain's coffee consumption and appearance, and in turn, received negative comments herself. === Books === Ratcliffe has advertised her own self-published e-books outlining her diet principles under the titles, ‘Raw Till 4 Diet’, ‘Go Fruit Yourself’ and ‘My Naked Lunchbox’. These books are written for all vegan and raw food enthusiasts, so they can share their stories and motivate others. == References Category:Cookbook writers Category:Veganism activists Category:Women cookbook writers Category:Chefs of vegan cuisine Category:Women chefs Category:1980 births Category:Australian YouTubers Category:Living people Category:Raw foodists Category:Female YouTubers Category:21st-century Australian women Category:21st-century Australian writers Category:21st-century Australian non-fiction writers Category:Australian women activists Category:Australian chefs Category:Lifestyle YouTubers ","title":"Leanne Ratcliffe"},{"id":"61605577","text":"The Popular Republican Union of Gironde (UPR; French: \\"Union Populaire Républicaine de la Gironde\\") was a small right-wing Catholic party active in the department of Gironde, France, between 1925 and the end of the 1930s.

It seeks to answer the question what does it mean to be hāfu? What does it mean to be Japanese, and what does it mean for Japan? The making of this documentary took 3 years of research, interviews and filming. It was completed in April 2013. The documentary is in Japanese with English subtitles and English with Japanese subtitles. Some protagonists talk in English. ==Synopsis== An estimated 1 in 49 marriages are international marriages in Japan. The majority of international marriages are between Japanese and Chinese, Filipino or Korean people. The documentary follows the lives of five ethnic half-Japanese people. It is narrated by themselves, it includes interviews and cinéma vérité. David Mitsuaki Yano is Ghanaian and Japanese. He seeks to reconcile his mostly Japanese childhood with his mother's country Ghana. He wants to build a school in Ghana and thereby connects with his Japanese community. Sophia Fukunishi is half Australian and Japanese. She moved to Tokyo at 27 years old and has obstacles with trying to assimilate into a very different Japanese culture. The Mexican- Japanese Oi family with Gabriela, Alex, Tetsuya and Sara share the challenge of raising multi-lingual, multi-cultural children in Japan. The older son Alex has difficulty integrating into his school and suffers from bullying. Edward Yutaka Sumoto is Venezuelan and Japanese. He struggled with his hafu identity and the disconnect with Japanese culture. He now actively works to promote multicultural awareness in Japan. Fusae Miyako is Korean and Japanese. She can easily blend into Japanese society due to looking just like an average Japanese person. So she is not easily identified as hafu on the spot. Fusae was led to believe she was entirely Japanese until discovering otherwise in her mid-teens. As the personal stories are told of the five protagonists, it is discovered that they each have different personal experiences, struggles and accomplishments. There's also diversity among them due to factors such as family, relationships, education, appearance, language skills and upbringing. ==Reception== The documentary had a generally positive reception. On the online database IMDb the average score is 7.2/10 with 147 reviews. On Prime Video it has 76 reviews with an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars. ==See also== *Demographics of Japan *Culture of Japan *Hāfu ==ReferencesCategory:2013 films Category:2013 documentary films Category:Documentary films about race and ethnicity Category:Japanese films Category:Documentary films about Japan Category:Japanese documentary films ","title":"Hafu (film)"},{"id":"61605628","text":"The Voluntary Organisations Disability Group represents organisations within the voluntary sector who work alongside disabled people.

Opened in August 2019, it offers a capacity for all types of shows and events from 5,000 to 15,000. Replacing the former Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC), the 10,000-seat arena is used for concerts and other events. It is the largest indoor arena in Scotland, and the fifth largest arena in the United Kingdom. ==History== In September 2012, talks got underway to replace the 27-year-old AECC Arena with a new £20 million facility on the same site amid claims that the arena was missing out on big acts due its comparatively small 4,750-seat capacity. On 18 October 2013, the city council announced plans to spend £200 million on a rebuild of the AECC, but also raised the possibility of relocating the venue to a new site. Then on 31 October, it was announced that the go ahead had been given to the relocation, with Henry Boot as the preferred development partner. Artists impressions were released for a new centre and arena to be built at The Rowett Institute currently owned by the University of Aberdeen in the city's Bucksburn area near Aberdeen Airport and close to the Aberdeen International Business Park. The council says the project would be completed by 2019, accommodating 10,000 people seated and 12,500 standing. Other facilities include office and leisure space, plus an adjoining 4-star Hilton Aberdeen TECA hotel with options for two more. An artist's impression the new AECC was released on 1 November 2013, together with an estimate of the final bill at around £185 million. In September 2014, public consultations took place prior to the final planning application being submitted in May 2015 for the Bucksburn site and redevelopment of the current AECC site at Bridge of Don. Construction began in July 2016, after a ground- breaking ceremony on 5 July. The planned spending total of the new project is £333 million. In July 2018, it was announced that the new venue would be named The Event Complex Aberdeen (TECA). The official name was changed to P&J; Live in May 2019, following a sponsorship deal with the venue’s operator SMG Europe and DC Thomson (owners of The Press and Journal and Evening Express). Constructed by the Robertson Group, the main arena includes an exclusive 50 person capacity show deck, 16 private hospitality suites and a VIP lounge. The new building also contains seven conference spaces, three 2,000 sqm exhibition halls (each with a seated capacity of 1,700), eleven meeting rooms, 150-seat restaurant and a coffee shop. The development also comprises two on site hotels. The open day was held on 10 August 2019. ==Events== The first event at the new arena was Offshore Europe from 3–6 September 2019. On 17 September 2019, it was announced that P&J; Live would host the 2019 edition of BBC Sports Personality of the Year on 15 December. On 23 November 2019, Scottish singer Gerry Cinnamon performed a sold-out concert at the venue to a crowd of 15,000 people, making it the largest indoor concert ever held in Scotland. ===Entertainment events=== {class=\\" collapsible\\" width=60% style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Events at P&J; Live - !

He was the first surviving son of Hugh Tuite of Sonna and Sarah Elizabeth née Chenevix, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Chenevix of Ballycommon. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1826, he married Mary, daughter of Maurice O'Connor, with whom he had one son and one daughter—Joseph Tuite (1828–1910) and Sarah Elizabeth Tuite (died 1905)—before her death in 1863. He married again, in 1863, to Hester Maria, daughter of John Hogan. After testing the field via a \\"limited canvas\\" in 1824, Tuite was first elected MP for at the 1826 general election, offering himself as a pro-Catholic opposed to dominant Protestant interests, and devoid of \\"any particular line of politics\\". He told electors that emancipation would restore \\"peace and good order\\" and that he wished for the county to be rescued \\"from the degradation of being considered a sort of family property, or hereditary borough\\". His election was supported by the Catholic Association and, despite accusations of widespread electoral misconduct by his supporters amid a \\"severe struggle\\", was returned to the seat. A petition was lodged against his return, which Tuite declined to defend, causing him to be absent for a number of votes in parliament. After associates registerd as defence, however, a commission was established in 1827, but then broke up in 1828 and the petition was decided in his favour. This period of his parliamentary career saw Tuite vote in favour of Catholic relief and emancipation, both for Catholics and Jews. Tuite stood for election for the same seat in 1830 but, faced with an alliance between his former opponents and criticism for his support of emancipation, he was \\"rather remiss\\" with canvassing and was defeated. At the 1831 election, he initially stood as a supporter of the Grey ministry's reform bill, but withdrew. He returned to parliament, again sitting for Westmeath, after the 1841 general election and held the seat until 1847, when he did not seek-relection. Before his death at his family home, Sonna, in 1868, Tuite was also a Justice of the Peace for County Westmeath, and Deputy Lieutenant of County Westmeath.

The Rhodian forces were led by an admiral called DemagorasMayor, Adrienne. The Poison King, p. 180, Princeton University Press, 2009. and the proconsul of Asia, Lucius Cassius, with them. After the defeat of Rome in the Battle of Protopachium, Rome was forced to retreat from Asia and the only major independent power left in that province was Rhodes. Rhodes had previously been an ally to both Mithridates and Rome, but now it only preferred Rome. == Prelude == After securing mainland Asia Minor Mithridates moved on to the islands of the Aegean. He first invaded the island of Kos, a very lucrative conquest (and probably the main reason for the invasion) as the Ptolemies of Egypt and many other nations and people (like the Jews of Alexandria) had stashed part of their treasury there. The people of Kos did not put up a fight and received Mithridates as a liberator not a conqueror. Besides the treasuries Mithridates got a hold of young prince Ptolemy Auletes, who was being held safe on Kos. The people of Kos distinguished themselves by insisting that the Romans on the island, who were granted sanctuary, were not to be harmed. After Kos Mithridates went on to Mytilene on Lesbos which also surrendered without a fight. The next target was the island of Rhodes.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome Indomitable Enemy, p. 47. The Roman governor of Asia, Lucius Cassius, had fled to the Rhodes and was marshalling the resistance against Mithridates on the island. Many surviving Romans and Italians had also fled to Rhodes and were assisting the Rhodians in bolstering their defences. When word arrived of Mithridates pending arrival the defenders destroyed all building outside their walls and prepared for the upcoming assault. During the famous Siege of Rhodes 200 years prior, Rhodes had successfully defended itself from Demetrius I of Macedon, commonly known as \\"Poliorcetes\\" (The Besieger). Demetrius' engineers had created a large mechanised siege tower called the Helepolis, but despite this taunting technology Rhodes came out with a win. Demetrius' abandoned siege equipment was then used to make the well known Colossus of Rhodes. Mithridates was all quite aware of this, and he wanted to outdo Demetrius (just like he wished to outdo Alexander the Great). Mithridates had his engineers construct the sambucaRickard, J (11 December 2008), Siege of Rhodes 88 B.C. (different from the sambuca invented by Heracleides of Tarentum more than 100 years prior). It was a large tower mounted on ships with bridges equipped to safely pass over city walls from sea. Meanwhile, Mithridates sailed in a quinquereme and his land forces awaited orders in Caunus. == Battle and siege == After securing Lesbos Mithridates sailed his fleet to Rhodes, the Rhodian fleet moved out of their harbour and met the Pontic fleet en route. Mithridates, in personal command of the invasion force, ordered his numerically superior fleet to extend its line to envelop the Rhodian fleet. The Rhodians recognized his intentions and backed off quickly to avoid being surrounded. Eventually, without engaging, the Rhodians slipped back into their harbour.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome Indomitable Enemy, p. 49. The Rhodians decided on a strategy of opportunist lightning strikes at the Pontic fleet. Soon there occurred one of the opportunities the Rhodian fleet had been waiting for. A royal supply ship, secure in their belief the Rhodians were penned up in their harbour, ventured close to the port and was attacked and captured by a swift bireme. The Pontic fleet hurried to retrieve the situation, but were met by Rhodian reinforcements. Appian reports: ::A severe engagement followed. Both in his fury and in the size of his fleet, Mithridates was superior to his opponents, but the Rhodians circled skilfully and rammed his ships to such effect that the battle ended with the Rhodians retiring into their harbour with a captured trireme in tow and other spoils besides.Appian, Mithridatica, 25. Soon after, the Pontic forces captured a Rhodian quinquereme. They kept his triumph a secret hoping the Rhodians would venture out to look for their missing ship. Eventually, the Rhodians sent out a search party of six ships. Mithridates dispatched twenty-six ships after them. The Rhodian commander used the superior speed of his ships to avoid action until sunset. Then, when the Pontic ships turned to break of their pointless pursuit, the Rhodians suddenly wheeled and hit their opponents from the rear. Two Pontic ships were sunk, the rest scattered while the Rhodians sailed on and slipped back into their port almost unscathed.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome Indomitable Enemy, p. 50. In the chaos that followed the Rhodian action, Mithridates's flagship was accidentally rammed by a ship from Chios. This incident shook Mithridates's confidence in the loyalty of his Greek allies, the Chians in particular. This would have profound consequences later on in the war. When the Pontic transport fleet arrived the Rhodians raced out to meet them and do as much damage as they could. The transports had arrived sooner than expected and in considerable disorder as a result of a storm which had swept them towards Rhodes. Mithridates did not have his warfleet in position to properly protect his transports and now the Rhodians were among them burning, ramming and capturing ships. Eventually, the overwhelming weight of the Pontic warfleet caused the Rhodians to retreat, but they had done considerable damage. At this point Mithridates decided to use the Sambucca against Rhodes. The Sambucca was supported by other assault ships which were filled with soldiers with siege ladders. The sea attack was to coincide with an assault on the landward side, where deserters had shown the king a suitable spot for an attack. Unfortunately for Mithridates, his land forces mistook Rhodian warning signals for the signal to begin the assault and they attacked while most units were still getting into position. Mithridates pulled his army back before it was fully committed, but the damage had been done. The Rhodians were on full alert now and took advantage of the lull in the assault to properly prepare their defence. When the attack finally was launched in earnest the Rhodians were ready. The Pontic land forces were rebuffed with ease and the Sambucca collapsed while it was being maneuvered into place. The site chosen for the Sambucca assault was against the temple of Isis, which was apparently build into the walls. Later the Rhodians claimed that the goddess herself appeared on the walls and heaved a massive fireball at the Sambucca after which it collapsed.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome Indomitable Enemy, p. 51. After the failed Sambucca assault Mithridates gave up on besieging Rhodes. He left a fleet to keep an eye on the Rhodians and prevent them from hindering his operations and returned to the mainland. ==Aftermath== The war moved from Rhodes to mainland Greece. Eventually, the Rhodians were persuaded to lend part of their navy to the Roman admiral Lucullus who was collecting a fleet for Rome. The Rhodian contingent formed the backbone of Lucullus's fleet and was instrumental in defeating Mithridates's fleet on several occasions.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome Indomitable Enemy, p. 86. The war ended in a Roman victory which forced Mithridates to abandon all his conquests and return to Pontus. Rhodes continued their alliance as a Friend and Ally of Rome. == References == Category:Mithridatic Wars Category:80s BC conflicts Category:88 BC Category:Battles involving Pontus Category:Sieges of antiquity Category:History of Rhodes ","title":"Siege of Rhodes (88 BC)"},{"id":"61606018","text":"The 1934 Toledo Rockets football team was an American football team that represented the University of Toledo in the Ohio Athletic Conference during the 1934 college football season.

Fales, also known as The Dedham Case, was a seminal case of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. It involved the First Church and Parish in Dedham rejecting the minister the Town of Dedham selected for it and its split into the Allin Congregational Church. It was a major case on the road to the separation of church and state and led to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts formally disestablishing the Congregational Church in 1833. ==Background== The preaching of Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield helped to revive the churches of Dedham during the Great Awakening. The theological debates that arose as a result, however, helped bring about a split in the churches into different denominations. A distinction was made between the church and the parish. The parish was composed all of the residents of a geographic territory who had not joined another religious group such as the Episcopal Church. The church included only those members of the parish who had been admitted to the church. In Dedham, members of the church were generally more conservative than the members of the parish. Many in the congregation were unhappy with the previous minister, Joshua Bates, and the church itself was divided by strong religious and other opinions. In the early 19th century, all Massachusetts towns were Constitutionally required to tax their citizens \\"for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety.\\" All residents of a town were assessed, as members of the parish, whether or not they were also members of the church. The \\"previous and long standing practice [was to have] the church vote for the minister and the parish sanction this vote,\\" although the method varied over the history of Dedham since the church was first gathered in 1638. Churches in those days were not corporate bodies or authorized to hold property. A Massachusetts law passed in 1754 made a church's deacons the trustees of all its property. ==Dispute at First Church== ===Selection of Lamson as minister=== In 1818, \\"Dedham [claimed] rights distinct from the church and against the vote of the church.\\" Bates, the unpopular and recently departed minister, had been educated at Phillips Academy Andover, and the town wanted a more liberal minister from Harvard. They considered three candidates, though the liberal Unitarian minister, Rev. Alvan Lamson, seems to be the only one seriously considered. On July 13, 1818, a meeting of the parish engaged Lamson to preach for eight weeks. The more conservative members were unhappy, and asked for additional candidates to be considered. At the end of August, both the church, and then the parish, met to consider calling Lamson to the pulpit. The church initially rejected Lamson by a vote of 17 to 15. An elderly, hard of hearing man then stood up to say he was confused and actually meant to vote against Lamson, bringing the tally to 18 against Lamson, 14 in favor, and six absent. Despite the negative vote from the church, the parish then met and voted in favor of Lamson by a vote of 81 in favor to 44 opposed. Those who opposed Lamson did not raise any objections to his moral or professional qualifications. They did, however, object to his theology and found him lacking in \\"spirituality and knowledge of the scriptures\\" and displayed little of \\"that which fixes the attention and reaches the heart.\\" Lamson's initial reaction seems to have been to decline the call, given the size of the opposition, but he was persuaded to accept by Jabaz Chickering, the chairman of the parish council. ===The ecclesiastical council=== After Lamson accepted the parish's call without the concurrence of the church, the parish sent letters to 15 other churches calling for a council to consider the situation. A council of 13 other churches then assembled with the minister and one lay delegate from each participating. The council included Judge John Davis, Harvard College President Rev. John Kirkland, future Harvard president Rev. James Walker, Rev. Henry Ware, Rev. Charles Lowell, and Rev. William Ellery Channing. The committee selected Channing to serve as moderator and Rev. Ralph Sanger as scribe. Rev. John Reed of Bridgewater, Kirkland, Channing, Lowell, and Davis were selected to report the findings of the council. At 9:00 a.m. on October 28, 1818, the council met at the Norfolk County Courthouse. They first heard a report from the parish and then heard the long and carefully prepared argument of Judge Samuel Haven, who opposed Lamson's appointment. Haven argued that a church should be able to elect its own pastor and that an ecclesiastical council should not be able to force a Gospel minister upon a church without its consent. Haven also noted that the tradition in New England had long been for a church to make a selection and then present its choice to the parish for ratification. Ordinations, he said, are ecclesiastical events, not civil ones. Additionally, councils are called by churches, Haven said, not by secular authorities. To have the Dedham parish convene this council was to confuse secular and religious authority. The letters calling for the council asked for the other church's help \\"in the ordination of Mr. Lamson, as a Gospel Minister over the Church and Society constituting said Parish.\\" After hearing Haven's argument, Chickering backtracked and said they did not ask for Lamson be ordained over the church. Chickering then presented letters showing that if all the members of the church had been present when the vote was taken that there would have been a majority in favor of Lamson. The council was not inclined to consider the views and membership status of the absent members and instead considered Lamson's qualifications. At the end of the day, the council declared that it would proceed to ordain Lamson on the following day. ===Ordination and second council=== As promised, the council assembled to ordain Lamson on the following day. The council's final report, prepared by Channing and known as its \\"Result,\\" was read at the ordination ceremony. The Result accepted the argument of the conservative members that a church may not have a minister imposed upon it without its consent. It added that having a parish ratify the selection of the church is \\"in the main wise and beneficial,\\"but is not always possible. The interests of the parish must also be considered, the Result said, and \\"that circumstances may exist, in which a minister may be ordained over a parish without the concurrence of the church connected with it.\\" It added that the parish was obliged by law to support a public teacher of morality and may be fined if it did not. The Result lamented the lack of unanimity in the congregation but said that any decision they arrived at would likely upset some members. At the ordination ceremony, Deacon Joseph Swan got up and walked out. He was followed by his father-in-law, Deacon Samuel Fales, and a number of others. Haven declared the ordination council was illegitimate and attacked the Result. He declared that the church should call a minister and the parish should not vote until then. If the parish did not agree, the church should present other candidates until a mutually acceptable candidate was found. Lamson's ordination, Haven said, was irregular and should not be recognized by other churches. Members of the church then called upon other churches to assemble for another council on November 18, 1808. Letters were sent to every other congregational church with the exception of those who participated in the ordination. Before the second council could assemble, a second vote was taken by the church. In the interest of conciliation, some members initially opposed to Lamson were ready to accept him as their minister. On November 15th, a majority of 21 votes were cast for Lamson as minister and a greater number voted to admit him as a member of the church. Many of those still opposed to Lamson boycotted the second vote, calling it irregular and invalid. The second council, including Dr. Eliphalet Porter of Roxbury, Thaddeus Mason Harris of Dorchester, and John Pierce of Brookline, was unable to come to a unanimous decision. It expressed a mild condemnation of the parish for appointing a minister against the wishes of the church, though some council members pushed for stronger language. Eight members voted their disapproval of the Result for varying reasons. ===Separation=== The second council advocated for a reconciliation, but one was not to be had. Haven published a book of over 100 pages outlying the argument against Lamson and included the Result from each council. In it, he used derogatory and insulting language to describe his opponents. He also said that bringing Lamson to the church was \\"both disgusting and ridiculous.\\" He added that the more liberal members who favored Lamson had deliberately stirred up the community and that the meeting on July 13th, in which Lamson's stay in the pulpit was extended, was \\"a farce\\" marked by \\"management, intrigue, and deceit.\\" Haven also blamed the dispute on the death on Deacon Joseph Swan, who died on November 13, within two weeks of Lamson's ordination. Haven characterized the church meeting in which Lamson was admitted as a member as a \\"shocking profanation\\" exhibiting \\"scenes of wickedness... indecency and barbarity.\\" After Lamson's ordination, the more conservative members of the church left to form what is today known as the Allin Congregational Church. The deacons at the time included Samuel Fales, who left to join the new church, Jonathan Richards, who voted for Lamson but resigned his position after the new minister was settled, and the deceased Joseph Swan. The remaining members elected Eliphalet Baker and Luther Richards as replacements. During the split, Fales and the departing members took parish records, funds, and the valuable silver used for communion with them. The communion silver was kept in a closet within the church, but disappeared after someone entered through a window. According to Massachusetts law at the time, the deacons of the church were the lawful custodians of church property, but there were now two competing groups of deacons. ==Lawsuit== ===Case=== Deacon Baker, on behalf of the remaining members of the First Church, brought a suit of replevin against Deacon Fales and the breakaway church. During the April term of 1820, they asked a court to order that the records, funds, silver, and other items be returned. At the trial, the members of First Church were represented by Judge John Davis and Jabez Chickering while the breakaway church members were represented by Messrs. Metcalf, Haven, and Prescott. Judge Samuel Wilde, who presided over the trial, instructed the jury that as a matter of law that the plaintiffs, the remaining members of the First Church, were in the right. The jury, however, deliberated all night about \\"Which is the First Church?\\" When they came back in the morning without a verdict, they were severely reprimanded by the judge. They returned to their deliberations and came back ten minutes later with a verdict for the plaintiffs. The case was appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court. There, Massachusett's Solicitor General, Daniel Davis, represented the plaintiffs with Chickering. The breakaway defendants had Daniel Webster and Theron Metcalf representing them. ===Decision=== The case turned on who was to be considered First Church: those who supported Lamson and stayed, or those who opposed him and left. In a decision written by Chief Justice Isaac Parker in February 1821, the court unanimously ruled that \\"[w]hatever the usage in settling ministers, the Bill of Rights of 1780 secures to towns, not to churches, the right to elect the minister, in the last resort.\\" They also ruled that the connection between First Church and First Parish was indissoluble. Even if a majority of the members left to form a new church, those who remained would constitute First Church. As such, those who remained with Lamson, and not those who left, were to be considered the First Church and thus the rightful owners of the property in question. If all the members of the church left, the parish could form a new church which would be the legal successor of the old. The church, according to the decision, was an appendage of the parish, not an entity unto itself. The court held that the funds, records, and other property had to be returned to First Church, setting a precedent for future congregational splits that would arise as Unitarianism grew. The orthodox faction supposedly responded to the decision with the saying, \\"They kept the furniture, but we kept the faith.\\" Parker has been criticized for using \\"legal slight of hand\\" in his decision and for ignoring the complex history, especially in Dedham, between the church and the society. He was also accused of forming his legal opinion of the Dedham church through his experiences at his own Brattle Street Church. ==Legacy== The case was a major milestone in the road towards the separation of church and state and led to the Commonwealth formally disestablishing the Congregational Church in 1833. Despite the court ruling, the silver was not returned to First Church. It did not appear again publicly again for more than a century when the flagons were found one morning on the steps of the Dedham Historical Society. The rest remained hidden away until 1969 when it was donated to the Historical Society as a neutral third party. Today the service is on permanent loan to the Museum of Fine Arts and replicas have been made for both churches. ==Notes== ==References== ==Works cited== * * Category:Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Category:Massachusetts state case law Category:1818 in Massachusetts Category:1820 in Massachusetts Category:History of Dedham, Massachusetts ","title":"Baker v.

Michael Terrin, Samuel Charache, Duane Bonds and Claude Lenfant, NHLBI director, announce treatment for sickle cell disease in 1995 Samuel Charache (January 12, 1930 – January 29, 2019) was an American hematologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University. He led the research team that discovered the first effective treatment for sickle cell disease, a painful and sometimes fatal blood disorder that mainly affects people of African ancestry. ==Career== He received his bachelor's degree from Oberlin College in 1951 and his M.D. degree from New York University School of Medicine in 1955. He joined the Johns Hopkins faculty in 1966 and became director of the hematology department of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1969. He was a professor in the departments of both pathology and medicine, retiring in 1995. ==Sickle cell disease== He is best known for his discovery of a treatment for sickle cell disease, a hereditary blood disorder that affects more than 70,000 people in the United States, primarily African Americans. The disease gets its name from its effect on red blood cells, which become distorted from their normal round shape into pointed, sickle-shaped cells due to a mutation affecting hemoglobin A, the main form of hemoglobin in adults. When cells sickle they can cause recurrent episodes of acute pain that often require hospitalization, transfusions, and strong pain medication. There is no cure. In the early 1980s a team led by Charache began testing a few patients at Hopkins to see if hydroxyurea, a cancer drug, would help to abate the symptoms of the disease. They found that hydroxyurea treatment could increase recipients' blood levels of hemoglobin F, a form of hemoglobin primarily made by the fetus (and normally only at low levels in adults) that is not affected by the sickle cell mutation. The results were encouraging, so in the 1990s he and a colleague, pediatrician George Dover, who had been researching sickle cell disease for 20 years, launched a controlled clinical trial. The result was such a dramatic improvement in the condition of the test group that the trial was halted early, so that the control subjects (those receiving a placebo) could benefit from the treatment. Subsequent investigation of the beneficial effects hydroxyurea in people with sickle cell disease has revealed multiple mechanisms (including suppression of inflammatory white blood cells and platelets), but increased levels of hemoglobin F are still thought to play a significant part. ==Personal life== While still an undergraduate at Oberlin he met and married Patricia Connamacher Charache. She became a noted physician, served on the Hopkins faculty for more than 50 years, and retired as a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Pathology, Medicine, and Oncology. They were married for 64 years until her death in 2015, and had one child. He died January 29, 2019 at the age of 89. ==References== ==External links== *An oral history interview with Charache by the National Institutes of Health Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American hematologists Category:Physicians from New York City Category:Physicians from Baltimore Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:New York University School of Medicine alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:Sickle-cell disease ","title":"Samuel Charache"},{"id":"61606427","text":"Yasmin Khan (born 1977) is a British historian specialising in the history of British India.

The intention of this support is to assist those seen as being in need of such support. For example, individuals could be struggling with anger, frustration, hurt, and also physical distress, and Supportive Communication becomes a strategy utilized to help individuals cope with those feelings and experiences. At times, individuals do not like facing things alone, so they will seek Supportive Communication from family, friends, and other trusted sources. At other times, individuals such as family and friends will offer Supportive Communication to someone they feel is in need of such support. The impact of Supportive Communication has varied in research studies partially due to the reception of the communication. An individual may not receive the support in the intended way, or it may dredge up previous stress emotions and intensify them. The field of social support is still relatively new with the typologies below being discussed as recent as the mid to late 1970s. == Background == The research on the topic of supportive communication, or variations thereof, have fairly recent beginnings with most of the heavy research beginning in the mid to late 1970s . Early research recognized the role of communication in helping others specifically as a role of social support, which also garnered quite a bit of attention in this time period. As a form of social support, scholars found that, unlike the sociological and psychological perspectives of social support, the supportive communication aspect served a specific role in actual communication of support unlike the psychological perspective which is the perceived belief of support or the sociological perspective which is considered more of the role of social integration. Research in Supportive Communication has utilized a typology of supportive behaviors created in the 1970s and 80's which includes emotional, esteem, network support, informational, and tangible. Through these typologies, researchers have been able to better study the impact of each of the support types. == Types == === Nurturant support ===  Emotional  This type of supportive communication would be utilized to help those who are experiencing emotional distress. This emotional distress could be due to many environmental factors, some are listed above, but are all emotional stressors. The goal would be to help alleviate the pain on an emotional level, but cannot help necessarily on a physical level.  Esteem  The esteem type of supportive communication, in contrast to emotional supportive communication, would encourage the individual in need of support on a different level. This type of support would enhance the individuals feelings towards themselves. The support would highlight the individuals accomplishments, abilities, and/or their attributes in an effort to provide support when the supporter recognizes the need of social support.  Network  Network support is a type of support that gives the individual a sense of belonging among a group of individuals who may have experienced the same stressors that the individual is currently going through. This can be found by creating a group of individuals the person already knows, or joining a support group specifically categorized by the type of support the individual needs. === Action-facilitating support ===  Informational  On the other end of the spectrum from emotional or esteem, informational support us focused more on practical application of the support that is given. The practical applicability of this type of support can range from advice on what to do to feedback on what should not have been done. This type of support is also known as an action-facilitating support type which has the main goal of helping to solve the problem that is causing the stress.  Tangible  This type of support, much like the informational support, is considered an action-facilitating support type. The difference in tangible and informational is the action of assisting instead of just the advice, or verbal support. Tangible support would seek to provide money, housing, transportation, or other such services to help alleviate stressors in the individuals life. == Supportive communication in business == Supportive communication helps employees to communicate accurately and honestly without jeopardizing interpersonal relationships. Supportive communication aims to preserve the relationship employees have even if management or other employees have to correct or point out a mistake in someone's actions. == Social media == Social media has created a platform not only for sharing information, but also for individuals to seek Supportive Communication. Positive affirmation and communication in Social Media platforms have been linked in positive psychological benefits, reinforcing the idea of Supportive Communication helping in an emotional state. Social Media has also created for individuals the idea of social capital where individuals believe they have created a network that they can rely on when support is needed. Looking at the definition above for Social support, we can see how social media can potentially provide emotional, informational, esteem, and even network support. With the open source structure of social media, a world of communication is opened for both positive and negative reinforcement. Bullying has become a prevalent concern when discussions occur regarding social media. Cyber bullying can occur because of race, sexual orientation, age, and political preference, among other attributes. Bullied individuals, specifically, can experience real life impact outside the digital world. This experience, without the Supportive Communication of their network, can lead to stress, anxiety, and other social factors impacting their daily lives. Emotional, informational, esteem, and network supportive communication can be an especially beneficial to the individuals experiencing the bullying as they receive the communication they are valued and cared for. == References == Category:Human communication ","title":"Supportive communication"},{"id":"61606451","text":"Salmonid herpesvirus 2 (SalHV-2) is a species of virus in the genus Salmonivirus, family Alloherpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Alloherpesviridae ","title":"Salmonid herpesvirus 2"},{"id":"61606452","text":"Salmonid herpesvirus 3 (SalHV-3) is a species of virus in the genus Salmonivirus, family Alloherpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. == References == Category:Alloherpesviridae ","title":"Salmonid herpesvirus 3"},{"id":"61606467","text":"Death on High Mountain () is a 1969 Italian-Spanish western film directed by Fred Ringold, written by Enzo Gicca Palli and José Mallorquí Figueroa, produced by Bruno Turchetto and scored by Luis Enríquez.

Bilateral relations have traditionally been at the heart of development cooperation activities. Mozambique is, in effect, one of the priority countries of the Spanish Cooperation.

The MAP establishes a referential financial framework of 46.5 million euro s as a donation through budgetary aid, which is the mode of execution preferred by the Mozambican authorities, programmatic assistance, co-financing of ONGD , the debt conversion program and projects through international organizations.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Diplomatic relations. == Economic relations == Despite its uncertainties, Mozambique's economic growth and large gas-related projects offer interesting perspectives for Spanish companies to take advantage of business and investment opportunities in the country. The high technological profile of Spanish companies in the engineering, infrastructure or telecommunications sectors, key to the country's development, is a comparative advantage. Also of interest is the Spanish business penetration in Portugal, where many Spanish companies have subsidiaries and branches, which can benefit from tax exemptions derived from the agreement to avoid double taxation between Portugal and Mozambique. The strength of Spanish companies in other African countries, for example Angola, another model of extractive economy, is an incentive to operate in Mozambique. Spanish exports to Mozambique remain at very low levels. The trade balance is characterized by presenting a strong deficit for Spain, which occupies the 71st position in the ranking of suppliers in Angola and 72 in the ranking of investors in the country.Mozambique file Office of Diplomatic Information.

Under this Agreement, since 1989 successive meetings of the Mixed Commission have been held, the last of which in June 2005 in Maputo (VI Mixed Commission, 2005-2008). Mozambique has been the sixth largest recipient of Spanish ODA in the world.

For many years, Namibia was a priority country for our cooperation, but the IV Master Plan for Spanish Cooperation 2013-2016 included Namibia among the 9 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa where it was planned to close or redesign the current program. As a result, the OTC in Windhoek closed its doors in August 2015. The overall volume of official development assistance (ODA) received by Namibia fluctuated greatly in recent years. In the 1990s, after independence, the volume of foreign aid received doubled, with a rapid decline after the first years of the new millennium. Between 2007 and 2010 there was an uptick in ODA granted to the country, to decrease again considerably from 2011. During the period 2005-2012 the total net ODA of Spain in the country reached 72 million euros, mostly channeled to through bilateral programs of AECID and MAEC (49 million) and contributions to multilateral organizations (10 million).

She could sing, play the lyre and dance very well. The historian Sallust states she was extremely fortunate in life, marriage, and children, yet had a profligate character. According to him she had \\"masculine daring\\" and involved herself in politics. Without the knowledge or consent of her husband, she participated in the conspiracy of Catiline and allowed the conspirators to meet in her home to plan.American Philosophical Society., 1960. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge, Volume 104 - 327 Sempronia and women like her represented a \\"new woman\\" in Rome, with abilities and interests that would become common for women of Rome in later years, a contrast to classical Roman women like Cornelia Africana who stood for values from the earlier Republican period.D.

Thomas Africa thought Syme had recanted this view; see \\"The Mask of an Assassin: A Psychohistorical Study of M. Junius Brutus,\\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History 8 (1978), p. 615, note 28, referring to Syme's book Sallust (Berkeley, 1964), p. 134. This would appear to be a misreading, given Syme's fuller argument twenty years later in \\"No Son for Caesar?\\" Historia 29 (1980) 422–437, pp. 426–430 regarding the greater likelihood that Decimus would be the Brutus who was Caesar's son. (See the same story about Servilia (mother of Brutus)). ==Research== In the past she has sometimes been conflated with another woman by the same name who was the sister of the Gracchi brothers.Fröléen, 1918; Cajus Julius Caesar, Volume 1 - 229 Johann Caspar von Orelli supposed that this Sempronia may be the same Sempronia who, according to Asconius, gave testimony at the trial of Titus Annius Milo in 52 B.C. This Sempronia was the daughter of a Sempronius Tuditanus, and supposedly the mother of Publius Clodius Pulcher. However, as Clodius' wife was Fulvia, the daughter of a Sempronia and granddaughter of Sempronius Tuditanus, it seems that she was not the same Sempronia who married Brutus, and that the woman witnessing was actually Clodius' mother-in-law, not mother.Quintus Asconius Pedianus, in Cic. Milon., p. 41, ed.

He is known for his contributions into inflammatory bowel diseases and being a leader in the Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis research. ==Early life and education== Janowitz was born in a Jewish household to Rose and Sam Janowitz on March 13, 1915 in Paterson, New Jersey. The sociologist Morris Janowitz was his younger brother. After graduating from Eastside High School at the age of 16, Janowitz entered Columbia College from which he graduate with honors and a membership into Phi Beta Kappa. His major there was biology but his undergraduate was history of philosophy.Kirsner, Joseph B. \\"Friedenwald Presentation to Henry David Janowitz, M.D.\\", Gastroenterology, 87(4). . Retrieved September 30, 2019. \\"Henry David Janowitz was born March 23, 1915, in Paterson, New Jersey.... His high school was Eastside in Paterson, one of those remarkable public institutions that are in such short supply today, where he was introduced to classical learning.\\" Because he was uncertain whether to pursue medicine or philosophy, he sought an advice from his mentor and professor, Dr. Irwin Edman. Edman suggested to him to become a physician, and so he did. After graduating from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1939 with Alpha Omega Alpha honor, Janowitz did a two-year fellowship in clinical pathology. ==War== In 1942 he joined the US Army as a medic in World War II and until 1946 served as such at its Medical Corps. While serving at an Arkansas-based Army hospital, Janowitz became acquainted with Thomas Urmy, a gastroenterologist from Boston. After learning preceptorship in gastroenterology from this man, the next three years became very fruitful for Janowitz, who during those years served as gastroenterologist in France and Germany, and was eventually sent home with a rank of a major. ==Career== ===Early career=== Following the war, he resumed his studying, earning a Master's degree in physiology from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1947, at the age of 32, Janowitz became a CUCPS resident. Between 1948 and 1950 he worked towards master's degree in physiology at Andrew Conway Ivy's Department of Clinical Science at the University of Illinois. There, under mentorship of professor Morton I. Grossman, he laid out foundations in gastrointestinal physiology and became known as Dr. Grossman's oldest living student. Since gastrin and cholecystokinin were already discovered by that time, Dr. Janowitz focused his study onto physiology of gastric organs and autonomic nervous system. Upon completion of his thesis in 1950, Janowitz returned to the Gastrointestinal Physiology Laboratory as full time researcher. While at the lab, he worked under Franklin Hollander, who at that time was a renowned gastroenterologist after publishing his investigations into gastrointestinal electrolyte metabolism. ===Later career=== Janowitz became a private practitioner in 1952 and worked closely with Burrill Bernard Crohn at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, New York. While there, he also worked with David Dreiling and contributed to the study of peptic ulcer and inflammatory bowel diseases. In 1958, Janowitz was asked to create a Division of Gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai Hospital. While leading that group, he trained over 100 residents and fellows among which were Bernard Wolf and Richard Marshak. ==Editorial work== Prof. Janowitz served on many editorial boards, including Journal of Chronic Diseases (now known as Journal of Clinical Epidemiology), the American Journal of Physiology and was a contributor to Gastroenterology Clinics. He also was known for the resurrection of the American Journal of Digestive Diseases which existed from 1956 to 1966. He was a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and served as Committee chairman with the American Gastroenterological Association and on the National Scientific Advisory Board of the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis. ==Death and legacy== Janowitz died on August 19, 2008 and was survived by his wife, Adeline R.

His first appearance is in Toy Story 4, which was released in June 2019. Before he became Forky, he was just a plain spork until Bonnie made him into Forky. He is also the main character of the series of shorts Forky Asks a Question on Disney+. ==Concept and creation== While considering names for the character, director Josh Cooley showed a picture of the character to his four- year-old son and asked for a suggestion on the name. Cooley's son suggested the name Fork Face, and Cooley later said \\"the fact that he's around the same age as Bonnie and didn't know what a spork was, I thought, 'That feels real to me.' So Forky felt like a kid would name him that.\\" ===Character overview=== Forky is a white plastic spork outfitted with a pair of different sized googly eyes; a mouth made out of blue plasticine; two halves of a popsicle stick for feet, stuck on with modelling clay; arms and hands made out of a red pipe cleaner; and a unibrow made out of red plasticine. Bonnie's name is written on the bottom of his feet, and he has a rainbow sticker on his left foot. ===Attributes=== Forky is innocent and self-loathing. From the moment he comes to life, he is convinced that he is “garbage”. This attitude gradually changes after he befriends Woody and his gang, although his naïveté and inquisitive- yet-dim-witted behavior remain. ==Appearances== ===Toy Story 4=== Forky is first seen during the orientation at Bonnie's kindergarten class, where he was created with the help of Woody who scavenged parts from the trash bin for a craft project. As he and Woody came back home while inside Bonnie's backpack, Forky comes to life. Woody presents Forky to the rest of the gang; Forky, convinced that he is more of a piece of trash than a toy, doggedly tries to find solace in the nearest trash bin. During the road trip, Forky escapes from the RV and finds his way on a highway, much to Woody's horror. Woody chases him and persuades him to become Bonnie's toy, passing by an antique store at the Historic Grand Basin, where Woody notices Bo Peep's lamp. The two encounter a talking doll named Gabby Gabby, who claims to know about Bo Peep's whereabouts; Woody senses an ulterior motive and tries to escape from the Bensons, Gabby Gabby's ventriloquist dummy bodyguards, but Forky is taken captive. While being held as Gabby's hostage, Forky naively recalls the stories Woody told about his time with Andy. At the playground, Woody reunites with Bo Peep and convinces her to rescue Forky from Gabby Gabby and her minions. Bo Peep reluctantly agrees \\"for old time's sake\\", and they hatch a plan to rescue Forky along with Buzz Lightyear, Duke Caboom, Giggle McDimples and Ducky and Bunny. The rescue mission turns out to be a failure, leading to an argument with Woody and Bo Peep, with Woody declaring having nothing to lose except for Forky. Woody and the other toys part ways; alone, Woody confronts Gabby Gabby again, who upon learning about Woody's memories based on what Forky divulged, expresses her desire to be loved by a child. Woody and Gabby then make a compromise – Woody giving up his voice box in exchange for Forky's freedom. Woody was about to get in Bonnie's backpack when Forky calls him back as he witnesses Gabby's encounter with her ideal girl, Harmony; Harmony rejects the doll as uninteresting and leaves Gabby Gabby heartbroken. Not wanting to leave Gabby to suffer a miserable existence, Woody convinces the doll to join him and become one of Bonnie's toys, while tasking Forky to fetch Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents. Forky is then tasked to lock out Bonnie and her parents from the RV, buying the toys enough time to meet up with Bo Peep and Woody. At the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye; Woody decides to stay with Bo and live a new life together as lost toys, and Forky bids farewell. The RV departs with Bonnie's toys as Woody and Bo begin a life together, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. In a mid-credits sequence, Bonnie creates a female toy out of a plastic knife on her first day of first grade. The knife toy suffers from the same existential crisis as Forky, who becomes smitten with her. When asked how she is alive, Forky simply replies \\"I don't know.\\" ===Forky Asks a Question=== Forky returns as the protagonist in a series of shorts exclusive to Disney+, where every episode he asks a question about the world around him. Bonnie's toys make occasional appearances to help him learn. ==See also== * Office Assistant ==References== Category:Toy Story characters Category:Animated film characters introduced in 2019 Category:2010s toys Category:Forks Category:Male characters in film Category:Male characters in animation ","title":"Forky"},{"id":"61606972","text":"The 2019 FFAS Senior League is the 39th edition of the FFAS Senior League, the top football league of American Samoa organized by the Football Federation American Samoa.

Its only species, Pompelon marginata, was first described by Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville in 1843. It is a day-flying moth found throughout Southeast Asia, with sightings in the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Sulawesi, Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra. Larvae feed exclusively on Cinnamomum. They often are spotted resting on wild cinnamon trees. Members of this species mimic various species of Euploea. Its larvae have been observed being parasitized by members of the tachinid fly species Senometopia distincta. ==Description== A pair of mating Pompelon Moths P. marginata is a mid-sized day-flying moth with predominantly black and rounded wings, with iridescent blue margins. Its head is surrounded by a red band that resembles that of a collar. Its body stands in stark contrast to its dark dorsal side, having a bright red thorax and abdomen. With its abdomen having a series of black dots along each segment. P. marginata legs are black with a blue metallic sheen. ==Life history== P. marginata caterpillars feed exclusively on Cinnamomum, with each subspecies having a specific species that they feed on. Subspecies found in Singapore have been observed feeding on Cinnamomum iners, whereas others in Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia have been observed feeding on Cinnamomum verum. The larva is predominantly ivory in color, with an uneven distribution of black markings. On the dorsal end, there are verrucae distributed on each segment, they are tipped with black. On these verrucae, there are fine setae, even on the ones distributed on the flanks. When disturbed, the larva emits a clear liquid, potentially serving as a defense mechanism against predation. The pupa tends to bend a single leaf in a U-shaped pattern, forming a brown silk sheet with the tip of the pupa extending out of the sheet. There are also fine white silk threads that emanate from the center of the pupa. ==Subspecies== T. Endo and Y.

On 9 December 1999, Yang began releasing financial documents relating to James Soong and Soong's son Soong Chen-yuan. What followed became known as the . Yang claimed that Soong Chen-yuan held more than NT$140 million in his Chung Hsing Bills Finance account, including NT$106 million in securities. A resulting probe revealed that Tuntex Corporation president donated NT$100 million to James Soong in 1992, which was later transferred to his son's account. James Soong claimed that the money had been returned to Chen in June 1999, but Yang produced financial records that showed transactions on the account in question later than that date, until its recorded liquidation in October. Yang also claimed that James Soong kept NT$470 million in the bank account of Chen Pi-yuan, his sister-in-law. The case was reported to the Control Yuan for further investigation. The supervisory agency formed a task force for the case. Separately, Yang filed charges of tax evasion against James Soong. With the help of legislative colleague , Yang added more charges, among them embezzlement, fraud, breach of trust, money laundering, and expanded the number of accused, which included James Soong, his wife, son, and sister-in-law, as well as an assistant, Yang Yun-tai.

In the middle of September, General Culcer moved the I Corps headquarters to Nagytalmács (Tălmaciu/Talmesch). General Popovici arrived in Nagytalmács along with his staff on 16 September.

By 18 October, Krafft's eastern flank had reached the hills just to the north of Sălătrucu, where their advance was met by a Romanian counterattack on 19 October. The Central Powers retreated to Mount Fruntu, and from there, on 21 October, retreated further to Poiana Lunga. The Central Powers had attempted to outflank the defenses to the east of the Olt/Roter-Turm Pass, and succeeded in making good initial progress through the mountains before running into a determined Romanian counterattack north of Sălătrucu. The 2nd Brigade covered 40 miles in the first 30 hours. The Bavarian Jägers stormed the Moscovul Massif in thick fog, taking it in hand-to-hand fighting. The Bavarian Guard Regiment slowly advanced down the Red Tower Pass, inching forward with frontal assaults against strong Romanian resistance. The Romanians rapidly reversed most of the gains made by the Central Powers. General Petala showed great initiative, hauling guns up the mountains with wire-rail used by local foresters. If it weren't for a heavy snowstorm as well as considerable German reinforcements, the brigade which covered Krafft's eastern flank would have been entirely destroyed. The Romanians skillfully conducted a converging movement which almost cut off the Austro-Hungarian brigade. Krafft's western flank was also intercepted at the Pietroasa and Veverita Massifs on 16 October, and flung back with heavy losses towards Mounts Robu and Murgasu. The disasters to his flanks brought up by the Romanian counterattacks forced Krafft to hold up the attack of his Bavarian forces in the center. The offensive had come to an end by the 23rd. This first Central Powers offensive south of the Red Tower Pass was unsuccessful.Michael B.

The steamer Queen Bee, also owned by Captain Weston, was loading at North Coast ports for Sydney. Whilst latter in November 1909 it was reported that the collier Queen Bee had arrived from Newcastle during the night running the union barricades with a cargo of coal, estimated at about 180 tons. Captain Hacking the Deputy Superintendent of Navigation stated that the bigger part of the Queen Bee's cargo was for the Sydney pilot steamer Captain Cook which would absorb nearly 100 tons of the Queen Bee's coal. The remainder would be retained as supplies for the numerous launches running about the harbor and that the local hospitals were also to get a quantity of it. During 1910 Joseph Weston, a master mariner, gave evidence at the Wood and Coal Laborers' Wages Board held at the Water Police Court that he had been in the coal trade 25 years and that he was the owner of the Queen Bee and the Wyoming, (at that time, he once owned four vessels). He stated that he unloaded his vessels on the lump principle, and paid each man 17s per load and that the operation of unloading typically took about 15 hours. He stated that in the previous 12 months the Queen Bee had carried 26,292 tons of coal, and allowing the average of 12 tons an hour for unloading two men could have averaged £2 3s 3d per week. In answer to the union, he indicated that he paid his sailors £8 per month and 1s 3d per hour overtime for all work done at night. Their food averaged him 16s per man per week. On his timber vessels the sailors only received £6 month. with the sailors averaged 7 to 8 tons of coal, per hour; and sometimes as few as 5 tons. There was no deduction from their wages for holidays. ===March 1920 tail-shaft mishap=== During a trip from Sydney to Newcastle on the 17 March 1920 the coastal trader Queen Bee, had left Sydney shortly before noon when about three miles off Long Reef struck a submerged object and broke the port propeller shaft. An effort was made to return to Sydney, but owing to the heavy southerly swell and the winds was unable to do so. The vessel reached Broken Bay to inform its owners and was then brought on to Newcastle under her own steam to be put upon the slip at Stockton. While she was on the slip it was found that the port tail shaft bad broken in the stern tube with the outer tall shaft worn down considerably, both In the bearings and in the bush. A new outer tail shaft was fitted and a spare inner tail shaft also installed to replace the broken one. when the vessel left the slip it was chartered by Messrs, E.D. Pator. & Co. to make several trips on the coast. ===October 1920 Collision with the Moorabool in Newcastle Harbour=== A collision occurred on Wednesday 27 October 1920 at about half-past seven in the morning near the Newcastle No. 2 North Harbour buoy between the Huddart Parker Interstate steamer Moorabool and the coastal steamer Queen Bee. The Moorabool was backing out from the No.3 berth at Stockton, with the tug Commodore lashed alongside, to proceed to No. 11 crane at the Dyke. The Queen Bee had just arrived from sea, and when passing the No. 8 crane received orders from the wharf to berth there, and when the Queen Bee was being turned round to go to the crane the collision took place. The super structure of the Queen Bee was considerably damaged on the starboard side, as well as being damaged below the water line, but was not taking water. One of the blade of the Moorabool's propeller was embedded in the side of the Queen Bee, end the remaining blades were more or less damaged. The damage to the Moorabool ran into £1500, and that to the Queen Bee £460 A Marine Court of Inquiry was set up to consider the circumstances surrounding the collision and it found that the Queen Bee was berthing at the Dyke while there was a strong flood tide and a strong westerly wind prevailed. It overshot the berth, and the Moorabool, which was moving out stern first. Captain Lancaster was the master of the Queen Bee, The court found that the collision was caused by the wrongful act of the master of the Queen Bee, which could have avoided the collision to suspend the certificate of Charles Norton Lancaster, master of the Queen Bee, for three months, as front the date of the collision. ===February 1921 Collision in Newcastle Harbour again Ship's Launch Sunk=== Shortly before seven o'clock at night on Monday 21 February 1921 the Queen Bee was shifting from No. 10 dyke crane to No. 9 in doing so she collided with the stern of the full-rigged ship Cumberland, which was berthed at, No. 8 crane. One of the plates on the starboard quarter of the sailing vessel was damaged and her mooring lines were carried away. The bows of the Queen Bee cut the Cumberland's motor launch, which was moored under the stern, into two pieces, and it was a total loss. The Queen Bee's stem was damaged ==Shipwreck event 2 September 1922== At 12:30a.m. in the very early morning of the Sunday 2 September 1922 with very little warning the collier Queen Bee foundered some two miles east-north-east of Broken Bay early while engaged in one of her regular trips between Newcastle and Sydney. Under the charge of Captain A. Gardiner and a crew of eight hands, the Queen Bee left Newcastle on the Friday at 4:40pm for Sydney with a full cargo of coal. A south-easterly breeze prevailed during the night, and the vessel met a slight swell. The weather was fine, except for a few clouds, and it was moon light. As she made her way down the coast all appeared to be well with the little vessel. Good progress was made until the vessel was five miles east-north-east of Barrenjoey lighthouse, when the engineer of the vessel, Mr. Williams noticed a sudden rush of water. It was then 12:05am, he sensed something irregular in the vessel's movements. Investigating the matter he found that the vessel was making water in the bows. Realising the danger which threatened the vessel was turned towards Broken Bay. The position of the vessel was a few miles away from the nearest beach, but Captain Gardiner hoped at least to reach one of the beaches and ground the vessel. Events now happened, however, with dramatic rapidity, and within 25 minutes of the leak being discovered, the vessel had foundered. The water was found to be making rapidly, and efforts at increased speed only increased the flow. In the dim moonlight the crew could see that the bow of the vessel was slowly settling down. The ship's boat, which was on the bridge deck, was manned and the crew scrambled into the boat, some having to jump from the deck. In the confusing light the engineer misjudged the position of the boat and his leap ended in the water. With feverish haste he was hauled on board, and the crew commenced to pull away. After a few strokes the Queen Bee seemed to rise slightly and then settled finally into the swell. The shore some miles away was fit fully visible in the fading moonlight, and the party rowed on for Palm Beach. Here they landed and proceeded to the house of the post-mistress. After being served with hot coffee and their clothes drying alongside the fire, the whole company was picked up by motor car at 5 o'clock, and brought back to Sydney. Mr. R. V. Saddington, one of the part-owners of the vessel, stated at the news of her loss that it was one of the greatest shocks he had ever received. 'We looked upon the Queen Bee as being quite sound and equal in sea going qualities to anything plying in the coal fleet' said Mr. Saddington. 'Some time ago we spent a large sum of money in having various things done to the vessel, and' we have never had a complaint about the boat.' ==External links== * https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/maritimeheritageapp/ViewSiteDetail.aspx?siteid=733 ==References== Category:Shipwrecks of the Northern Sydney Region Category:Ships built in New South Wales Category:1907 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1922 Category:1922 in Australia Category:1901 – World War I ships of Australia Category:Interwar period ships of Australia Category:Colliers of Australia Category:Wooden steamships of Australia ","title":"Queen Bee (steamer)"},{"id":"61607703","text":"The Taekwondo at the 1987 Southeast Asian Games was held between 17 September to 19 September at Grogol Youth Centre. ==Medal summary== ===Men's=== { - Fly weight (50 kg)  Budi Setiawan  Anan Meksawan  Ramasamy Selvamuthu * * * Robert Vargas - Feather weight  Pairat Suteeratat  Parto Kusumo  Rahim Ahmad * * * Siu Hung Quock - Welter weight  Lanting  Jesus Morales  Tee Liang Lian * * * Barry Voon - Heavy weight  A.

J. Simpson murder case, 108 exhibits of DNA evidence, including 61 drops of blood, were presented at trial allegedly linking O. J. Simpson to the crime. With no witnesses to the murders, the prosecution was dependent on DNA as the only physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime. Testing was cross-checked and validated at three separate labs using different tests with no discrepancies found. The prosecution offered the defense access to the evidence samples to conduct their own testing, but they declined. The defense summarized their reasonable doubt theory as \\"compromised, contaminated, corrupted\\". They argued that the evidence was 'compromised' during the collection phase of evidence gathering by mishandling and 100% of the \\"Real Killer(s)\\" DNA was lost, and then 'contaminated' during the processing phase with Simpsons preserved DNA being transferred to all but three exhibits. The remaining three were 'corrupted' as they allege that the police planted that blood evidence. Due to its abundance and exhaustive validation, the prosecution considered the DNA evidence infallible. However, at this time the public was unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching and the prosecution struggled to get the jury to appreciate this. The defense, on the other hand, had to change strategies after neither of their forensic DNA experts would support their theory. The new strategy, according to defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, intended to elicit a cherry picking response from the jury whereby they would discard all of the \\"mountain\\" of DNA evidence against Simpson if they could show \\"a few of the hills\\" were corrupted by police fraud resulting in a jury nullification for the murders via an error of impunity. Although three exhibits were allegedly planted, by closing arguments lead defense attorney Johnnie Cochran had focused on a single exhibit: the bloody glove found by detective Mark Fuhrman at Simpson's Rockingham home. After his acquittal, all of the DNA experts returned to testify in the wrongful death civil trial. == Background == === Judge Lance Ito === Judge Ito made several important decisions concerning the DNA section of the trial. First he allowed the defense to argue that some of the evidence was planted despite producing no evidence that it was. Next he ruled the prosecution must reserve at least 10% of the DNA samples for the defense to test themselves. The prosecution actually preserved nearly all the samples for the defense but they ultimately declined to test the samples themselves. Next Ito allowed John Gerdes to testify about contamination in prior LAPD cases. His testifying about prior mistakes is prejudicial to the prosecution and misleading to the jury because it allowed Gerdes to conflate evidence of contamination in previous cases with the Simpson case. In the subsequent civil trial, all of decisions were reversed by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, who banned all allegations of police conspiracy and only allowed Dr. Gerdes to testify to confirmed cases of contamination, in this case only. === Thano Peratis === Prison nurse Thano Peratis testified he drew an undocumented amount of blood from Simpson. When the defense asked him to estimate how much he drew, he stated approximately 8mL. Records from the testing labs show that only 6.5mL of blood could be accounted for, and the defense claimed that 1.5mL was missing. During the rebuttal phase, Peratis testified again and clarified he believes he only took 6.5mL as the records show. === Philip Vannatter === Detective Philip Vannatter testified that Simpson volunteered to give some blood for comparison to the evidence samples. Peratis drew an undocumented amount from Simpson on June 13 at approximately 3:30 pm and sealed it in an envelope and gave it to Vannatter. The detective documented what happened and hand delivered the sample to criminalist Dennis Fung who was at Rockingham collecting evidence at approximately 5:30 pm. At trial, Peratis's documentation confirmed the blood draw at 3:30 pm and the jail's security camera show that Vannatter left the jail at approximately 4:00 pm and the laser disc recorder on his police car confirmed that he did drive for over an hour to get to Rockingham. The log book at the crime scene showed the detective arrived at 5:20 pm and Fung's written notes confirm that Vannatter transferred custody of Simpson's blood at 5:30 pm and the envelope was still sealed. Ron Goldman's and Nicole Brown's blood, taken at autopsy by Deputy Medical Examiner Irwin Golden, was booked immediately into evidence by detective Vannatter. Detective Mark Fuhrman never had custody of any of the reference blood. Vannatter's decision to take the blood directly to Simpson's home rather than booking it into evidence was criticized after the trial for making evidence planting even possible. He defended his decision noting Dennis Fung testified the envelope was still sealed when he received it. The defense would allege the police stole and planted one drop of Simpsons blood on the back gate at Nicole Browns home, not his home. == Prosecution case and witnesses == === \\"Mountain of DNA evidence\\" === Crime scene photo at Nicole Brown's home The only physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime was DNA evidence. The volume of DNA evidence was unique and criminalists felt they could reconstruct the crime with enough accuracy to resemble an eyewitness account. With over one hundred exhibits, the defense would have to discredit all of them to establish reasonable doubt. The prosecution also produced corroborating evidence - hair follicles, clothing fibers from the victims and fibers from the Bronco - found with the exhibits to corroborate their theory of how the crime was committed. Mistakes made during the evidence collection were highlighted and repeated during DNA expert cross-examination but the prosecution began offering evidence refuting the claim that the mistakes rendered the results unreliable. With three different labs cross-checking the evidence and no discrepancies found during testing plus the defense declining to challenge the results by testing the evidence themselves, the prosecution expected a conviction. However, three assumptions about the jury turned out to be inaccurate: they would listen during the testimony, they would understand the testimony and they would consider the testimony in rendering their verdict. Ultimately, none of these would be true. Geraldo Rivera asked several jurors what their reasonable doubt was concerning the blood drops found next to the bloody footprints near the victims that were photographed hours prior to Simpson's blood being drawn. Those samples were sent to Cellmarks for testing, not the LAPD, and were shown to be Simpson's blood with chances of error being 1-in-9.7 billion. Juror Carrie Bess responded that she thinks the blood belonged to Simpson's children, Juror Marsha Rubin-Jackson responded she thinks Simpson's blood was left there next to the bloody footprints prior to the murders happening and Foreman Amanda Cooley responded she had no explanation for that incriminating evidence and stated it didn't factor into her reasonable doubt decision.  Dennis Fung  Criminalist Dennis Fung testified from April 3–5, April 11–14 and April 17–18, 1995. He testified to how the blood evidence was collected from the crime scene, the white Ford Bronco and at Simpson's home. He also testified that detective Philip Vannatter gave him Simpson's reference vial of blood when he was at Rockingham. The cross-examination between Fung and Barry Scheck lasted nine days. Scheck's aggressive questioning along with Fung's unusual willingness to volunteer confusing information while answering made the prosecution scramble to explain his answers. He said he did not see a blood drop on the back gate in a photo from June 13 despite collecting blood from that spot on July 3. Later the prosecution found a photo that showed the blood was there on June 13. He also said he could not see blood on the socks he collected from Simpson's bedroom. The prosecution later demonstrated that blood is only visible under a microscope. He also admitted that blood evidence was collected in plastic bags, not paper bags as recommended, and stored in a police van without being refrigerated for up to seven hours. Scheck aggressively tried to shake Fung's time line about when he received Simpsons donated blood, hoping to show that police actually delivered it the following day, June 14, instead of June 13, giving them a whole day with Simpson's blood they could allegedly use to frame him. The ten-minute window was documented so Scheck tried to discredit Fung's documentation because a page of his notes had been replaced with a copy but the original was found and shown to be exactly the same.  Andrea Mazzola  Criminalist Andrea Mazzola testified on April 20, 1995 and from April 25–27, 1995. Her testimony was also interrupted by Jury problems. She testified to much the same as Dennis Fung - evidence collection, storage and transportation at the crime. During cross-examination, the defense tried to portray Mazzola as inexperienced. She defended herself stating she had just moved to LA recently and had worked at the Kern County Police district as a criminalist for eighteen months. She admitted to a few mistakes at the crime scene while collecting evidence including using one swatch to collect blood from three separate spots in the ford bronco and occasionally not changing gloves when picking up different pieces of evidence. She also verified the blood evidence was kept unrefrigerated for up to seven hours after collection.  Collin Yamauchi  Criminalist Collin Yamauchi testified from May 24-31,1995. He was the first scientist to handle and perform PCR analysis on several key evidence items, including the Rockingham glove and the sock from Simpson's bedroom. He testified that Simpson, Brown and Goldman's blood was on the glove found at Rockingham, Nicole's blood was found on the sock in Simpson's bedroom and Goldman's blood was found in Simpsons Bronco. All but one drop of blood collected by Fung and Mazzola was PCR testable. During cross examination he testified that during preparation for PCR testing that a reference card is created using Simpson's donated blood for comparison to the evidence items. When asked, he initially stated he was not sure he changed his gloves when he moved from the reference card to the evidence items but then remembered he did change his gloves. In either case, he maintains that he never touched any of the evidence items with his gloved hands and used sterile instruments to handle the items that were then changed between each item. The defense claimed that Yamauchi lied when he said he changed his gloves and did handle items with his gloved hands and transferred Simpsons DNA to the evidence items from the reference vial. Yamauchi denied this, stating that before and after each evidence item is tested a blank sterile control swatch is run to determine if cross contamination like that occurred and all of the controls were negative. Yamauchi also pointed out the defenses DNA expert Henry Lee did not change gloves either when he examined the evidence items.  Gregory Matheson  Gregory Matheson, chief forensic chemist at the Los Angeles Police Crime Lab, testified from May 1–5, 1995. His serology results revealed that blood drops found alongside a trail of bloody shoe prints leading from the victims matched Simpson's blood with the error rate being 1-in-200. Matheson stated that none of Mazzola's admitted mistakes would have resulted in contamination of evidence. Matheson also testified about the only drop of blood that was too degraded for testing found under Nicole Simpson's fingernails. The defense said that blood belonged to the \\"real killer\\" but Matheson said that blood was probably hers because that hand was found in a pool of her own blood and wet blood degrades quickly. Later criminalist Renee Montgomery, using a different test, proved it was Nicole Brown's blood. During cross-examination Matheson admitted that Fung and Mazzola made several mistakes during evidence collection. He admitted the blood from the bronco and back gate at Browns home should have been collected on June 13, not July 3, she should have used three separate swatches to collect from three different spots on the bronco not just one, and the evidence should have been refrigerated after collection in the police van. When asked about the 1.5mL of Simpsons blood unaccounted for he stated that Peratis didn't document how much was taken from Simpson so there is no way to prove that blood is actually missing. He noted though that small amounts of blood do stick to pipettes, gloves, and other lab instruments during testing so that could possibly explain some blood being unaccounted for.  Robin Cotton  Dr. Robin Cotton, Lab director of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified May 8–15, 1995. She testified to Restriction fragment length polymorphism or RFLP testing, the most precise DNA matching at the time. She testified that blood found on a sock in Simpsons bedroom was Nicole Brown's with a 1-in-170 million chance of error and that the blood drops next to bloody foot prints near Nicole's body was Simpsons with a 1-in-9.7 billion chance of error. During cross examination she admitted that two cross contamination errors had occurred at Cellmark in 1988 and 1989 but the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. She stated the DNA sample sizes needed for RFLP testing in this case are too large to be susceptible to the degraded DNA cross- contamination the defense alleged. The only possible scenario would be a mixture of two persons DNA being typed, Simpsons and the \\"Real Killer\\" if cross-contamination occurred, but only Simpsons was found. She admitted her tests cannot demonstrate how the blood got on Simpson's sock, meaning her tests do not refute the possibility the blood was planted.  Gary Sims  Criminalist Gary Sims of the California Department of Justice Crime Lab testified May 16 - 22, and again from May 31 to June 1, 1995. He testified to the results from DQ Alpha DNA matching. His results also showed Nicole Browns blood on the sock found at Rockingham with a 1-in-7.7-billion chance of error, the blood on the back gate at Brown's home matched Simpson and the blood found inside the Bronco belonged to the two victims with a 1-in-21 billion chance of error for both. During cross-examination the defense insinuated the matches were from the results from cross-contamination. Sims denied this stating that none of the 108 exhibits tested showed evidence of contamination and also mentioned the defense was offered the chance to test the evidence samples for contamination themselves but they declined. Gary Sims testified again on May 31 and had the jurors look at the socks from Simpson's bedroom with their naked eye and then through a microscope. The purpose of this demonstration was to show the blood stains were only visible under a microscope. During recross- examination Sims acknowledged that foliage can contaminate blood samples but denied that occurred on the drop of blood on the back gate at Brown's home. The defense then asked if that blood could have been planted by the police since it was collected on July 3rd and Fung said he didn't see it in the photo the defense showed him from June 13. Sims denied the claim and said a different photo of the same gate taken on June 13 shows the blood was already there.  Renee Montgomery  Criminalist Renee Montgomery of the California Department of Justice Crime Lab testified from May 23 to May 24, 1995. She reported the results from D1S80 DNA matching. She narrated her results using a poster board to reconstruct the prosecution's theory of how the crimes were committed. Her results show that Simpson was present during the murders as evidenced by his blood being found next to the bloody footprints next to the bodies. Her results show that he fled the scene through the back gate as evidence by his blood found on a trail of blood drops leading away from the victims towards and on the back gate. Her results then show he got in his Bronco and drove home as evidenced by the victim's blood found on the door outside and inside on the console of the Bronco. Her results then show he entered his home through the backyard as evidence by a trail of blood stains with his and the two victims found leading behind his home and the bloody glove found behind his home that had blood from all three. Her results suggest he changed his clothes prior to meeting the limousine driver as evidence by his sock he left in his bedroom having Nicole Brown Simpson's blood on it. During cross examination, when asked about mishandling of evidence at the crime scene, she stated none of the mistakes they made would add Simpson's blood to the evidence unless it was already there. When asked about cross-contamination with Simpsons preserved blood at the LAPD crime lab, she stated that all of the evidence she testified to, except the glove and sock, were shipped directly to her and not handled by anyone in that lab. When asked about the DNA on the glove being degraded after being kept unrefrigerated and then contaminated by Simpsons preserved DNA, she denied that happened at the LAPD lab. If all the DNA was degraded and then contaminated with Simpson's blood, only Simpsons DNA should be on the glove. The fact that the victims' blood was found as well is proof that that did not happen. When asked about the reliability of her relatively new test, she stated its the same test the FBI is currently using and is accepted in every courtroom in the country, as reliable science. == Defense case and witnesses == === \\"Compromised, Contaminated, Corrupted\\" === Poster describing reasonable doubt theory proposed by the defense. The defense stated the DNA evidence against Simpson was not reliable. They said the police compromised the evidence by committing several mistakes when collecting it including occasionally not changing gloves between evidence items, using one swatch to collect blood from three drops of blood on the bronco dashboard, packaging the swatches of blood evidence using plastic bags, not paper bags as recommended, and storing them in a police van for up to seven hours unrefrigerated. This resulted in 100% of the \\"real killers\\" DNA being lost. They argued that Simpson's blood found on the evidence samples resulted from contamination in the LAPD crime lab with the reference blood in all but three exhibits. The remaining three exhibits that could not be explained by contamination were planted by the police. Although evidence of mistakes made during collection were shown at trial, no evidence of their contamination or corruption claim was presented. The contamination claim was dependent on all the blood in the case being 100% degraded and the real killer's DNA lost. If that did not happen, contamination would only produce a mixture of Simpsons DNA and the killers. The contamination claim likewise would spread EDTA to the evidence samples which could be tested for as it was a preservative found in the reference vials of Simpson and the two victims. The contamination claim was also limited to just the LAPD crime lab as it was not alleged at the two consulting labs, the state department and Cellmarks diagnostics, were most of the DNA testing was done. The defense also declined to test the samples themselves for the “real killers” DNA or for EDTA. Once the prosecution began showing evidence the samples were not completely degraded and no EDTA was found in levels seen from the reference vials, the defenses reasonable doubt theory became increasingly more dependent on the claim the evidence was corrupted by a police conspiracy to frame Simpson. The predominately African American jury was receptive to it.  Fredric Rieders Dr. Fredric Rieders, a forensic toxicologist, testified on July 24, 1995 and again on August 14, 1995. During Direct examination he testified the results Agent Martz reported showed that EDTA was found in Simpsons blood drop on the back gate at Nicole Brown's home and Nicole Brown's blood drop on the sock in Simpson's bedroom. Using a reference article from the EPA, he testified that because the amount of EDTA in that blood is measured in \\"parts-per-million\\" (PPM) and the reference article states normally EDTA in the blood should only be detectable in \\"parts-per-billion\\" (PPB), the evidence blood contains a thousand times more EDTA than it should. Because EDTA is used as a preservative in purple top tubes for lab draws, he stated the blood could have come from their reference vials. During cross-examination the claim was immediately debunked when the prosecution gave Rieders a fax copy of the EPA article he referenced during his testimony and had him read it out loud to the jury demonstrating he misread it and it does say \\"parts-per-million\\" of EDTA is normally found in blood. Rieders then claimed it was a typo but the prosecution produced a certified copy directly from the EPA, confirming the PPM units of measure. The defense called Rieders again on August 14. During redirect he clung to his claim the EDTA came from the reference vials, denied that PPM of EDTA could be found in unpreserved blood and denied that it was still used in food. During re-cross examination the claim was debunked again. This time agent Martz tested his own unpreserved blood and found PPM of EDTA, disproving Rieders' claim. Then Dr. Rieders admitted that the EDTA results from Martz's unpreserved blood were similar to the evidence blood drops in question and not even close to levels from Martz's persevered blood from a purple top tube, which had more than a hundred times more EDTA than the evidence samples. The prosecution also produced an article from the FDA showing that not only is EDTA still used in food (which Rieders denied), it is found in the French fries and Big Mac that Simpson ate approximately one hour before the murders.https://web.archive.org/web/20071211050729/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/09.html He admitted Agent Martz was correct that he could not identify EDTA from a presumptive test and the identification test was inconclusive, meaning this could not even be EDTA at all. Rieders also admitted that he proposed to test Simpson and Browns preserved blood for EDTA levels and compare those results to the evidence sample to confirm his claim but the defense declined to have the test done. Dr. Rieders would testify to the same claim at the civil trial on December 20, 1996 but admitted during direct examination \\"I don't know where [the EDTA] came from\\" and that the EDTA could have come from contamination of the blood stains in the laboratory. The claim of EDTA on the sock coming from Nicole Brown's reference vial was conclusively disproven by Dr. Cotton who showed the DNA in the reference vial was more degraded than the DNA on the sock, proving it could not have come from that vial.  Roger Martz FBI Special Agent Roger Martz testified on July 25 and July 26, 1995. The defense called Agent Martz because Dr. Rieders had used his data during his testimony. During direct examination he initially testified the blood samples \\"responded like EDTA responded\\" and \\"was consistent with the presence of EDTA\\" but then stated that he could not identify EDTA in the evidence samples This apparent turnaround during direct examination stunned the defense and when they accused Martz of changing his demeanor during the lunch break he admitted he had because he realized he was not being entirely truthful in his testimony before because he was only giving \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" answers. During cross examination, Martz narrated his answers and stated EDTA is also used in food and detergents and not just blood test tubes. Martz demonstrated this by testing some of Nicole Brown's clothing that did not have blood on it and found EDTA was present. Martz then tested his own unpreserved blood and found EDTA was present there as well. Martz then compared EDTA levels in his own unpreserved blood to the evidence samples and showed they were similar. He then compared both of those results to his preserved blood in a blood test tube and showed they were not even close. Martz said that environmental conditions would not affect EDTA because it is a stable substance (one evidence sample was outside on the back gate at browns home) and demonstrated this by testing some preserved blood that was over a year old and showed the EDTA level was still the same as his own preserved blood taken only a few days prior. Martz also stated that, although the presumptive test mentioned by Dr. Rieders was positive, the identification test for EDTA was inconclusive, meaning he could not positively identify EDTA was present.  Edward T Blake  Dr. Edward Blake was retained by Simpson's defense team to discredit the DNA evidence. Blake is a world-renowned forensic scientist who pioneered the establishment PCR testing as a reliable forensic science. The prosecution had tried to retain Blake before learning the defense had already done so. All of the DNA experts were familiar with Blake and Gary Sims, who ran the state department lab, was one of his students. He was slated to testify but was dropped from the witness list on March 30, 1995. After concluding his review of the case, he informed the defense that his testimony is not likely to be helpful. His review found nothing negative to say about the tests from the State Department and Cellmark Diagnostics, concluding those results are likely valid and If he testified he would have to turnover his reports stating the reasons why he reached that conclusion. He was subsequently replaced by microbiologist, Dr. John Gerdes.  John Gerdes Dr. John Gerdes testified from August 2-4 and August 7,1994. Prior to his testimony, the prosecution asked to limit his testimony to just evidence of contamination in this case only but Judge Ito allowed him to testify about other cases of contamination as well, which they said would be misleading to the jury. During direct examination he testified \\"The LAPD crime lab has a substantial contamination problem. It is chronic in the sense that it doesn't go away.\\" Gerdes testified that because of the LAPD's history of contamination, he would not consider any of the PCR results, in this case, valid because they were done by the LAPD.. He testified that both the state department and Cellmark diagnostics had made cross-contamination errors in the past too. He testified their PCR results are not valid either because the evidence they tested went \\"through the LAPD\\" for packaging and shipping. The three RFLP matches he admitted were valid. Prior to his cross-examination, journalists had already observed his testimony was unreliable as he was clearly pandering to defense, noting the only three DNA tests he said were valid were the same three the defense claimed were planted. If he had said those were the result of contamination, he would have contradicted the defenses corruption claim. His claim that \`\`you can no longer have any scientific confidence in″ a newly available RFLP match linking Ron Goldman to Simpsons bronco because the tow-truck driver had stolen items from it was also mentioned as proof he was pandering. They claim the reason Gerdes said that is because earlier he said RFLP results are not susceptible to contamination because the amount of DNA needed for that test is too large but the defense claimed those three exhibits were planted. Now the prosecution had a new RFLP match to Goldman's blood in the Bronco that couldn't be explained by contamination or fraud, so Gerdes made that claim instead. During cross- examination Gerdes admitted having no experience or training in forensic evidence gathering or forensic DNA testing and had never done any of the tests whose results he was criticizing at trial himself or at his lab. He's testified in 23 trials; consistently for criminal defendants charged with rape, murder or both, claiming the DNA evidence against them was unreliable because of contamination. He also admitted making the same cross-contamination error he criticized the LAPD, State Department and Cellmark's lab had made in prior years, at his own lab as well. He also admitted the LAPD's crime lab has more safeguards in place against contamination than his own lab. When Judge Ito instructed Gerdes to narrow his testimony to facts about this case during cross, journalist noted his demeanor changed as his contamination claim became more dubious. He claimed it was possible for 100% of the \\"real killers\\" DNA to degrade so every molecule was gone in the seven hours they had spent unrefrigerated in the police van but then admitted that scientists had gotten analyzable DNA for PCR tests from mummies and even fossils. He also admitted that contamination for the results at Cellmark's and the state department could only have occurred at the crime scene since LAPD packaged and ship most of the evidence they tested directly there. If that is where contamination occurred, that means Simpsons blood was at the crime scene. He later admitted that in the civil trial. He finally admitted there was no evidence cross- contamination occurred in this case and he was only testifying to \\"what might have occurred and not what actually did occur\\". During the civil trial, Gerdes testified again. This time he was only allowed to testify about the facts in this case and could only infer from things that actually did happen. He admitted there was no evidence cross-contamination had occurred and that Simpsons blood was at the crime scene and Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman's blood was in the bronco and neither could be explained by contamination.  Henry Lee  Dr. Henry Lee, director of the Connecticut State Forensics Science Laboratory, testified on August 23-24, 25 and 28. He stated he discovered shoe imprints near the murder scene that could not have come from the shoes the prosecution claims Simpson wore the night of the murders, suggesting a second attacker was present. Lee noted that the blood patterns suggested Goldman tried to fend off his attacker for an extended period of time, contradicting the prosecutions claim the murders only took minutes. Dr. Lee did not support the defenses claim of police fraud, but several of his answers gave the appearance he did. He testified that bloodstains on the console of the Bronco were consistent with a smearing motion which the defense said was evidence it was planted there by police. Lee also said he agreed with blood spatter expert Herbert MacDonell that the blood splatter on sock suggested the blood soaked through while no one was wearing it which the defense claimed was evidence the blood was planted on the sock. The defense implied that Lee's statement \\"something's wrong\\" with the blood evidence in the case meant Lee supported their allegations that police planted evidence. During cross-examination Lee stated Dr. Gerdes cross-contamination theory was \\"highly improbable\\". He also admitted that the bloody shoe prints that were next to the bodies did come from a rare pair of Bruno Magli shoes the prosecution claimed Simpson owned. Lee also admitted that he could not rule out the extra shoe prints found at the crime scene were caused by the police when they were there. Dr. Henry Lee testified during the civil trial as well but stated clearly he never meant his testimony to suggest that police planted evidence. When he said \\"there's something wrong,\\" he meant the quality of police lab procedures.. === Police Conspiracy Allegations === The defense conspiracy allegation of planted evidence primarily focused on three exhibits initially: the blood on the Bundy back gate, the blood on the sock from Simpson's bedroom and the glove found at his Rockingham estate. However, by the end of the trial the defense would eventually claim that virtually all of the blood evidence was planted by the police including the blood drops found next to the bloody foot prints (match Simpson), the trail leading away from the victims (match Simpson), the blood on the back gate at Nicole Browns home (match Simpson), the blood inside and outside Simpson's Bronco (matched Simpson and both victims); the glove found at Simpson's residence at Rockingham (match Simpson and both victims), the blood inside and outside of his home on Rockingham (match Simpson); and the blood on the socks in his bedroom (match Simpson and Nicole Brown).  Bundy Back Gate  The defense claimed that one drop of blood on the back gate at Nicole Brown's home was planted by the police. As evidence they offered the blood contained EDTA, a preservative found in purple top tubes used for blood draws, it was collected several weeks later on July 3, rather than on June 13, and 1.5 mL of Simpsons donated reference blood was unaccounted for. The officer who planted it was not named by the defense. The prosecution countered that the EDTA levels found in the blood was consistent with that found normally in unpreserved blood and not even close to the levels found in blood preserved in a purple top tube. A different photograph of the gate on June 13 shows the blood was already there and the claim of some of Simpson's reference blood missing from the vial was refuted during rebuttal by the nurse who drew it who clarified he believes he only drew the amount the records show was used for testing.  The Sock  The defense claimed that blood found on a sock in Simpson's bed was planted there by Detective Vannatter. As evidence, they offered that Vannatter did have possession of Nicole Brown's autopsy blood briefly prior to booking it into evidence and the blood contained EDTA, a preservative found in the reference vial of Nicole Brown autopsy blood. The claim was refuted by the defenses own witness, FBI special agent Roger Martz who showed the level of EDTA in that blood drop is consistent with unpreserved blood and not even close to the levels that would be seen in blood from a purple top tube. The prosecution also countered that no blood was ever claimed to be missing from Nicole Brown's reference vial and that the records show Detective Vannatter booked the reference vials from the victims immediately into evidence right after receiving it from Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Irwin Golden. Dr. Cotton conclusively refuted that claim by showing the blood in the reference vial is substantially more degraded than the blood on the sock, proving it did not come from that vial.  Rockingham Glove  The defense claimed the bloody glove found at Simpsons Rockingham estate was planted by Detective Mark Fuhrman who said he found it there. No physical or eyewitness evidence ever surfaced supporting that claim. The only reason given at trial for believing it was planted was Fuhrman had perjured himself when he said he had never use the word \\"nigger\\" in the last ten years. The glove contained DNA from Simpson and both victims and the blood did not contain EDTA which rules out it coming from the reference vials. Thus, if Fuhrman planted the glove at Rockingham from the crime scene, that means Simpson's blood was at the crime scene which contradicts his claim he was home that night. Fuhrman's DNA was also not found on the glove which supports his claim he did not plant it. The prosecution argued that Fuhrman didn't plant the glove because he didn't know if Simpson had an air-tight alibi that night. Vincent Bugliosi concurs with the prosecutor's argument noting as well that Fuhrman did not know whose blood was on it at the time either. == Acquittal and aftermath == All of the jurors were initially confident in their reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence. All maintain they understood the DNA evidence presented at trial and defended their decision in books and interviews. However, their confidence began eroding after the following events occurred after the trial. === Civil Trial === A separate jury found Simpson liable for the murders in a civil trial one year after being acquitted in the criminal trial. Civil liability has a lower burden of proof than guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but it is very rare for someone to be found liable for a crime after being acquitted for committing the crime. At the civil trial, Dr. Cotton showed the DNA in Nicole Brown's reference vial was more degraded than her DNA on the sock from Simpson's bedroom, proving it could not have come from that vial, as the defense alleged. At the civil trial, John Gerdes admitted Simpsons blood was at the crime scene and both Nicole Brown and Ron Goldmans blood was in the bronco and neither could be explained by cross- contamination. === Publications === Several jurors co-wrote and published Madam Foreman: A rush to judgement? (1995) defending their reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence. Critics panned the book saying it is filled with so many factual inaccuracies, illogical arguments and spelling errors that it reinforced, not refute, the criticism they did not understand it. Prosecutor Marcia Clark published Without a Doubt after the trial stating the jurors did not understand the DNA evidence because they were unfamiliar with it and deliberately confused by the defense about it. She pointed out that during jury selection, the defense had specifically tried to seat jurors who were unfamiliar with DNA evidence. Prosecutor Christopher Darden published In Contempt and reiterated Clark's claim the jury did not understand the DNA evidence. He claimed their relative lack of education played a role in their confusion noting ten did not have college degrees and one didn't even have a high school diploma. He also noted that multiple news outlets reported the jury not paying attention during the DNA section of the trial. Prosecutor George Clarke published Justice and Science: Trials and Triumphs of DNA Evidence and stated the defense abandoned their claim the DNA evidence was unreliable after the Fuhrman tapes were discovered because they believed they had a motive for the evidence being planted and that would explain the results too. Defense attorney Robert Shapiro published The Search for Justice and in it, he states he does not believe the police planted blood evidence against Simpson as suggested at trial. Lead Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran published Journey for Justice and writes that Simpson is a victim of Lange, Vannatter, and Fuhrman's police fraud to plant blood evidence against him. Critics panned the book calling it \\"self-aggrandizement\\" and noted that Cochran says Simpson is innocent because police planted some but not all the blood evidence against him. Detective Mark Fuhrman published Murder in Brentwood and defended himself against the claim he planted blood evidence, noting he never had custody of any of the reference blood. He denied planting the bloody glove at Simpson's home because no one knew his blood was on it until two days later when the labs tested it. He also revealed that, contrary to popular belief, he did want to testify again after the tapes revealed he used racial slurs in the past to explain those comments but the prosecution refused to redirect him. He stated his taking the 5th amendment was at the suggestion of his attorney. Detectives Tom Lange and Philip Vannatter published Evidence Dismissed: The Inside Story of the Police Investigation of O.J. Simpson and defended themselves against corruption allegation writing that no blood from either Nicole Brown or Ron Goldman's reference vial was ever said to be missing and Dennis Fung had testified that the vial of Simpsons blood Vannatter delivered to him at Rockingham was still sealed in its envelope. They stated Fuhrman did not plant the Rockingham glove and Simpson's blood on the glove did not come from the reference vial either because it didn't contain EDTA. Defense forensic DNA expert Dr. Henry Lee published Blood Evidence: How Dna Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes (2003) and writes the cross-contamination theory was implausible and maintains he does not believe the police planted evidence. He also opines the jury may not have understood the DNA evidence as critics suggested. Vincent Bugliosi published Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder (1997) and writes the jury had dismissed the blood evidence by jury deliberations, noting they did not even ask to review it prior to rendering their verdict. He concurs with Darden and Clark that the jury didn't understand the blood evidence because of a combination of factors including unfamiliarity with it, relative lack of education and deliberate confusion by the defense about its reliability. He partially faults Judge Ito for the confusion for allowing the defense expert to conflate contamination mistakes made in other cases with this one. M.L Rantala writes in O.J. Unmasked: The Trial, The Truth and the Media (1996) that the jurors' inability to justify their reasonable doubt about all the DNA evidence reinforced the criticism they did not understand it and that is why media reenactments of the trial, such as The People v. O.J Simpson: American Crime Story and O.J: Made in American, continue to depict them that way. === Television === CSI: Crime Scene Investigation premiered in 2000 and ran for 15 seasons popularizing forensic science with the public, especially the reliability of DNA testing. === Comments after trial === Defense attorney Robert Kardashian stated during an interview afterwards he had doubts about Simpson's innocence specifically because of the blood evidence and later severed ties with him and testified for the Goldmans during the civil trial. Defense attorney Alan Dershowitz stated during an interview after the trial the defense had concluded they could not raise reasonable doubt about all of the DNA evidence and instead attempted to elicit a cherry picking response from the jury whereby they would discard all of the DNA evidence against Simpson if they could show some of it was planted by the police. He said they did prove Vannatter planted Nicole Brown's blood on the sock despite Dr. Cotton debunking that claim at the civil trial. Defense attorney Carl Douglas stated the racial gap concerning Simpson's guilt is shrinking for two reasons: his celebrity status has faded among African Americans and greater acceptance of DNA evidence as reliable. He notes research shows African American mistrust of the police remains unchanged. He declined to say whether or not he thinks Simpson is innocent. Defense attorney Barry Scheck stated in an interview that he and Peter Neufeld only attacked the way the DNA evidence had been collected and preserved but not the reliability of the results. Scheck specifically said the outcome of the trial \\"muddied\\" the premise of the Innocence Project. Neither Scheck or Neufeld believe the police planted blood evidence against Simpson as suggested at trial. Neither of their publications after the trial mention the Simpson case. Defense attorney Gerald Uelmen stated the defense's strategy was to raise reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence based on how it was collected and preserved at the crime scene, not the results obtained at the lab. Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey is the only member of the defense that still advocates for Simpson's innocence. Defense forensic DNA expert Ed Blake revealed after the trial that he didn't testify because his review of the case found no criticism of the testing conducted by Gary Sims or Dr. Robin Cotton. Defense non-forensic expert Dr. John Gerdes testimony raising doubt about most of the DNA evidence via contamination is omitted by the defense in all of their post- trial publications about the trial despite jurors mentioning his testimony in justifying their reasonable doubt, especially in their immediate post-trial interviews and in Madam Foreman (1995). Unlike the other experts in this case, Gerdes did not enjoy publicity from the trial because his claim that forensic DNA testing is unreliable was not true. This abandonment by the Dream Team of Gerdes contamination claim after the trial made the jury defending their verdict untenable. Subsequent portrayals of the trial in the media often omit his testimony as well and none of the defense attorneys retained him again, including Scheck and Neufeld. === Jurors === Geraldo Rivera asked three jurors what their reasonable doubt was concerning the blood found next to the bloody footprints near the victims. Photos of the crime scene show the blood was there hours before blood from Simpson was taken so it wasn't planted. The blood was collected and shipped directly to the state department lab, not the LAPD lab, so contamination couldn't explain it and the blood was testable so it wasn't compromised and Dr. Cotton said the chances it wasn't Simpsons was 1-in-9.7 billion. Foreman Amanda Cooley responded she had no explanation for that incriminating evidence and it didn't factor into their reasonable doubt decision, implying she ignored it. Juror Marsha Rubin-Jackson responded she thinks Simpson's blood was left there next to the bloody footprints prior to the murders happening. The defense never suggested this and Simpson said he was never there that day. Juror Carrie Bess responded that she thinks the blood belonged to Simpson's children. Dr Cotton said the chances of it being anyone else other than O.J. Simpson was 1-in-9.7 billion. Lionel \\"Lion\\" Cryer  Lionel \\"Lion\\" Cryer was one of the jurors who came out strong for Simpson's innocence during deliberations and afterward; he was known in the media as the juror who raised a Black Power salute after the \\"not guilty\\" verdict was announced, an act that generated considerable controversy. However, in interviews in the 2010s, Cryer stated he does now believe that Simpsons is guilty of the murders. He admitted that what he thought at the time was reasonable doubt of the DNA evidence really wasn't. He stated that portion of the trial dragged on longer than most people realize. In media portrayals, the DNA section of the trial is shortened to just the important clips, whereas the jurors had to listen to eight hours a day for nearly nine weeks of technical terminology that was difficult to follow. He admits the jury not reviewing the DNA evidence during deliberations was a mistake, but states its because most of them have voted to acquit during the initial straw poll, and the two hold outs changed their mind quickly so further review of the evidence was not necessary. ==References== Category:1994 in Los Angeles Category:1994 in mass media Category:1994 in television Category:1994 murders in the United States Category:1995 in Los Angeles Category:1990s trials Category:20th century American trials Category:Criminal investigation Category:Criminal trials that ended in acquittal Category:Domestic violence Category:Domestic violence in the United States Category:Legal history of California Category:Murder in Los Angeles Category:National Football League controversies Category:O.

World was one of three games available on the extra audio card, alongside Silpheed and Cakewalk Apprentice. It is an on-line version of the popular PC title, written specifically for Prodigy. This version had a new adventure each week. The game was pitted to teach geography in an \\"exciting new way\\". == Gameplay and plot == Players can find the game through a series of menus for instance the Stories Menu, or by '[JUMP]: carmen'. Once in the game, the player will see 4 menu options: the current case, a How To Play page, Last Week's Winners, and an Acme Detective Agency Honor Roll. Clicking on the game yields three choices: start the case, read the eight criminal dossiers, or look at some hints. As with other games in the series, World sees players traipse behind Carmen and her crooks in the hunt to capture them in the least amount of time possible. Players travel to three cities per case - after two stops the players should have enough information to know the name on the arrest warrant; in the third city the player must find the criminal and make the arrest with the correct warrant. When players start a case, they navigate through a series of screens that introduce them to the case, and then they are introduced to the first city of investigation. Each city offered three locations to explore, for instance in Rome the player may visit the Auditorio, the Colosseum, or the Spanish Steps. Only one of the locations will yield both a clue about the next location and the thief's identity. If the player chooses the wrong location, their score goes up by 15 points and they are lectured by The Chief. In the third city, The Chief asks the player to create an arrest warrant - players complete this by making selections in the crime computer about the suspect's characteristics, players don't need to fill in every option but need enough information to narrow down to one suspect. They can narrow down their search options by looking at the suspect's dossiers. The dossiers reveal information about the suspect's sex, hair color, vehicle, distinguishing feature (like tattoo, scar, or limp), and hobby, which will help identify the correct suspect when utilising clues in the crime computer. In-game gameplay - dossiers are vital to give clues to players to help them correctly identify the suspect by comparing information to clues given out by witnesses in city locations. This version was also a contest: the more quickly the player solved the puzzle, the lower their score. Points are given out based on actions taken in the game - it takes 5 hours to investigate any location in a city, and 15 hours to move from one city to the next. Players generally need to explore at least one location in each city to have enough information to complete each case. The perfect score is 60 – 45 hours to move three times, and 5 hours each to investigate one place in each city while guessing the correct location of the thief in the last city on the first try, a 1-out-of-3 chance. The lowest (best) scores saw the player's name posted in the Prodigy service weekly hall of fame the following week. Only the player's first score in any week counts toward beating other members on the honor roll, players are able to play multiple times afterwards for fun. It was designed as a game of interest for younger members. The Prodigy service version offered new stories weekly that were always related to current events. == Critical reception == The New York Times noted: \\"Because electronic books and games can be \\"published\\" more quickly than conventional books, Prodigy's \\"Carmen\\" is very topical\\". PC Mag noted it wasn't as graphically pleasing as the genuine article and wondered aloud if parents would want their kids using up the phone line for hours at a time to play the game. Compute felt the move was surprising for the popular Carmen Sandiego franchise, commenting that there was \\"even\\" an online version of the game. Mocagh suggested that the gameplay of the online version trumps the tradition game in which the player has the same experience each time they play. The Official Guide to the Prodigy Service wrote that the game is \\"really challenging for kids in fourth grade and up [and] entertaining for adults\\", and advises that players \\" always read through the dossiers\\" before playing - they also recommended playing with an encyclopedia or almanac handy, and visiting the next location even if only receiving a location clue because players can always receive enough suspect clues in the other cities. == References == Category:Carmen Sandiego games Category:Online games ","title":"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

The commandery was established during late Qin dynasty. In Western Han dynasty, the commandery administered 14 counties, including Qingyang (清陽), Dongwucheng (東武城), Yimu (繹幕), Ling (靈), Cuo (厝), Shu (鄃), Beiqiu (貝丘), Xincheng (信成), Shati (𢘿題), Dongyang (東陽), Xinxiang (信郷), Liao (繚), Zaoqiang (棗強) and Fuyang (復陽).

By 140 AD during the eastern Han dynasty, the number of counties had reduced to 7, and the population to 760,418, or 123,964 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 110. In 280 AD during the Western Jin dynasty, it administered 6 counties (Qinghe, Dongwucheng, Yimu, Beiqiu, Ling and Shu) with a population of 22,000 households.Book of Jin, Chapter 14. In several periods from Wentern Han to Jin dynasty, the commandery was converted to a principality and served as the fief of various imperial princes. After the Sixteen Kingdoms period, the commandery was successively held by Northern Wei, Eastern Wei, Northern Qi and Northern Zhou, before being abolished during early Sui dynasty. In Sui and Tang dynasties, Qinghe Commandery became an alternative name of Bei Prefecture (貝州).

She specialized in 16th and 17th century astronomy, wrote a book on the Great Comet of 1577, and was the translator of another book, a biography of Johannes Kepler. She became a professor at the Pratt Institute and later at the Queens College, City University of New York, and was recognized by membership in several selective academic societies. ==Early life and education== Hellman was born on August 28, 1910, in New York City. Her father, Alfred Myer Hellman, was an obstetrician and a collector of rare books; her mother Clarisse (née Bloom) later served as the only female member of the board of directors of Sydenham Hospital. She graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1926, and earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and astronomy (with election to Phi Beta Kappa) from Vassar College in 1930. She then became a Vassar College Fellow at Radcliffe College and completed a master's degree in the history of science at Radcliffe in 1931. According to biographer Joseph Dauben, this was \\"one of the country's earliest advanced degrees in history of science\\". At Radcliffe, Harvard historian of science George Sarton became one of her mentors. She became a doctoral student at Columbia University and, interrupting her studies to marry and raise two daughters, completed her Ph.D. in 1943. Her dissertation concerned the Great Comet of 1577, and was titled The Comet of 1577: Its Place in the History of Astronomy. In it, she credits Columbia professor Frederick Barry for supervising her doctoral research, and thanks Sarton and Lynn Thorndike for their encouragement, suggestions, and criticism. The dissertation was also published as a book in 1944 by the Columbia University Press, and reprinted in 1971 by the AMS Press of New York. ==Later life and career== In 1949, Hellman began a ten-year term on the council of the History of Science Society. In 1951, she was appointed to the faculty of the Pratt Institute, in the Department of Social Studies, and in the early 1950s she led the effort to found The New York Section of the History of Science Society. In 1959 she published her second book, a translation of a biography of Johannes Kepler originally written in German by . It was reprinted by Dover Publications in 1993. She also represented the United States at the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science Congress on the History of Science in Spain in 1959, and was secretary of the following congress, in 1962 at Cornell University. Her research in 1959–1960 was supported by a National Science Foundation senior postdoctoral fellowship. Continuing to work at the Pratt Institute, she also began working as an adjunct professor at New York University in 1964. In 1966, she moved to Queens College, City University of New York, also teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center. She died in New York on March 28, 1973, after a long illness. Her husband, Morton Pepper (a lawyer and president of the Jewish Guild for the Blind) remarried and lived until 1988. Her daughters, Alice and Carol Pepper, married two brothers who both became academics, Robert L. and Paul R. Cooper. ==Books== ===The Comet of 1577=== Hellman's book The Comet of 1577: Its Place in the History of Astronomy collected and catalogued accounts of the Great Comet of 1577 by writers of the time. It also includes two introductory chapters based on the work of Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton summarizing what was known about comets prior to 1577. Prior works in the history of astronomy largely told the tale only of astronomical observations, and Hellman broke from this tradition by including the writings of many others, including \\"preachers, poets, persons of general culture, and astrologers\\". The book's material on astronomical observations of the comet is divided, broadly, according to the measurement of parallax and its use in determining the position of the comet with respect to the moon, with one chapter on astronomers who believed it to be closer than the moon, another chapter on those who, finding no observable parallax, determined that it was farther away (chief among them Tycho Brahe), and a third on those who did not consider the question. Although Brahe himself rejected the sun- centered model of the solar system put forward by Nicolaus Copernicus, in favor of the more orthodox earth-centered model of the time, the observations of Brahe cast serious doubt on the earth-centered model and on its reliance on solid but transparent spheres supporting the planets, because they showed the comet passing through that space without obstruction. As the book briefly outlines in its conclusion, and as historians of science came to realize, in large part based on Hellman's work, these observations of the comet played a key role in the success of the Copernican Revolution of the early 17th century, in which the earth-centered model was supplanted by the sun-centered one. This changing view of Brahe's and the comet's place in the history of science is reflected in the book's reviews. Writing at the time of its first publication, historian Pearl Kibre sees the book as reflecting the continuity of medieval thought, rather than the break that was soon to come. Another contemporary reviewer, astronomer Nicholas T. Bobrovnikoff, while finding much to quibble about in the details of the book, seems perplexed both by its inclusion of non-astronomers and by its focus on parallax, writing that it would have been better to pay more attention to the direction of the comet's tail and what it would imply about the composition of comets. In contrast, at the book's republication in the 1970s, historian of science William H. Donahue credits Hellman with the recognition of the comet's role in the change in cosmology, calls her choice to include non-astronomical sources \\"admirable and powerful\\", and writes that, by focusing less on theoretical debates and more on thoroughly cataloging the works of the time, Hellman's book has become timeless, \\"ever assured a place in the first rank of works on the history of astronomy\\". By 1995, Albert van Helden, the Lynette S. Autrey Professor of History at Rice University, called her book \\"the standard treatment of the comet of 1577\\". ===Kepler=== German historian Max Caspar spent 50 years collecting and editing the works of Johannes Kepler. Kepler, his biography of Kepler, was originally published in German in 1948, and reprinted in 1950 and 1958, but until Hellman's translation there was nothing like it in English. Writing in Science, reviewer William D. Stahlman calls Caspar's book the definitive biography, and Hellman's translation excellent, smooth, and long- awaited. As well as translating Caspar's original text, Hellman also added footnotes with historical and biographical information, largely missing from the original, and corrected some errors. Some text written in Latin by Kepler and quoted by Caspar remains untranslated. The 1993 Dover edition added a new introduction and bibliography, contributed by Owen Gingerich and Alain Segonds. Reviewer Albert Van Helden described the book as standard and unchallenged as a biography of Kepler, and Hellman's translation as \\"beautiful\\". ==Recognition== Several learned societies honored Hellman by electing her as a member (or, for societies with open membership) to a higher honorary level of membership: She became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1960. She was elected to the International Academy of the History of Science in 1963, and became a full member in 1969. She was also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Spain considers the West African region as a priority for its foreign policy and recognizes the position of relevance that Nigeria occupies in the area.Ficha de Nigeria Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Diplomatic relations. A reflection of the fluid bilateral relations is the numerous reciprocal exchanges of candidacies between Spain and Nigeria in different international forums. Cooperation in the police field is especially satisfactory for both parties, who collaborate very fluently in the fight against illegal immigration, holding meetings on the subject and numerous exchanges, such as participation in various seminars and conferences in Spain by experts of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) and the National Agency for the fight against Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). From a military point of view, in the framework of the Africa Plan and the Defense Diplomacy Plan, between 2011 and the first half of 2012, three Spanish Navy patrols visited Nigeria (and other countries in the area), to carry out joint military operations and participate in training and training activities for local marine personnel. In the cultural field, Spain has gained visibility thanks to the annual organization by the Embassy of the Spanish Cultural Week, which celebrated its 10th edition in October 2015. This event allows to strengthen relations with Nigeria, more specifically with the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and National Orientation as well as with the different cultural institutions that depend on said Ministry, while promoting young local and Spanish talents. There has also been interest on the part of Spanish companies operating in the country, as well as local companies, in sponsoring this activity. There are already consolidated ties with the representatives of the Nigerian film industry, second worldwide in production volume, and with different local publishers. In the last 2–3 years, the world of photography has gained importance in the country, a field in which Spain also collaborates. Despite Spanish not being a recognized subject field at any Nigerian university, there are some academies that teach the language. In 2014, the Spanish Embassy in Abuja was recognized as an associate center for the conduct of DELE exams, and a first call for levels B1 and B2 was held on 22 November 2014. == Economic relations == Embassy of Nigeria in Madrid === Institutional framework === In 2006, the Secretary of State for Tourism and Commerce made a visit to Nigeria, accompanied by businessmen, in order to support the interests of Spanish companies that want to make investments in the country. Thus, a Memorandum of Understanding on Economic Cooperation was signed between the Nigerian Minister of Commerce and the Secretary of State in the presence of President Obasanjo, with the objectives of exchanging information about investment possibilities, acquiring commitments to review and, where appropriate, suppress measures that hinder trade and investment, and explore new fields in order to diversify Spanish investment. Since 2006, the Reciprocal Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (APPRI) is in force. Among its most notable aspects is the establishment of an arbitration procedure in case of conflict. In 2009, during the visit of the President of the Government of Spain, accompanied by numerous businessmen, the Agreement to Avoid Double Taxation was signed.Ficha de Nigeria Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Institutional framework. === Commercial exchanges === Spain is one of Nigeria's best customers thanks to crude oil imports. In 2014, it was the second best customer for the purchase of 6,500 million euros of oil and gas. Oil accounts for 76.2% of Nigeria's Spanish imports and Natural Gas another 22%. Regarding exports, although there has been a considerable increase in recent years, from €185 million in 2007 to €342 million in 2011, Spain's market share is small. However, in some sectors, the Spanish market share is high, such as ceramic products (21.2%), beverages (12.5%), mechanical devices (6.9%) or coloring materials and paint (5.5%). Exports show greater diversification, although 40% are referred to petroleum products. Other relevant exports are plastics, machinery, ceramic products, pipes for gas pipelines, frozen fish, paper, automobile accessories and pharmaceutical products. Due to heavy oil imports, the trade balance is traditionally very deficient for Spain and the coverage rate is usually at 7%.Ficha de Nigeria Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Commercial exchanges. === Business opportunities for the Spanish company === Nigeria presents good business opportunities due to its significant growth potential, its immense market of 170 million people, and the huge shortcomings in infrastructure, manufactured products and services. However, both physical and legal insecurity, installation costs due to huge electricity costs, as well as tariff barriers and protectionism, should be carefully considered in the face of any commercial and investment project. For the Spanish exporter, the construction sectors are of interest, both in raw materials (especially ceramic products) and construction equipment, general equipment goods, plastic manufactures, pharmaceuticals, non-alcoholic beverages and wine, as well as food products. For the investor, the oil and gas, energy and telecommunications sectors are interesting, in which opportunities arise as a result of the privatization process. The agricultural sector will receive a boost in the coming years.

The outcome of the pollution case took several years to complete with no acknowledgement of responsibilities from companies involved despite the closure of factory in 1994 that become the source of pollution. == Background == A rare earth extracting company named Asia Rare Earth Sdn Bhd (ARE) was established in 1979 for yttrium extraction in Bukit Merah, Perak with the biggest shareholders for the company was the Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd and Beh Minerals (both with 35% share) together with Tabung Haji and other Bumiputera businessmen owning lesser shares. In 1982, the newly established company began to extracting yttrium from a mineral named monazite which contains different earth elements with radioactive including thorium and uranium. Since the company of ARE starting its operation, residents from a nearby town of Papan began to complaining unpleasant odour and smoke from the factory where they also had breathing difficulty as a result of the pollution. The residents later discovering in 1984 that the extracting company of ARE had built a waste channel to a disposal site near their town under the consent of the state government of Perak. == Affected residents reaction towards the pollution == Upon knowing that the state government were in part involved in the activities, around 6,700 residents from the affected town of Papan and several others from nearby towns signed a petition that was subsequently sent to various government departments, including the Perak Menteri Besar and Malaysian Prime Minister offices, the Health Ministry and the Science, Technology and Environment Ministry while 3,000 residents including women and children participated in a peaceful assembly and another 200 blocked the road to the waste disposal site. == Government responses == Nonetheless, the Malaysian Prime Minister at the time Mahathir Mohamad responded that the government had taken every precaution to ensure safety with the construction of the radioactive disposal site will be continued regardless of the protest with the Science, Technology and Environment Minister Stephen Yong Kuet Tze also denying any potential health hazards and stressing that the disposal site was safe as it was built under strict regulations, challenging the affected residents to back up their claims that the disposal site was indeed hazardous. Despite the conclusion gathered from international experts, the government decided to proceed with the activities where the residents later continue their protests and performed a one day hunger strike against the government decision. In 1985, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam showed his concern by visiting the site and subsequent cabinet meeting lead by the latter was held to move the disposal site to the Kledang Range, about 5 kilometres from the town area. Following the third revelation, the federal government through a minister from the Prime Minister's Office Kasitah Gaddam said the levels were still safe despite it being more than the limit with an excuse reason such as the number of sites were very small. == Investigation and subsequent events == To prove that their claims was indeed true, the residents of Papan aided by residents from the nearby towns of Bukit Merah, Lahat, Menglembu and Taman Badri Shah formed the Bukit Merah Acting Committee. The committee was visited by a local environmentalist group Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM) who measured the radiation levels at the open space and pool near the factory with a conclusion that the radiation on these places to be 88 times higher than the upper limit allowed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) with a memorandum was then submitted to the country Prime Minister. With the increasing pressure, the Malaysian government then invited a team comprising members from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the factory where three international nuclear experts from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States also found that the waste channel are totally not safe for the public. Another expert from Japan were called thereafter to gather further evidence where he found that the radiation levels were 800 times the permitted maximum level. === Court case === Ipoh High Court, where the presiding on the case being held. In 1985, eight of the town residents including one who is a cancer victim bring the case to the High Court with 1,500 people from the affected area were present to hear the verdict. A temporarily stop work order was subsequently issued by the court until a satisfying safety measures being taken by the ARE company. However, in just a month after the order, the company invited an American atomic specialist to prove the factory are safe to continue their operation. This was countered with the second visit by the expert from Japan along with the revelation from two former workers of the company where they revealed further several thorium dumping sites in Bukit Merah to Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) with the Japanese expert discovered that the radiation levels at these places were significantly over the ICRP's maximum safety limit. The company then ordered by the court to stop all operation but the AELB continue to issue a license to the latter to continue their operation in 1987. With the company refusal to stop despite court order, the affected residents began to sue the company which evolve into a court battle that took 32 months and in July 1992, the residents won their case against the company with the court ordered them to close their factory within 14 days. Even with the second court order, the company continue to filed an appeal case to the Federal Court where the Ipoh High Court's decision was suspended under two reasons such as the ARE's experts were more trustworthy and asking the residents to ask the Malaysian atomic board by themselves to withdraw the company license as the board had the power to do so under the Atomic Energy Licensing Act. Without wasting further time in a long case that affecting their livelihood, several of the affected residents travel to Japan to meet up with the highest authority of Mitsubishi Chemical, one of the company major shareholders and explaining their dire situation which also being heard by Japanese environmentalists. With Mitsubishi's intervention and further international pressure, the company finally stopped their operations despite having won the court battle locally. Mitsubishi Chemical reached an out-of-court settlement with the affected residents by agreeing to donate $164,000 to the community's schools while denying any responsibility for the related illnesses from pollution caused by the ARE related works. == See also == * Lynas * Radioactive contamination == Further reading == * * == References == Category:Environmental issues in Malaysia Category:Health disasters in Malaysia Category:Radiation accidents and incidents Category:Radiation health effects Category:1982 in Malaysia Category:1982 crimes in Asia Category:Man-made disasters in Malaysia ","title":"1982 Bukit Merah radioactive pollution"},{"id":"61607998","text":"Chandpur is a city and district headquarter of Chandpur District in the division of Chittagong, Bangladesh.

This is an algebraic option useful, in a number of cases, for determining the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a directed graph. It is a generalization of the number of Hamiltonian cycles of a digraph as the sum of the products of its Hamiltonian cycles' arc weights (all of which equal unity) for weighted digraphs with arc weights taken from a given commutative ring. In the meantime, for an undirected weighted graph the sum of the products of the edge weights of its Hamiltonian cycles containing any fixed edge (i,j) can be expressed as the product of the weight of (i,j) and the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of the matrix received from its weighted adjacency matrix via removing the i-th row and the j-th column. In () it was shown that : \\\\operatorname{ham} (A) = \\\\sum_{J\\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} (-1)^{J}\\\\det(A_J)\\\\operatorname{per}(A_{\\\\bar J}) where A_J is the submatrix of A induced by the rows and columns of A indexed by J, and \\\\bar J is the complement of J in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, while the determinant of the empty submatrix is defined to be 1. In a field of characteristic 2 the latter equality turns into \\\\operatorname{ham} (A) = \\\\sum_{J\\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} \\\\det(A_J)\\\\det(A_{\\\\bar J}) what therefore provides an opportunity to polynomial-time calculate the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of any unitary matrix U (i.e. such that U^{T} U = I where I is the identity n×n-matrix), because in such a field each minor of a unitary matrix coincides with its algebraic complement: \\\\operatorname{ham} (U) = {\\\\det}^2(U + I_{/1}) where I_{/1} is the identity n×n-matrix with the entry of indexes 1,1 replaced by 0. Hence if it's possible to polynomial-time assign weights from a field of characteristic 2 to a digraph's arcs that make its weighted adjacency matrix unitary and having a non-zero Hamiltonian cycle polynomial then the digraph is Hamiltonian. Therefore the Hamiltonian cycle problem is computable on such graphs in polynomial time. In characteristic 2, the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of an n×n-matrix is zero if n > 2k where k is its rank or if it's involutory and n > 1. Besides, in an arbitrary ring R for any skew-symmetric n×n-matrix A there exists a power series in a formal variable \\\\varepsilon: U(\\\\varepsilon) =\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty U_n \\\\varepsilon^n such that it's a unitary n×n-matrix over R\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon\\\\right) and U_0 = I, U_1 = A, while for any U(\\\\varepsilon) satisfying these conditions \\\\operatorname{ham} (A) equals the coefficient at the n-th power of \\\\varepsilon in the power series \\\\operatorname{ham} (U(\\\\varepsilon)). It implies that computing, up to the n-th power of \\\\varepsilon, the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of a unitary n×n-matrix over the infinite extension of any ring of characteristic q (not necessarily prime) by the formal variable \\\\varepsilon is a #q-P-complete problem if q isn't 2 and computing the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of a k-semi-unitary matrix (i.e. an n×n-matrix V such that \\\\operatorname{rank}(V^T V - I \\\\,) = k) over such an extension of any ring of characteristic 2 is a #2-P-complete problem for any k > 0 (because any k-semi-unitary matrix can be received from a unitary matrix via removing k rows and k columns). For k = 1 the latter statement can be re-formulated as the #2-P-completeness of computing, for a given unitary n×n-matrix U over a field of characteristic 2, the n×n-matrix H(U) whose i,j-th entry is the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of the matrix received from U via removing its i-th row and j-th column. This matrix satisfies the following matrix equation: U(H(U))^T = H(U)U^T. Moreover, it would be worth noting that in characteristic 2 the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial possesses its invariant matrix compressions (partly analogical to the Gaussian modification that is invariant for the determinant), taking into account the fact that \\\\operatorname{ham} (X) = 0 for any t×t-matrix X having three equal rows or, if t > 2, a pair of indexes i,j such that its i-th and j-th rows are identical and its i-th and j-th columns are identical too. Hence if a matrix has two equal rows with indexes i and j then adding one of them to any third one doesn't change this polynomial in characteristic 2 what allows to Gaussian-style eliminate all the entries of its i-th column except the i,i-th and j,i-th ones (in case if they aren't zero) and remove its i-th column and j-th row – then the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of the initial matrix equals this polynomial of the new one multiplied by the initial j,i-th entry. Also in characteristic 2 and for matrices with more than two rows the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial isn't changed by adding the i-th column to the j-th one in a matrix where the i-th and j-th rows are identical what, particularly, yields the identity : \\\\det(D+D^{-1}) \\\\operatorname{ham} \\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}V & A \\\\\\\\\\\\B & U \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right ) = \\\\operatorname{ham} \\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}V & V+D & A\\\\\\\\\\\\ V+D^{-1} & V+D^{-1}+D & A\\\\\\\\\\\\ B & B & U\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right ) for an n×n-matrix U, m×m-matrices V and diagonal D, m×n-matrix A and n×m-matrix B. This identity's restriction to the case when U is unitary, VD + DV^{T}+AA^{T}=I+D^{2} and BD=UA^{T}, where I is the identity m×m-matrix, makes the (2m+n)×(2m+n)-matrix in the equality's right side unitary and its Hamiltonian cycle polynomial computable, hence, in polynomial time what therefore generalizes the above-given formula for the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of a unitary matrix. Apart from the above- mentioned compression transformations, in characteristic 2 the following relation is also valid for the Hamiltonian cycle polynomials of a matrix and its partial inverse (for A_{11} and A_{22} being square, A_{11} being invertible): : \\\\operatorname{ham}\\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}A_{11} & A_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21} & A_{22}\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) = {\\\\det}^2\\\\left ( A_{11} \\\\right ) \\\\operatorname{ham}\\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}A_{11}^{-1} & A_{11}^{-1}A_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21}A_{11}^{-1} & A_{22} + A_{21} A_{11}^{-1} A_{12} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right ) and, due to the fact that the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial doesn't depend on the matrix's diagonal entries, adding an arbitrary diagonal matrix doesn't change this polynomial too. These two types of transformation don't compress the matrix, but keep its size unchanged. However, in a number of cases their application allows to reduce the matrix's size by some of the above-mentioned compression operators. Hence there is a variety of matrix compression operators performed in polynomial time and preserving the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial in characteristic 2 whose sequential application, together with the transpose transformation (utilized each time the operators leave the matrix intact), has, for each matrix, a certain limit that can be defined as the compression-closure operator. When applied to classes of matrices, that operator thus maps one class to another. As it was proven in (), if the compression-closure operator maps the class of unitary matrices onto all the set of square matrices over an infinite field of characteristic 2 then the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial is computable in polynomial time over any field of this characteristic what would imply the equality RP = NP. == References == *. * * Category:Computational problems in graph theory Category:NP-complete problems Category:Hamiltonian paths and cycles ","title":"Hamiltonian cycle polynomial"},{"id":"61608260","text":"South Sudan–Spain relations are the bilateral and diplomatic relations between these two countries.

The game was announced at Gamescom 2019 as the sequel to Little Nightmares, and will feature a new player character, Mono, with the protagonist from the previous game, Six, as a computer-controlled character. The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 11 February 2021, with versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S released at a later date in the same year. == Plot == The game takes place after Six escapes from the Maw. She later meets Mono, a boy wearing a brown paper bag as a mask, and must work with him to navigate through the Pale City and reach the Black Tower, which is controlled by the mysterious Thin Man (who was previously seen at the end of Secrets of the Maw possibly creating this story). Locations found throughout the Pale City include the Wilderness, the School, the Hospital, and the Black Tower. There will also be new enemies and other characters to be discovered such as the Hunter (who Mono rescues Six from at the start of the game), the Teacher, the Students, Mannequins, a monster that resides in the Hospital, the Viewers, and the Thin Man. ===Premise=== A young boy named Mono experiences a dream where he sees the door with an eye at the end of a hallway. He wakes up in a dense forest near a TV. After covering his head with a paper bag with eyeholes, he proceeds to make his way through the Wilderness. While exploring the forest, Mono encounters many traps and corpses of people who accidentally fell into them. He eventually reaches a shack owned by the taxidermy-obsessed Hunter. He finds Six (without her raincoat), who had somehow made it shore following her escape from the Maw and was apparently captured by the Hunter, imprisoned in one of the rooms. Although he offers to help her, she immediately runs away, rejecting his help. In pursuit of her, Mono discovers people who have been turned into effigies. Near the attic, he catches up to Six, who agrees to work with Mono upon realizing that she cannot escape alone. Together they escape from the shack, but the Hunter, who was skinning an animal, hears them leave and pursuits them, taking a shotgun and flashlight with him. They are able to lose him by jumping under a small cliff up ahead, but he moves forward and stands in a spot, looking for them. Mono and Six gain courage by holding each other's hands and carefully evade the Hunter until they make a break for it, nearly killing them until they both duck in a small hole. == References == ==External links== * Category:Bandai Namco games Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2021 Category:Horror video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Puzzle-platform games Category:Survival video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Video game sequels Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games ","title":"Little Nightmares 2"},{"id":"61608284","text":"Georgios Doitsinis () was a significant Greek chieftain of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia.

R. Bruss and Roger Blondel, was a French science fiction and fantasy writer, and a civil servant under the Nazi collaborationist Vichy regime (1940–44). == Biography == === Vichy collaborationist (1940–1944) === Bonnefoy was the editor-in-chief of the Moniteur du Puy-de-Dôme, a newspaper bought by Pierre Laval in 1927. In liaison with Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Bonnefoy expelled Jewish teachers from universities and created a chair on the history of Judaism at the Sorbonne University, entrusted to Henri Labroue. After Pierre Laval dismissed the team of Je Suis Partout from Radio-Vichy in September 1940 due to their extremism, he entrusted the direction of information to Bonnefoy, who became responsible for developing the themes of the Révolution Nationale over the radio. Upon the return of Laval to power in April 1942, Bonnefoy replaced Paul Marion—then in charge of Information for the Vichy government—as the head of press control. === Novelist (1946–1980) === Due to his past as a Vichy collaborationist, he had to use a pseudonym in order to publish his first novel Et la planète sauta... in 1946. Ten years later, he released the novel Le Mouton Enragé under the pen name Roger Blondel, adapted to the cinema in 1974 as Love at the Top and featuring Jean- Louis Trintignant and Jane Birkin. His other well known novels include Bradfer et l'éternel (1964), Un endroit nommé la vie (1973) and Graffiti (1975). In 1978, he declared to the magazine Nouvelles littéraires: \\"I took the non- serious as center of gravity. The central subject of all my fables is the definition of the primordial sputtering. The one which is spontaneous, banal, overabundant, the one we hear in the street, at the coffee shops, in the subway, all these sonorous graffiti that show us daily that our world is empty...\\" He was the father of literary critic Claude Bonnefoy. == Works == === Science fiction === * Et la Panète Sauta...

Since 1977, he has hosted the weekly jazz and Big band music program Night Train on WLRN-FM in Miami, Florida, one of the longest-running radio programs still broadcast throughout South Florida. == Early life == Theodore Grossman was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City in 1942. He graduated from North Miami High School in North Miami, Florida, in 1960 and was a speech major at Dade Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). One of his earliest jobs for which he was paid for his speaking skills was in 1967 when he announced the dolphin shows at the Miami Seaquarium for $90 a week. Later, he worked as a parts manager for an appliance store. Eventually, he became a postal employee, driving over 100 miles a day carrying special delivery letters for the U.S. Postal Service. \\"The first live jazz I saw,\\" Grossman told the Miami Herald in 1983, > \\"was when my father and a friend of his took me to the Sir John Hotel in > Miami, about 1962.

I don't care what kind of music you > like, you see that, it knocks you out.\\" == Career == While still a mail carrier, Grossman approached public radio station WLRN in 1975 when the station expanded its jazz programming. He volunteered his talents. As Grossman recounted to the Miami Herald in 1983, \\"You don't have any big-band show, I told them. They let me on to sink or swim.\\" ==Night Train== Grossman's program, Night Train, premiered on WLRN in January 1977. He has served as its sole regular host since its debut. In the late 1970s, it was a three-hour show that aired on Friday nights. In the 1980s, it moved to Sunday nights and expanded to four hours. Today, it is simulcast live to the Florida Keys on WLRN's affiliate, WKWM. In addition to playing the recordings on his show, Grossman supplies anecdotes and authoritative commentary about the bands and performers, including album notes and assorted trivia. He often peppers his show with mentions of the birthdays, deaths, or other anniversaries of jazz notables, past and present. Occasionally, the show will feature local or nationally-known recording artists or other musicians as in-studio guests, with Grossman playing recordings and quizzing his guest about the identity of the recording's performer(s) or vocalist(s). In keeping with the show's locomotive-themed title, Grossman is known for donning a train conductor's striped railroad hat as he broadcasts each week. The Miami Herald once described Night Train as a \\"rambling, rumbling three-hour local service with stops at Big Band, Dixieland, The Blues and Crooner City.\\" == References == == External links == * Night Train webpage at WLRN-FM * Ted Grossman webpage at WLRN-FM * Brief excerpt of Ted Grossman on-air during a Night Train broadcast (by Paul Leary) Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Radio personalities from New York City Category:People from Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:People from Brooklyn Category:Radio personalities from Miami Category:Jazz radio presenters Category:American radio DJs Category:People from North Miami, Florida ","title":"Ted Grossman"},{"id":"61608588","text":"Sanditon is a British historical drama television series adapted by Andrew Davies from an unfinished manuscript by Jane Austen and starring Rose Williams and Theo James in the lead roles. Set during the Regency era, the plot follows a young and naive heroine as she navigates the new seaside resort of Sanditon. The series first aired on ITV in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2019 in eight parts, and on PBS in the United States on 12 January 2020, which supports the production, as part of its Masterpiece anthology. Due to the unfinished nature of the novel (Austen completed only eleven chapters), the original work is used for the majority of the first episode, and then Davies used the developed characters to complete the story. The novel is set in a seaside town during a time of social change. At the time of her death in 1817, Austen had completed 24,000 words of the novel. ==Overview== A chance accident brings Charlotte Heywood to Sanditon, a seaside resort on the cusp of dramatic change. Spirited and unconventional, Charlotte is initially keen to experience everything the town has to offer but is then shocked by its scheming and ambitious inhabitants and intrigued by the secrets they share. When Charlotte is tactlessly forthright about the family of enthusiastic entrepreneur Tom Parker, she immediately clashes with his handsome but wild younger brother Sidney.

The majority of interior filming took place on interior and exterior sets built at The Bottle Yard Studios in Bristol. ==Critical reception== Critical reception has been mixed. Some UK media outlets reported that viewers were shocked at the depictions of sex and nudity in the opening episode, considering it to be untrue to the works of Jane Austen. Many viewers critiqued the ending as unusual and very “un-Austen-like”. Viewers claim Austen would have liked a happy ending for all characters, as she has happy endings in all of her stories; however, this could have been a set up for a second season. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2019 British television series endings Category:2010s British television miniseries Category:ITV television dramas Category:Period television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Somerset Category:Television shows based on works by Jane Austen ","title":"Sanditon (TV series)"},{"id":"61608599","text":"Asclepias connivens is a species of milkweed, commonly called Baldwin's milkweed or the largeflower milkweed.

The purpose of the convoy was to bring supplies to Dubrovnik's inhabitants who, in connection with the siege, were living without electricity and access to fresh drinking water, food and medicine. The convoy's name 'Libertas' alludes to the Latin word for freedom which is the historical motto of Dubrovnik. == Background == Shelling of the Old Town On October 1, 1991, Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), then made up of Serbian and Montenegrin units, attacked Dubrovnik from land, sea and air, and by late October had captured virtually all of the land between the Pelješac and Prevlaka peninsulas on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, with the exception of Dubrovnik itself. The siege was accompanied by a Yugoslav Navy (JRM) blockade. The JNA's bombardment of Dubrovnik culminated on 6 December 1991 which provoked international condemnation. As a result of the blockade, approximately 50,000 citizens in Dubrovnik lived without electricity and access to enough fresh drinking water, food and medicine. == The beginning == In October 1991 in Zagreb, the Dubrovnik Salvation Fund Sveti Vlaho, the Croatian Writers' Association and Matica hrvatska launched an initiative to break through the naval blockade and deliver the necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Dubrovnik. The idea behind the action was to bring together as many vessels as possible, break through the blockade and sail into the port of Gruž. Rijeka become an organizational and logistical center for collecting assistance. == The action == People queue at a water pipe during the siege On October 28, 1991, the convoy sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 civilian vessels (tourist boats, sailboats, tugboats, etc.), the largest being Jadrolinija's ferry Slavija, as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoy carried European Community Monitor Mission observers, protesters, and a number of politicians, journalists, cultural figures including Veljko Bulajic and politicians, including the President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and the Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Gregurić. On October 30, at around one o'clock in the morning, the convoy reached Korčula. A day earlier, Dubrovnik amateur radio operators intercepted JRM's messages in which the 9th VPS Boka Command requested for a convoy to be stopped and searched. The convoy's journey towards Dubrovnik proceeded unimpeded up until it reached the Elaphiti Islands where it was stopped by the Yugoslav frigate JRM Split between the islands of Brač and Šolta. JRM representatives demanded all vessels to return and Slavia to dock in the Montenegrin port of Zelenika, After lengthy negotiations and the thorough search of the vessels, the convoy was allowed to continue its journey towards Dubrovnik. https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/predsjednica-vlade-s- izaslanstvom-organizacijskog-odbora-i-sudionika-konvoja-libertas-1991/14083 Memorial plaque of the Libertas Convoy in Zagreb's Ivan Gundulić Street, a street named after Croatian poet from Dubrovnik In the early morning hours of October 31, 1991, speedboats of the Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik sailed from the port of Gruž to meet the Convoy and escorted all 29 vessels into the harbor where about 1,000 Dubrovnik residents welcomed them. During his speech, president Stjepan Mesić stated that the people of Dubrovnik have not been forgotten.

Journalists who documented the humanitarian disaster that arose in Dubrovnik in connection with the city's siege caused a public relations disaster for Serbia and Montenegro, contributing to their further diplomatic and economic isolation, as well as the international recognition of Croatia's independence.
