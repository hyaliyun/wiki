The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the Department of Justice responsible for the care, custody, and control of incarcerated individuals. ==History== The federal prison system had existed for more than 30 years before the Bureau was established. Although its wardens functioned almost autonomously, the Superintendent of Prisons, a Department of Justice official in Washington, was nominally in charge of federal prisons, starting with the passage of the \\"Three Prisons Act' in 1891, which authorized the first three federal penitentiaries: USP Leavenworth, USP Atlanta, and USP McNeil Island with limited supervision by the Department of Justice. Until 1907, prison matters were handled by the Justice Department General Agent, with responsibility for Justice Department accounts, oversight of internal operations, and certain criminal investigations, as well as prison operations. In 1907, the General Agent was abolished, and its functions were distributed between three new offices: the Division of Accounts (which evolved into the Justice Management Division); the Office of the Chief Examiner (which evolved in 1908 into the Bureau of Investigation, and in the early 1920s into the Federal Bureau of Investigation); and the Office of the Superintendent of Prisons and Prisoners, later called the Superintendent of Prisons (which evolved in 1930 into the Bureau of Prisons). The exterior of Federal Correctional Institution, Milan The Bureau of Prisons was established within the Department of Justice in 1930, by the United States Congress, and was charged with the \\"management and regulation of all Federal penal and correctional institutions.\\" This responsibility covered the administration of the 11 federal prisons in operation at the time. By the end of 1930, the system had expanded to 14 institutions with 13,000 inmates, and a decade later in 1940, the system had 24 institutions with 24,360 incarcerated. The state of Alaska assumed jurisdiction over its corrections on January 3, 1959, using the Alaska Department of Corrections. Prior to statehood, the BOP had correctional jurisdiction over Alaska.\\"History of Lemon Creek Correctional Center\\" (Archive). Alaska Department of Corrections. Retrieved on December 13, 2015. As a result of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and subsequent legislation which pushed for longer sentences, less judicial discretion, and more harsh sentences for drug-related offenses, the federal inmate population doubled in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. The population increase has decelerated since the early 2000s but the federal inmate population continues to grow. The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 transferred responsibility for adult felons convicted of violating District of Columbia laws to the Bureau. ==Administration and employees== The current director of the Bureau of Prisons is Michael Carvajal. As of 2020, 62.5% of Bureau employees are white, 21.3% are black, 12.6% are Hispanic, 2.3% are Asian and 1.3% are Native American. 72% are male. There is roughly one corrections officer for every 10 prisoners. All Bureau employees undergo 200 hours of formal training in their first year of employment and an additional 120 hours of training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia. ==Types of federal prisons== The United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, a unit for male prisoners requiring medical care. The Bureau has five security levels: * Federal Prison Camps (FPCs), the BOP minimum-security facilities, feature a lack of or a limited amount of perimeter fencing, and a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio. * Low-security Federal Correctional Institutions (FCIs) have double-fenced perimeters, and inmates live in mostly cubicle or dormitory housing. * Medium-security FCIs and some United States Penitentiaries (USPs) are classified to hold medium- security inmates. The medium facilities have strengthened perimeters, which often consist of double fences with electronic detection systems. Medium- security facilities mostly have cell housing. * Most U.S. Penitentiaries are classified as high-security facilities. The perimeters, highly secured, often have reinforced fences or walls. * Federal Correctional Complexes (FCCs) are co-locations of BOP facilities with different security levels and/or genders.\\"Prison Types & General Information .\\" Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved May 21, 2010. * Administrative Security Facilities are prisons with special missions and capabilities. An example would be Federal Medical Centers which house sick and injured inmates getting medical care which is beyond the capabilities of a normal institution. Some units have small, adjacent, minimum-security \\"satellite camps\\". Twenty-eight institutions hold female inmates. about 15% of Bureau inmates are in facilities operated by third parties, mostly private companies, whilst others are in local and state facilities. Some are in privately operated Residential Reentry Centers (RRC) (or Community Corrections Centers).

On July 19, 1993, the federal government designated the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute in Indiana as the site where male federal inmates sentenced to death would be held and where federal inmates of both genders would be executed. The Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Texas holds the female inmates who have been sentenced to death. Some male death row inmates are instead held at ADX Florence, and one in USMCFP Springfield. As of July 2020, 60 inmates are slated for death row. ===Overpopulation and responses=== Parole was abolished for federal inmates in 1987 and inmates must serve at least 85% of their original sentence before being considered for good-behavior release. In addition, the current, extremely strict, sentencing guidelines were adopted in response to rising crime rates in the 1980s and early 1990s, especially for drug-related offenses. US violent crime has dropped since then, but some analysts and activists believe that other factors played a much more significant part in falling crime rates. In addition, they hold that strict federal sentencing guidelines have led to overcrowding and needlessly incarcerated thousands of non-violent drug offenders who would be better served by drug treatment programs. The yearly increases in the federal inmate population have raised concerns from criminal justice experts and even among DOJ officials themselves. Michael Horowitz, the DOJ Inspector General, wrote a memorandum concerning this issue: ===Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)=== As of July 30, 2020, there are 2,910 federal inmates and 500 BOP staff who have confirmed positive test results for Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 nationwide. 7312 inmates and 683 staff have recovered.

The typical problem is to find the shape which is optimal in that it minimizes a certain cost functional while satisfying given constraints. In many cases, the functional being solved depends on the solution of a given partial differential equation defined on the variable domain. Topology optimization is, in addition, concerned with the number of connected components/boundaries belonging to the domain. Such methods are needed since typically shape optimization methods work in a subset of allowable shapes which have fixed topological properties, such as having a fixed number of holes in them. Topological optimization techniques can then help work around the limitations of pure shape optimization. ==Definition== Mathematically, shape optimization can be posed as the problem of finding a bounded set \\\\Omega, minimizing a functional :\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\Omega), possibly subject to a constraint of the form :\\\\mathcal{G}(\\\\Omega)=0. Usually we are interested in sets \\\\Omega which are Lipschitz or C1 boundary and consist of finitely many components, which is a way of saying that we would like to find a rather pleasing shape as a solution, not some jumble of rough bits and pieces. Sometimes additional constraints need to be imposed to that end to ensure well-posedness of the problem and uniqueness of the solution. Shape optimization is an infinite- dimensional optimization problem. Furthermore, the space of allowable shapes over which the optimization is performed does not admit a vector space structure, making application of traditional optimization methods more difficult. ==Examples== ==Techniques== Shape optimization problems are usually solved numerically, by using iterative methods. That is, one starts with an initial guess for a shape, and then gradually evolves it, until it morphs into the optimal shape. === Keeping track of the shape === Example: Shape optimization as applied to building geometry. Example provided courtesy of Formsolver.com Example: Optimization shape families resulting from differing goal parameters. Example provided courtesy of Formsolver.com To solve a shape optimization problem, one needs to find a way to represent a shape in the computer memory, and follow its evolution. Several approaches are usually used. One approach is to follow the boundary of the shape. For that, one can sample the shape boundary in a relatively dense and uniform manner, that is, to consider enough points to get a sufficiently accurate outline of the shape. Then, one can evolve the shape by gradually moving the boundary points. This is called the Lagrangian approach. Another approach is to consider a function defined on a rectangular box around the shape, which is positive inside of the shape, zero on the boundary of the shape, and negative outside of the shape. One can then evolve this function instead of the shape itself. One can consider a rectangular grid on the box and sample the function at the grid points. As the shape evolves, the grid points do not change; only the function values at the grid points change. This approach, of using a fixed grid, is called the Eulerian approach. The idea of using a function to represent the shape is at the basis of the level-set method. A third approach is to think of the shape evolution as of a flow problem. That is, one can imagine that the shape is made of a plastic material gradually deforming such that any point inside or on the boundary of the shape can be always traced back to a point of the original shape in a one-to-one fashion. Mathematically, if \\\\Omega_0 is the initial shape, and \\\\Omega_t is the shape at time t, one considers the diffeomorphisms :f_t:\\\\Omega_0\\\\to \\\\Omega_t, \\\\mbox{ for } 0\\\\le t\\\\le t_0. The idea is again that shapes are difficult entities to be dealt with directly, so manipulate them by means of a function. === Iterative methods using shape gradients === Consider a smooth velocity field V and the family of transformations T_s of the initial domain \\\\Omega_0 under the velocity field V: :x(0) = x_0 \\\\in \\\\Omega_0, \\\\quad x'(s) = V(x(s)), \\\\quad T_s(x_0) = x(s), \\\\quad s \\\\geq 0 , and denote :\\\\Omega_0 \\\\mapsto T_s(\\\\Omega_0) = \\\\Omega_s. Then the G√¢teaux or shape derivative of \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\Omega) at \\\\Omega_0 with respect to the shape is the limit of :d\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\Omega_0;V) = \\\\lim_{s \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\Omega_s) - \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\Omega_0)}{s} if this limit exists. If in addition the derivative is linear with respect to V, there is a unique element of abla \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\in L^2(\\\\partial \\\\Omega_0) and :d\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\Omega_0;V) = \\\\langle abla \\\\mathcal{F}, V \\\\rangle_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega_0} where abla \\\\mathcal{F} is called the shape gradient. This gives a natural idea of gradient descent, where the boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega is evolved in the direction of negative shape gradient in order to reduce the value of the cost functional. Higher order derivatives can be similarly defined, leading to Newtonlike methods. Typically, gradient descent is preferred, even if requires a large number of iterations, because, it can be hard to compute the second-order derivative (that is, the Hessian) of the objective functional \\\\mathcal{F}. If the shape optimization problem has constraints, that is, the functional \\\\mathcal{G} is present, one has to find ways to convert the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Sometimes ideas based on Lagrange multipliers can work. === Geometry parametrization === Shape optimization can be faced using standard optimization methods if a parametrization of the geometry is defined. Such parametrization is very important in CAE field where goal functions are usually complex functions evaluated using numerical models (CFD, FEA,...). A convenient approach, suitable for a wide class of problems, consists in the parametrization of the CAD model coupled with a full automation of all the process required for function evaluation (meshing, solving and result processing). Mesh morphing is a valid choice for complex problems that resolves typical issues associated with re-meshing such as discontinuities in the computed objective and constraint functions .Wilke, D.N.; Kok, S.; Groenwold, A.A. (2010) The application of gradient-only optimization methods for problems discretized using non-constant methods. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, Vol. 40, 433-451. In this case the parametrization is defined after the meshing stage acting directly on the numerical model used for calculation that is changed using mesh updating methods. There are several algorithms available for mesh morphing (deforming volumes, pseudosolids, radial basis functions). The selection of the parametrization approach depends mainly on the size of the problem: the CAD approach is preferred for small-to-medium sized models whilst the mesh morphing approach is the best (and sometimes the only feasible one) for large and very large models. The multi-objective Pareto optimization (NSGA II) could be utilized as a powerful approach for shape optimization. In this regard, the Pareto optimization approach displays useful advantages in design method such as the effect of area constraint that other multi-objective optimization cannot declare it. The approach of using a penalty function is an effective technique which could be used in the first stage of optimization. In this method the constrained shape design problem is adapted to an unconstrained problem with utilizing the constraints in the objective function as a penalty factor. Most of the time penalty factor is dependent to the amount of constraint variation rather than constraint number. The GA real- coded technique is applied in the present optimization problem. Therefore, the calculations are based on real value of variables. ==See also== *SU2 code *Topological derivative == References == == Sources == * Allaire, G.

The brothers figure Bugs as being a member of the clan they are feuding with and make several attempts to shoot him. Bugs foils them each time. Curt and Punkinhead are determined to get revenge on Bugs for their humiliation.

The dance tune starts as a straightforward version of \\"Skip to My Lou\\" played and called by the jukebox band, \\"The Sour Belly Trio\\". Shortly into it, Bugs deliberately unplugs the jukebox, removes the dress and takes over fiddling and square dance calling, still to the melody and rhythm of the song, but manipulating the Martins through a series of slapstick comedy gags. Bugs proceeds to assign the Martins increasingly bizarre and violent directives, which the brothers unquestioningly follow with hilarious results. Finally, with the Martins having promenaded off a cliff, Bugs finishes the dance by having the Martins groggily bow to each other (before collapsing due to exhaustion from the whole \\"dance\\") and saying, \\"And THAT is all!\\" and playing six final notes on the fiddle, before the cartoon ends. == Censorship == * This cartoon saw major editing when aired on ABC due to violent content.

Electronics Boutique also operated stores under the name Games 'n Gadgets. The Games 'n Gadgets stores were more centered on entertainment and gaming, rather than business and productivity. In the mid-1990s, the company's focus switched to TV-based video games and consoles, though many stores still maintain PC game sections. In May 2000, in order to unify their company, Electronics Boutique changed the vast majority of its current EB and EB Gameworld stores to the name EB Games. They also announced that they would be either closing or selling all of their EB Kids and Brandywine Sports Collectible Stores.EB changes name of game: rebranding a la GameStop. For years EB Games' primary distribution center was in Louisville, Kentucky, with two smaller distribution centers and a World Headquarters all located in West Chester, Pennsylvania. With video games becoming increasingly popular, EB Games decided it was time for a new distribution center. In October 2004, EB Games opened its doors to its new distribution center in Sadsbury Township, Pennsylvania. The world headquarter office in West Chester remained open, however anyone working at the old distribution centers were transferred to the new location.Video game retailer Electronics Boutique expects to break ground on a new 315,000-square-foot distribution center this spring.

An EB Games store in Edmonton, Alberta in February 2017. EB began its international expansion with the opening of three stores in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1993. The Canadian division is the largest of the international divisions with 300+ stores as of May 2008. In 1995, the company expanded to the UK with the purchase of 25% of the financially troubled British game retailer Rhino Group. The name of the chain was changed from Future Zone to \\"Electronics Boutique\\" to match the new owner. John Steinbrecher, Electronic Boutique's VP of Stores in the US and Canada, was seconded to the UK to manage the chain. Store remodels, product mix changes and used video games combined to restore the chain's finances. Electronics Boutique commenced operations in Australia in 1997 and rapidly became the number one video game specialty retailer in the country and the only one with a nationwide footprint. Although the merger created a company separate from the U.S. parent, EB retained a 24% ownership stake in the merged chain for a period of time and, under the merger agreement, collected substantial management fees from it until 2004, when the companies agreed to sever the remainder of their ties with a one time settlement. The GAME brand replaced the EB name at all former EB stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The new company was the biggest video game retailer in the United Kingdom. However, GameStop is once again operating in Ireland under the GameStop brand. On May 23, 2005, EB Games announced a definitive agreement to acquire Jump, a retailer based in Valencia, Spain that sells PCs and other consumer electronics. EB Games plans to begin introducing video game hardware and software into Jump's 141 stores over the next several months. The acquisition provides EB Games entry into the Spanish marketplace and continues EB Games's aggressive international expansion. On June 22, 2008, reports surfaced that EB Games in New Zealand would acquire The Gamesman - New Zealand's largest independently owned and operated specialised gaming store.\\"The Gamesman\\" Set to be Acquired by EB Games All Gamesman stores are to be rebranded as EB Games stores, leaving no multi-centre specialist gaming stores in New Zealand. ==Internet meme== On December 16, 2014, the YouTube channel for EB Games Canada uploaded a 30-second commercial entitled \\"Rivals\\", in promotion of the video game Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. The commercial's concept and dialogue drew criticism from online users and became an Internet meme. ==See also== * GameStop * EB Games Australia * EB Games Expo * Game (retailer) ==References* Category:Video game retailers of the United States Category:Companies based in Chester County, Pennsylvania Category:West Goshen Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania Category:Retail companies established in 1977 Category:American companies established in 1977 Category:GameStop Category:1977 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:2005 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"EB Games"},{"id":"1271435","text":"ƒ∞nce Minareli Medrese (literally Slender Minaret Medrese) is a 13th-century madrasa (Islamic school) located in Konya, Turkey, now housing the Museum of Stone and Wood Art (Ta≈ü ve Ah≈üap Eserler M√ºzesi). ==History== Built between 1258-1279 by the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate vizier S√¢hib Ata Fahreddin Ali who later founded the Anatolian beylik of S√¢hib Ata.Justin McCarthy, The Ottoman Turks, (Longman Publishing, 1997), 1.

Hence Estreti, village on the road which developed into Estr√©es. Also known in ancient times as Strata or Estreti, history mentions an abbey in the 12th century.

He was also president of Radcliffe College and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, among other offices.Hollander, David N., \\"The LeBaron Russell Briggs Sails Its Last\\", The Harvard Crimson, August 18, 1970. ==Early life== Briggs was born in Salem, Massachusetts on December 11, 1855. He was the son of Unitarian minister George Ware Briggs and Lucia Jane (n√©e Russell) Briggs. Among his siblings was brother George Russell Briggs. He received A.B. (in 1875) and A.M. degrees (in 1882) from Harvard University. ==Career== After graduating from Harvard, he began teaching there; he began as a Greek tutor before moving to English, eventually becoming the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric from 1904 until 1925.Briggs, Le Baron Russell, 1855-1934\\\\. Records of Radcliffe College President Le Baron Russell Briggs, 1903-1925: A Finding Aid. Harvard University Library. Eventually, Briggs was appointed dean of Harvard College in 1891 (to 1902) and dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1902 until his retirement in 1925. His appointment as Dean of Men was the first \\"student personnel\\" appointment, which later became the catalyst for the Student Affairs field in higher education. Briggs was responsible for advising students academically, and on personal issues. \\"His fairness in dealing with the Faculty and students alike, his patience in dealing with erring undergraduates, and his always kindly humor endeared him to everyone,\\" wrote George Henry Chase. ===Radcliffe College=== In 1903, Briggs succeeded co- founder Elizabeth Cary Agassiz as the second president of Radcliffe College, which had been founded as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in 1882 before becoming Radcliffe College in 1894. During his presidentcy (which was then a part-time position), the College purchased the Greenleaf estate and built five new dormitories. Also during his tenure, the student body grew from less than 500 in 1903 to more than 700 in 1923. The geographical diversity of students also increased, with the number of students matriculating from outside of Massachusetts rising from 19 percent in 1903 to 33 percent in 1923. He served as president for twenty years until 1923, when he was succeeded by Ada Louise Comstock who also served as president for twenty years from 1923 to 1943. Before Briggs left office, the administration of Radcliffe requested that Radcliffe become a college for women within Harvard, but were again refused. In his last presidential report, Briggs wrote: ‚ÄúI believe that ultimately Radcliffe will become a women‚Äôs college in Harvard, but that neither institution is as yet prepared for such a union.‚Äù After his retirement from Radcliffe, he wrote the novel, Men, Women And Colleges, which was published in 1925 by the Houghton Mifflin Company. ==Personal life== In 1883, Briggs was married to Mary Frances De Quedville (b. 1862) of Cambridge. Together, they were the parents of three children, including: * John DeQuedville Briggs (1885‚Äì1965), who married Marjorie Scott Winslow (1900‚Äì1994), daughter of William Herman Winslow, in 1925. * Lucia Russell Briggs (1887‚Äì1960), who served as president of Milwaukee-Downer College for thirty years. * LeBaron Russell Briggs Jr. (1895‚Äì1972), who married Elizabeth Mason. Riggs died on April 24, 1934 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the home of his daughter Lucia. He was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he had a summer home. ===Legacy=== Briggs was also a trustee of Middlesex School, where the LeBaron Briggs House dormitory is named for him, as well as Briggs Hall at Harvard's Cabot House. He received honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Western Reserve University and Lafayette University. His nautical namesake, the liberty ship LeBaron Russell Briggs, was scuttled with its cargo of nerve gas on August 18, 1970, as the last installment of a project in which the United States disposed of much of its stockpile by dumping it at sea.\\"Cut Holes and Sink 'Em\\", Time, Aug. 24, 1970; \\"A Generation of Indiscriminate Dumping\\". ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Brief biography on Bartleby.com *Records of the President of Radcliffe College, 1903-1925.

Fr Edward J. Cahill, S.J. (18 February 1868‚Äì16 July 1941) was an Irish Jesuit priest and academic, born in Ballyvocogue, Cappagh, County Limerick. He was educated in Theology at Maynooth, and ordained a priest in 1897. He served on the staff of Mungret College and in the years before the Easter Rising he was known for facilitating Irish Volunteers in their training in Mungret. In 1924, he joined the staff of the Jesuit Milltown Park Institute in Dublin as Professor of Church History, Lecturer in Sociology, and later, Spiritual Father. In October 1926, on the occasion of the first celebration of the Feast of Christ the King, he founded \\"An R√≠oghacht\\", the League of the Kingship of Christ. The object of this society was to ensure the use of Catholic Social Teaching in the Irish Free State. \\"An R√≠oghacht\\", under Fr. Cahill's guidance, organised public meetings three or four times a year, published pamphlets on current topics and even attempted to produce a weekly paper to further its ideals. This organisation would go on to form the basis of Fr. Denis Fahey's Maria Duce. Cahill's anti-mason message, delivered in the 1920s and 1930s, also delved into the realm of Antisemitism. In his works he accuses the Masons of being enemies of the Catholic Church, and suggests that these same Masons are led by Jews: He was a regular contributor the Irish Ecclesiastical Record and the Irish Monthly. His works often stressed the link between Catholicism and nationalism. He died on 16 July 1941, aged 73, after a long illness. ==Bibliography== ;Books *The Abbot of Mungret, a play in 4 acts.

He attended Aoyama Gakuin University to study English literature. In addition to creating songs for his own music career, he has written, produced and performed songs for many other artists, the most notable being SMAP's Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana. He is ranked at No.84, in a list of Japan's top 100 musicians, provided by HMV.He was also invited to write the song \\"The Gift\\" for English band blue in their album \\"Guilty\\". Makihara made his debut to the J-Pop scene in the early '90s after performing on a televised song competition program. He made a name for himself with the release of songs such as \\"Mou Koi Nante Shinai\\" () and \\"Donna Toki mo.\\" (), both of which, among several others, are covered to this day by current popular artists (including English-language covers by various American artists). Some of his music has been translated into other languages, and \\"Donna Toki mo\\", specifically has been remixed by Bemani artists \\"Dream Line Out\\" for use on Konami's Beatmania game series. Much of his music's lyrical content has revolved around the subject of romantic love, though themes of profound joy, reminiscence, gratitude and deeper spiritual aspects of the human condition have become predominant in recent years. In 1999, he was given a suspended 18-months prison sentence for possession of amphetamines.

The company's origins lie in the founding of the Rhino Group by Terry Norris and Bev Ripley in 1992. A number of mergers and acquisitions followed during the 1990s, and in 1999, the company was purchased by Electronics Boutique Limited, which rebranded itself as The Game Group. The company continued to expand during the 2000s, purchasing several retailers including Gameswizards in Australia. In March 2012, several suppliers, including Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Capcom refused to supply their latest products due to concerns over Game's creditworthiness. Game subsequently entered administration on 26 March 2012, and was purchased by OpCapita the following week. Baker Acquisitions was subsequently renamed Game Retail Ltd. The company operated in the United Kingdom under the GAME and Gamestation brands from the acquisition of the latter in May 2007 until the end of 2012, when it was announced that the business would focus solely on the Game brand. GAME Digital plc reported a ¬£10.4 million loss for the 12-month period from July 2016 to July 2017 in its full year results.https://www.gamedigitalplc.com/~/media/Files/G/Game- Corp-V2/documents/results-reports-presentations/2017/full-year- results-2016-17.pdf In the corresponding 2015‚Äì2016 period, the company had a net profit of ¬£7.1 million. In June 2019, Game Digital agreed to a takeover of the company by Frasers Group for ¬£52 million. ==History== ===Formation=== The company that went on to become Game was founded by Bev Ripley and Terry Norris as Rhino Group in 1992,City File: Bev Ripley The Independent, 18 October 1992 with stores branded as Future Zone. A year earlier in 1990, a separate company, called Game, was founded by Peter Wickins and Neil Taylor. Rhino Group acquired Virgin Games Stores from W H Smith in November 1993, increasing the total number of stores to 77. In October 1995, the gaming retailer Electronics Boutique acquired 25% of the Rhino Group, the name of which was changed to Electronics Boutique Limited under license from the business in America, and John Steinbrecher was sent from the United States to manage the chain.Good at Games The Independent, 13 June 2009 In November 1999, Electronics Boutique Limited purchased a chain of retail outlets known as Game, from which the current name of the company was derived, for ¬£99 million. at the time of the takeover Game had 86 stores.

Game shop in Ume√•, Sweden Game, Kings Mall, Hammersmith, London (2016) In 2002, Electronics Boutique stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland were rebranded as Game, and the company name was changed to The Game Group. Despite the name change, a 1% sales royalty to Electronics Boutique in the United States continued to be paid until January 2006. Attempts to have this overturned in court in February 2003 were unsuccessful. In July 2004, the Game group acquired Gameplay (GB) Limited, an online and mail order retailer of video games, computer software and associated products. Gameplay (GB) Ltd started trading as Game.co.uk, the group's main online arm in the United Kingdom. In September 2006, Game acquired Australian speciality video games retailer Gameswizards for A$3.8 million and rebranded all Gameswizards outlets as Game stores.

This was due to the major games distributor limiting Game's credit terms. This affected the pre-orders of Mass Effect 3, due out the following week. On 5 March 2012 it was announced that Game and Gamestation stores would not be stocking titles by Capcom. The first title affected by the move was Street Fighter X Tekken. Customers who pre-ordered the special edition from either store were refunded. In early March 2012, Game and Gamestation began heavily discounting stock in an attempt to bring in cash ahead of administration. On 14 March 2012, OpCapita made an unsuccessful bid for the company. The business had been in talks with Game's lenders with the aim of buying its debt and settling its bills with suppliers in full. The offer was rejected by Game's lenders. Microsoft and Activision ceased the supply of their products to Game on 15 March. On 19 March, the company's shares were suspended from the London Stock Exchange at its own request. ===Administration=== Game, Mill Street, Macclesfield, Cheshire (Closed) Game on the Headrow in Leeds (2013) The company entered administration on 26 March 2012, with PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed and Ian Shepherd stepping down as CEO.

On 31 March 2012, Game Group was purchased out of administration by OpCapita. David Hamid was announced as the new executive chairman of Game.

Game's Scandinavian operations were purchased by Nordic Games at the end of May 2012. Nordic Games purchased 55 stores (44 in Sweden and 11 in Norway) and Game's Scandinavian website, and also have a licensing deal that allows continued use of the Game brand. In May 2015 the Swedish subsidiary went into administration.

The series of events, referred to as the ‚ÄòiSeries‚Äô are sequentially numbered and run three times a year, typically with one around Easter, with the others usually hosted in August and November. The original events were hosted at Newbury Racecourse in the United Kingdom from i5 to i33 when the venue was relocated to Stoneleigh Park for i34. From i38 to i42 the event returned to Newbury. The home of i43 to i50 events was The Telford International Centre and from i51 to i55 it took place at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. i56 - present day is being held at the NEC in Birmingham due to its growth and popularity. These events have evolved with professional competitive tournaments and large exhibition halls. Popular segments of the festival include main stage shows by special guests, often YouTube personalities, as well as evening entertainment such as the \\"World Famous Insomnia Pub Quiz\\". Sometimes referred to as \\"The Glastonbury of Gaming\\", Insomnia continues to be the biggest festival of its kind in the UK. The first Insomnia: Insomnia99 was a 300-player event. At that point, it was, and remains, the largest LAN party held in the United Kingdom. It was announced during i55 that the festival would relocate to the NEC in Birmingham in time for i56 in December 2015. ==See also== * GameStop * Gamestation * CeX * Christmas Shopper Simulator ==References== ==External links== * Category:Video game retailers in the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in Basingstoke Category:Retail companies established in 1992 Category:Video game trade shows Category:Companies that have entered administration in the United Kingdom Category:1992 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2014 initial public offerings ","title":"Game (retailer)"},{"id":"1271476","text":"Southern Fried Rabbit is a 1953 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on May 2, 1953, and stars Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. ==Plot== A severe drought has ruined the carrot crop in Bugs Bunny's northern home. Upon learning of a boom crop in Alabama, Bugs decides to happily make the trip to the fertile soils. After a lot of walking, he finds himself near the Mason‚ÄìDixon line that separates the drought-ravaged north from the fertile south; but as soon as he crosses the line, he is shot at by \\"Colonel\\" Sam, who chases Bugs back over the line. Bugs asks Sam what the deal is, only to hear Sam somehow believes that he is a soldier of the Confederate States of America and has received orders from General Lee to guard the borders between the Confederate States and the United States. When Bugs points out that \\"the war between the states ended almost 90 years ago\\" (the cartoon itself was animated in 1953), Sam says \\"I ain't no clock watcher!\\", and that he will stay there unless he hears the orders to do otherwise from Lee, that, obviously, will never come. He shoots at Bugs and forces him to run away, prompting the rabbit to make several attempts to shake his antagonist. First, Bugs disguises himself as a banjo-playing slave (see \\"Availability\\" below), singing \\"My Old Kentucky Home.\\" When Sam asks for something \\"more peppy\\", Bugs promptly sings \\"Yankee Doodle\\", leading Sam to call Bugs a traitor. Bugs then begs Sam not to beat him, and forces a whip into Sam's hands. Then, after fleeing from Sam, Bugs immediately comes back in disguised as Abraham Lincoln, scolds Sam for \\"whipping slaves\\", and hands him a card to \\"look [him] up at [his] Gettysburg Address\\". Bugs' cover is blown, however, when Sam sees his cotton tail sticking out of Abe's trenchcoat. Infuriated, Sam chases Bugs into a tree. Bugs blows out Sam's match when he tries to light a bomb, and when Sam tries it again away from the tree, he blows it out with an extended pipe. Sam goes even further away in the third attempt, but with more ground to cover, the fuse runs out as Sam runs back, and the bomb detonates in his hands. Bugs then disguises himself as Stonewall Jackson (here as \\"General Brickwall Jackson\\"), fooling Sam into marching into a well. Afterwards, Bugs flees from Sam into a mansion, where he disguises himself as Scarlett O'Hara (from Gone with the Wind), and when Sam attempts to search the mansion, he takes a cannon blast while looking inside a closet and is dissuaded from searching any further. Bugs at last succeeds in getting Sam when, disguised as an injured Confederate soldier, he informs him that the Yankees are in Chattanooga. Sam heads to Chattanooga, and the finale has him threatening the New York Yankees, preventing them from competing in an exhibition baseball game against the Chattanooga Lookouts. ==Availability== *Southern Fried Rabbit is available on a VHS tape and The Looney Tunes Golden Collection volume 4 ==See also== * List of Bugs Bunny cartoons * List of Yosemite Sam cartoons * List of films featuring slavery ==References== ==External links== *Southern Fried Rabbit *New York Times review * Category:1953 films Category:1953 animated films Category:1953 short films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1950s animated short films Category:American Civil War films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.

In September, when she was nearly ready for sea, the Confederate Army sought unsuccessfully to retain her at that place for use as a troop and supply transport. On October 28, 1864, she put to sea under Lieutenant John Wilkinson (CSN) for a cruise north to the entrance of Long Island Sound, thence to St. George, Bermuda, for repairs and coal. She took several prizes before returning to Wilmington on November 19. During the bombardment of Fort Fisher, December 24‚Äì25, 1864, a portion of Chickamaugas crew served the guns at the fort. Although not immediately engaged in defense of Fort Fisher, the ship rendered further aid in transporting ammunition. She lent support to the fort when it was bombarded again on January 15, 1865. After the evacuation of Wilmington, Chickamauga went up the Cape Fear River where she was burned to prevent capture on February 25, 1865.Gregory, Mackenzie J. \\"Ahoy - Mac's Web Log.\\" Ahoy - Mac's Web Log - CSS Chickamauga. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 May 2017. . ==Service history== The ship, Edith, from Tallahassee, Florida, became the new Confederate cruiser. Its name was CSS Chickamauga. CSS stands for Confederate States Ship. Lieutenant John Wilkinson, who was a lieutenant of the new Confederate Navy, commanded the ship. Wilkinson as he was commanding Chickamauga, ran into the same problems faced by Woods, who was the previous commander. The ship had been a productive blockade runner, but it did not have the qualities needed for a Raider. Chickamauga was fast, but she could only be at sea as long as they had coal supply. On October 26, Chickamauga set sail for the open sea. After she also grounded on the bar, backed herself free, tried once more again, she finally cleared the obstruction, and made it out into the open sea. Chickamauga was once seen by . Dumbarton as well as two more Union ships chased Chickamauga. However, speed saved the ship, and she sailed off into the ocean, once again. US ships reported that another ship, Tallahassee, was sailing out and about again, and was searching for exactly the same thing as what Chickamauga was looking for. The shooting star ship, Albion Lincoln, held prisoners Mark L. Potter and Emily L. Hall, who sent to the ship. Other prisoners were burned, instead of going to Fort Monroe as ordered. On 4 November, Secretary Welles learned that he had to search for another raider, but since he did not know anymore information, he telegraphed Rear Admiral Porter: \\"It is reported that four privateers are out of Wilmington. Three have actually committed depredations, namely, Tallahassee, Chickamauga, and Olustee.\\" Olustee was actually Tallahassee, but just under a different new name. The next day, Porter ordered to find the raiders, so therefore the nine Union warships could be reunited. Lieutenant John Wilkinson kept busy, he captured Goodspeed, Otter Rock, and Speedwell. While Porter‚Äôs ships were trying to find Chickamauga, she sailed down in the Bermuda Triangle looking for coal. Wilkinson, on 15 November, left the Bermuda Triangle and set course towards his homeport. He arrived on 18 November waiting to anchor in safety. Before he reached his haven, four Union blockade runners, , , and all fired shots. Chickamauga herself got into the act, but not a single shot from either side ever found a target. In three weeks Chickamauga had taken only seven ships, Olustee only four. Tallahassee was responsible for capturing more than 55 ships. When the Feds stormed Fort Fisher, it was Chickamauga who took part in this final battle. She then had to retreat up river back to Wilmington, where her crew burned her. Olustee had another name change due to its duties as a blockade runner. and was renamed Chameleon. Lieutenant John Wilkinson took her out to the Bermuda Triangle to provide General Robert E. Lee's armies with food and supplies. After that, he sailed off to Liverpool, and when he got there, Lee surrendered, and the British Government seized his ship. ==See also== * Blockade runners of the American Civil War * Union blockade ==References== Chickamauga Category:Shipwrecks of the American Civil War Category:Shipwrecks in rivers Category:Ship fires Category:Maritime incidents in February 1865 ","title":"CSS Chickamauga"},{"id":"1271511","text":"Little Germany, Ontario can mean the following: *Little Germany, Grey County, Ontario *Little Germany, Northumberland County, Ontario ","title":"Little Germany, Ontario"},{"id":"1271513","text":"Lochalsh, Ontario may refer to: *Lochalsh, Algoma District, Ontario *Lochalsh, Huron County, Ontario ","title":"Lochalsh, Ontario"},{"id":"1271519","text":"Long Lake, Ontario, may refer to: *Long Lake, Thunder Bay District, Ontario *Long Lake, Frontenac County, Ontario *Long Lake (Ontario) (Lake) ","title":"Long Lake, Ontario"},{"id":"1271520","text":": Mandana of Media was a princess of Media and, later, the Queen consort of Cambyses I of Anshan and mother of Cyrus the Great, ruler of Persia's Achaemenid Empire. ==Etymology== The name ‚ÄúMandana‚Äù means ‚Äúeternal‚Äù in Old Persian. ==Mandana in Herodotus' histories== According to Herodotus, Mandane was the daughter of Astyages, King of Media. Shortly after her birth, Herodotus reports that Astyages had a strange dream where his daughter urinated so much that Asia would flood.Herodotus, 'The Histories' Book 1.108 He consulted the magians who interpreted the dream as a warning that Mandane's son would overthrow his rule. To forestall that outcome, Astyages betrothed Mandane to the vassal prince, Cambyses I of Anshan, ‚Äúa man of good family and quiet habits‚Äù, whom Astyages considered no threat to the Median throne. Astyages had a second dream when Mandane became pregnant where a vine grew from her womb and overtook the world. Terrified, he sent his most loyal court retainer, Harpagus, to kill the child. However, Harpagus was loath to spill royal blood and hid the child, Cyrus II, with a shepherd named Mitradates. Years later, Cyrus would defy his grandfather Astyages, leading to war between them; a war that Cyrus would have lost, but for Harpagus' defection at the battle of Pasargadae, leading to the overthrow of Astyages, as the dream had forecast. ==Mandane in Xenophon's Cyropedia== Xenophon also gives reference to Mandane in his Cyropaedia (The Education of Cyrus). In this story, Mandane and her son travel to Astyages' court, when Cyrus is in his early teens. Cyrus charms his grandfather, who includes the boy in royal hunts, while Mandane returns to her husband in Anshan. It is when Cyrus concocts a story that his father, Cambyses I, is ill and returns to visit him that Astyages comes after him and the battle is joined. ==Death== There are references to Mandana's death as 559 BC; however, as this year is considered the date of her husband's death (Cambyses I), it is unknown if that is the actual date of her death or when she changed status from Queen Consort to Queen Mother. ==Sources== Category:Persian queens consort Category:Median people Category:6th-century BC women Category:Women of the Achaemenid Empire Category:580s BC births Category:Year of death unknown Category:6th-century BC Iranian people Category:Ancient Persian women Category:Ancient princesses Category:Ancient queens consort Category:Cyrus the Great ","title":"Mandane of Media"},{"id":"1271528","text":"Social value may refer to: *Social dimensions of value (ethics) *The UK's Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 ","title":"Social value"},{"id":"1271555","text":"Peter Parnell (; born 1953) is an American Broadway and Off-Broadway playwright, television writer, and children's book author.

There is a large number of Germanic names ending in -bert, second in number only to those ending in -wolf (-olf, -ulf). Most of these names are early medieval and only a comparatively small fraction remains in modern use. The element -berht has the meaning of \\"bright\\", Old English beorht/berht, Old High German beraht/bereht, ultimately from a Common Germanic *berhtaz, from a PIE root *bhereg- \\"white, bright\\". The female hypocoristic of names containing the same element is Berta. Modern English bright itself has the same etymology, but it has suffered metathesis at an early date, already in the Old English period, attested as early as AD 700 in the Lindisfarne Gospels. The unmetathesized form disappears after AD 1000 and Middle English from about 1200 has briht universally. ==Names containing berht== There is no evidence of the berht element in Germanic personal names prior to the 6th century. It is mostly unknown in names of Goths, Vandals, Frisians or Norse, and only rarely occurs in names of Saxons. By contrast, it is very common among Anglo-Saxons, Lombards, Franks and Bavarians. The popularity of the element in certain areas may be related to religion, similar to the wolf element being due to the worship of Wodanaz, the names with berht can be considered theophoric, in connection with the goddess Perchta. The full form of Old High German beraht is reduced in two ways, by omission of either the second (berht, perht, pert) or the first vowel (braht, praht, brat, prat, brecht). Early attestations of such names include Ethberictus, Garberictus, and Transberictus mentioned in Hontheim's Historia Trevirensis s. a. 699. Pardessus' Diplomata s. a. 745 has Berdbert as a rare example of a reduplicated Germanic name. F√∂rstemann counts 369 names with final -bert(a), of which 61 are feminine.E.

He was educated at Eton College (where, as a skilled cricketer, he was Captain of the Oppidans) and, from 1827, St John's College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he contributed four poems to Poems, by Two Brothers, which Frederick, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and their brother Charles Tennyson Turner published in 1827. He also won the Browne medal for Greek verse composition (a Sapphic ode on the pyramids) in 1828, but was rusticated for three terms for refusal to accept punishment for not attending chapel. Re- admitted to Cambridge in 1830, he graduated BA in 1832. Tennyson passed most of his subsequent life in Italy and Jersey. On his inheritance of an estate near Grimsby in 1833, he went firstly to Corfu, then settled for twenty years in Florence, where he was a friend of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. In 1839 he married Maria Carolina Giuliotti, the daughter of the Chief magistrate of Tuscany. He became an Anglo-Israelite and later joined the Church of the New Jerusalem. ==Works== * Days and Hours, 1854 * The Isles of Greece: Sappho and Alc√¶us, 1890 * Daphne and other poems, 1891 * Poems of the Day and Year, 1895 ==References== * Category:1807 births Category:1898 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:People from Louth, Lincolnshire Category:People educated at Eton College Frederick Category:English male poets Category:19th-century English poets Category:19th- century British male writers Category:Burials at Highgate Cemetery ","title":"Frederick Tennyson"},{"id":"1271622","text":"A magnet is an object that has a magnetic field.

Each of the individual crossover/tie-in issues had a Legends Chapter # header added to their trade dress. The series was plotted by John Ostrander, scripted by Len Wein, pencilled by John Byrne, and inked by Karl Kesel. ==Publication history== The six issues of the Legends series could be read as an abbreviated story by themselves, or all 22 chapters could be read as a longer story that included the Legends issues as well as issues from other titles including Batman, Superman, and Secret Origins. It was also the first major DC Universe crossover after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths. Legends served mainly as a launching pad for several new comic series, including the latter-day Flash title, Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis' comedy/action take on the Justice League, and the villain-based black ops Suicide Squad. The series also saw the post-Crisis introduction into the DC Universe of Captain Marvel (who was spun off in the miniseries Shazam!: The New Beginning) as well as Wonder Woman, who had been rebooted by DC Comics at the same time Legends was being published. ==Plot== Darkseid makes a wager with the mysterious Phantom Stranger that he can turn humanity against its heroes. To win the bet, Darkseid sends his minion Glorious Godfrey to Earth, where Godfrey uses the sound of his voice to control people's minds and turn them against Earth's heroes. To further his scheme, Darkseid sends a fire elemental called Brimstone to Earth to defeat the Detroit-based Justice League along with Firestorm and a time-traveling Cosmic Boy. Darkseid also arranges for the cyborg villain Macro-Man to be killed by the mystic lightning that Captain Marvel uses to change into Billy Batson, and Captain Marvel is blamed by the media for Macro-Man's death. Batman suffers his own loss when Robin (Jason Todd) is trampled by a crazed mob. Fearing widespread panic, President Ronald Reagan (the U.S. Commander-in-Chief at the time of publication) declares martial law and bans all superheroic activities in America. This angers several members of Reagan's department of defense, who - at the behest of Amanda Waller - activate \\"Project: Task Force X\\", a.k.a. the Suicide Squad. Recruiting a team of expendable imprisoned supervillains, Amanda Waller has the Suicide Squad destroy Brimstone. Doctor Fate is forced to intervene when Glorious Godfrey uses his army of followers to invade Washington, DC. Dr. Fate organizes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Guy Gardner, Black Canary, Changeling, The Flash, and the Blue Beetle to oppose Glorious Godfrey. They are joined by the Martian Manhunter, who responds to a JLA distress call from the President. They defeat the forces of Glorious Godfrey, including Darkseid's cyborg Hounds of War. The masses are freed from Godfrey's power when Robin gathers an army of children untouched by Godfrey's powers to serve as a human shield between the heroes and Godfrey. Godfrey strikes one of the children, and the shock frees the mob from his power. Godfrey is defeated when he steals Dr. Fate's helmet and puts it on, rendering him mindless. In the aftermath, the Martian Manhunter, Batman, Blue Beetle, Guy Gardner, Black Canary, Captain Marvel and Dr. Fate form a new Justice League. Superman and the Flash decline membership, stating that they will assist if needed, Wonder Woman quietly exits and Changeling opts to remain with the Teen Titans. ==Story chronology== The official reading order was announced as follows by DC Comics: * Chapter 1 Cross-over: Batman #401 (November 1986): \\"A Bird in the Hand...\\" * Chapter 2 Cross-over: Detective Comics #568 (November 1986): \\"Eyrie\\" * Legends #1 (November 1986): \\"Once Upon A Time...!\\" * Chapter 3 Cross-over: Green Lantern Corps vol. 1 #207 (December 1986): \\"Simple Minds\\" * Legends #2 (December 1986): \\"Breach of Faith!\\" * Chapter 4 Spin-off: Cosmic Boy #1 (December 1986): \\"Those Who Will Not Learn the Lessons of History...\\" * Chapter 5 Cross-over: Justice League of America #258 (January 1987): \\"The End of the Justice League of America: Saving Face\\" * Chapter 6 Spin-off: Secret Origins vol. 2 #10 (January 1987): \\"The Phantom Stranger\\" * Chapter 7 Cross- over: The Fury of Firestorm #55 (January 1987): \\"The Stench of Brimstone\\" * Legends #3 (January 1987): \\"Send For... the Suicide Squad!\\" * Chapter 8 Spin- off: Cosmic Boy #2 (January 1987): \\"Is History Destiny?\\" * Chapter 9 Cross- over: Justice League of America #259 (February 1987): \\"The End of the Justice League of America: Homecoming\\" * Chapter 10 Cross-over: Firestorm, the Nuclear Man #56 (February 1987): \\"Firestorm No More\\" * Chapter 11 Cross-over: Blue Beetle vol. 6 #9 (February 1987): \\"Timepiece!\\" * Legends #4 (February 1987): \\"Cry Havoc...!\\" * Chapter 12 Cross-over: Warlord vol. 1, #114 (February 1987): \\"When A Legend Dies\\" * Chapter 13 Spin-off: Cosmic Boy #3 (February 1987): \\"Past, Present...and Future\\" * Chapter 14 Cross-over: Justice League of America #260 (March 1987): \\"The End of the Justice League of America: Flesh\\" * Chapter 15 Cross-over: Blue Beetle vol. 6 #10 (March 1987): \\"Time on His Hands\\" * Chapter 16 Cross-over: Warlord vol. 1 #115 (March 1987): \\"The Citadel of Fear\\" * Chapter 17 Cross-over: Superman vol. 2 #3 (March 1987): \\"Legends From the Darkside\\" * Chapter 18 Cross-over: Adventures of Superman #426 (March 1987): \\"From the Dregs\\" * Chapter 19 Cross-over: Action Comics #586 (March 1987): \\"The Champion!\\" * Legends #5 (March 1987): \\"Let Slip the Dogs of War\\" * Chapter 20 Spin-off: Cosmic Boy #4 (March 1987): \\"Time Without End\\" * Chapter 21 Cross-over: Justice League of America #261 (April 1987): \\"The End of the Justice League of America: Last Stand\\" * Legends #6 (April 1987): \\"Finale!\\" * Chapter 22 Spin-off: Secret Origins vol. 2 #14 (May 1987): \\"The Secret Origin of the Suicide Squad\\" ==Collections== A trade paperback Legends: The Collection () was published in 1993 collecting the entire 6-issue limited series.

He likewise made various other translations, including Bartholomaeus Anglicus' On the Properties of Things (De Proprietatibus Rerum), a medieval forerunner of the encyclopedia. A fellow of Queen's College, Oxford from 1372 to 1376 at the same time as John Wycliff and Nicholas of Hereford, Trevisa may well have been one of the contributors to the Early Version of Wycliffe's Bible. The preface to the King James Version of 1611 singles him out as a translator amongst others at that time: \\"even in our King Richard the second's days, John Trevisa translated them [the Gospels] into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be seen that divers translated, as it is very probable, in that age\\". Subsequently, he translated a number of books of the Bible into French for Lord Berkeley, including a version of the Book of Revelation, which his patron had written up onto the ceiling of the chapel at Berkeley Castle. Trevisa's reputation as a writer rests principally on his translations of encyclopaedic works from Latin into English, undertaken with the support of his patron, Thomas (IV), the fifth Baron Berkeley, as a continuous programme of enlightenment for the laity.Oxford DNB http://www.oxforddnb.com.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk/view/article/27722 John Trevisa is the 18th most frequently cited author in the Oxford English Dictionary and the third most frequently cited source for the first evidence of a word (after Geoffrey Chaucer and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society).Top 1000 sources in the OED '' == References == * David C.

It was the fourth unicameral legislature in Philippine history. Members of the Batasang Pambansa were referred to as \\"Mambabatas Pambansa\\", (English: Member of Parliament, literally \\"National Lawmaker\\"), shortened to \\"MP\\".Supreme Court Reports, Annotated, Volume 140, Central Book Supply, Incorporated, 1986, page 140 The Batasan was instituted under the 1973 Constitution promulgated by then- President Ferdinand Marcos, replacing the earlier Congress of the Philippines established by the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution. It was abolished immediately after the People Power Revolution in 1986, and Congress was restored with the passage of the 1987 Constitution. ==History== The original provisions of the 1973 Constitution, which was ratified on January 17, 1973, provided for the establishment of a unicameral National Assembly. Upon its ratification, an interim National Assembly composed of the President and Vice President of the Philippines, those who served as President of the 1971 Constitutional Convention, the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and those Delegates to the 1971 Constitutional Convention, was established and functioned as the Legislature. Before the Regular Batasang Pambansa convened, the 120-member Interim Batasan served as the national legislature. The body was composed of the incumbent President, representatives elected from different regions and from different sectors, and select Cabinet officials appointed by the President. In 1981, the semi-parliamentary legislature was formally convened as the Batasang Pambansa, and in 1985, some dissident members unsuccessfully tried to impeach President Marcos. The Batasang Pambansa was subsequently dissolved when Proclamation No. 3, popularly known as the 1986 Freedom Constitution, was promulgated on March 25, 1986. ==References== ==External links== * Website of the Philippine House of Representatives: Brief History of the Philippine Congress Philippines Category:Fourth Philippine Republic ","title":"Batasang Pambansa"},{"id":"1271657","text":"Frances Milton Trollope, also known as Fanny Trollope (10 March 1779 ‚Äì 6 October 1863), was an English novelist and writer who published as Mrs. Trollope or Mrs. Frances Trollope. Her first book, Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832) is the best known. She also wrote social novels: one against slavery said to have influenced Harriet Beecher Stowe, the first industrial novel, and two anti-Catholic novels that used a Protestant position to examine self-making. Some recent scholars note how modernist critics exclude women writers such as Frances Trollope from consideration.Nicola Diane Thompson, Victorian Women Writers and the Woman Question, Cambridge University Press, 2012. In 1839, The New Monthly Magazine claimed, \\"No other author of the present day has been at once so read, so much admired, and so much abused\\".Quoted in M. Sadleir, Trollope: a commentary (London, 1945) p. 112. Two of her sons, Thomas Adolphus and Anthony, became writers. Her daughter-in- law Frances Eleanor Trollope (n√©e Ternan), second wife of Thomas Adolphus Trollope, was also a novelist. ==Biography== Born at Stapleton, Bristol, Frances was the third daughter and middle child of the Reverend William Milton and Mary, n√©e Gresley. Frances's mother died in childbirth when Frances was five years old. Her father was remarried to Sarah Partington of Clifton in 1800. She was baptised at St Michael's, Bristol, on 17 March 1779.Ancestry.com. England & Wales, Christening Index, 1530-1980 [database on- line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2008. Genealogical Society of Utah. British Isles Vital Records Index, 2nd Edition. Salt Lake City, Utah: Intellectual Reserve, copyright 2002. Used by permission. As a child, Frances read a great amount of English, French and Italian literature. She and her sister later moved to Bloomsbury, London, in 1803 to live with their brother, Henry Milton, who was employed in the War Office. ===Marriage and family=== In London, she met Thomas Anthony Trollope, a barrister, and at the age of 30, married him on 23 May 1809 in Heckfield, Hampshire. They had four sons and three daughters:Frances Eleanor Trollope, \\"Frances Trollope Her Life and Literary Work from George III to Victoria, Vol. One\\", (Bentley and Son, 1895) p. 42. . Thomas Adolphus, Henry, Arthur, Emily (who died in a day), Anthony, Cecilia and Emily. When The Trollopes moved to a leased farm at Harrow-on-the-Hill in 1817, they faced financial struggles for lack of agricultural expertise. This was where Frances gave birth to her last two children. Two of her sons also became writers. Her eldest surviving son, Thomas Adolphus Trollope, wrote mostly histories: The Girlhood of Catherine de Medici, History of Florence, What I Remember, Life of Pius IX, and some novels. Her fourth son Anthony Trollope became a well-known and received novelist, establishing a strong reputation, especially for his serial novels, such as those set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, and his political series the Palliser novels. Despite producing six living children, their marriage was reputedly unhappy. ====Move to America==== Soon after the move to the leased farm, her marital and financial strains led Frances to seek companionship and aid from Fanny Wright, ward of the French hero Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. In 1824 she visited La Grange, Lafayette's estate in France. Over the next three years, she made several other visits to France and was inspired to take an American excursion with Wright. Frances thought of America as a simple economic venture and figured that she could save money by sending her children through Wright's communal school, as Wright had planned to reform the education of African American children and the formerly enslaved on their property in Tennessee. In 1827, Frances Trollope took most of her family to Fanny Wright's utopian community, Nashoba Commune, in the United States. Her husband and remaining family followed shortly after. Arriving in the United States four years earlier than her husband, she was able to develop an intimate relationship with Auguste Hervieu, a collaborator in her venture, and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio with her sons after the community failed. She also encouraged the sculptor Hiram Powers to do Dante Alighieri's Commedia in waxworks. Nonetheless, all the ways she tried to support herself in America were unsuccessful. She found the cultural climate uninteresting and came to resent democracy. Furthermore, after her venture failed, her family was more in debt than when she had migrated there ‚Äì forcing her and her family to move back to England in 1831. ====Return to Europe==== From her return at the age of 50 until her death, her need of an income for her family and escape her debts led her to begin writing novels, memoirs of her travels, and other shorter pieces, while travelling around Europe. She became well acquainted with elites and figures of Victorian literature including Elizabeth Barrett, Robert Browning, Charles Dickens, Joseph Henry Green and R. W. Thackeray (a relative of William Makepeace Thackeray). She wrote 40 books: six travelogues, 35 novels, countless controversial articles, and poems. In 1843, Frances visited Italy and eventually moved to Florence permanently. ==Writing career== Grandon, Monken Hadley. Home to Fanny Trollope and her husband in 1836‚Äì1838 Trollope already gained notice with her first book, Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832). She gave an unfavourable, and in the opinions of America's partisans, an exaggerated account. Her novel, The Refugee in America (1832), expressed similar views, prompting Catherine Maria Sedgwick to respond that \\"Mrs. Trollope, though she has told some disagreeable truths, has for the most part caricatured till the resemblance is lost.\\"Quoted in M. Sadleir, Trollope: a commentary (London, 1945) p. 101. She was thought to reflect the disparaging views of American society that were allegedly commonplace at that time among English people of the higher social classes. Later Trollope wrote further travel works, such as Belgium and Western Germany in 1833 (1834), Paris and the Parisians in 1835 (1836), and Vienna and the Austrians (1838).The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 4; Volumes 1800‚Äì1900, Cambridge University Press, 2000. Among those with whom she became acquainted in Brussels was the future novelist Anna Harriett Drury. ===Novels=== Next came The Abbess (1833), an anti-Catholic novel, as was Father Eustace (1847). While both borrowed from Victorian Gothic conventions, the scholar Susan Griffin notes that Trollope wrote a Protestant critique of Catholicism that also expressed \\"a gendered set of possibilities for self- making\\", which has been little recognised by scholars. She noted that \\"Modernism's lingering legacy in criticism meant overlooking a woman's nineteenth century studies of religious controversy.\\"Susan M. Griffin, \\"Revising the Popish Plot: Frances Trollope's 'The Abbess' and 'Father Eustace'\\", Victorian Literature and Culture, 2003, p. 279, JSTOR, accessed 24 February 2011. Trollope received more attention in her lifetime for what are considered several strong novels of social protest: Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw (1836) was the first anti-slavery novel, influencing the American Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). It focuses on two powerful families ‚Äì one that strongly encourages slavery and another that strongly opposes it and provides sanctuary for slave refugees. It antagonizes pro-slavery characters, making them appear foolish and uncultured. Frances also brings out her idea of a stereotypical American by drawing certain characters as shrewd, convincing, sly and greedy. Published in 1840, Michael Armstrong: Factory Boy was the first industrial novel to be published in Britain, inspired by Frances's visit to Manchester in 1832, where she examined the conditions of children employed in the textile mills. The story of a factory boy who is rescued by a wealthy benefactor at first, but later returns to the mills, illustrates the misery of factory life and suggests that private philanthropy alone will not solve the widespread misery of factory employment. Other socially conscious novels of hers include The Vicar of Wrexhill (1837, Richard Bentley, London, 3 volumes), which took on the issue of corruption in the Church of England and evangelical circles. Possibly her greatest work is the Widow Barnaby trilogy (1839‚Äì1855), which includes the first ever sequel. In particular, Michael Sadleir considers the skilful set-up of Petticoat Government [1850], with its cathedral city, clerical psychology and domineering female, as something of a formative influence on her son's elaborate and colourful cast of characters in Barchester Towers, notably Mrs Proudie.M. Sadleir, Trollope (Constable 1945) p. 157. ==Later life and death== In later years Frances Trollope continued to write novels and books on miscellaneous subjects ‚Äì in all over 100 volumes. In her own time, she was considered to have acute powers of observation and a sharp and caustic wit, but her prolific production coupled with the rise of modernist criticism caused her works to be overlooked in the 20th century. Few of her books are now read, but her first and two others are available on Project Gutenberg.. After the death of her husband and daughter, in 1835 and 1838 respectively, Trollope relocated to Florence, Italy, having lived briefly at Carleton, Eden in Cumbria, but finding that (in her son Tom's words) \\"the sun yoked his horses too far from Penrith town.\\"Quoted in G. Lindop, A Literary Guide to the Lake District (London 1993) p. 135. One year, she invited Theodosia Garrow to be her house guest. Garrow married her son, Thomas Adolphus, and the three lived together until Trollope's death in 1863. She was buried near four other members of the Trollope household in the English Cemetery of Florence. ==Major works== *Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832) *Belgium and Western Germany in 1833 (1834) *Tremordyn Cliff (1835) *Paris and the Parisians in 1835 (1836) *The Life and Adventures of Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw; or Scenes on the Mississippi (1836) retitled Lynch Law; etc. in 1857 edition *The Vicar of Wrexhill (1837) *Vienna and the Austrians (1838) *The Widow Barnaby (1839) *The Widow Married; A Sequel to the Widow Barnaby (1840) *The Life and Adventures of Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy (1840) *Charles Chesterfield, or the Adventures of a Youth of Genius (1841) *A Visit to Italy (1842) *The Refugee in America (1842) *The Ward of Thorpe-Combe (1842) *The Barnabys in America, or Adventures of the Widow Wedded (1843) *Jessie Phillips: A Tale of the Present Day (1844) *Young Love, A Novel (1844) *Travels and Travelers : A Series of Sketches (1846) *Town and Country, A Novel (1848) *The Young Countess, or, Love and Jealousy (1848) *The Old World and the New, A Novel (1849) *The Lottery of Marriage (1849) *Petticoat Government, A Novel (1850) *Mrs Matthews, or Family Mysteries, A Novel (1851) *The Young Heiress, A Novel (1853) ==See also== *Frances Trollope bibliography *Trollope *Frances Wright ==References== ==Sources== * This article on her son has a short biography of her. ==Further reading== * *E.

He wrote The Light of Nature Pursued (1768‚Äì1777) under the name of Edward Search. ==Biography== Tucker was born in London of a Somerset family, the son of a wealthy city merchant. His parents died during his infancy, and he was brought up by his uncle, Sir Isaac Tillard. In 1721, he entered Merton College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, and studied philosophy, mathematics, French, Italian and music. He afterwards studied laws at the Inner Temple, but was never called to the bar. This work in turn cites: * James Mackintosh, Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy (Edinburgh, 1832) * Leslie Stephen, English Thought in the 18th Century, iii, pp. 119‚Äì130. In 1727 he bought Betchworth Castle, near Dorking, where he passed the remainder of his life. In 1736 Tucker married Dorothy Barker, daughter of Edward Barker of East Betchworth, cursitor baron of the exchequer. They had two daughters, Judith (died 1794) who did not marry, and Dorothea Maria, who married in 1763 Sir Henry St John, 2nd Baronet of Dogmersfield Park. On his wife's death in 1754, Tucker occupied himself in collecting together all the letters that had passed between them, which, we are told, he transcribed twice over under the title of \\"The Picture of Artless Love.\\" He then concentrated on his major work, The Light of Nature Pursued, of which in 1763 he published a specimen under the title of Free Will, Foreknowledge, and Fate, by \\"Edward Search\\". The strictures of a critic in the Monthly Review of July 1763 drew from him a pamphlet called Man in Quest of Himself, by \\"Cuthbert Comment\\" (reprinted in Samuel Parr's Metaphysical Tracts, 1837), \\"a defence of the individuality of the human mind or self.\\" In 1768 the first two volumes of his work were published. The remaining volume appeared posthumously. His eyesight failed him completely in 1771, but he contrived an apparatus which enabled him to write legibly enough that the result could be transcribed by his daughter. The final volume was ready for publication when he died. Tucker took no part in politics, and wrote a pamphlet, The Country Gentleman's Advice to his Son on the Subject of Party Clubs (1755), cautioning young men against its snares. ==Work== Tucker's magnum opus is The Light of Nature Pursued, originally published in three volumes: * Volume 1: Human Nature (1768) * Volume 2: Theology (1768) * Volume 3: Lights of Nature and Gospel Blended (1777) The author's intention is to draw up \\"a scheme of nature and the fundamentals of natural religion, founded upon the basis of experience and observations resulting therefrom\\".Tucker, Abraham. The Light of Nature Pursued. Volume 3, Chapter 1, Section 2. His work contains many psychological and more strictly metaphysical discussions, but it is chiefly in connexion with ethics that Tucker's speculations are best remembered. In important points he anticipated the utilitarianism of William Paley, who expressed obligations to his predecessor. \\"Every man's own satisfaction\\" Tucker held to be the ultimate end of action; and satisfaction or pleasure is one and the same in kind, however much it may vary in degree. This universal motive is further connected, as by Paley, through the will of God, with the \\"general good, the root where out all our rules of conduct and sentiments of honour are to branch.\\" The Light of Nature Pursued was republished with a biographical sketch by Tucker's grandson Sir Henry St John-Mildmay, 3rd Baronet (1805, other editions 1831, 1834, &c.;), and an abridged edition by William Hazlitt appeared in 1807. ==Notes== Category:1705 births Category:1774 deaths Category:English philosophers Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford ","title":"Abraham Tucker"},{"id":"1271669","text":"Dried orris roots Orris root (rhizoma iridis) is a term used for the roots of Iris germanica and Iris pallida. It had the common name of Queen Elizabeth Root. ==Constituent chemicals== The most valued component of orris root is oil of Orris (0.1‚Äì0.2%), a yellow-white mass containing myristic acid. Oil of Orris is sometimes sold as Orris Butter. Other components include fat, resin, starch, mucilage, bitter extractive, and a glucoside called iridin or irisin.Margaret Grieve ==Uses== Once important in western herbal medicine, it is now used mainly as a fixative and base note in perfumery; it is the most widely used fixative for potpourri. Orris is also an ingredient in many brands of gin.T. K. Lim Fabienne Pavia, in her book L'univers des Parfums (1995, ed. Solar), states that in the manufacturing of perfumes using orris, the scent of the iris root differs from that of the flower. After preparation the scent is reminiscent of the smell of violets. In Japan, the roots and leaves of the plant were hung in the eaves of a house to protect the house and occupants from attacks by evil spirits. Other magic uses include using it as a \\"love potion\\", with the root powder in sachets, or sprinkled around the house or sheets of a bedroom. ==Preparation== After an initial drying period, which can take five years or more depending on the use (for potpourri only two to three months), the root is ground. For potpourri, this powder is used without further processing. For other uses, it is dissolved in water and then distilled. It achieves a highly scented, yellow-brown crystalline form.John Charles Sawer One ton of iris root produces two kilos of essential oil, also referred to as orris root butter or butter of iris, making it a highly prized substance. Its fragrance has been described as tenaciously flowery, heavy and woody (paraphrasing Pavia, Dutch translation, page 40). It is similar to violets. ==In perfume== Typical iris perfumes (where orris prevails over the other components) are: \\"Orris Noir\\" by the London-based perfume house Ormonde Jayne Perfumery;\\"Orris Noir Perfume Collection\\".

The group's original line up consisted of OTMC, DiSoul, and Dj Choice. Dubmatique is often regarded as one of the groups that launched French Canadian Hip Hop, and within this category they are the only group to have an album certified Platinum. == Biography == === Early career === In the 1980s, Disoul and OTMC became friends in the country of Senegal. In the early 1990s Disoul moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Shortly after OTMC returned for a visit, and the two decided to start a French Hip Hop group. The two rappers invited Dj Choice to join them, and the three founded Dubmatique. In 1994, they made their first appearance by doing a freestyle on the mix-tape Tape 9-Too Leust by Cut Killer. By 1995, the group were doing shows in local clubs. They participated at the launch of the album Simple et Funky by Alliance Ethnik and the soundtrack for the movie La Haine. They won the award Best Hip Hop Group of the Year at the Gala Mimi. That same summer, they performed at the music festival Les FrancoFolies de Montr√©al. === La force de comprendre === In 1997, on the French Canadian market, they released their first album named La force de comprendre. It was soon certified platinum, selling over 125,000 copies. Because of the singles and music videos for Soul Pleureur, La force de comprendre, and Plus rien n‚Äôest pareil, they reached the top of the charts on commercial radio stations and TV channels for music videos. The reviews were favourable on both lyrics and the production. The album featured French rappers Menelik and 2 Bal. Dubmatique went on to perform 150 shows on stages throughout Quebec. At the French Canadian equivalent of the \\"Grammy Awards\\" called \\"Le Gala de L'ADISQ\\", the band won the F√©lix Award of \\"Best Rock Alternative Album\\" (Their first year at \\"Le Gala de L'ADISQ\\", there was no Hip Hop section). They were nominated for Group of the year, and Revelation of the year. In 1998 the band won the F√©lix Award for Group of the year, and two more nominations for Show of the year and Best Seller. On the English side of Canada they were nominated for a Juno Award for the Best selling Francophone album. === Dubmatique === Their second album, the self-titled Dubmatique was released in 1999. They launched the singles and music videos of La vie est si fragile with the violinist Ashley MacIsaac and M√©moires. The album was certified gold and sold 35,000 copies in the first week. They collaborated with two members of the group IAM: Shurik‚Äôn was featured on the song L‚Äôavenir, and Akhenathon remixed the single La force de comprendre from the first album. Montreal artists were also featured: El Winner of Latitude Nord, D-Shade of Shades of Culture and Mr. Len. The record was well received and Dubmatique continued to perform around Quebec\\"FETE 01/CITY/MONTREAL/\\". Montreal Gazette, June 24/99, and fill up large venues. Finally at \\"Le Gala de L'ADISQ\\", they won the F√©lix Award for \\"Hip Hop Album of the year\\", were nominated for Group of the year. Additionally at \\"Le Gala Soba\\" they won two Sound of Blackness Awards for Best Group of the year, and Best Francophone Hip Hop Group of the year. === Influences === Dj Choice did not participate on the production of their third album.\\"Rap local : Dubmatique, prendre les bonnes d√©cisions\\".

Ragga Dub and Sexcite-Moi, a collaboration with the rock singer √âric Lapointe, were chosen as the singles and music videos to launch the album. The group continued to do well on the charts. They won the F√©lix Award for Best Hip Hop Album of the year. This record is also annotated to be the first appearance by best selling R&B; singer Corneille on a professional project. === M√©moires and solo projects === In 2004, their label Tox released the compilation M√©moires that contained all of their hits. Shortly after, Disoul and OTMC launched solo projects. In 2005, Disoul decided to use his real name, J√©r√¥me-Philippe and released a self-titled album where he mixed rapping and singing. OTMC followed up in 2006 with a Hip Hop album named Sinc√©rit√© volontaire. Their respective songs would play on the radios throughout Quebec and sales were respectable. === Trait d‚Äôunion === In 2008, a group was created by a fan on Facebook to urge Dubmatique to reunite, and over 50,000 fans joined. This motivated OTMC and Disoul to make an album. In 2009 they launched Trait d‚Äôunion. Dj Choice participated and produced the song Patience a collaboration with Sir Pathetik, Imposs and John John.

It is a send-up of the melodramatic genre of women's pictures, particularly those directed by Douglas Sirk, whose work directly influenced this film, as well as a satirical look at suburban life in the early 1980s involving divorce, abortion, adultery, alcoholism, foot fetishism, and the religious right. Polyester was filmed in Waters' native Baltimore, Maryland, and features a gimmick called \\"Odorama\\", whereby viewers can smell what they see on screen using scratch and sniff cards, in a stylistic tribute to the work of William Castle, whose films typically featured attention-grabbing gimmicks. aside from Stunts, it was one of the first films produced by New Line Cinema. ==Plot== Housewife Francine Fishpaw (Divine) watches her upper-middle-class family's life crumble in their suburban Baltimore home. Her husband Elmer (David Samson) is a polyester-clad lout who owns an adult movie theater, causing anti-pornography protesters to picket the Fishpaws' house. Francine's Christian beliefs are also offended by the behavior of her children--Lu-Lu (Mary Garlington), her spoiled, promiscuous daughter, and Dexter (Ken King), her delinquent, glue-sniffing son who secretly derives pleasure from stomping on women's feet. Francine's troubles are compounded by her cocaine-snorting mother La Rue (Joni Ruth White), a class-conscious snob who robs her daughter blind and constantly derides her obese appearance. La Rue berates Francine for befriending her former housecleaner, Cuddles Kovinsky (Edith Massey), a simple-minded woman who tries to console Francine with \\"seize-the-day\\" bromides. Cuddles inherits a large sum of money from a former employer, further infuriating La Rue. After Francine discovers her husband is having an affair with his secretary, Sandra Sullivan (Mink Stole), she confronts them during a motel tryst and demands a divorce. Francine then falls into alcoholism and depression, exacerbated by her children's behavior: Lu-Lu becomes pregnant by her delinquent boyfriend Bo-Bo Belsinger (Stiv Bators) and announces she is getting an abortion; and after Dexter is arrested at a supermarket for stomping on a woman's foot, the media reveal that he is the Baltimore Foot Stomper who is terrorizing local women with his serial attacks. Lu-Lu goes to a family planning clinic for an abortion, but is harassed by anti-abortion picketers. She returns home and tries to induce a miscarriage, causing Francine to call an unwed mothers' home. Two nuns arrive, force Lu-Lu into the trunk of their car, and take her to a Catholic home for unwed mothers. La Rue is shot by Bo-Bo and his friend, who have come to trash the Fishpaw house on Halloween night. La Rue manages to retrieve the gun and shoots Bo-Bo, killing him. After Lu-Lu flees the unwed mothers' home, she returns home to discover her boyfriend's dead body and is so distraught that she attempts suicide. Francine comes home and faints after witnessing her daughter's suicide attempt--and the apparent suicide by hanging of the family dog, Bonkers, based on a suicide note left near the dog's dangling body. However, Francine's life soon begins to change. Dexter is released from jail, having been rehabilitated. Lu-Lu suffers a miscarriage from her suicide attempt and is contrite about her past, becoming an artistic flower child who embraces macram√©. Francine finally summons the strength to quit drinking, confronts and rebukes her mother, and finds new romance with Todd Tomorrow (Tab Hunter).

Only two Dreamlanders, Divine and Edith Massey, received top billing in this film. Dreamlander perennials Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pearce, Cookie Mueller, Sharon Niesp, Marina Melin, Susan Lowe, and Jean Hill played small roles in Polyester. While their parts are integral to the plot, they are much smaller compared to their earlier roles. Principal photography for the film took place over the course of three weeks in October 1979. Polyester was the first Waters film to skirt the mainstream, even garnering an R rating (his previous films were all unrated or rated X--the equivalent of the Motion Picture Association of America's present-day NC-17 rating). The film was set in a middle-class suburb of Baltimore instead of its slums and bohemian neighborhoods, the setting of Waters' earlier films. ===Music=== These are the only songs known to be in the film: # \\"Polyester\\" by Tab Hunter ‚Äì words and music by Chris Stein and Debbie Harry # \\"Be My Daddy's Baby (Lu-Lu's Theme)\\" by Michael Kamen ‚Äì words and music by Harry and Kamen # \\"The Best Thing\\" by Bill Murray ‚Äì words and music by Harry and Kamen ===Women's pictures=== Polyester was a send-up of women's pictures, an exploitative genre of film that was popular from the 1950‚Äì60s and typically featured bored, unfulfilled, or otherwise troubled women, usually middle-aged suburban housewives, finding release or escape through the arrival of a handsome younger man. Women's pictures were typically hackneyed B-movies, but Waters specifically styled Polyester after the work of the director Douglas Sirk, making use of similar lighting and editing techniques, even using film equipment and movie-making techniques from Sirk's era. ===Odorama=== Original German Odorama card for the film Odors, especially Francine's particularly keen sense of smell, play an important role in the film. To highlight this, Waters designed Odorama, a \\"scratch-and-sniff\\" gimmick inspired by the work of William Castle and the 1960 film Scent of Mystery, which featured a device called Smell-O-Vision. Special cards with spots numbered 1 through 10 were distributed to audience members before the show, in the manner of 3D glasses. When a number flashed on the screen, viewers were to scratch and sniff the appropriate spot. Smells included the scent of flowers, pizza, glue, gas, grass, and feces. For the first DVD release of the film the smell of glue was changed due to, as Waters states, \\"political correctness\\". The gimmick was advertised with the tag \\"It'll blow your nose!\\"Neil Gaiman, Kim Newman, Ghastly Beyond Belief, Arrow Books, 1985, , p. 193 After being prompted to scratch and sniff a bouquet of roses, viewers are subjected to a series of mostly foul-smelling odors, and thus fall victim to the director's prank. The ten smells (developed by 3M per John Waters in the supplements section of the DVD release) are: * 1. Roses * 2. Flatulence (Natural ass) * 3. Model airplane glue * 4. Pizza * 5. Gasoline * 6. Skunk * 7. Natural gas * 8. New car smell * 9. Dirty shoes * 10. Air freshener A video release omits the numbers flashing onscreen as well as the opening introduction explaining Odorama. This version, created by Lorimar- Telepictures, was shown on cable TV in the United States. The Independent Film Channel released reproduction Odorama cards for John Waters film festivals in 1999. Waters expressed his delight at having the film's audiences actually \\"pay to smell shit\\" on the commentary track of the film's 2004 DVD release. Producers of Rugrats Go Wild (Paramount) used the Odorama name and logo in 2003, somewhat upsetting Waters when he learned that New Line Cinema had let the copyright lapse. The 2011 film Spy Kids: All the Time in the World uses a scratch and sniff card now called \\"Aromascope\\", which is advertised as providing the fourth dimension in its \\"4D\\" format. The film was re-screened by Midnight Movies at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2011. The Odorama cards were recreated by Midnight Movies, Little Joe Magazine, and The Aroma Company to allow viewers to interact with the film as originally intended. ==Critical response== Polyester received some good reviews from the mainstream press. Said Janet Maslin of The New York Times: The film currently holds a 93% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 27 reviews. ==In popular culture== A scene in which Principal Kirk calls Francine to inform her about Dexter's expulsion from school was sampled by Australian electronic music group The Avalanches in their single \\"Frontier Psychiatrist\\".Page for the sample on WhoSampled. ==References*Polyester: The Perils of Francine an essay by Elena Gorfinkel at the Criterion Collection Category:1981 films Category:1980s black comedy films Category:American films Category:American black comedy films Category:American independent films Category:American satirical films Category:English-language films Category:Adultery in films Category:Films about abortion Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films directed by John Waters Category:Films set in Baltimore Category:Films shot in Baltimore Category:Films shot in Maryland Category:Films with scents Category:1981 comedy films ","title":"Polyester (film)"},{"id":"1271715","text":"Encamp () is one of the parishes of Andorra, located on the Valira d'Orient river.

Zakharov joined the Red Guards (precursor to the Red Army) in 1917. He served under Kliment Voroshilov during the Russian Civil War. Zakharov graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1928, and from Soviet General Staff Academy in 1937 (his graduation was actually a year ahead of schedule, due to the lack of officers in the Red Army because of the explosive growth of the army, as well as Stalin's purges.) Zakharov held a number of high-ranking positions before World War II even began. In 1937 he was made the Chief of Staff of the Leningrad Military District, then in 1938‚Äì1940 he was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and then the Chief of Staff of the Odessa Military District. By the end of 1941, after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, he was moved north, where he was made the Chief of Staff of the Northwestern Theatre. Soon thereafter, he was made the Chief of Staff of the Kalinin Front, a role he held for most of 1942. In 1943, he was made the Chief of Staff of the Steppe Front, which was renamed the 2nd Ukrainian Front around mid-year. It was in this capacity that Zakharov proved himself as one of the Soviet Union‚Äôs top military commanders. He helped plan a number of brilliant operations against German forces, first as a subordinate to Marshal Ivan Konev, and then under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky. After the cessation of hostilities with Germany, Zakharov was transferred east, where he was made the Chief of Staff of the Transbaikal Front, and helped plan the subsequent Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. After the war, Zakharov held a number of key positions in the army. In 1945‚Äì1960, Zakharov was the Commandant of the General Staff Academy, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Chief Inspector of the Army, Commanding General of the Leningrad Military District and Commander in Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. On May 8, 1959, Zakharov was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union. After attaining that rank, Zakharov was simultaneously made Chief of the General Staff and Deputy Minister of Defence in 1960‚Äì1963. He then briefly went back to the General Staff Academy where he was once again the commandant until 1964, when he was made the Deputy Minister of Defense and again Chief of the General Staff, a post he held until his retirement in 1971. Marshal M. V. Zakharov died on January 31, 1972.

Other forms of classification, such as sexual orientation, religion, or age, apply to this theory as well. Patricia Hill Collins is credited with introducing the theory in her work entitled Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment. As the term implies, there are many different ways one might experience domination, facing many different challenges in which one obstacle, such as race, may overlap with other sociological features. Characteristics such as race, age, and sex, may affect an individual in extremely different ways, in such simple cases as varying geography, socioeconomic status, or simply throughout time. Other scholars such as Kimberle Crenshaw's Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color are credited with expanding Collins' work. The matrix of domination is a way for people to acknowledge their privileges in society. How one is able to interact, what social groups one is in, and the networks one establishes is all based on different interconnected classifications. == Theory applied == Though Collins' main focus of the theory of the matrix of domination was applied to African-American women, there are many other examples that can be used to illustrate the theory. Other examples include Log Cabin Republicans, female criminality, and African-American Muslim women. One of the key concepts of the matrix of domination is that the different categories, like race and gender, are separate groups, rather than a combination. This is a problem that can be seen in the law as well when it comes to discrimination because the courts fail to view discrimination as an overarching umbrella of intersectionality. A way in which the matrix of domination works with regards to privilege can be if two people all have the same classification, except one person has an education and one does not have as high of an education. Their gender, race, sexuality, educational attainment all intersect to identify who they are. However, compared to other people one classification can point out privilege and, in turn, open more opportunities for one individual over the other. One of the main aspects of the matrix of domination is the fact that one may be privileged in one area, yet they can be oppressed in a different aspect of their identity. Some people believe that racial discrimination is on its way to being eradicated from the United States when they look as people like Colin Powell, a very successful, African-American, middle-aged man. Although Powell obtains the characteristics of a person that may not face oppression (upper-class, middle-aged, male), he is still discriminated against because of his race. This shows one of the key components of the matrix of domination; the idea that one cannot look at the individual facets of someone's identity, but rather that they are all interconnected. == Matrix of domination compared to intersectionality == === Historical background on the matrix of domination === In Collins' Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment, she first describes the concept of matrix thinking within the context of how black women in America encounter institutional discrimination based upon their race and gender.Collins, Patricia Hill. (2000) Black Feminist Thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. New York, Routledge. A prominent example of this in the 1990s was racial segregation, especially as it related to housing, education, and employment. At the time, there was very little encouraged interaction between whites and blacks in these common sectors of society. Collins argues that this demonstrates how being black and female in America continues to perpetuate certain common experiences for African-American women. As such, African-American women live in a different world than those who are not black and female. Collins notes how this shared social struggle can actually result in the formation of a group-based collective effort, citing how the high concentration of African-American women in the domestic labor sector in combination with racial segregation in housing and schooling contributed directly to the organization of the black feminist movement. The collective wisdom shared by black women that held these specific experiences constituted a distinct viewpoint for African-American women concerning correlations between their race and gender and the resulting economic consequences. Moolman points out the main issue concerning matrix thinking is how one accounts for the power dynamics between varying identifying categories that are ingrained in both oppression and domination instead of the traditional approach, reducing experiences to a single identity. For instance, black women's experiences with society are used to illustrate how even though white scholars have attempted to use intersectionality in their research, they may still be inclined to default towards single-identity thinking that often fails to address all aspects of black women's experiences, thus ignoring the organization the matrix objectively offers. The matrix of domination in the colonial era and white society has also been carefully examined. The societal hierarchy determined by race and implemented under apartheid locates different racial populations in regards to their privilege, with African Americans usually at the bottom of the ladder. Dhamoon argues that on a global scale, the spot occupied by African Americans in such context is interchangeable with indigenous populations, as marginalized peoples are systematically working both within and across a matrix of interrelated axes of \\"penalty and privilege\\". The interconnectivity of different identities in regards to power in racial structures in post-colonial era societies help illustrate what changes make a difference. The framework setup of the matrix of domination connects its origin theory and thought to existing struggles in the political and social spheres of society. A closer look at both specific and broader aspects of matrix thought will shed more light on the inner-workings and mechanisms that determine how different relationship dynamics influence matrix categorizations. May cites that an important implication that matrix thinking inspires is that it directly goes against what is often described as the socially inclusive ‚Äòadd and stir‚Äô approach. This is often used when describing the addition of one or more identity group to existing epistemological approaches, political strategies or research methodologies. This accounts for the proper weighing of power dynamics and their impact on different groups of people. Intersectionality centers power in a multi-pronged way as shifting across different sites and scales at the same time. Therefore, it is not neutral but evolved out of histories of struggle that pursue multidimensional forms of justice. === Historical background on intersectionality === Kimberl√© Crenshaw, the founder of the term intersectionality, brought national and scholarly credential to the term through the paper Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. In the paper, she uses intersectionality to reveal how feminist movements and antiracist movements exclude women of color. Focusing on the experiences of Black women, she dissects several court cases, influential pieces of literature, personal experiences, and doctrinal manifestations as evidence for the way Black women are oppressed through many different experiences, systems and groups. Though the specifics differ, the basic argument is the same: Black women are oppressed in a multitude of situations because people are unable to see how their identities intersect and influence each other. Feminism has been crafted for white middle-class women, only considering problems that affect this group of people. Unfortunately, this only captures a small facet of the oppression women face. By catering to the most privileged women and addressing only the problems they face, feminism alienates women of color and lower-class women by refusing to accept the way other forms of oppression feed into the sexism they face. Not only does feminism completely disregard the experiences of women of color, it also solidifies the connection between womanhood and whiteness when feminists speak for \\"all women\\". (Crenshaw:154) Oppression cannot be detangled or separated easily in the same way identities cannot be separated easily. It is impossible to address the problem of sexism without addressing racism, as many women experience both racism and sexism. This theory can also be applied to the antiracist movement, which rarely addresses the problem of sexism, even though it is thoroughly intertwined with the problem of racism. Feminism remains white, and antiracism remains male. In essence, any theory that tries to measure the extent and manner of oppression Black women face will be wholly incorrect without using intersectionality. Patricia Hill Collins wrote a book entitled Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment, which articulated \\"Black Feminist Thought\\" in relation to intersectionality with a focus on the plight of Black women in face of the world, the white feminist movement, and the male antiracism movement. Collins references Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality and relates it to the matrix of domination, \\"The term matrix of domination describes this overall social organization within which intersecting oppressions originate, develop, and are contained.\\". === Intersectionality and the matrix of domination === Both intersectionality and the matrix of domination help sociologists understand power relationships and systems of oppression in society. The matrix of domination looks at the overall organization of power in society while intersectionality is used to understand a specific social location of an identity using mutually constructing features of oppression. The concept of intersectionality today is used to move away from one dimensional thinking in the matrix of domination approach by allowing for different power dynamics of different identity categories at the same time. Researchers in public health are using Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) Framework to show how social categories intersect to identify health disparities that evolve from factors beyond an individual's personal health. Ferlatte applied an IBPA framework and used structural interviews to identify barriers to the allocation of HIV prevention funding for gay men. He highlighted policy more likely to cause harm than reduce the epidemic stemming from policy makers missing the ‚Äòintersections of oppression, sex panic, and medicalization‚Äô.Ferlatte, Olivier. (2012). Are There Enough Gay Dollars? An Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis of HIV Prevention Funding for Gay Men in British Columbia, Canada. 189-210. Intersectionality can also be used to correct for the over-attribution of traits to groups and be used to emphasize unique experiences within a group. As a result, the field of social work is introducing intersectional approaches in their research and client interactions. At the University of Arkansas, the curriculum for a Master of Social Work (MSW) is being amended to include the Multi-Systems Life Course (MSLC) approach. Christy and Valandra apply an MSLC approach to intimate partner violence and economic abuse against poor women of color to explain that symbols of safety (such as police) in one population can be symbols of oppression in another. By teaching this approach to future social workers, the default recommendation for these women to file a police report is amended and an intervention rooted in the individual case can emerge. == Implications of the matrix of domination == Many approaches have been used that consider the concepts of identity, societal structures, and representation to be mutually exclusive, but the introduction of Patricia Hill Collins‚Äô matrix of domination addresses the interlocking patterns of privilege and marginalization along the lines of race, class, gender, and class inside social institutions as well as at the community level. With this work has come greater recognition of the various effects that each identity holds in different societal contexts, in both the micro- and macro-level structures within the systems of oppression that exist. === In female criminality === In April Bernard's article, \\"The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality\\", Bernard applies Patricia Hill Collins‚Äô work to the study of feminist criminology, as a means of explaining the cumulative effects of identity in a system of oppression on women's decisions to commit a crime. Bernard employs an intersectional approach to dissect the complexities that act as determinant factors in a woman's decision to partake in criminal activities, and more specifically, the limiting pressures of a patriarchal society. In particular, this article is framed in response to Robert Merton's claims about deviance as a response to a lack of adequate resources to achieve cultural goals, as Bernard employs an intersectional paradigm model that explores female criminality as an expression of constraint and circumscription, rather than a \\"strained reality\\". With this alternative framework, Bernard suggests that societal goals are not unanimous, and are instead shaped by individuals‚Äô experiences in economic, political, and social spaces; for marginalized women, access to the means through which they build success are impacted by micro- and macro-level norms and histories that have created indicators of class (e.g. racial, economic, political, sexual) and subjugated them to limited networks. Thus, identity makes women with marginalized identities more vulnerable in the legal system, subjugates to oppressive states within multiple institutions, and creating a need for policies that move toward creating an equitable reality for them. === In the welfare state === In the United States, especially, the matrix of domination has implications within the welfare state. Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others. Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender. In Politics, Gender, and Concepts, Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race. As such, using the idea of a matrix of domination in these kinds of studies provides a basis for empirical research on the relationship between social positions and policies, and also, for a comparison between the outcomes of social policies on marginalized and privileged women. == Intersectionality of gender and class == === Benefits among class === The benefits that upper- class citizens receive from their employer are far different from that of working-class employees. This is due to the upper class taking jobs that give them a higher status or position, whereas the working class take jobs with lower status such as retail and blue-collar jobs. The most obvious benefit that differs between classes is the amount of money made. Upper-class workers receive significantly more pay than the working class, and while the upper class receive salaries, the lower class typically receive their pay based on hourly wages. Moreover, the chance of getting a raise is greater for the higher-ups. More benefits that the upper class enjoy over the working class are vacation time, flexible hours, retirement savings, and greater coverage of healthcare and insurance. === Benefits among gender === When it comes to workplace benefits such as health insurance coverage, pensions, sick leave, and disability plans, there are gender differences in whether or not these benefits are offered. Women are less likely to be offered pensions, health coverage and disability plans. In fact, high poverty rates among elderly women have been linked to lack of pension coverage. Additionally, many female heads of household remain on welfare because they cannot find jobs with adequate health insurance coverage. When it comes to union contracts, men are also twice as likely to be covered. This gender gap in benefits coverage may be due to the fact that women tend to have higher medical expenditures than males of the same age. As a result, some of the observed gap in wages between males and females in the United States could be the result of employers compensating for the higher cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. This further perpetuates gender discrimination because it means that firms who offer ESI (Employer Sponsored Insurance) will prefer to hire males. Another effect of women generally having greater healthcare expenses than men is that they are likely to place a higher value on insurance and be more inclined to pass up jobs for insurance-related reasons. This lowers the probability of obtaining jobs that pay higher wages directly and decrease a woman's bargaining power with her current employer. Indeed, health insurance has a larger (negative) effect on the job mobility of women, which they attribute to women's elevated healthcare expenses. === Wage gap among class === In the United States there is an unequal distribution of income between social classes for multiple reasons. Level of education has a great influence on average salaries. The higher the socioeconomic status (SES) of an individual the more likely they are to graduate from high school and potentially obtain a college degree, which in return increases their chances of a larger salary. The average salary of an individual with a high school diploma is about $35,000, but increases to about $60,000 by obtaining a bachelor's degree after. The gap in salary increases with each additional level of education received. Those in the lower class face more obstacles and have less opportunities to pursue additional education due to their lack of resources. The wage gap is even larger for individuals affected by poverty and racial barriers. Whites have a median income of about $71,000 while blacks have a median income of about $43,000. Statistics show that blacks make up 16% of public high school graduates, 14% of those enrolling in college, and only 9% of those receiving a bachelor's degree. At the same time, whites make up 59%, 58%, and 69%, respectively. That is a 61% difference between blacks not obtaining a bachelor's degree and whites graduating with one. Individuals in poverty already face a disadvantage in obtaining the same level of income as their upper class coworkers, but when also affected by racial barriers the chances of reaching the same income are even fewer. === Wage gap among gender === There is definitely intersectionality and inequality with women and men when it comes to wage gaps. Careers that pay well are often male dominated, and do not tolerate women and their personal needs. There has been a stable \\"pay gap\\" between men and women which has remained between 10-20% difference in their average earnings. (Women, careers and work life preferences). When discussing wage gaps between genders, scientists takes into account two questions, the first being \\"is there differential access jobs on the basis of gender?\\" and the second being, \\"is women‚Äôs work perceived to have less value than comparable work done by men?\\". When women begin to increase their numbers in certain job positions the status or value of the job decreases. Conceptualizing intersectionality through class, gender and race then identifying the barriers that create inequality in Work organizations is found in the idea of \\"inequality regimes\\". Workplaces are prominent locations to analyze the continuous efforts of inequalities because many societal inequality issues stem in such areas. In the works of Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations, inequality in gender, race, class are examined through intersectionality in organizations. Joane Acker discussed Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations in Sociologists for Women in Society Feminists Lecture through studies conducted using Swedish Bank. Studies have shown in the 1980s depict that wage gaps were increasing between genders. Men were being rewarded the higher paying positions such as local managers, and believed fair wages for men should be higher than fair wages for women. === Representation among class === Social class plays a large role on people's everyday life, yet their representation is not always fair. In television and popular culture, those who fall into the lower class are often portrayed differently based on if they are a woman or a man. If they are a woman, they often are portrayed as being more intelligent and responsible than their husbands, almost acting as their mothers. The male head of the household is typically portrayed as being less intelligent, with some redeeming qualities, but typically is not respected. Together they can be shown in a light that makes them seem lazy or dishonest. The upper class however, does not face these same issues with representation in the media. The man of the household takes on stereotypical male qualities, while the woman takes on stereotypical female qualities. The children in this upper class scenario are what provides entertainment value, rather than focusing on the unintelligent and unorganized adults as in the lower class model. Overall, in the upper-class family unit, they are portrayed as organized and put together, while the lower class model are portrayed as lazy and unorganized. === Representation among gender === In American society and many other societies around the world, being a largely represented group in a position of power means that one has succeeded in life. Whether one is a manager of a fast food restaurant or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, authority is power and power is advantage. But just like the widespread power struggle, there is a widespread equality struggle. One of the largest workplace and societal inequalities is the inequality between genders. A prime example of this is the wage gap. Women in 2016 earned, on average, 82 cents to a man's dollar. This unequal pay is part of the reason that many women are the ones to leave the workforce when it is determined that a stay- at-home parent is required; if women are contributing less to the household income, it will make less of an impact if they quit their jobs. Women are also not granted the same opportunities for employment as men. A clear example is the U.S. military. Women were banned from all combat roles until recently. In 2011, only 14 percent of the armed forces were female, and only 14 percent of officers were female. Another example is the U.S. congress. In 2015, 80 percent of the Senate was male, and only 20 was female. This numbers were similar for the House, at 80.6 percent male and 19.4 percent female. The gender composition of the military and the government, along with the wage gap, shines a lights on the gender inequality experienced right here at home, but this inequality is more greatly felt abroad. Some countries place strict limitations on women, not allowing them to vote or work or even drive a car. While the U.S. is seen as a country of dreams and opportunity, is far easier to see this when compared to an even more unequal country. The United States has been trending toward gender equality in recent years, but it has a while to go. === Research contributions === An article found in the November 1998 issue of Social Problems details the conflict involving racial domination by identifying the complexity African-Americans face. In many cases, sociologists and laypersons alike are often limited in their approach to the problem. Michelle Byng, in \\"Mediating Discrimination: Oppression among African-American Muslim Women\\"‚Äîthe 1998 article‚Äîbrings to focus new approaches to understanding discrimination, but also, she writes to illustrate the many overlooked opportunities in which the discriminated are able to empower themselves in certain situations. ==Intersectionality in court cases== There are countless numbers of court cases that examine intersectionality within the workforce that did not allow individuals to have equal opportunities because of their race, gender, and social class. The case, DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors, provides an example when the law does an injustice to those that face discrimination. Emma DeGraffenreid and four other black female production workers were laid off, and took it to court claiming that the company was violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because, \\"it perpetrated past discriminatory practices of not hiring Black females.\\" The court looked at each of the categories, race and gender, separately therefore they missed the discrimination of a person being both African-American and female. \\"It was argued, black women can expect little protection as long as approaches, such as that in DeGraffenreid, which completely obscure problems of intersectionality prevail.\\"Cousins, Oswald B. (November 10, 2017). \\"The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective\\". Another case, Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai'i, where intersectionality was the core reason behind the problem that emerged. Maivan Lam was not offered a job twice when she applied to be the Director of the Law School's Pacific Asian Legal Studies Program. Two times, the university was looking for a director and when the final offer came around, and she was the best candidate available, the university simply cancelled their search. In the first search, Professor Lam made it to the final round, but was not offered the job before the whole search was simply shut down. The second time, the position was offered to another candidate and the other candidate refused to accept, the search was simply cancelled without it being offered to Professor Lam. When Lam brought this situation up to the Dean, he suggested reopening the search so that male candidates who had not applied on time could submit their applications. It is stated, \\"Early in the 1989-90 academic year, the new appointments committee reviewed applications for a commercial law position. At one meeting, a male committee member stated that the Law School should not have two women teaching commercial law. This comment was reported to the Dean, who said that he recognized that the professor had difficulty dealing with women but took no action to remove him from the committee or otherwise to remedy the problem.\\".United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i, 1994, Maivan Lam, Plaintiff-appellant, v. University of Hawai'i; Albert Simone, in His Capacity Aspresident of the University of Hawai'i; Andjeremy Harrison, in His Capacity As Deanof the Richardson School Oflaw, Defendants-appellees, 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994) There was clear intersectionality as Professor Lam was not only arguing regards to race but also how her gender affected her position. In the case, Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Association, April 21, 1980, Dafro M. Jefferies claimed that her former employer failed to promote her to a higher position because of her race and sex. In 1967 she was employed by Harris County Community Action Association as a Secretary to the Director of Programs. She was later promoted to Personal Interviewer in 1970. Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction for her. However, between 1971 and April 1974, Jefferies applied for promotions in various positions and departments without any luck. She realized that her employer was discriminating against her when two Field Representative positions opened. Jefferies immediately applied. However, the positions were already staffed by a white female and black male the same day that she was told about the vacant position. The company had purposefully told her about the open positions knowing that they were already filled by other staff members. After several complaints to the company, on April 23, 1974 Jefferies was placed on probation. In June 1974, she was terminated from the job because she had called the company out for discriminating against her because of her race and sex. There was clear evidence of intersectionality in this case, she argued; She was not promoted to a higher position because she was both black and a female. However, the court ultimately disagreed with her, insofar as there existed zero concrete evidence to support her case. ==See also== *Black feminism *Intersectionality *Multiple jeopardy *Triple oppression == Further reading == * Collins, Patricia Hill.

It operates as a nonprofit self-owned corporation under private law, and receives significant state-funding. ==History== ===Foundation and early years (1942-1968)=== In 1942, the Sociedad de Amigos del Arte (Society of friends of art) was formed in the city of Valdivia. Aside from promoting culture, one of the society's main goals was to establish a university in the city. The idea of creating a university was presented to the national congress in the 1950s by the senator for Valdivia, Carlos Achar√°n P√©rez de Arce, who later succeeded in consolidating the project. In a meeting held on 16 February 1954 supporters of installing a university created a directory and proclaimed Eduardo Morales Miranda as president of it. The initial founding depended on donations from private persons including some industrial businessmen. After have been founded by decree on 7 September 1954 the university was inaugurated on 12 March 1955 by president Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. The inauguration was also attended by the rectors of the University of Chile and the States Technical University as well as the ambassadors of Venezuela and Argentina and representatives of the Netherlands, Germany and the United States. The first degree programmes to be taught at the university were fine arts, agronomy, forestry engineering and veterinary medicine, each of which had also its own faculty.Historia de la Universidad Austral de Chile Austral University of Chile On June 3 of 1968 UACh was granted autonomy from the University of Chile as law 16.848 was enacted. The autonomy did that UACh became allowed to decide its own plans and study programs and put the university out of the tutelage of the University of Chile. ===Development (1969-1999)=== Picture of one of the \\"A\\"-houses of Universidad Austral near Valdivia River in Isla Teja Campus During the military regime's privatization of higher education in the 1980s UACh incorporated the successor regional see of Universidad T√©cnica del Estado, the Instituto Profesional de Valdivia. By doing this, UACh prevented an offshoot university from being created there as it happened around the country with regional sees of major universities. With the incorporation of Instituto Profesional de Valdivia, that corresponds to present day 'Campus Miraflores, UACh started to grant bachelor degrees in engineering and got its Engineering Faculty. In 1993 the university held the Valdivia International Film Festival for the first time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its cinema Cine Club which has since then developed to one of the most important film festivals in Chile. ===Recent history (2000-present)=== With the arrival of Centro de Estudios Cient√≠ficos (CECS) to Valdivia in 2000 the city was further outlined as a research center, as CECS brought expertise on biophysics, molecular physiology, theoretical physics, glaciology and climate change to the city. The arrival of CECS was seen as positive by UACh's administration since CECS research do not overlap UACh's main research areas and, as a scientific research corporation, do not compete in student enrollment. However, in 2007 UACh and CECS got involved in a controversy when the Regional Council of Los Lagos Region granted regional funds that had been put into tender to CECS without attending to the meeting where UACh's and University of Los Lagos joint project was presented. Deputy Gabriel Ascencio (DC) accused Claudio Bunster, director of CECS, of using his personal influence among politicians and the Council of Innovation for Competitiveness (of which he is member of) to gain more resources. \\"http://www.lannacion.cl\\" La Naci√≥n On Monday 3 December 2007 the Emilio Pug√≠n building of the Faculty of Sciences caught fire. The building, located on Teja island Campus housed considerable amounts of chemicals and scientific equipment which could not be saved. Several research projects had to be halted or aborted due to loss of equipment, samples and data. Due to the spreading of toxic smoke the police had to evacuate a total of 10,000 people from Isla Teja. Firefighting companies from the neighboring cities of Osorno, La Uni√≥n and Paillaco had to come to assist to control and extinguish the fire. The building hosted the institutes of chemistry, physics, zoology, microbiology and botanics, including some laboratories. The cost of the damage was estimated at about 5000 million Chilean pesos (about 10 million US dollars).Incendio en Universidad Austral de Chile, El Naveghable Finally, 22% of the damage were not covered by the according insurances, but directly financed by the Chilean government. On May 13 of 2008 the student federation of UACh decided to go on strike since they considered that a request list sent to the university administration was answered in too loose terms.¬°A la calle!: a los estudiantes de la UACh se les acab√≥ la paciencia, El Naveghable The strike and occupation of the university by students ended in late June when the rector Victor Cubillos and the directory ceded on several points but was however still heavily criticized both from students and from sectors of the faculty where they considered that he had ceded too much to students. On April 2010 the reconstruction of the Emilio Pugin building of the Sciencie Faculty, started the competitive bidding. And in this year it would start the reconstruction. Cubillos won the 2010 election with 229 votes, 13 less than the prior election. the second term ended in June 2014. ==Campus== UACh main campus, Isla Teja Campus, occupies the whole northwest of Isla Teja in Valdivia. Campus Isla Teja is the home of UACh's administration, Cine Club, botanical garden and most faculties. The botanical garden is a recreational area as well as a place of study with a total of around 950 plant species growing in its 12 ha.Jard√≠n Bot√°nico . Revised on April 2, 2012. Most plants in the botanical garden belong to Valdivian temperate rain forest but there are others with exotic origins. The waters of Cau-Cau River that flows through the northern parts of the botanical garden allows a section of wetland plant species included in the garden. The engineering faculty operates in Campus Miraflores located along Valdivia River south of Valdivia's Plaza de Armas. A third campus exists in Puerto Montt where business administration, speech and language pathology and aquaculture are studied. UACh has apart from the campuses several properties spread through Los R√≠os and Los Lagos Region such as Parque Arboretum in northern Isla Teja, the Calfuco field station in the coast near Niebla and the forests of San Pablo de Tregua in the Andean foothills. ==Research== Faculty of UACh in the forests of San Pablo de Tregua UACh is one of the leading universities of Chile in matters of scientific research. It was ranked second only to the University of Chile in scientific research by El Mercurio and was the third university to receive most of government Mecesup research funds in 2008.Universidad Austral de Chile se adjudica 1.582 millones en el Concurso Mecesup 2008 Universia Some of the fields where UACh scientists have made contributions include: *Archaeology: In archeology university scientists Mario Pino and Tom Dillehay, led the excavations of at Monte Verde, one of the earliest archaeological sites in the Americas.

DLL is one of the few journals containing native Mapudungun literature and linguistic articles. == Museum network == Universidad Austral de Chile runs through its museology department several museums in Valdivia and southern Chile, including; UACh's Contemporary Art Museum, Philippi Museum on the 19th century exploration and settlement of southern Chile and Maurice van de Maele Museum on history and anthropology. The museology department has collections of indigenous artifacts including early indigenous ceramics as well as Mapuche silverwork and textiles. In addition to this there is a collection of objects from the early human settlement of Monte Verde. Other collections include 19th century clothing and toys and an extensive photographical archive dating back to 1850.Direcci√≥n Museol√≥gica UACh ==Rankings== Centro de Educaci√≥n continua building in downtown Valdivia In a 2011 university ranking of Quacquarelli Symonds the Austral University of Chile was ranked 30th among Latin American universities, 5th among Chilean universities and second among Chilean universities outside Santiago. In El Mercurio's 2006 ranking of the \\"Best Universities in the Country\\", UACh received the highest score in \\"teaching quality\\" of any Chilean university. The same article also listed UACh second only to Universidad de Chile in research quality, and ranked the Valdivia- based university third place overall among Chilean universities. As both universities that earned higher rankings are located in Santiago (U. de Chile and Pontifical Catholic University of Chile), UACh thus became the highest ranking university in Chile outside of the nation's capital.El Mercurio Ranking of Universities In the most recent Chilean university ranking released by Am√©ricaEconom√≠a magazine, released in 2009, UACh earned an overall ranking of 7th place, and 4th among universities outside Santiago.

It was originally created as a campus of the Technical State University. Three years later in 1964 it was denominated University College of Punta Arenas. In March 1981 it became the Magellan Professional Institute and finally on October 3 of the same year it acquired its actual formalization as University of Magallanes.

The Faculty of Engineering was one of the first to be created. The Faculty of Economics and Law was created in late 2002 as a result of academic reorganization of the former Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. More recently, the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Education and Social Sciences were created in May 2014, as a result of the reorganization of the former Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and Health.

The university has two campuses: the major one in Playa Ancha, Valpara√≠so, and the second one in San Felipe. The university seeks to train professionals with an ethical, humanistic, analytical, critical and creative profile, who can contribute to economic, cultural, social, regional and national development. The institution has a vast tradition in education and humanities areas, and it is deeply involved with the community of Valparaiso and San Felipe. ==History== The university was founded in 1948 as the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile with the intention to enhance the study of languages. === The Creation of the Pedagogical Institute (1948-1973) === Insignia of the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile The Pedagogical Institute of Valpara√≠so was founded in 1948, as the initiative of Oscar Guzm√°n Escobar, a lawyer and professor at the then Valpara√≠so Law School of the University of Chile, with the intention of promoting the study of Spanish and some foreign languages. It was initially located on Calle Col√≥n in Valpara√≠so, in the former campus of the current School of Law of the University of Valpara√≠so, currently the School of Social Work of the same University. It was supported in its initiative by the professors of Valpara√≠so Emilio Mu√±oz Mena, Juan Monted√≥nico Napoli and Pedro Contreras Valderrama, among others. In 1950, due to the quality of its activity, and after inspection by the members of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile, it received by Supreme Decree the status of State cooperator in education, its exams being valid and rendered before the official commissions designated by the Casa de Bello. The first courses taught by the then Institute were Pedagogy in Spanish, French and English, while in 1951 a Philosophy course was created and a year later the first School of Journalism in the country and a Women's Normal School were established. The University of Chile initially contributed with very outstanding professors from Santiago, such as H√©ctor Castillo, Ricardo Benavides, and Professor Cedomil Goic, among others, together with outstanding professors from the region such as Juan Monted√≥nico, Carlos Pantoja G√≥mez, and F√©lix Morales Pettorino, who formed a team that took advantage, together with teachers from the Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valpara√≠so and with people who had begun their professional training in Pedagogy, emerging as assistant professors. Due to the request of its director and the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile, Mr. Eugenio Pererira Salas, Decree No. 9,118 of October 13, 1954 was issued, on the basis of which the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile in Valpara√≠so was created, which began to function as such the following year. This document was signed by the President of the Republic, Mr. Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, and his Minister of Education, Mr. Tob√≠as Barros Ortiz. === The Military Dictatorship (1973-1990) === Memorial to students and teachers who were victims of the military dictatorship On September 11, 1973, a coup d'√©tat took place, to which, according to various accounts, the University did not offer resistance, being invaded by military assault around 12:15 by the \\"Maipo\\" 2nd Infantry Regiment, despite the fact that at that time there were already few students at the University (alerted by the situation in the country). The intervention led to massive arrests of students, academics and officials. In 1981 ‚Äîby decision of the military dictatorship‚Äî the Valpara√≠so branch of the University of Chile was separated from its main campus (located in the city of Santiago de Chile), creating the University of Valpara√≠so first. Two months later, in a second split, the Faculty of Education and Letters was transformed into the Instituto Profesional Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedag√≥gicas de Valpara√≠so (Professional Institute of the Higher Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Valpara√≠so). This transition meant the significant loss of its infrastructure and the allocation of a reduced state contribution (0.6% of the total direct fiscal contribution), in addition to other problems arising from the policies and definitions implemented by the authoritarian regime that affected academics, officials and students. Law 18,434 of 4 September 1985, created the Playa Ancha University, which succeeded the Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedag√≥gicas de Valpara√≠so and the University of Chile. === The UPLA nowadays (1990-present) === The return to democracy in 1990 brought with it the election of the first democratically elected rector by direct vote of academics, Professor Pedro Norman Cort√©s Larrieu being elected on that occasion. In 1991, its San Felipe campus began operating. On the other hand, there was an important development of the infrastructure: the Faculty of Arts is built in 1995, the adjacent lands to the central house are acquired, the FEUPLA is put in operation with Confech vote and the kindergarten \\"Colmenita\\" is built, with the purpose of providing room to university parents or employees of the University. With the advent of the year 2000, the changes continue to take place. The new building of Natural and Exact Sciences is inaugurated, as well as the Faculty of Social Sciences, which offers degrees in Sociology (2002), Psychology (2013), Journalism and Library Science. The performing arts hall (for students of Theatre) is created, being one of the best equipped in the whole region and moving the casino to a new location next to the Faculty of Arts. In 2008 the new University library is inaugurated and with it the SIBUPLA makes its debut, giving shape to one of the most equipped, spacious and modern libraries in the region. Towards 2013, the Faculty of Health and Engineering is created, acquiring the Independencia campus. In 2012 two multipurpose domes were acquired, one located in the Patio de los Vientos, next to the Faculty of Arts, and the other in the San Felipe Campus. In 2014 the Nursing laboratories were created, in 2012 the Center for Advanced Studies (CEA) and the Vice- Rector's Office for Research, Innovation and Postgraduate Studies were installed in Vi√±a del Mar. In October 2014, with 71.5% of the votes in a trystman plebiscite, the elimination of the Board of Directors and the creation of a University Senate, which represents the three estates, students, officials and academics, is approved. == Symbols == Punta Angeles Lighthouse, symbol of the Playa Ancha University === Emblem === The emblem of the Playa Ancha University is a lighthouse illuminating both sectors with a lone star leading the way (in reference to being at night). Its inspiration comes from the Punta √Ångeles Lighthouse, created in 1837 under the presidency of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto. This is located next to the University, as a symbol of being one of the pioneer houses of study in pedadogy at a national level, symbolized in the lighthouse, the most powerful in South America and in the \\"lighthouse effect\\" that symbolized having a university in Playa Ancha and not in the center of Valparaiso as the other houses of study did traditionally. ==Faculties and careers== Main Campusalt= Performing Arts Hall Faculty of Science and EngineeringTraslavi√±a Campus Punt√°ngeles Building Independencia Campus Institutional Building Library Gran Breta√±a Building The Playa Ancha University has 36 undergraduate degrees in Valparaiso (of which 3 are dual day and evening courses) and 6 in San Felipe.

In 2007 the construction of the new university library began, located near the most important buildings of the institution. The project includes an ambitious and modern service for more than ten thousand students, who will be able to access one of the most modern and complete libraries in the region. === Administration === During its existence, the Playa Ancha University has belonged to the University of Chile, depending directly on the Faculty of Humanities and Letters of Santiago; and, after the 1968 University Reform, to the Valpara√≠so branch of the Casa de Bello, both as an Area-Faculty of Humanities, at first, and later as a Faculty of Education and Letters. This determined that its superior authorities were named Director, and later, Dean. As a consequence of the 1981 University Reform, it became an independent entity, either as the Higher Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Valpara√≠so, or as the University of Playa Ancha. Here, its superior authority is called Rector. ==== Directors, Pedagogical Institute of Valpara√≠so - University of Chile ==== Oscar Guzm√°n Escobar (1948-1955) [Private] Milton Rossel Acu√±a (1955-1957) Juan Uribe Echevarr√≠a (1957-1961) Rodolfo Iturriaga Jamett (1961-1965) Carlos Pantoja G√≥mez (1965-1969) ==== Deans, Faculty of Humanities/Education and Literature.

It has several other campuses in the Valparaiso Region of Chile (Quinta Regi√≥n) and in Santiago, which is 100 km from Valparaiso. Taking its current name as an autonomous university on February 12, 1981, UV is heir to the most longstanding higher education tradition in Valparaiso and its region. As the major Pacific port south of San Francisco, Valparaiso was an important centre of business in the nineteenth century. Formal studies in law began there in 1878. By 1911, teaching had evolved into Chile‚Äôs first regional School of Law, part of the national University of Chile (UCH, which in turn can trace its origins back through two colonial universities to 1622, some 82 years after the Spanish began their colonisation of today‚Äôs central Chile). Two private universities would form in Valparaiso in the 1920s and 1930s‚Äîwhat would become Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a (UTFSM, or USM) and Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so (PUCV, or UCV)‚Äîas state-backed higher education was also consolidated under the aegis of the national Universidad de Chile system. In 1972, public university education in Valparaiso was organized as a Seat (Sede) of UCH; UV inherited all of this except for the Teaching Institute, which would eventually become the basis of the Universidad de Playa Ancha. On February 12, 1981 the University of Valparaiso adopted its present name and autonomous form. The creation of public regional universities was an important component of the economic reforms undertaken under the military rule that lasted until 1990. UV is one of sixteen members of the Consortium of State Universities of Chile. All of these took their more or less current structure following a decision to divide the Universidad de Chile and the State Technical University into autonomous entities. UV and all state universities are among the 25 members of Chile‚Äôs Council of University Rectors (‚ÄúCRUCH‚Äù); these 25 are often referred to as the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù universities, as opposed to the other ‚Äúnew private‚Äù universities. UV is also in the Grouping of Regional Universities of Chile, all of whose members are public and have been discussed (in English) together as public regional universities.Salazar, J. and Leihy, P.

It was written entirely in BASIC by a large team of people, starting with Russell Lane and then later enhanced by Tom Mack, Ken Goosens and others. It supported messaging conferences, questionnaires, doors (through the dropfile), and much more. ==History== In 1982, Larry Jordan of the Capital PC Users Group started modifying some existing BBS software that had been ported from CP/M by Russell Lane.RBBS-PC History The first major release of this effort, RBBS-PC CPC09, in May 1983 was written in interpreted BASIC and included the Xmodem file transfer protocol added by Jordan. In June 1983, Jordan turned over maintenance and enhancements to Tom Mack and Ken Goosens. The first release under Mack, version 10.0, was released July 4, 1983. New versions and features were released steadily throughout the rest of the 1980s. The final complete version, 17.4, was released March 22, 1992. Since version 17.4 at least four other code paths have developed. Some work has been done to unify the code paths and to develop version 18.0. Dan Drinnons CDOR Mods and Mapleleaf versions were further enhanced by Beta testers Mike Moore and Bob Manapeli using Ken Goosens LineBled program to manipulate the source code to endless variations of the program. ==Philosophy== From the beginning of RBBS-PC's development, the authors of the software had two goals as stated in the RBBS- PC documentation: * To show what could be done with the BASIC language and that \\"real programmers can/do program in BASIC.\\" * To open a new medium of communication where anyone with a personal computer the ability to communicate freely.

In that sense, \\"nonmonogamy\\" may be accurately applied to extramarital sex, group marriage, or polyamory. It is not synonymous with infidelity, since all parties are consenting to the relationship structure, partners are often committed to each other as well as to their other partners and cheating is still considered problematic behavior with many non-monogamous relationships. More specifically, \\"nonmonogamy\\" indicates forms of interpersonal relationship, intentionally undertaken, in which demands for exclusivity (of sexual interaction or emotional connection, for example) are attenuated or eliminated, and individuals may form multiple and simultaneous sexual and/or romantic bonds.Are you open to an alternative lifestyle? This stands in contrast to monogamy, yet may arise from the same psychology.978-0-415-80055-6 Barker, Langdridge. 2009. Understanding Non- Monogamies. Routledge == Terminology == Many terms for non-monogamous practices are vague, being based on criteria such as \\"relationship\\" or \\"love\\" that are themselves subjectively defined. There are forms of non-monogamy whose practitioners set themselves apart by qualifiers, such as \\"ethically non-monogamous\\" which intends a distancing from the deceit or subterfuge they perceive in common cheating and adultery. This usage creates distinctions beyond the definitions of the words. For example, though some relations might literally be both polygamous and polyamorous, polygamy usually signifies a codified form of multiple marriage, based on established religious teachings such as Plural marriage, a form of polygyny associated with the Latter Day Saint movement in the 19th-century and with present-day splinter groups from that faith, as well as evangelical sects that advocate Christian Plural Marriage. Polyamory is based on the preferences of the participants rather than social custom or established precedent. There is no one 'right' way to engage in non-monogamy (although there are widely agreed on 'wrong' ways). Because of this, the terms for the various kinds of relationships can be vague and sometimes interchangeable. but there are some distinctions that are worth defining. For example, swingers may intentionally avoid emotional and social connection to those‚Äîother than their primary partner‚Äîwith whom they have sex, so may or may not be polyamorous but are non-monogamous. Useful Terms: *Metamour or Meta‚Äîthe common term for a person with whom a partner is shared. *V-Structure‚Äîone person is equally involved with two partners. *Triads / Quads‚Äîthree or four participants make up the primary partnership. Forms of non-monogamy are many, a few being: *Casual relationship‚Äî Sometimes called friends with benefits, A primarily physical relationship between two people with low expectations of commitment or emotional labor. *Group sex and orgies ---sexual activities involving more than two participants at the same time. **Threesome‚Äîa primarily sexual arrangement involving three people. *Open relationship (incl. open marriage)‚Äîone or both members of a committed (or married) couple have the express freedom to become sexually active with others. *Polyamory‚Äîparticipants have multiple romantic partners **Group marriage‚Äîseveral people form a single familial unit, with each considered to be married to all other members. ***Line families‚Äîa form of group marriage intended to outlive its original members by ongoing addition of new spouses ***Poly families‚Äîsimilar to group marriage, but some members may not consider themselves married to all other members. **Hierarchical Polyamory---there is a primary romantic relationship with all other relationships being secondary to it. This structure is losing popularity as problems with couples' privilege arise. **Kitchen Table Polyamory---Metamours are expected to know one another and be comfortable in each others' company. **Parallel Polyamory--- Relationships between metas are kept separately. All may be aware of each other, but are not expected to be friends. *Polyfidelity‚Äîparticipants have multiple partners but restrict sexual activity to within a certain group. *Primary/secondary‚Äîthere is a main romantic relationship with all other relationships being second to it. *Polygamy‚Äîone person in a relationship has married multiple partners **Polyandry‚Äîa woman has multiple husbands **Polygyny‚Äîa man has multiple wives *Relationship anarchy‚Äîparticipants are not bound by set rules other than whatever is explicitly agreed upon by the people involved. Romantic relationships are not given more weight than platonic ones and metas have no power over each others' relationships. *Swinging‚Äîsimilar to open relationships, but conducted as an organized social activity, often involving some form of group sex. Some times simply trading partners with other swingers. == Public Health and Morality == The concepts of monogamy and marriage have been strongly intertwined for centuries, and in English-language dictionaries one is often used to define the other, as when \\"monogamy\\" is \\"being married to one person at a time.\\" A common antonym is polygamy, meaning to have more than one spouse at one time. As a result, monogamy is deeply entrenched within many religions, and in social regulations and law, and exceptions are condemned as incursions on both morality and public health. To some, the term non-monogamy semantically implies that monogamy is the norm, with other forms of relational intimacy being deviant and therefore somehow unhealthy or immoral. This concern over sexually transmitted diseases is despite the common practice of regular testing and sharing of recent test results prior to engaging in sexual activity. It is often assumed that people who participate in non-monogamous sexual relationships have a higher rate of STIs. Despite reporting a higher number of sexual partners, research suggests that the risk of transmitting STIs is no higher than they are among the monogamous population. This is because the non-monogamous community is more likely to be regularly tested and more open about their results. The stigma of receiving a positive result is diminished, resulting in better treatment options and fewer people who are unwittingly transmitting the disease because they were not told by the person who gave it to them. == Symbology == File:Polyamory woven.svgThe most commonly used symbol is the heart and infinty. It has been altered to reflect personalities and tastes of those who have adopted the symbol for their own. Several versions of the infinity-heart are now used to signify non-monogamy. File:RadicalRelationsHeart.svgBecause relationship anarchy (RA) is a relationship philosophy which draws its tenets from political anarchy, the main one being that all relationships (romantic and otherwise) shouldn‚Äôt be bound by any rules not agreed upon by the involved parties, the symbol for RA is the anarchist A in a heart. File:Polyamory Pride Flag.svgThe poly pride flag is, possibly, the first symbol created for the poly community and was created by Jim Evans and released into the public domain. The color blue represents the openness and honesty that is so prized among the poly community. Red is the color of love and passion, which is what drives so many people into polyamory in the first place. Black was chosen to represent solidarity with all others who have to hide their relationships due to social pressure. The symbol in the middle is a gold lowercase Greek letter called \\"pi\\" (œÄ), which translates just to \\"p\\" - as in the first letter of \\"polyamory\\". The gold color represents the value that poly people place on emotional attachment to others. File:Paarc.pngThe PAARC ribbon adapted the poly flag for use in the Polyamory Awareness and Acceptance Ribbon Campaign, taking a cue from all the other awareness campaigns use of folded ribbons. The intention was to create a virtual ribbon that could be placed on websites as a symbol of those who supported polyamory as a legitimate relationship choice, whether the website owner himself was polyamorous or not, in order to raise awareness. File:Love Outside The Box.svgA group of community leaders and organizers got together to coordinate awareness and organization efforts, and began calling themselves the Poly Leadership Network. One of the topics discussed was what kind of symbol to use for the group, and that led to a discussion about poly symbols in general. A brainstorming session resulted in two major symbols being created for the poly community. One of them was the \\"Love Outside The Box\\" symbol, which was intended to be more inclusive of all kinds of alternative love styles. The other was the purple mobius triangle seen below. File:Mobius-purple.jpgThe Purple Mobius. This symbol uses the point-down triangle shape in solidarity with all the other alternative sexuality communities and their various triangles of different colors. It is purple as both a nod to the LGBT community with their frequent use of purple, and to the poly community, which seemed to also favor the color purple. The triangle itself is made of a Mobius Strip to reference the infinity symbol, which is one kind of Mobius Strip. This symbol was released into the public domain and is free to use. The Purple Mobius has been seen added to other images for poly discussion group logos, poly bookclubs, and even cross-over groups like poly atheists. File:Swinger Symbol 05.pngThe Swing symbol used by the swinger community to identify each other in public. File:Non monogamy pride flag.pngUnlike the black of the polyamory flag above which represents those who must hide their relationships, the white of the non-monogamy flag represents the inevitable acceptance of society towards non-monogamous relationships and individuals. The light blue and pink are toned down versions of the red and blue of the first polyamory flag. File:Parrot polyamory mascot.gifThe Parrot Club Mascot was created in 1997 by Ray Dillinger for the public domain. The symbol was partly a play on the phrase \\"polly wanna cracker?\\" because of the habit of shortening \\"polyamory\\" to just \\"poly\\", and partly ironically because of the monogamous image of parrots. Many early poly discussion groups would place a stuffed parrot on the table in the restaurant or other venue, so that people attending the meeting would recognize them without drawing undue attention from the general public. ==See also== *Pla√ßage *Sexual revolution * Adultery * Family: the web series * Group sex * List of polyamorists * List of polyamorous characters in fiction * Polyday * Romantic orientation * Sociosexual orientation * The Four Loves (Book) ==References== Category:Sexual fidelity ","title":"Non-monogamy"},{"id":"1271796","text":"Lar Lubovitch (born April 9, 1943) is an American choreographer. He founded his own dance company, the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company in 1968. Based in New York City, the company has performed in all 50 American states as well as in more than 30 countries. As of 2005, he had choreographed more than 100 dances for the company. In addition to the company, Lubovitch has also done creative work in ballet, ice-skating venues, and musical theater, notably Into the Woods. He has played a key role in raising funds to fight AIDS. ==Early life and education== Born in Chicago, Lubovitch was educated at the University of Iowa and at New York City's Juilliard School, where he graduated in 1964. His teachers at Juilliard included Antony Tudor, Jos√© Lim√≥n, Anna Sokolow and Martha Graham. ==Career== Lubovitch danced in numerous modern, ballet, jazz and ethnic companies before forming the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company in 1968. His works are included in the repertories of companies throughout the world, including the New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Paris Opera Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project and Netherlands Dance Theater. His work is renowned for its musicality, rhapsodic style and sophisticated formal structures. His radiant, highly technical choreography and deeply humanistic voice have been acclaimed throughout the world. Lubovitch made his Broadway debut in 1987 with the musical staging for the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine musical, Into the Woods, for which he received a Tony Award nomination. In 1993 he choreographed the highly praised dance sequences for the Broadway show The Red Shoes. The final ballet from that show joined the repertories of American Ballet Theatre and the National Ballet of Canada. For his work on that show, he received the 1993-94 Astaire Award from the Theater Development Fund. Starting in 1995, the company began focusing on creating dances in New York and teaching throughout the world. A prolific choreographer, Lubovitch created three new dances during the 2004-05 season. The first, Love Stories, was a collaboration between the Lubovitch company and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago (it premiered in Chicago in March 2005), the second, Do You Be, was created solely with the Lubovitch company in honor of Meredith Monk and premiered in NYC in November 2004). The third, Elemental Brubeck, is a collaboration between the Lubovitch company and the San Francisco Ballet (premiered in Paris in July 2005). Also in 2005 the Lubovitch company collaborated with the Lim√≥n Dance Company in the creation of another new dance, and staged its annual New York City season at the 850-seat Skirball Center on Washington Square in November. In 1996 he created the musical staging (and two new dances) for the Tony-Award-winning Broadway revival of The King and I. Most recently he devised the musical staging for Walt Disney's stage version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame in Berlin. In 2004 he was honored with the Elan Award for his outstanding choreography. United States Artists named him a 2011 Fellow. Recent projects (as of 2005) have included: the Lubovitch company's world premiere of My Funny Valentine as part of the company's 2001 season in New York at City Center, and (the year before that) staging the world premiere of its acclaimed hit Men's Stories as part of the company's 2000 season in New York at the Orensanz Center for the Arts. Recent projects also include the creation of a full-evening-length (3-act) ballet composed by Elliot Goldenthal based on Othello in an unprecedented collaboration between the Lubovitch company and American Ballet Theatre and San Francisco Ballet. Othello was broadcast nationwide on PBS's Great Performances and nominated for an Emmy Award for its music. In addition to his work for stage, screen and television, Lubovitch has also made a notable contribution to the advancement of choreography in the field of ice dancing. He has created dances for Olympic gold medalists John Curry, Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill and has choreographed a full-length ice-dancing version of The Sleeping Beauty, starring Olympic medalists Robin Cousins and Rosalynn Sumners. The ballet was broadcast throughout Great Britain and America. He also choreographed a TV project with Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay, who won the silver medal for France at the 1992 Olympics. The show, based on The Planets by Gustav Holst, was broadcast by the A&E; television network in June 1995 and was nominated for an International Emmy Award, a Cable ACE Award and a Grammy Award. Most recently he created two new ice dances for Paul Wylie, a duet for Ren√©e Roca and Gorsha Sur, and an ensemble piece for the Ice Theatre of New York. ==Significant works== *Cavalcade (1980), score by Steve Reich *A Brahms Symphony (1985), marked Lubovitch's return to early composersBremser, Martha.

It is the longest in the country with a length of nearly , and it is considered the second most important. It crosses 12 Brazilian states: Rio Grande do Norte, Para√≠ba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia, Esp√≠rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. It also connects more state capitals than any other \\"rodovia\\" (highway) in the country. In total, 12 capitals are directly connected by BR-101.

The chloroalkane class (alkanes with one or more hydrogens substituted by chlorine) provides common examples. The wide structural variety and divergent chemical properties of organochlorides lead to a broad range of names and applications. Organochlorides are very useful compounds in many applications, but some are of profound environmental concern. ==Physical and chemical properties== Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways. The compounds are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen. Aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group. ==Natural occurrence== Many organochlorine compounds have been isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds are found in nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins have been found in the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.Public Health Statement - Chloromethane, Centers for Disease Control, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry The natural organochloride epibatidine, an alkaloid isolated from tree frogs, has potent analgesic effects and has stimulated research into new pain medication. However, because of its unacceptable therapeutic index, it is no longer being researched for potential therapeutic uses. The frogs obtain epibatidine through their diet and then sequester it on their skin. Likely dietary sources are beetles, ants, mites, and flies. ==Preparation== ===From chlorine=== Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be chlorinated under free radical conditions, with UV light. However, the extent of chlorination is difficult to control. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chloroform was formerly produced thus. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. ===Reaction with hydrogen chloride=== Alkenes react with hydrogen chloride (HCl) to give alkyl chlorides. For example, the industrial production of chloroethane proceeds by the reaction of ethylene with HCl: :H2C=CH2 \\\\+ HCl -> CH3CH2Cl In oxychlorination, hydrogen chloride instead of the more expensive chlorine for the same purpose: :CH2=CH2 \\\\+ 2 HCl + O2 ‚Üí ClCH2CH2Cl + H2O. Secondary and tertiary alcohols react with hydrogen chloride to give the corresponding chlorides. In the laboratory, the related reaction involving zinc chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid: : {R-OH} + HCl ->[\\\\ce{ZnCl2}][\\\\Delta] \\\\overset{alkyl\\\\ halide}{R-Cl} + H2O Called the Lucas reagent, this mixture was once used in qualitative organic analysis for classifying alcohols. ===Other chlorinating agents=== Alkyl chlorides are most easily prepared by treating alcohols with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5), but also commonly with sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) and phosphorus trichloride (PCl3): :ROH + SOCl2 -> RCl + SO2 \\\\+ HCl :3 ROH + PCl3 -> 3 RCl + H3PO3 :ROH + PCl5 -> RCl + POCl3 \\\\+ HCl In the laboratory, thionyl chloride is especially convenient, because the byproducts are gaseous. Alternatively, the Appel reaction can be used: :250px ==Reactions== Alkyl chlorides are versatile building blocks in organic chemistry. While alkyl bromides and iodides are more reactive, alkyl chlorides tend to be less expensive and more readily available. Alkyl chlorides readily undergo attack by nucleophiles. Heating alkyl halides with sodium hydroxide or water gives alcohols. Reaction with alkoxides or aroxides give ethers in the Williamson ether synthesis; reaction with thiols give thioethers. Alkyl chlorides readily react with amines to give substituted amines. Alkyl chlorides are substituted by softer halides such as the iodide in the Finkelstein reaction. Reaction with other pseudohalides such as azide, cyanide, and thiocyanate are possible as well. In the presence of a strong base, alkyl chlorides undergo dehydrohalogenation to give alkenes or alkynes. Alkyl chlorides react with magnesium to give Grignard reagents, transforming an electrophilic compound into a nucleophilic compound. The Wurtz reaction reductively couples two alkyl halides to couple with sodium. ==Applications== ===Vinyl chloride=== The largest application of organochlorine chemistry is the production of vinyl chloride. The annual production in 1985 was around 13 billion kilograms, almost all of which was converted into polyvinylchloride (PVC). ===Chloromethanes=== Most low molecular weight chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethene, and trichloroethane are useful solvents. These solvents tend to be relatively non-polar; they are therefore immiscible with water and effective in cleaning applications such as degreasing and dry cleaning. Several billion kilograms of chlorinated methanes are produced annually, mainly by chlorination of methane: :CH4 \\\\+ x Cl2 ‚Üí CH4‚àíxClx \\\\+ x HCl The most important is dichloromethane, which is mainly used as a solvent. Chloromethane is a precursor to chlorosilanes and silicones. Historically significant, but smaller in scale is chloroform, mainly a precursor to chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2) and tetrafluoroethene which is used in the manufacture of Teflon. ===Pesticides=== The two main groups of organochlorine insecticides are the DDT-type compounds and the chlorinated alicyclics. Their mechanism of action differs slightly. *The DDT like compounds work on the peripheral nervous system. At the axon's sodium channel, they prevent gate closure after activation and membrane depolarization. Sodium ions leak through the nerve membrane and create a destabilizing negative \\"afterpotential\\" with hyperexcitability of the nerve. This leakage causes repeated discharges in the neuron either spontaneously or after a single stimulus. *Chlorinated cyclodienes include aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, chlordane and endosulfan. A 2- to 8-hour exposure leads to depressed central nervous system (CNS) activity, followed by hyperexcitability, tremors, and then seizures. The mechanism of action is the insecticide binding at the GABAA site in the gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) chloride ionophore complex, which inhibits chloride flow into the nerve. *Other examples include dicofol, mirex, kepone, and pentachlorophenol. These can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic, depending on their molecular structure.Robert L. Metcalf \\"Insect Control\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Wienheim, 2002. ===Insulators=== Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were once commonly used electrical insulators and heat transfer agents. Their use has generally been phased out due to health concerns. PCBs were replaced by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which bring similar toxicity and bioaccumulation concerns. ==Toxicity== Some types of organochlorides have significant toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is burned in the presence of chlorine, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment, as are some insecticides (such as DDT). For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid-20th century, also accumulates in food chains, as do its metabolites DDE and DDD, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. DDT also posed further issues to the environment as it is extremely mobile, traces even being found in Antarctica despite the chemical never being used there. Some organochlorine compounds, such as sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, and Lewisite, are even used as chemical weapons due to their toxicity. However, the presence of chlorine in an organic compound does not ensure toxicity. Some organochlorides are considered safe enough for consumption in foods and medicines. For example, peas and broad beans contain the natural chlorinated plant hormone 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid (4-Cl-IAA); and the sweetener sucralose (Splenda) is widely used in diet products. , at least 165 organochlorides had been approved worldwide for use as pharmaceutical drugs, including the natural antibiotic vancomycin, the antihistamine loratadine (Claritin), the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft), the anti-epileptic lamotrigine (Lamictal), and the inhalation anesthetic isoflurane.MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR), Elsevier MDL, version 2004.2 Rachel Carson brought the issue of DDT pesticide toxicity to public awareness with her 1962 book Silent Spring. While many countries have phased out the use of some types of organochlorides such as the US ban on DDT, persistent DDT, PCBs, and other organochloride residues continue to be found in humans and mammals across the planet many years after production and use have been limited. In Arctic areas, particularly high levels are found in marine mammals. These chemicals concentrate in mammals, and are even found in human breast milk. In some species of marine mammals, particularly those that produce milk with a high fat content, males typically have far higher levels, as females reduce their concentration by transfer to their offspring through lactation.Marine Mammal Medicine, 2001, Dierauf & Gulland == See also == * Organic halide == References == ==External links== *\\"Formation of Chlorinated Hydrocarbons in Weathering Plant Material\\" article at SLAC website *\\"The oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons\\" article from The Institute for Green Oxidation Chemistry at the Carnegie Mellon University website ","title":"Organochloride"},{"id":"1271817","text":"Christopher Gillis (February 26, 1951 in Montreal - August 7, 1993 in New York City) was an important gay male dancer and choreographer and member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company. == Early life and career == Born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of the late Gene Gillis, a US Olympic skier, and Rhona Wurtele, a Canadian Olympic skier who competed in the 1948 Winter Olympics along with her twin sister Rhoda.

It broadcasts a talk radio format and is owned by Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. (Patrick is not related to sports radio and TV host Dan Patrick.) The studios and offices are on Katy Freeway in Houston.KSEVradio.com/contact-us The transmitter is off FM 2978 in Magnolia, Texas.Radio-Locator.com/KSEV AM 700 is a clear-channel frequency reserved for WLW in Cincinnati, a Class A, 50,000 watt station. While KSEV operates with 15,000 watts by day, it must reduce power at night to 1,000 watts to avoid interference. There are only eleven other stations in the United States which broadcast on 700 kHz. ==Programming== On weekdays, KSEV features local hosts in morning and afternoon drive times, with paid brokered programming in middays and syndicated conservative talk shows heard the rest of the day. Hosts include Laura Ingraham, Michael Savage, Ben Shapiro, Joe Walsh, Dana Loesch, Red Eye Radio and First Light. On weekends, KSEV carries programs about money, health, real estate, cars and gardening, some of which are brokered programming. Most hours begin with world and national news from Townhall Radio. The station's primary competitors are two well established talk stations, both owned by iHeartMedia, AM 740 KTRH and AM 950 KPRC, as well as Salem Media talk radio outlet AM 1070 KNTH. ==History== On December 1, 1986, the station first signed on as KTBT.Broadcasting Yearbook 1988 page B-283 It was owned by Duncan Broadcasting and aired a middle of the road (MOR) music format. At first, the power was 2,500 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. Howard Sellers acquired the station in September 1989. He kept the format as MOR.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-313 Sellers sold the station the following month. In October 1989, the station changed owners again, as Sunbelt Broadcasting bought the station for only $47,164.Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page B-333 Sunbelt's president and owner was Dan Patrick, who was already hosting a show on KTBT. Previously, Patrick had served as sports director for KHOU Channel 11 in Houston. Sunbelt changed the call sign to KSEV and switched the format to conservative talk. The station became an NBC Radio Network affiliate and also got a boost in power to 25,000 watts in the daytime, 1,000 watts at night. Patrick wore several hats as owner, general manager and morning drive sports talk host in the early years of KSEV. Also in 1989, KSEV acquired the Houston-area rights to run the nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show, while Limbaugh was relatively unknown. (Limbaugh later switched to 740 KTRH, owned by iHeartMedia, which also syndicates Limbaugh's show.) In April that year, Los Angeles Kings hockey games were aired; it ended in June 1993. Dallas Stars took over in the fall that year. By 1990, along with Limbaugh and Patrick, KSEV had a lineup of local hosts which included Roger Gray, Jerry Trupiano and former Houston Chronicle sportswriter Ed Fowler. Bob Hallmark was program director and Rod Evans served as news director. In 1995, KSEV was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-454 The format remained talk and Patrick stayed on as vice president and general manager. The station changed hands again in 2001, as Clear Channel sold KSEV to Liberman Broadcasting, based in Southern California.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2002-2003 page D-456 Even though Lieberman usually programs Spanish-language formats, KSEV remained a conservative talk station in English. Patrick remained KSEV's vice president, running the station through a local marketing agreement (LMA).

It is chronologically the earliest case in Sherlock Holmes canon. This story is related mainly by Holmes rather than Watson, and is the first case to which Holmes applied his powers of deduction, having treated it as a mere hobby until this time. This is one of the two Sherlock Holmes stories in which a protagonist is haunted by an old acquaintance for an old crime. The other is \\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\". It is also one of his many stories that deal with the fate of characters who return to England after having spent time abroad in the colonies of the British Empire. \\"The Cesspool of Empire: Sherlock Holmes and the Return of the Repressed,\\" Victorian Literature and Culture, 34.1: March 2006 , pp. 233-247. ==Synopsis== In his university days, Holmes spent a month with his friend, Victor Trevor, at Victor's father's estate in Norfolk. While there, Holmes amazed his host, Victor's father, who was a Justice of the Peace and a landowner. He had made his fortune in the goldfields in Australia. One of Holmes's deductions was that the elder Mr. Trevor was once connected with someone with the initials \\"J. A.\\" whom he wanted to forget. His host then passed out on the table. Holmes had touched a sore spot, and possibly did not believe the old man's explanation once he had come back to himself that J. A. had been an old lover. Holmes perceived that he was making his host uncomfortable and decided to take his leave. The evening before he did this, another old man suddenly appeared at the house causing the elder Mr. Trevor to rush for a shot of brandy before greeting him. They had apparently been shipmates some 30 years earlier, and Mr. Trevor said something about finding him some work. Soon afterwards, Holmes and his friend found Mr. Trevor drunk. Holmes then left the Trevor estate and spent the next seven weeks at his chemistry experiments, suddenly receiving a telegram from the younger Trevor begging him to come back to Norfolk. Once he got there, Victor told Holmes that his father was dying as a result of a stroke suffered after he received a letter. They found that he had died while Victor had been meeting Holmes at the station. After Holmes had left the house seven weeks earlier, it seems that this old man who had come looking for work, and whose name was Hudson, proved to be as unruly an employee as could be imagined. He had demanded to be promoted from gardener to butler and had got what he wanted. He had taken unforgivable liberties which would normally have resulted in an employee's dismissal. He was often drunk. Victor could not stand him and would have beaten Hudson up if he had been younger. The other staff had complained about him. However, Victor's father always let him get away with any infamy. Suddenly, Hudson announced that he was leaving because he had tired of Norfolk, and he was going to Hampshire to see Beddoes, another old shipmate. Now, Holmes's friend had become thin and careworn by the ordeal. He had thought that the trouble was over when Hudson had left, but then came the letter, from Fordingbridge in Hampshire. It read: :\\"The supply of game for London is going steadily up. Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen pheasant's life.\\" It meant nothing to Victor, and it was quite a while before Holmes saw anything in it. He found the key. If one read every third word beginning with the first, there was an intelligible message: \\"The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.\\" Holmes had deduced that the game was blackmail. Some guilty secret had been the power that Hudson had held over the elder Mr. Trevor. The old man's dying words to his doctor unlocked the secret. Some papers were found in Mr. Trevor's Japanese cabinet. The document was a confession. The elder Mr. Trevor had once borne the name James Armitage (initials: J. A.) and had been a criminal having embezzled money from the bank where he worked and been caught. He was sentenced to transportation. Once on the ship, the Gloria Scott, bound for Australia from Falmouth, Armitage found out from a neighbouring prisoner that there was a conspiracy to take over the ship. The neighbour, Jack Prendergast, had financed the scheme out of the nearly ¬£250,000 in unrecovered money from his crime. Many of the crew, even officers, were in his employ, and even the chaplain Wilson, who was not truly a clergyman at all. Wilson, while pretending to minister to the prisoners, was actually furnishing them with pistols and other equipment to be used when the time was right. Armitage also drew his other neighbour, Evans, into the scheme. As might be expected, all did not go as planned. The takeover was accomplished unexpectedly when the ship's doctor discovered a pistol while treating a prisoner. The prisoners then had to make their move right away or they would lose the element of surprise. In the ensuing m√™l√©e, the Captain and many other men were killed, and there arose a dispute between Prendergast with his supporters and a group including Armitage over what to do with the few loyal crewmen still left alive. Armitage and others would not stand for coldblooded murder. They were cast adrift in a small boat to make their way as they would. Shortly after leaving in their small boat, the Gloria Scott blew up as the result of the violence spreading to where the gunpowder was kept. The men in the small boat, among whom was also Evans, hurried back to the site and rescued one survivor‚ÄîHudson. The next day, as luck would have it, the men were rescued by another ship, the Hotspur, also bound for Australia. They passed themselves off as survivors from a passenger ship and once in Australia, headed for the goldfields. Armitage changed his name to Trevor, and Evans changed his name to Beddoes. Both later returned to England as rich men. All had gone well until Hudson had suddenly shown up. Since no scandal involving the Gloria Scott ever followed the odd message from Beddoes (Evans), and since neither Hudson nor Evans was ever heard from again, the Police believed Hudson had done away with Beddoes while Holmes believed that Evans had likely killed Hudson, believing that he had told all, when in fact he had not, and then fled with as much money as he could lay his hands on. The case is referenced by Holmes once more in \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\\" when Holmes consults an index of his past exploits for references to \\"vampires\\" and remarks on \\"the Voyage of the Gloria Scott\\" listed under \\"V\\". It is also mentioned in passing in \\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\" as Holmes recounts to Watson his early cases when he first became a detective. ==Discrepancy== The confession account contained a scribbled footnote from the elder Trevor that recorded the fatal note delivered to him. This contradicts the stated fact that Trevor never regained consciousness until the very end of his life, at which time he merely revealed where the confession lay. According to Trevor's confession the Gloria Scott left Falmouth \\"thirty years ago\\" and precisely in 1855, but that would set Holmes's enquiry in 1885 and not in his college years, as he told Watson. Since further in the story the elder Trevor writes also: \\"For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives\\", we can assume that the exact date is around 1875, that would fit Holmes's reference to his college years. It is also possible that the \\"thirty years\\" was a rounding of twenty-five years, which would place the case in 1880. ==Publication history== The story was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 15 April 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the Strand in May 1893.Smith (2014), p. 84. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine.Cawthorne (2011), p. 80. It was included in the short story collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK in December 1893 and in the US in February 1894.Cawthorne (2011), p. 75. ==Adaptations== ===Film and television=== The story was adapted as a 1923 short film for the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. The 1954‚Äì1955 Sherlock Holmes television series starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and H. Marion Crawford as Watson loosely adapted the story for its episode \\"The Case of the Blind Man's Bluff\\", changing the name of the ship to the \\"Gloria North\\". It retains elements from the story, such as a respectable character with a tattoo he has tried to erase but which Holmes observes anyway (in the episode, the tattoo was the initials \\"G.N.\\" for \\"Gloria North\\" rather than \\"J.A.\\").\\"The Adventure of the Blind Man's Bluff (1954)\\". Full episode on YouTube. The episode was later remade, retaining the plot structure and much of the dialogue, for the 1980 American-Polish series Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson starring Geoffrey Whitehead, which was also produced by Sheldon Reynolds.\\"The Adventure of the Blind Man's Bluff (1980)\\". Full episode on YouTube. \\"The Gloria Scott\\" was a 2001 episode of the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, in which the titular prison ship was a spacecraft en route to the Moon. In the 2014 episode \\"The Empty Hearse\\", the first episode of the third series of the BBC television series Sherlock, Dr. Watson's fiancee, Mary Morstan, solves a coded text message on a cellphone by reading every third word. In the fourth series episode \\"The Final Problem\\" in 2017, it is revealed that Holmes had a childhood friend named Victor Trevor. ===Radio=== Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the US radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The episode aired on 21 January 1932.Dickerson (2019), p. 41. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 14 April 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson)Dickerson (2019), p. 64. and 1 October 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 76. Meiser also adapted the story for the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for an episode with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, which aired on 28 December 1941.Dickerson (2019), p. 104. The story was adapted as an episode of the US radio series CBS Radio Mystery Theater titled \\"The Gloria Scott\\". The episode, which starred Kevin McCarthy as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson, first aired in November 1977. \\"The Gloria Scott\\" was dramatised by Vincent McInerney for BBC Radio 4 in 1992, as part of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Simon Treves as Victor and Terence Edmond as Trevor. A 2008 episode of the US Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. ===Print=== In 2005, Croatian writer Mima Simiƒá published a short story collection entitled Pustolovine Glorije Scott (Adventures of Gloria Scott). This rather free adaptation introduces a queer parody of the Sherlock Holmes canon through the gender reversal of the protagonists: disastrous detective Gloria Scott and her faithful assistant Mary Lambert. A TV animation series based in this adaptation is under development as of 2014. The 2016 book The Murder of Mary Russell by Laurie R. King is based on the premise that Gloria Scotts Hudson is none other than the father of Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * ==External links== * Gloria Scott, The Adventure of the Category:1893 short stories Category:Works originally published in The Strand Magazine ","title":"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott"},{"id":"1271858","text":"==Peerage of England== rowspan=2Earl of Cornwall (1068)Robert, Count of Mortain10681095Died - William Fitz-Robert, 2nd Earl of Cornwall10951106 - Earl of Dorset (1070)Osmund, Count of Seez10701099Died - Earl of Chester (1071)Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester10711101 - rowspan=3Earl of Shrewsbury (1074)Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury10741094Died - Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury10941098Died - Robert of Bell√™me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury10981102 - Earl of Northampton (1080)Simon I de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton10801109 - rowspan=2Earl of Albemarle (1081)Adelaide, 1st Countess of Albemarle10811090Died - Stephen de Blois, 2nd Earl of Albemarle10901127 - rowspan=2Earl of Surrey (1088)William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey10881099Died - William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey10991138 - Earl of Warwick (1088)Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick10881119 - Earl of Gloucester (1093)William Fitzeustace, 1st Earl of Gloucester10931094New creation; Died - Earl of Buckingham (1097)Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham10971102New creation ==Peerage of Scotland== Mormaer of FifeCausant√≠n, Earl of Fifec. 10951128 - Mormaer of MearnsM√°el Petair of Mearns  fl. 1094 ==References== * Category:Lists of peers by decade Category:1090s in England Category:11th century in Scotland Category:11th-century mormaers Peers ","title":"List of peers 1090‚Äì1099"},{"id":"1271862","text":"clipper ship card In opera or commedia dell'arte, a prima donna (; plural: prime donne; Italian for \\"first lady\\") is the leading female singer in the company, the person to whom the prime roles would be given. Prime donne often had grand off-stage personalities and were seen as demanding of their colleagues. From its original usage in opera, the term has spread in contemporary usage to refer to anyone behaving in a demanding or temperamental fashion or having an inflated view of oneself and a narcissistic attitude. The prima donna in opera was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (usually a castrato in the 17th and 18th centuries, later a tenor) is primo uomo.H. Rosenthal, H. and J. Warrack, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press, 1979. p. 398. ==Opera== Nita Carritte, Prima Donna, Carl Rosa Opera Company, 1895 In 19th-century Italy, the leading woman in an opera or Commedia dell'arte company was known as the prima donna, literally the \\"first lady\\". This woman, usually the principal soprano of the company, would typically perform leading roles and generally sang more music than other women in the company. Famous opera prime donne have often caused opera enthusiasts to divide into opposing \\"clubs\\" supporting one singer over another. The rivalry between the fans of Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi, for example, was one of the most famous, despite the friendship of the two singers.See for example, George Jellinek, Callas: Portrait of a Prima Donna, Dover, 1986, p. 96 and passim. . The designation prima donna assoluta (absolute first lady) is occasionally applied to a prima donna of outstanding excellence.Oxford English Dictionary (Draft revision 2009). It has also been used to describe the creators of heroic coloratura roles in the first half of the 19th century.Riggs, Geoffrey (2003). The Assoluta Voice in Opera, 1797‚Äì1847, p. 1. McFarland. . The female who sang the second major part in an opera was, correspondingly, referred to as the seconda donna; by the late 18th century, this role was sometimes called the altra prima donna.Seconda donna. Oxford Music Online, 2002. ==Personality== At times, these prime donne (the Italian plural form) were grand with their off-stage personalities and demands on fellow troupe members, musicians, set and wardrobe designers, producers and other staff, but were deferentially tolerated because of their consummate talent and their draw at the box office. From this experience, the term prima donna has come into common usage in any field denoting someone who behaves in a demanding, often temperamental fashion, revealing an inflated view of themselves, their talent, and their importance.Susan Rutherford, The Prima Donna and Opera, 1815‚Äì1930, Cambridge University Press, 2006. . Due to this association, the contemporary meaning of the word has taken on this negative connotation of a vain, undisciplined, egotistical, obnoxious or temperamental person who finds it difficult to work under direction or as part of a team, but whose contributions are essential to the success of a team.The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English (2009). \\"prima donna\\".

It is based on a three-part language question asked about all household members who are five years old or older. The first part asks if the person speaks a language other than English at home. If the answer is 'yes,' the respondent is asked what that language is. The third part of the question asks how well the person speaks English (\\"Very well,' \\"Well,\\" \\"not well,\\" \\"Not at all\\").

In 2000 and 1990, language spoken was a part of Summary File 3. For the 2000 census, data was published for 30 languages, chosen for their nationwide distribution, and 10 language groupings (see list below). Data from households which report languages other than the 30 are reported under the language groupings. Thus, languages which are widespread in certain areas of the country but not nationally get put together, even in block level data. Lithuanian, and Welsh are simply \\"Other Indo-European languages,\\" Yoruba and Swahili are simply \\"African languages,\\" and Indonesian and Hakka are simply \\"Other Asian languages.\\" Several locally very well represented languages, such as Punjabi and Pennsylvania German, are collated into smaller groupings. Native North American languages besides Navajo are also collated, though they are reported on several geographic levels in another data set. For the 2009-2013 ACS data, detailed information was provided on over 300 languages. In addition to the number of speakers reported for each language, the count of speakers whose English speaking ability is less than \\"very well\\" is also reported. Updated information is available via the Census Bureau's American Fact-finder. == Data usage == Statistics on English-speaking ability and language spoken at home are used by the Justice Department in the implementation of the Voting Rights Act and to allocate funds for to schools for programs for English Language Learners. Federal and local governments, as well as non-governmental and private interests also use these statistics. == Languages and language groupings == { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%; border: 1px solid #999; float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 240px; text- align: right;\\" - f5f5f5; text-align: center;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Language Spoken at Home (U.S. Census 2000) Summary -  English only  82.105% -  Spanish  10.710% -  Chinese (all varieties of Chinese incl.)  0.78% -  French (incl.

It was signed on 25 March 1957 at the same time as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC Treaty). The Euratom Treaty is less well known because of the lower profile of the organisation that it founded. The EEC has evolved into what is now the European Union, but Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957 although it is governed by the institutions of the European Union. It was established with its own independent institutions, but the 1967 Merger Treaty merged the institutions of Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community with those of the EEC. The Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment because of later sensitivity surrounding nuclear power in European public opinion. That has caused some to argue that it has become too outdated, particularly in the areas of democratic oversight. It was not included as part of the (unratified) Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which sought to combine all previous treaties, over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it.

In 1919, some 80 independent associations throughout the British Isles, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and the United States joined into the British-Israel-World Federation. The main patron of this movement was Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone. She attended the federation's first Congress in July 1920, and remained a patron of the BIWF until her death in 1981. One of its founders was Reuben H. Sawyer, a clergyman in Portland Oregon where he was involved in setting up an Anglo-Israelism group and as leader of the Oregon Ku Klux Klan. He spoke to the Federation's first conference in 1920. Sawyer's supremacist views were influential in the development of the anti-semitic Christian Identity movement out of the philo-semitic British Israelism. William Pascoe Goard was involved in early negotiations of developing the BIWF, and became vice president of the organization in 1921. In 1922, Goard founded Covenant Publishing, the BIWF's publishing company. He also became the first editor of The National Message. The National Message was published until 1981. The federation now publishes The Covenant Nations magazine. From 1924, the organization maintained an office next to Buckingham Palace. In 1990, it moved to Putney on the Thames, but since 2003 has been based near Bishop Auckland in Co Durham. ==Beliefs== British Israelism (also called Anglo-Israelism) states that people of Western Europe descent, particularly those in Great Britain, are the direct lineal descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

A moderate Republican, she served four two-year terms in the post. To date, Sheldon remains the city's last Republican mayor. ==Education== Sheldon earned a Bachelor of Science in education from Eastern Michigan University and a master's in education from the University of Michigan. Sheldon then worked as a sixth grade teacher for three years. == Career == Sheldon became involved in city government during these years, and first ran for elective office in 1988, when she was elected to the city council as a Republican. Four years later, Sheldon ran for mayor against incumbent Democrat, Liz Brater. The campaign was seen as one of Ann Arbor's more divisive mayoral contests of recent years. Sheldon defeated Brater in the April 5, 1993 election. Sheldon won reelection over Democratic challenger David F. Stead in November 1994. In Sheldon's reelection campaigns of 1996 and 1998, she won narrowly against Ann Arbor city councilman, Chris Kolb. Sheldon left office in 2000 when she elected not to run for re-election, and was succeeded by Democrat John Hieftje. As a Republican mayor in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, and facing large Democratic majorities on the city council throughout her tenure, Sheldon took a moderate approach to governance. Like many Michigan Republicans from Ann Arbor, she was a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. During her years as mayor, Sheldon served on the board of the Michigan Association of Mayors, and served as president of the Michigan Municipal League. She chaired the league's Let Local Votes Count campaign, an attempt in 2000 to pass a state initiative that would limit the state government's ability to overturn local municipalities' ordinances. Since leaving office, Sheldon has been involved with a number of local nonprofit organizations, including the Ann Arbor Summer Festival and the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre. Sheldon discusses her childhood and experiences as mayor in an essay in the book Ann Arbor (W)rites: A Community Memoir. Sheldon remains an active member of the Ann Arbor community, and works as a bookkeeper at a tennis club. == Personal life == Sheldon's husband, Cliff Sheldon, served as a member of the Ann Arbor city council from 1978 to 1982.

It focused on legal issues, primarily on securing women's right to vote. The term first-wave feminism itself was coined by journalist Martha Lear in a New York Times Magazine article in March 1968 entitled \\"The Second Feminist Wave: What do these women want?\\"First Wave Feminism  BCC Feminist Philosophy First wave feminism focused on the fight for women's political power, as opposed to de facto unofficial inequalities. ==Origins== The fight for women's rights began much earlier than the 20th century. In her book The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir wrote that the first woman to \\"take up her pen in defense of her sex\\" was Christine de Pizan in the 15th century. Feminists Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi worked in the 16th century. Marie le Jars de Gournay, Anne Bradstreet and Fran√ßois Poullain de la Barre's Equality of sexes came out in 1673. === Wollstonecraft === The period in which Mary Wollstonecraft wrote was affected by Rousseau and the philosophy of the Enlightenment. The father of the Enlightenment defined an ideal democratic society that was based on the equality of men, where women were often discriminated against. The inherent exclusion of women from discussion was addressed by both Wollstonecraft, and her contemporaries. Wollstonecraft based her work on the ideas of Rousseau. Although at first it seems to be contradictory, Wollstonecraft's idea was to expand Rousseau's democratic society but based on gender equality. Wollstonecraft published one of the first feminist treatises, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she advocated the social and moral equality of the sexes, extending the work of her 1790 pamphlet, A Vindication of the Rights of Men. Her later unfinished novel, Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman, earned her considerable criticism as she discussed women's sexual desires. She died young, and her widower, the philosopher William Godwin, quickly wrote a memoir of her that, contrary to his intentions, destroyed her reputation for generations. Wollstonecraft is regarded as the \\"fore-mother\\" of the British feminist movement and her ideas shaped the thinking of the suffragettes, who campaigned for the women's vote. === Early American efforts === Early Feminism was directly correlated with the abolitionist movements and as a result many famous feminists and activists began to have their voices heard. Some of these early activists include, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Blackwell, Jane Addams, and Dorothy Day. The first wave of feminism was primarily led by white women in the middle class, and it was not until the second wave of feminism that women of color began developing a voice. The term Feminism was created like a political illustrated ideology at that period. Feminism emerged by the speech about the reform and correction of democracy based on equalitarian conditions. A 1932 Soviet poster for International Women's Day: \\"Day of the uprising of female workers against kitchen slavery\\". Louise Weiss along with other Parisian suffragettes in 1935. The newspaper headline reads, in translation, \\"THE FRENCHWOMAN MUST VOTE\\". == Education == Education amongst young Swiss women was very important during the suffrage movements. Educating young women in society on the importance of self-identity, and going to school was very important to the public and for women to realize what their full potentials were. The Swiss suffrage movements believed it was important for young women to know that there was more to their life than just bearing children, which was a very universal thought and action during the suffrage movements in the 1960s and 70s. In a 2015 evaluation from Lord David Willetts he had discovered and stated that in 2013, the percentage of undergraduate students in the UK were 54 percent females and 46 percent were male undergrads. Whereas in the 1960s only 25 percent of full-time students in the United Kingdom were females. The increase of females going to school and contributing in the educational system can be linked to the women‚Äôs suffrage movements that aimed to encourage women to enroll in school for higher education. This right and political affair eventually came after the right for women to vote in political elections which was granted in 1971. In the 1960s in the United Kingdom, women were usually the minority and a rarity when it came to the higher education system. When ‚ÄúThe Feminist Mystique,‚Äù was published in the United States by Betty Friedan in 1963, the feminist movements set a new standard and gender roles for women as well. ==By country== === Australia === In 1882, Rose Scott, a women's rights activist, began to hold weekly salon meetings in her Sydney home left to her by her late mother. Through these meetings, she became well known amongst politicians, judges, philanthropists, writers and poets. In 1889, she helped to found the Women's Literary Society, which later grew into the Womanhood Suffrage League in 1891. Leading politicians hosted by Scott included Bernhard Wise, William Holman, William Morris Hughes and Thomas Bavin, who met and discussed the drafting of the bill that eventually became the Early Closing Act of 1899. ] ===Denmark=== The first women's movement was led by the Dansk Kvindesamfund (\\"Danish Women's Society\\"), founded in 1871. Line Luplau was one of the most notable woman in this era. Tagea Brandt was also part of this movement, and in her honor was established the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat or Travel Scholarship for women. The Dansk Kvindesamfund's efforts as a leading group of women for women led to the existence of the revised Danish constitution of 1915, giving women the right to vote and the provision of equal opportunity laws during the 1920s, which influenced the present-day legislative measures to grant women access to education, work, marital rights and other obligations. ===Finland=== :See also Feminism in Finland The First wave women's movement in Finland organized when the Suomen Naisyhdistys was founded in 1884. ===France=== :See also Feminism in France The issue of women's rights were discussed during the Age of Enlightenment and the French revolution. Some success was achieved by the new inheritence rights (Loi sur l'h√©ritage des enfants) and the divorce law (Loi autorisant le divorce en France).Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran√ßois Fayard et Alfred Fierro, Histoire et dictionnaire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise. 1789-1799, Paris, √©d. Robert Laffont, coll. ¬´ Bouquins ¬ª, 1987, 1998 [d√©tail des √©ditions] () The Code Napol√©on of 1804 however eradicated the progress made during the revolution. Women's rights were supported by the rule of the Communist Paris Commune of 1870, but the rule of the Commune came to be temporary. The First wave women's movement in France organized when the Association pour le Droit des Femmes was founded by Maria Deraismes and L√©on Richer in 1870.Charles Sowerwine: France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic, 2009 It was followed by the Ligue Fran√ßaise pour le Droit des Femmes (1882) which took up the issue of women suffrage and became the leading suffrage society in parallel to the Union fran√ßaise pour le suffrage des femmes (1909-1945). ===Germany=== The First wave women's movement in Germany organized under the influence of the Revolutions of 1848. It organized for the first time in the first women's organization in Germany, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein (ADF), which was founded by Louise Otto-Peters and Auguste Schmidt in Leipzig 1865. === The Netherlands=== In the Netherlands, Wilhelmina Drucker (1847‚Äì1925) fought successfully for the vote and equal rights for women through political and feminist organisations she founded. Although in the Netherlands during the Age of Enlightenment the idea of the equality of women and men made progress, no practical institutional measures or legislation resulted. In the second half of the nineteenth century many initiatives by feminists sprung up in The Netherlands. Aletta Jacobs (1854‚Äì1929) requested and obtained as the first woman in the Netherlands the right to study at university in 1871, becoming the first female medical doctor and academic. She became a lifelong campaigner for women's suffrage, equal rights, birth control, and international peace, travelling worldwide for, e.g., the International Alliance of Women. Wilhelmina Drucker (1847‚Äì1925) was a politician, a prolific writer and a peace activist, who fought for the vote and equal rights through political and feminist organisations she founded. In 1917‚Äì1919 her goal of women's suffrage was reached. Cornelia Ramondt- Hirschmann (1871‚Äì1951), President of the Dutch Women's International League for Peace and Freedom [WILPF]. Selma Meyer (1890‚Äì1941), Secretary of the Dutch Women's International League for Peace and Freedom [WILPF] === New Zealand === Tribute to the Suffragettes memorial in Christchurch, New Zealand. The figures shown from left to right are Amey Daldy, Kate Sheppard, Ada Wells and Harriet Morison Early New Zealand feminists and suffragettes included Maud Pember Reeves (Australian-born; later lived in London), Kate Sheppard and Mary Ann M√ºller. In 1893, Elizabeth Yates became Mayor of Onehunga, the first time such a post had been held by a female anywhere in the British Empire. Early university graduates were Emily Siedeberg (doctor, graduated 1895) and Ethel Benjamin (lawyer, graduated 1897). The Female Law Practitioners Act was passed in 1896 and Benjamin was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1897 (see Women's suffrage in New Zealand). ===Norway=== :See also Feminism in Norway The First wave women's movement in Norway organized when the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights was founded in 1884. ===Russia=== In Imperial Russia, it was not legal to form political organisations prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution. Because of this, there was no open organised women's rights movement similar to the one in the West before this. There was, however, in practice a women's movement during the 19th-century. In the mid 19th-century, several literary discussion clubs were founded, one of whom, which was co-founded by Anna Filosofova, Maria Trubnikova and Nadezjda Stasova, which discussed Western feminist literature and came to be the first de facto women's rights organisation in Russia. The Crimean War had exposed Russia as less developed than Western Europe, resulting in a number of reforms, among them educational reforms and the foundation of schools for girls. Russian elite women de facto spoke for reforms in women rights through their literary clubs and charity societies. Their main interest were women's education- and work opportunities. The women's club of Anna Filosofova, Maria Trubnikova and Nadezjda Stasova managed to achieve women's access to attend courses at the universities, and the separate courses held for women became so popular that they were made permanent in 1876. However, in 1876 women students were banned from being given degrees and all women's universities were banned except two (Bestuzhev Courses in Saint Petserburg and Guerrier Courses in Moscow).Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild. Equality and Revolution: Women's Rights in the Russian Empire, 1905-1917. University of Pittsburgh Press, 2010. . Page 56. In 1895, Anna Filosofova founded the \\"Russian Women's Charity League\\", which was officially a charitable sociaty to avoid the ban of political organisations but which was in effect a women's rights organisation: Anna Filosofova was elected to the International Council of Women in 1899. Because of the ban of political activity in Russia the only thng they could do was to raise awareness of feminist issues. After the 1905 Russian Revolution political organisations was made legal in Russia and the women's movement was able to organise in the form of Liga ravnopraviia zhenshchin, which started a campaign of women's suffrage the same year. The Russian Revolution of 1917 formally made men and women equal in the eyes of the law in the Soviet Union, but also banned all organised women's movement. ===Sweden=== :See also Feminism in Sweden Feminist issues and gender roles were discussed in media and literature during the 18th century by people such as Margareta Momma, Catharina Ahlgren, Anna Maria R√ºckersch√∂ld and Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, but it created no movement of any kind. The first person to hold public speeches and agitate in favor of feminism was Sophie Sager in 1848,Kyle, Gunhild; Krusenstjerna, Eva von (1993). Kvinnoprofiler. Panorama (Natur & Kultur), 99-0913791-7. Stockholm: Natur och kultur. and the first organization created to deal with a women's issue was Svenska l√§rarinnors pensionsf√∂rening (Society for Retired Female Teachers) by Josefina Deland in 1855.Chief editor: Nils Bohman, Svenska m√§n och kvinnor. 2, C-F (Swedish Men and Women. 2, C-F) dictionary (1944) (in Swedish) In 1856, Fredrika Bremer published her famous Hertha, which aroused great controversy and created a debate referred to as the Hertha Debate. The two foremost questions was to abolish coverture for unmarried women, and for the state to provide women an equivalent to a university. Both questions were met: in 1858, a reform granted unmarried women the right to apply for legal majority by a simple procedure, and in 1861, H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet was founded as a \\"Women's University\\". In 1859, the first women's magazine in Sweden and the Nordic countries, the Tidskrift f√∂r hemmet, was founded by Sophie Adlersparre and Rosalie Olivecrona. This has been referred to as the starting point of a women's movement in Sweden. The organized women's movement begun in 1873, when Married Woman's Property Rights Association was co-founded by Anna Hierta-Retzius and Ellen Anckarsv√§rd. The prime task of the organization was to abolish coverture. In 1884, Fredrika Bremer Association was founded by Sophie Adlersparre to work for the improvement in women's rights. The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of several women's rights organisations and a considerable activity within both active organization as well as intellectual debate. The 1880s saw the so-called Sedlighetsdebatten, were gender roles were discussed in literary debate in regards to sexual double standards in opposed to sexual equality. In 1902, finally, the National Association for Women's Suffrage was founded. In 1921, women's suffrage was finally introduced. The women suffrage reform was followed by the Beh√∂righetslagen of 1923, in which males and females were formally given equal access to all professions and positions in society, the only exceptions being military and priesthood positions.Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (1979) The last two restrictions were removed in 1958, when women were allowed to become priests, and in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989, when all military professions were opened to women.Sundevall, Fia (2011). Det sista manliga yrkesmonopolet: genus och milit√§rt arbete i Sverige 1865‚Äì1989. Diss. Stockholm : Stockholms universitet, 2011 === Switzerland === The Swiss suffrage movement had struggled for equality in their society for decades until the early 1970s; this wave of feminism also included enfranchisement. October 31, 1971 Swiss women were granted the right to vote in political elections. According to Lee Ann Banaszak the main reasons for lack of success in women‚Äôs suffrage for Swiss women was due to the differences in mobilization of members into suffrage organizations, financial resources of the suffrage movements, alliances formed with other political actors, and the characteristics of the political systems. Therefore the success of the Swiss women‚Äôs suffrage movement was heavily affected by the resources and political structures. ‚ÄúThe Swiss movement had to operate in a system where decisions were made carefully by a constructed consensus and where opposition parties never launched an electoral challenge that might of prodded governing parties into action.‚Äù This explains how the closed legislative process made it way more difficult for suffrage activists to participate in, or even track women‚Äôs voting rights. Swiss suffrage also lacked strong allies when it came from their struggle to vote in political elections. The 1970s saw a turning point for Swiss feminist movements, and they began to steadily make more progress in their struggle for equality to present day. === United Kingdom === The early feminist reformers were unorganized, and including prominent individuals who had suffered as victims of injustice. This included individuals such as Caroline Norton whose personal tragedy where she was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons by her husband, led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the Custody of Infants Act 1839 and the introduction of the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement. The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to petition in the Court of Chancery, in practice few women had the financial means to petition for their rights. The first organized movement for English feminism was the Langham Place Circle of the 1850s, which included among others Barbara Bodichon (n√©e Leigh-Smith) and Bessie Rayner Parkes. The group campaigned for many women's causes, including improved female rights in employment, and education. It also pursued women's property rights through its Married Women's Property Committee. In 1854, Bodichon published her Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women, which was used by the Social Science Association after it was formed in 1857 to push for the passage of the Married Women's Property Act 1882. In 1858, Barbara Bodichon, Matilda Mary Hays and Bessie Rayner Parkes established the first feminist British periodical, the English Woman's Journal, with Bessie Parkes the chief editor. The journal continued publication until 1864 and was succeeded in 1866 by the Englishwoman's Review edited until 1880 by Jessie Boucherett which continued publication until 1910. Jessie Boucherett and Adelaide Anne Proctor joined the Langham Place Circle in 1859. The group was active until 1866. Also in 1859, Jessie Boucherett, Barbara Bodichon and Adelaide Proctor formed the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women to promote the training and employment of women. The society is one of the earliest British women's organisations, and continues to operate as the registered charity Futures for Women.Futures for Women (accessed February 2014) Helen Blackburn and Boucherett established the Women's Employment Defence League in 1891, to defend women's working rights against restrictive employment legislation. They also together edited the Condition of Working Women and the Factory Acts in 1896. In the beginning of the 20th century, women's employment was still predominantly limited to factory labor and domestic work. During World War I, more women found work outside the home. As a result of the wartime experience of women in the workforce, the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 opened professions and the civil service to women, and marriage was no longer a legal barrier to women working outside the home. In 1918 Marie Stopes published the very influential Married Love, in which she advocated gender equality in marriage and the importance of women's sexual desire. (Importation of the book into the United States was banned as obscene until 1931.) The Representation of the People Act 1918 extended the franchise to women who were at least 30 years old and they or their husbands were property holders, while the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 gave women the right to sit in Parliament, although it was only slowly that women were actually elected. In 1928, the franchise was extended to all women over 21 by the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, on an equal basis to men. Many feminist writers and women's rights activists argued that it was not equality to men which they needed but a recognition of what women need to fulfill their potential of their own natures, not only within the aspect of work but society and home life too. Virginia Woolf produced her essay A Room of One's Own based on the ideas of women as writers and characters in fiction. Woolf said that a woman must have money and a room of her own to be able to write. === United States === Charlotte Perkins Gilman (pictured) wrote these articles about feminism for the Atlanta Constitution, published on December 10, 1916. Suffragist with banner, Washington DC, 1918 Judith Sargent Murray published the early and influential essay On the Equality of the Sexes in 1790, blaming poor standards in female education as the root of women‚Äôs problems. However, scandals surrounding the personal lives of English contemporaries Catharine Macaulay and Mary Wollstonecraft pushed feminist authorship into private correspondence from the 1790s through the early decades of the nineteenth century.Weyler (2012), pp. 233-235 Feminist essays from John Neal in the 1820s filled an intellectual gap between Murray and the leaders of the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention,Weyler (2012), p. 227 which is generally considered the beginning of the first wave of feminism. As a male writer insulated from many common forms of attack against female feminist thinkers, Neal‚Äôs advocacy was crucial to bringing feminism back into the American mainstream.Weyler (2012), pp. 227-228, 242 Woman in the Nineteenth Century by Margaret Fuller has been considered the first major feminist work in the United States and is often compared to Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.Slater, Abby. In Search of Margaret Fuller. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 89‚Äì90. Prominent leaders of the feminist movement in the United States include Lucretia Coffin Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony; Anthony and other activists such as Victoria Woodhull and Matilda Joslyn Gage made attempts to cast votes prior to their legal entitlement to do so, for which many of them faced charges. Other important leaders included several women who dissented against the law in order to have their voices heard, (Sarah and Angelina Grimk√©), in addition to other activists such as Carrie Chapman Catt, Alice Paul, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, Margaret Sanger and Lucy Burns.Dicker, 2008. pp. 28, 47‚Äì48. First-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as Frances Willard and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union), others such as Matilda Joslyn Gage of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) resembling the radicalism of much of second-wave feminism. The majority of first-wave feminists were more moderate and conservative than radical or revolutionary‚Äîlike the members of the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) they were willing to work within the political system and they understood the clout of joining with sympathetic men in power to promote the cause of suffrage. The limited membership of the NWSA was narrowly focused on gaining a federal amendment for women's suffrage, whereas the AWSA, with ten times as many members, worked to gain suffrage on a state-by-state level as a necessary precursor to federal suffrage. The NWSA had broad goals, hoping to achieve a more equal social role for women, but the AWSA was aware of the divisive nature of many of those goals and instead chose to focus solely on suffrage. The NWSA was known for having more publicly aggressive tactics (such as picketing and hunger strikes) whereas the AWSA used more traditional strategies like lobbying, delivering speeches, applying political pressure and gathering signatures for petitions.Dicker, 2008, pp. 40‚Äì43. During the first wave, there was a notable connection between the slavery abolition movement and the women's rights movement. Frederick Douglass was heavily involved in both movements and believed that it was essential for both to work together in order to attain true equality in regards to race and sex.Rojas. U.S. Women of Color Feminism, 1st Edition. Kendall Hunt Publishing, Co., 01/2015. VitalSource Bookshelf Online. Different accounts of the involvement of African-American women in the Women's Suffrage Movement are given. In a 1974 interview, Alice Paul notes that a compromise was made between southern groups to have white women march first, then men, then African-American women.The Library of Congress, 2001. In another account by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), difficulties in segregating women resulted in African-American women marching with their respective States without hindrance.The Library of Congress, 2001. Among them was Ida B. Wells- Barnett, who marched with the Illinois delegation. The end of the first wave is often linked with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1920), granting women the right to vote. This was the major victory of the movement, which also included reforms in higher education, in the workplace and professions, and in health care. Women started serving on school boards and local bodies, and numbers kept increasing. This period also saw more women gaining access to higher education. In 1910, \\"women were attending many leading medical schools, and in 1915 the American Medical Association began to admit women members.\\"\\"Women's History in America\\", Excerpted from Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, 1995 A Matrimonial Causes Act 1923 gave women the right to the same grounds for divorce as men. The first wave of feminists, in contrast to the second wave, focused very little on the subjects of abortion, birth control, and overall reproductive rights of women. Though she never married, Anthony published her views about marriage, holding that a woman should be allowed to refuse sex with her husband; the American woman had no legal recourse at that time against rape by her husband. The rise in unemployment during the Great Depression which started in the 1920s hit women first, and when the men also lost their jobs there was further strain on families. Many women served in the armed forces during World War II, when around 300,000 American women served in the navy and army, performing jobs such as secretaries, typists and nurses. ==== State laws ==== The American states are separate sovereigns,U.S. Const., Amend. X. with their own state constitutions, state governments, and state courts. All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. States retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state institutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari.See . State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on. Marylynn Salmon argues that each state developed different ways of dealing with a variety of legal issues pertaining to women, especially in the case of property laws. In 1809, Connecticut was the first state to pass a law allowing women to write wills. 1860, New York passed a revised Married Women's Property Act which gave women shared ownership of their children, allowing them to have a say in their children's wills, wages, and granting them the right to inherit property.Dicker, 2008, pp. 30, 38. Further advances and setbacks were experienced in New York and other states, but with each new win the feminists were able to use it as an example to apply more leverage on unyielding legislative bodies. ==== White Feminism: The Absent Contributions by Black Feminists ==== First Wave Feminism in the United States did not chronicle the contributions of black women to the same degree as white women. Activists, including Susan B. Anthony and other feminist leaders preached for equality between genders; however, they disregarded equality between a number of other issues, including race. This allowed for white women to gain power and equality relative to white men, while the social disparity between white and black women increased. The exclusion aided the growing prevalence of White supremacy, specifically white feminism while actively overlooking the severity of impact black feminists had on the movement.  Two Different Fights  The two different fights for black and White women's equality were present simultaneously and could not be separated during the First Wave of Feminism. White women were fighting for rights equal to white men in society. They wanted to correct the discrepancy in education, professional, property, economic, and voting rights. They also fought for birth control and abortion freedom. Black women, on the other hand, were ultimately fighting two ‚Äú-isms‚Äù, racism and sexism, contributing to an uphill struggle for black feminists. While White women could not vote, black women and men could not vote. Mary J. Garrett who founded a group consisting of hundreds of Black women in New Orleans, said that black women strove for education and protection. It is true that ‚Äúblack women in higher education are isolated, underutilized, and often demoralized,‚Äù and they fought together against this. They were fighting against ‚Äúexploitation by White men‚Äù and they wanted to ‚Äúlead a virtuous and industrious life.\\" Black women were also fighting for their husbands, families, and overall equality and freedom of their civil rights. Racism restricted white and black women from coming together to fight for common societal transformation.  Examples of Inequalities  It was not just through personal racism that black women were excluded from feminists movements; institutional racism prevented many women from having an avid say and stance. The National American Woman Suffrage Association, established by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. did not invite black women to attend specific meetings, excluding them entirely. Feminist and women's suffrage conventions held in Southern states, where black women were a dominant percentage of the population, were segregated. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were abolitionists but they did not advocate for universal suffrage. They both did not want black men to be granted the right to vote before white women. The National American Woman Suffrage Association was created to distinguish themselves from advocating for black men to vote. The 15th Amendment states no person should be denied the right to vote based on race. Anthony and Stanton opposed passage of the amendment unless it was accompanied by a Sixteenth Amendment that would guarantee suffrage for women. Otherwise, they said, it would create an \\"aristocracy of sex\\" by giving constitutional authority to the belief that men were superior to women. The new proposal of this amendment was named the ‚ÄúAnthony Amendment‚Äù. Stanton once said that allowing black men to vote before women ‚Äúcreates an antagonism between black men and all women that will culminate in fearful outrages on womanhood‚Äù. Anthony stated, she would ‚Äúcut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work for or demand the ballot for the negro and not the woman‚Äù. Mary Church Terrell exclaimed in 1904 that, ‚ÄúMy sisters of the dominant race, stand up not only for the oppressed sex, but also for the oppressed race!‚Äù The National American Woman Suffrage Association sustained the inequalities between black and white women and also limited their ability to contribute. Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass together formed the American Equal Rights Association, advocating for equality between both gender and sex. In 1848, Frederick Douglass was asked to speak by Susan B. Anthony at a convention in Seneca Falls, New York. Frederick Douglass was an active supporter. Later, Douglass was not permitted to attend an Atlanta, Georgia NAWSA convention. Susan B. Anthony exclaimed, ‚ÄúI did not want to subject him to humiliation, and I did not want anything to get in the way of bringing the Southern white women into our suffrage association, now that their interest had been awakened‚Äù. Douglass opposed the fact that Cady and Anthony were extremely unsupportive of black voting rights. White women condoned racism at the cost of black women if it meant benefitting and more support of the white suffrage movement. Institutional racism excluded black women in the March on Washington in 1913. Black women were asked to march separately, together, at the back of the parade. They were forced to be made absent which can be seen in the lack of photographs and media of black women marching in the parade. White women did not want black women associated with their movement because they believed white women would disaffiliate themselves from an integrated group and create a segregated, more powerful one.  Sojourner Truth‚Äôs ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt I a Woman?‚Äù - Combining Forces  Despite participating and contributing a great deal to all feminists movements, black women were rarely recognized. Mary McLeod Bethune said that the world was unable to accept all of the contributions black women have made. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton together wrote the History of Woman Suffrage published in 1881. The book failed to give adequate recognition to the black women who were equally responsible for the change in United States history. Sojourner Truth became an influential advocate for the women's rights movement. In 1851 she delivered her ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt I a Woman‚Äù speech at the women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio. Black women at this point were beginning to become empowered and assertive, speaking out on the disproportionate inequalities. Truth speaks of how she, and other women, are capable of working as much as men, after having thirteen children. This speech was one of the ways white and black women became closer to working towards fighting for the same thing. Another one of Truth's speeches at the American Equal Rights Association in New York in 1867 she said, ‚ÄùIf colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.\\" Her speeches brought attention to the movement, for black women, but also for white. Although private lives continued to be segregated, feminist coalitions became integrated. Two separate reasons aided integration in the feminist movement. Paula Giddings wrote that the two fights against racism and sexism could not be separated. Gerda Lerner wrote that black women demonstrated they too were fully capable of fighting and creating change for equality. == Timeline == ; ; 1809 * US, Connecticut: Married women were allowed to execute wills. ; 1810 * Sweden: The informal right of an unmarried woman to be declared of legal majority by royal dispensation was officially confirmed by parliament.Christine Bladh (Swedish): M√•nglerskor: att s√§lja fr√•n korg och bod i Stockholm 1819‚Äì1846 (1991) ; 1811 * Austria: Married women were granted separate economy and the right to choose their professions.Richard J Evans (1979).

For Kyla Schuller in The Biopolitics of Feeling: Race, Sex, and Science in the Nineteenth Century, \\"biopower is feminism's enabling condition ... movements for gender equality have materialized amid a field of power in which, at least since Malthus, the interdependence of reproduction and economics forms the primary field of the political.\\" Schuller argues that \\"[the] evolutionary notion of the distinct sexes of male and female, understood as specialized divergences in physiology, anatomy, and mental function that only the most civilized had achieved, was itself a racial hierarchy ... the very idea of sex as a biological and political subjectivity is a product of the biopolitical logics unfolding hand in hand with the sciences of species change.\\" Schuller quotes Canadian philosopher Michelle Murphy in Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience: \\"Historicizing feminisms as a biopolitics that has taken 'sex,' and its subsidiary, 'reproduction,' as central concerns requires that we understand feminisms in all their variety and contradiction as animated within - and not escaping from - dominant configurations of governance and technoscience.\\" From this perspective, 19th- and early 20th-century feminisms reproduced the very social hierarchies they had the potential to struggle against, exemplifying the claim of Michel Foucault in his The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction that \\"resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power.\\" First-wave feminism offered no intersectional perspective. Gender was not thought of as a social construction, nor was the roles that each gender plays thought of as sexist. This time period also focused on biological differences, and that only the way to be considered a woman was through biology or sex. It did not consider and fight for women of color, or women of lower socioeconomic status. It also reinforced and made colonization stronger, as well increasing the eroticization of women from different nations. First-wave theorists also leave out all of the activism women of color contributed. Activists like Maria Stewart, and Frances E. W. Harper are hardly mentioned with any credit for the abolitionist or suffrage movements during this time period. First wave feminism is male centric meaning it was made in the form of the way men see women. Another issue with First-Wave feminism is that the white, middle-class women were able to decide what is a woman problem and what is not. First-wave lacked the sexual freedom women aspired to have but could not have while men could. It is also said that many of the white fundamental First Wave feminists were in alliance with women of color but stayed silent when they figured they could reach progression for middle class, white women. == See also == * History of feminism * Protofeminism * Second-wave feminism * Third-wave feminism * Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting) and Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting) in the 19th century * Timeline of women's suffrage * The Subjection of Women (1869) by John Stuart Mill ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Dicker, Rory Cooke.

It is located at the Golden Mile of San Juan, the island capital. It is usually referred by Puerto Ricans as the Choliseo, which is a portmanteau of the words \\"Coliseo\\" and \\"Cholito\\", in reference to Don Cholito, one of Jos√© Miguel Agrelot's characters and Agrelot's own adopted nickname. The coliseum opened on September 4, 2004 after a prolonged construction financed by the Government of Puerto Rico. This venue is owned by the Puerto Rico Convention District Authority, a public corporation of Puerto Rico, and managed by ASM Global. It can accommodate up to 18,500 spectators and can be reached by the Hato Rey Station of the Tren Urbano system. The arena hosted the first WWE pay-per-view event outside the continental United States, Canada and the United Kingdom when New Year's Revolution was held there in 2005. On May 26, 2011, the arena was ranked 8th on the Top 50 Arena Venues of the world and second of the West Hemisphere in worldwide ticket sales by Pollstar Magazine. As of May 2013, the arena has received over 5 million spectators, hosting more than 600 events with a gross ticket revenue around $200 million. After the hit from Hurricane Maria, in the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, events after mid-September 2017 were cancelled. For a while, the Choliseo was used as a warehouse and recollection center by the Government of Puerto Rico to prepare and distribute food, water and basic necessities to those affected by the deadliest and costliest hurricane in Puerto Rican history. The arena resumed hosting events in March 2018. ==History== ===Original plans=== Aerial view of the Jos√© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum after construction. The Coliseum was a project started during the administration of Governor Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, initially as part of an Olympic bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games. The facility was supposed to be constructed between the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and Hiram Bithorn Stadium, about a mile and a half away from the current arena site. The Coliseum would have been used for events such as Gymnastics and Olympic Basketball had the games been held in San Juan. ===Controversy=== In 1997, however, Athens was selected to host the games, and the construction of the Coliseum was jeopardized. Recognizing the need for such a facility anyway, the government decided to continue the construction, this time at a site physically close to San Juan's financial district, the Golden Mile. Since the new site was adjacent to a future Tren Urbano station, the Coliseum's planners decided not to incorporate parking facilities to the arena, as to induce visitors to use mass transportation to reach it. Political opponents of Pedro Rossell√≥'s administration raised various objections to the original plan, claiming that the lot of land purchased for the construction would benefit some of his political party's (PNP) heaviest financial contributors. They also objected to the lack of parking space, claiming that nearby private parking operators, supposedly also money donors to Rossell√≥'s party, would extort high parking fees from people who could not or would not use public transportation to the venue. At the time, the Tren Urbano was in its initial stages of construction; by the time the facility opened it was still under construction. Objectors would also point out that a private operator would take control of the facility under contract from the government of Puerto Rico under what was perceived as a highly expensive contract. The Rossell√≥ administration countered by stating that previous experience with public sports facilities in Puerto Rico, which would quickly fall into disrepair at an accelerated rate requiring constant remodeling, demanded that a private entity should manage the facility. The contract's expense would be justified by bringing in an operating partner with international experience managing world-class facilities, whose reputation would ensure that performers and sport events that had never been staged in Puerto Rico could visit the island. The Coliseum's construction was stopped for close to two years during the administration of governor Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n, the leader of the opposition party (PPD) whose administration followed Rossell√≥'s. She claimed that the Puerto Rican government had spent $242 million for a facility where only 42% of its scheduled project plan had been completed when she took office. The planners and constructors had overlooked the fact that a water pumping station next to the facility had been built over unstable land, and a portion of the building's foundations would have had to be redone because of this. There was even talk of demolishing what had been built and starting from scratch, which infuriated Rossell√≥ supporters, who dismissed the suggestion as merely an excuse to spend more government money, this time to benefit the PPD's financial backers. Plans for a redesigned interior added during the Calder√≥n administration added fuel to the intense public controversy. Another controversy came about when Banco Popular's Ticketpop was named the ticketing distributor through an exclusive contract, almost ignoring the bid by competitor TicketCenter; Ticketpop would remain the ticketing distributor until August 28, 2019 when rising competitor Ticketera was given the exclusive contract. The original ticket vendor bidding controversy almost went to trial, as both parties argued over who would receive the contract, but the Government of Puerto Rico stood by their original contract with Ticketpop. Local producer Angelo Medina spearheaded a group that wanted the legislature to curb the managing powers of SMG (before merging to ASM Global in 2019), recently-named to oversee operations and activities, because they feared that the company's relationship with non-local television companies would limit the participation of local talent in the arena. The Coliseum was finally inaugurated on September 4, 2004. The first major show was Van Halen, on September 13, 2004. ===Dedication=== The naming of the structure caused a controversy by itself. During the construction phase, plans called for the coliseum to be named simply El Coliseo de Puerto Rico (The Coliseum of Puerto Rico), but when it was also suggested that a private entity could sponsor the facility and thereby lend its name to it, most local politicians objected to the idea, since the financial scandal involving Enron reminded them that the bankrupt company had sponsored a sports facility, which was the Enron Field, later renamed Minute Maid Park in Houston. Some politicians argued over the naming the Coliseum after a Puerto Rican celebrity. Some of the names mentioned were that of pop star Chayanne, boxer F√©lix \\"Tito\\" Trinidad and actor Ra√∫l Juli√°. Puerto Rican law demanded that no facility could be named after a living individual and there were talks of making an exception to the law should a living Puerto Rican icon be honored with the name. However, the name of beloved local comedian Jos√© Miguel Agrelot was chosen when the Coliseum was near its completion. Agrelot himself had suggested the name of Rafael Hern√°ndez Mar√≠n to be used, and when someone suggested his name instead he was both surprised and concerned. He was quoted as saying once in his radio show, Tu Alegre Despertar: \\"I can only hope my name won't be used, since I'd like God to keep me alive for quite some time... it would be a great honor, and I wouldn't object to it if that is what people want, but public facilities here are customarily named after dead people... I won't even dare to think about it. I'd only like the controversy over the name to stop\\". Soon after, Agrelot died in his sleep while taking an afternoon nap, on January 28, 2004. The almost unanimous consensus of most Puerto Ricans was that Agrelot deserved the honor, and the facility was dedicated to him on what would have been his birthday that year. A bust of Agrelot as his character Don Cholito stands at the Coliseum's lobby in his honor, bearing a plaque with his immortal words inscribed: ==Parking and transportation== Night view of the Coliseum of Puerto Rico from the Hato Rey Station of the Tren Urbano A major public parking space or garage was not included in the planning or construction for the arena. Instead, only three parking lots were constructed, one for backstage entrance for authorized talent, production, equipment, props, etc., a medium-sized lot to the West entrance mostly for handicapped and the smallest lot, access- controlled, located across the box office and nearby the light rail station; privately-owned parking lots around the Choliseo can be found and charge a fee. The Tren Urbano is by far the most used transportation mode to and from the Choliseo; the Hato Rey station, located at a short walking distance, is the only station to extend operating hours after nighttime events end until all passengers using the system have exited at the station of their respective destinations. ==Awards and recognitions== Pollstar, the prestigious U.S.-based magazine, chose the Coliseum of Puerto Rico as the International Large Venue of the Year in 2005, recognized as one of the most important venues in the world, competing with the Acer Arena in Sydney, the Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester The Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, and the Odyssey Arena in Belfast. \\"The Choliseo, as Puerto Ricans affectionately call, was another of those pleasant surprises last year\\", continued Rivera Cardona. \\"It received Pollstar's coveted 2005 Best New International Large Venue of the Year and it was nominated again for the Best International Venue of the Year in 2006\\". The Coliseum of Puerto Rico ranks No. 15 in ticket sales worldwide according to industry trade magazine Pollstar. The Coliseum of Puerto Rico has developed into the premier entertainment site of the island. Since its inauguration in September 2004 over 3 million people have crossed its gates bringing in $128 million in gross ticket revenue and hosting more than 516 events. On May 26, 2011, the Choliseo was ranked 8th on the Top 50 Arena Venues of the world and second of the West Hemisphere in worldwide ticket sales by Pollstar magazine, surpassing the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Wembley Arena in London, etc. In the first three months of 2011, the coliseum received an overwhelming number of people of over 205,000. During the first trimester, the coliseum was ranked 13 times in the 25 best arenas worldwide, according to Pollstar, Billboard and Venues Today.El Coliseo de Puerto Rico entre los m√°s taquilleros del mundo El Nuevo D√≠a The Choliseo from the northeast parking lot Another popular show business magazine, Venues Today, placed the Choliseo as one of the 25 Best Arenas of the Decade in the world in the category of establishments with a capacity of between 15,000 and 30,000 spectators, a recognition in which Wesley Cullen, Choliseo general manager, reacted: \\"This is amazing and is very positive news for the people of Puerto Rico\\", said Cullen. One of the most important requirements that influenced the award was box office sales, which during the eight years it's been opened has exceeded $4.9 million, generating about $220 million. \\"Puerto Rico is a phenomenon at the box office. We have always been among the top 20 in the world (in sales) because the Puerto Ricans like to have fun\\", he said. According to Cullen, this level of event assistance puts Puerto Rico at the level of cities like New York City, San Francisco or Dallas. Pollstar magazine show business awards also recognized the Choliseo after being nominated in the category of International Large Venue of the Year. At the time, the venue was competing with major rivals like the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, the O2 Arena and the Royal Albert Hall, both in London, and the O2 World in Berlin. \\"Just the fact of being nominated with these competitors is a huge honor. If we don't win, however, it will represent a great achievement\\", he explained. The manager said one of the best rewards is that the Choliseo is being considered by artists and producers for their performance tours. \\"It is an honor to have the responsibility of directing the Convention District Authority, including the Coliseum of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico's major entertainment center and of the Caribbean, demonstrating our commitment to project to Puerto Rico as what is an island that has nothing to envy to the rest of the world\\", said V√≠ctor Su√°rez, executive director of the Convention District. ==Notable events held at the venue== ==See also== *Coliseo Rub√©n Rodr√≠guez *Puerto Rico Convention Center *Roberto Clemente Coliseum ==References== ==External links== *Coliseo de Puerto Rico Official Website Category:Basketball venues in Puerto Rico Category:Boxing venues in Puerto Rico Category:Indoor arenas in Puerto Rico Category:Sports venues completed in 2004 Category:Sports venues in San Juan, Puerto Rico Category:2004 establishments in Puerto Rico Category:Buildings and structures in San Juan, Puerto Rico ","title":"Jos√© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum"},{"id":"1271962","text":"Larger tables may require multiple lamps to properly light the playing surface. A billiard table or billiards table is a bounded table on which cue sports are played. In the modern era, all billiards tables (whether for carom billiards, pool, pyramid or snooker) provide a flat surface usually made of quarried slate, that is covered with cloth (usually of a tightly-woven worsted wool called baize), and surrounded by vulcanized rubber cushions, with the whole elevated above the floor. More specific terms are used for specific sports, such as snooker table and pool table, and different-sized billiard balls are used on these table types. An obsolete term is billiard board, used in the 16th and 17th centuries. ==Parts and equipment== ===Cushions=== Cushions (also sometimes called \\"rail cushions\\", \\"cushion rubber\\", or rarely \\"bumpers\\") are located on the inner sides of a table's wooden . There are several different materials and design philosophies associated with cushion rubber. The cushions are made from an elastic material such as vulcanized rubber (gum or synthetic). The purpose of the cushion rubber is to cause the billiard balls to rebound off the rubber while minimizing the loss of kinetic energy. The profile of the rail cushion, which is the cushion's angle in relation to the bed of the table, varies between table types. The standard on American pool tables is the K-66 profile, which as defined by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA) has a base of and a nose height of . When installed properly the distance from the nose of the cushion to the covered slate surface is while using a regulation ball set. On a carom table, the K-55 profile is used (with a somewhat sharper angle than pool cushions). K-55 cushions have cloth, usually canvas, vulcanized into the top of the rubber to adjust rebound accuracy and speed. Snooker tables use an L-shaped profile, such as the L77 profile. ===Bed=== The bed table ‚Äì the cloth-covered, horizontal playing surface ‚Äì is, on high-quality equipment, made of solid, smooth slabs of slate, most often from Italy, Brazil or China. Small pool tables may use only one or two pieces of slate, while carom, English billiards and tournament-size pool tables use three. Full-size snooker tables require five. The gap between slates is filled with a hard-drying putty, epoxy or resin, then sanded to produce a seamless surface, before being covered with the cloth. When several pieces of slate are joined poorly it is possible for the resin to deform and cause an uneven playing surface; it can also be difficult to move once joined. Tables for the home market usually use slate beds as well, but the slate is often thinner, down to about . The early table beds were made of cloth-covered wooden boards. Today, inexpensive but not very rigid or durable materials used for the beds of low-end tables (e.g. for children's recreation rooms) still include wood, especially medium-density fibreboard and plywood, as well as plastics and other synthetic materials under various trade names. ===Cloth=== Billiard cloth (sometimes erroneously called felt) is a specific type of cloth that covers the top of the table's \\"playing area\\". Both the rails and slate beds are covered with 21‚Äì24-ounce billiard cloth (although some less expensive 19-ounce cloths are available) which is most often green in colour (representing the grass of the original lawn games that billiards evolved from), and consists of either a woven wool or wool-nylon blend called baize. Most bar tables, which get much use, use the slower, thicker blended felt because it is cheaper. This type of cloth is called a woollen cloth. By contrast, high-quality pool cloth is usually made of a napless weave such as worsted wool, which gives a much faster roll to the balls. This \\"speed\\" of the cloth affects the amounts of and of the balls, among other aspects of game finesse. Snooker cloth traditionally has a directional nap, upon which the balls behave differently when rolling against vs. running with the direction of the nap. ===Markings=== , also known as (for their traditional shape), are inlaid at precise, evenly spaced positions along the rails of some tables (not usually on snooker tables) to aid in the aiming of bank or kick shots. There are seven along each long rail (with the side pocket interfering with where the seventh one would go, on pocket billiard tables) and three along each short rail, with each of the four corners counting as another in the mathematical systems that the diamonds are used to calculate. These sights divide the playing surface into equal squares. Books, even entire series of books, have been written on geometric and algebraic systems of aiming using the diamonds. Spots are often used to mark the and on the cloth. Other markings may be a line drawn across the (or across the with , in British-style pool). Another case is the outline of the behind the foot spot where the balls are in straight pool, since the outline of this area is strategically important throughout the game. In artistic pool, lines may be drawn between opposite sights putting a grid on the playing surface. Other grid patterns are used in various forms of balkline billiards. A recent table marking convention, in European nine-ball, is the . ==Carom billiards tables== Pocketless carom billiards tables are used for such games as straight rail, balkline, one-cushion billiards, three-cushion caroms, and artistic billiards. ===Dimensions=== Regulation 10 √ó 5-foot carom billiards tables have a playing surface (measured between the noses of the cushions) of 2.84 metres by 1.42 metres (9.32 √ó 4.65 feet) with a 5-millimetre allowance. The standard height range of the table, measured from the playing surface to the ground is between 75 and 80 centimetres. ===Bed=== The slate bed of a carom billiard table must have a minimum thickness of 45 millimetres and in tournaments recommended heating temperatures is 33‚Äì37¬∞C (91‚Äì99¬∞F), which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards. Heating table beds is an old practice. Queen Victoria had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes, although the aim at that time was chiefly to keep the then-used ivory balls from warping. The first use of electric heating was for an 18.2 balkline tournament held in December 1927 between Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer Jr. The New York Times announced it with fanfare: \\"For the first time in the history of world's championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used...\\" (Subscription required.) ==Pool tables== A and the 1 ball close to a WPA-style pocket. (The balls are the same size; the cue ball looks large due to foreshortening.) A pool table, or pocket billiards table, has six ‚Äì one at each corner of the table () and one at the midpoint of each of the longer sides ( or ). ===Dimensions=== A WEPF-style pool table, showing a cue ball and red and yellow balls close to the small, rounded, nearly parallel-sided pocket. Pool tables come in different sizes, typically referred to as , , , or tables. In all cases, the table is rectangular with a ratio (e.g. ). There are only two sizes approved for tournament play by the International Olympic Committee‚Äìrecognized sport governing body of pool, the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), and its various regional and national affiliates; under the world standardized rules of pool, these are the and models. For a table, the playing surface (the dimensions between the noses of the cushions) measures by with a (3.2 mm) margin of error for either dimension. For an , the playing surface measures by , with the same inch variance allowed. In the UK as well as a number of other British Commonwealth and European countries, the typical pool table is a 7 √ó 3.5 ft (2.13 √ó 1.07 m), although 6-foot (1.83 m) tables for the pub and home market are also common. These are the sizes used by internationally standardized blackball and the amateur World Eightball Pool Federation, as well as informal pub pool. The 7-foot size is also frequently used in North American amateur leagues, and are common coin-operated fixtures in bars and other venues. The playing surface for a 7-foot table is by . ===Pockets=== Pockets, usually rimmed at the back with leather or plastic traditionally have drop pockets, which are small receptacles below each pocket to catch the balls. Most modern pool tables may instead employ a ball return, a series of gutters inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection compartment on one side of the table, in a similar manner to the ball return on a bowling alley. On a coin-operated table, the object balls are deposited inside an inaccessible compartment window until the table is paid again, allowing the balls to be released into the collection chamber, while the cue ball is usually separated into its own ball return, often utilizing a different sized ball. A disadvantage to drop pockets is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again. Regardless of table size, the WPA standard (sometimes informally called \\"American-style\\") table has wide, angular pockets that funnel notably inward, generally 1.75 to 2.25 times as wide at the opening as the diameter of the balls, wider at the side (middle) pockets than the corners. WEPF pool (sometimes informally called \\"British- style\\" or \\"Commonwealth-style\\") is played with balls, and this type of table has smaller, narrow pockets (the width is calculated as the ball diameter multiplied by 1.6, and is consistent at all six pockets), with rounded entrances and nearly parallel sides, like those on a snooker table. One tactical consequence of this design difference is that the jaws of the WPA- type pocket are often used exactly like a horizontal version of the backboard of a basketball goal, to rebound the ball into the pocket; this technique does not work on blackball tables, and even shots down the cushion into a corner pocket are more difficult. ===Bed=== For tournament competition under WPA world-standardized rules (and league play under derived rulesets), the bed of the pocket billiard table must be made of slate no less than thick. The flatness of the table must be divergent by no greater than lengthwise and across the width. ==Snooker and English billiards tables== Snooker table, drawn to scale A table designed for the games snooker and English billiards is usually called a snooker table today, though English billiards pre-dates snooker. ===Dimensions=== The playing area of a tournament snooker table, as standardized by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) and the amateur International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF), measures 11 feet 8.5 inches by 5 ft 10 in (3569 mm by 1778 mm) with a tolerance of ¬± 0.5 in (13 mm), though commonly referred to as 12 ft by 6 ft, the nominal outer dimensions including the rails. Smaller tables, approximately 10 ft by 5 ft down to half size, are also sometimes used in pubs, homes and smaller snooker halls. The height from the floor to the top of the cushion is between 2 ft 9.5 in and 2 ft 10.5 in (851 mm and 876 mm). ===Pockets=== A snooker table has six pockets, one at each corner and one at the centre of each of the longest side cushions. The pockets are around 86 mm (3.5 in), though high-class tournaments may use slightly smaller pockets to increase difficulty. The amount of (trimmed underside of the rubber cushion's protruding at the pocket opening), Stooke is a snooker instructor and writer whose work appears to be presumptively reliable, based on the sources he does cite throughout his materials. if any, has a strong effect on how easily a ball is accepted by the pocket (the \\"\\"). On snooker and English billiards tables, the pocket entries are rounded, while pool tables have sharp \\"\\". This affects how accurate shots need to be to get into a pocket, and how fast they can be when not dead-on, including shots that run along and against a cushion, making snooker more difficult to play than pool. According to the WPBSA official rule book, \\"the pocket openings shall conform to the owned and authorised by The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA)\\". The WPBSA and IBSF rule books' equipment sections do not actually specify the measurements and shapes of these proprietary templates which change from time to time, requiring that the templates be dated. The organizations do not recognize tournament play or records (maximum breaks, etc.) if not performed on tables that conform to then-current templates. FCS is a snooker equipment manufacturer that also runs a snooker statistics site. ===Cushions=== The cushions (sometimes known as rails, though that term properly applies to the wood sections to which the cushions are attached) are usually made of vulcanized rubber. ===Markings=== The area is marked by a drawn on the cloth across the width of the table at 29 inches (737 mm) from and parallel to the face of the . A semicircle with a radius of 11.5 inches (292 mm) centred on this line within baulk forms in which the cue ball must be placed when breaking or after the cue ball has been or shot off the table. The position of four of are marked along the (lengthwise centre) of the table, perpendicular to the baulk line: the , 12.75 inches (324 mm) from the ; the or , located at the midpoint between the bottom and top ; the or , located midway between the centre spot and the top cushion; and the or , located at the midpoint of the baulk line (and, thus of the \\"D\\"). Due to its obviousness, the brown spot is not always marked (neither are the unmistakable and , at the left and right intersections, respectively, of the baulk line and the \\"Ds curve. The exact placing of these markings are different on smaller tables, but proportional to the full-size model. ===Bed=== The of a good quality snooker table has a of slate and is covered with baize cloth, traditionally green, though many other colours are now available. The thickness of this cloth determines the table's (lack of friction) and responsiveness to , thicker cloths being longer lasting but slower and less responsive. The nap of the cloth can affect the run of the balls, especially on slower shots and shots played with applied to the . A snooker table traditionally has the nap running from the baulk to the top end and is brushed and ironed in this direction. ==Tables for other games== Other types of billiard tables are used for specific games, such as Russian pyramid which uses a '12 ft by 6 ft' table (similar to a snooker table but with much smaller pockets), and Asian four ball which uses a pocketless 8 ft by 4 ft table. Games such as bagatelle often had more than six holes, including straight through the bed in the middle of the table, a feature still found in bar billiards and bumper pool. ==Novelty and home tables== There are novelty billiard tables, often for pool, that come in various shapes including zig-zag, circular, and (especially for bumper pool) hexagonal. A circular table featured prominently in the 1972 film Silent Running. For the home market, many manufacturers have produced convertible billiard tables (in the broad sense) that double as dining tables or as table tennis, foosball, or air hockey, tables, with removable hard tops. Home pool tables, which often lack a ball-return system, are commonly either 4 √ó 8 ft or 3.5 √ó 7 ft models, a medium between 3 √ó 6 ft. bar/pub tables and 4.5 √ó 9 ft tournament-size models. Low-end tables tend toward the smaller range, and may have MDF or wood beds as an alternative to slate; those with light-weight beds may be foldable for storage, as with table tennis. Miniature tables range in size from tabletop 1 √ó 1.6 ft to free-standing 2.5 √ó 5 ft models, and use scaled-down cues and balls.

He is the central figure in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's 1975 book Montaillou, a pioneering work of microhistory. Since then he has appeared in a number of other histories, and as the villain in the fictional work The Good Men by Charmaine Craig. ==The family== Pierre was the son of Pons and Mengarde Clergue. The Clergues were a family of wealthy peasants, by far the wealthiest in Montaillou and their power extended throughout the region. Pierre, the head of the family after the death of his father, became the priest of the village. His brother Bernard Clergue became the local bayle, the enforcer of laws and collector of taxes. The Clergue brothers thus had a central role in being the representatives of both religious and secular power in the town. As one of the few educated men in town Pierre Clergue also served as a notary and performed other such tasks. ==Catharism== Despite being a priest in a Roman Catholic church Pierre Clergue was a staunch Albigensian having been converted by the parfait Guillaume Authi√©. For many years he played an important role by convincing the inquisition to ignore Montaillou, despite its being filled with heretics. This changed in about 1300, when Pierre Clergue began to inform on some members of his parish. In 1308 he played a central role in the inquisition's move to arrest the entire adult population of the town. Pierre decided which villagers would be freed and which punished. He used this power to satisfy personal grievances. During this time he and his brother continued to provide shelter and aid to certain Cathars. ==Affairs with women== Pierre Clergue is notable for his sexual appetite‚Äîcelibacy among priests was not strictly enforced in the Pyrenees at this time‚Äîhaving many mistresses over his long career as priest and virtual ruler of the town. The most important of these was B√©atrice de Planisoles who as ch√¢telaine was the nominal ruler of the village. Le Roy Ladurie lists nine women of Montaillou with whom he conducted affairs: Alaza√Øs Faur√©, Raymonde Faur√©, B√©atrice de Planisoles, Grazide Lizier, Alaza√Øs Az√©ma, Gaillarde Benet, Alissende Roussel, Mengarde Buscailh, Na Maragda, Jacotte den Tort, Raymonde Guilhou, and Esclarmonde Clergue, his sister in law. Pierre Clergue justified his philandering in several ways. Cathar doctrine taught that all sex was sinful, though more so within the confines of marriage, as the couple did not believe that they were erring. Since he expected to be absolved from all his sins upon his deathbed in the consolamentum he also felt he could sin without having to suffer for it. In 1320 Pierre Clergue was arrested by the inquisition under the orders of Bishop Jacques Fournier. Despite a concerted campaign of bribery and calling in favours by his brother Bernard, Pierre remained in prison and eventually died there. There is no record of his testifying before the Inquisition. ==References== *Le Roy Ladurie, Emmanuel. Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error. translated by Barbara Bray. New York: G.

At the age of twelve, as was the custom, he began tending his family's flock of sheep. Soon he was apprenticed in Tournon to a woman named Thomassia, likely a widow. He worked there for five or six years before returning home and living with his widowed mother and his four brothers Raymond, Guillaume, Bernard, and Pierre. Some years later he again left home to become a shepherd in Niort. Staying there two years he went to Mompret for a year before again returning to Montaillou. This time he moved in with Bernard and Guillemette Maurs and worked tending their flock, the couple's children being too young for the job. His brother Bernard was also residing there working as a ploughboy for the couple. The Maurs were Cathars and Jean was briefly converted to the heresy.

A grandson of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, he was commander in chief of the Russian Imperial Army units on the main front in the first year of the war, during the reign of his first cousin once removed, Nicholas II. Although held in high regard by Paul von Hindenburg, he struggled with the colossal task of leading Russia's war effort against Germany, including strategy, tactics, logistics and coordination with the government.Paul Robinson, \\"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914‚Äì1915.\\" Historian 75.3 (2013): 475-498. online After the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive in 1915, Tsar Nicholas replaced the Grand Duke as commander-in-chief of the army. He later was a successful commander-in-chief in the Caucasus region. He was briefly recognized as Tsar, Emperor of Russia in 1922 in areas controlled by the White Armies movement in the Russian Far East. ==Biography== ===Family=== A very tall man (1.98m / 6' 6\\"), Nicholas, named after his paternal grandfather, the emperor, was born as the eldest son to Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich of Russia (1831‚Äì1891) and Alexandra Petrovna of Oldenburg (1838‚Äì1900) on 18 November 1856. His father was the sixth child and third son born to Nicholas I of Russia and his Empress consort Alexandra Fedorovna of Prussia (1798‚Äì1860). Alexandra Fedorovna was a daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Nicholas's mother, his father's first cousin's daughter, was a daughter of Duke Konstantin Peter of Oldenburg (1812‚Äì1881) and Princess Therese of Nassau (1815‚Äì1871). His maternal grandfather was a son of Duke George of Oldenburg and Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Paul I of Russia and Maria Fedorovna of W√ºrttemberg. (Catherine was later remarried to William I of W√ºrttemberg.) His maternal grandmother was a daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (1792‚Äì1839) and Princess Luise of Saxe- Hildburghausen. The Duke of Nassau was a son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (1768‚Äì1816) and Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg. His paternal grandparents were Duke Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg (1735‚Äì1788) and Carolina of Orange-Nassau. Carolina was a daughter of William IV of Orange and Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange. Anne was the eldest daughter of George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach. Grand Duke Nicholas was the first cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II. To distinguish between them, the Grand Duke was often known within the Imperial family as \\"Nikolasha\\": the Grand Duke was also known as \\"Nicholas the Tall\\" while the Tsar was \\"Nicholas the Short\\". ===Early military career=== Grand Duke Nicholas in 1870 Grand Duke Nicholas was educated at the school of military engineers and received his commission in 1873. During the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78, he was on the staff of his father who was commander in chief. He distinguished himself on two occasions in this war. He worked his way up through all the ranks until he was appointed commander of the Guard Hussar Regiment in 1884. He had a reputation as a tough commander, yet one respected by his troops. His experience was more as a trainer of soldiers than a leader in battle. Nicholas was a very religious man, praying in the morning and at night as well as before and after meals. He was happiest in the country, hunting or caring for his estates. By 1895, he was inspector-general of the cavalry, a post he held for 10 years. His tenure has been judged a success with reforms in training, cavalry schools, cavalry reserves and the remount services. He was not given an active command during the Russo-Japanese War, perhaps because the Tsar did not wish to hazard the prestige of the Romanovs and because he wanted a loyal general in command at home in case of domestic disturbances. Thus, Nicholas did not have the opportunity to gain experience in battlefield command. Grand Duke Nicholas played a crucial role during the Revolution of 1905. With anarchy spreading and the future of the dynasty at stake, the Tsar had a choice of instituting the reforms suggested by Count Sergei Witte or imposing a military dictatorship. The only man with the prestige to keep the allegiance of the army in such a coup was the Grand Duke. The Tsar asked him to assume the role of a military dictator. In an emotional scene at the palace, Nicholas refused, drew his pistol and threatened to shoot himself on the spot if the Tsar did not endorse Witte's plan. This act was decisive in forcing Nicholas II to agree to the reforms. From 1905 to the outbreak of World War I, he was commander-in-chief of the St. Petersburg Military District. He had the reputation there of appointing men of humble origins to positions of authority. The lessons of the Russo-Japanese War were drilled into his men. ===Marriage=== Anastasia of Montenegro On 29 April 1907, Nicholas married Princess Anastasia of Montenegro (1869‚Äì1935), the daughter of King Nicholas I, and sister of Princess Milica, who had married Nicholas's brother, Grand Duke Peter. They had no children. She had previously been married to George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg, by whom she had two children, until their divorce in 1906. Since the Montenegrins were a fiercely Slavic, anti- Turkish people from the Balkans, Anastasia reinforced the Pan-Slavic tendencies of Nicholas. ===Hunting=== Nicholas was a hunter. Ownership of borzoi hounds was restricted to members of the highest nobility, and Nicholas's packs were well-known. As the Russian dogs perished in the Revolution of 1917‚Äì18, the borzoi of today are descended from gifts he made to European friends before World War I. In his lifetime, Nicholas and his dogs caught hundreds of wolves. A pair of borzoi were used, which caught the wolf, one on each side, while Nicholas dismounted and cut the wolf's throat with a knife. Hunting was his major recreation, and he traveled in his private train across Russia with his horses and dogs, hunting while on his rounds of inspection.Robinson 2014, pp. 29‚Äì35 ===World War I=== ====Eastern Front==== Grand Duke Nicholas in 1915 The Grand Duke had no part in the planning and preparations for World War I, that being the responsibility of General Vladimir Sukhomlinov and the general staff. On the eve of the outbreak of World War I, his first cousin once removed, the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, yielded to the entreaties of his ministers and appointed Grand Duke Nicholas to the supreme command. He was 57 years old and had never commanded armies in the field before, although he had spent almost all of his life on active service. His appointment was popular in the army. He was given responsibility for the largest army ever put into the field up to that date. He recalled that \\"... on receipt of the Imperial order, he spent much of his time crying because he did not know how to approach his new duties.\\" On 14 August 1914, he published the Manifesto to the Polish Nation.Robinson 2014, p. 140 Grand Duke Nicholas was responsible for all Russian forces fighting against Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey. He decided that their major effort must be in Poland, which thrust toward Germany like a salient, flanked by German East Prussia in the north, and Austro-Hungarian Galicia in the south. He planned to attend first to the flanks and when they were secure to invade German Silesia.Robinson 1914, pp. 135‚Äì141. In the north poor coordination of the two invading Russian armies resulted in the disaster of Tannenberg. In the south they conquered much of Galicia. Their subsequent move toward Silesia was blocked by the Battle of the Vistula River and Battle of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The Grand Duke picked and chose from the various plans offered by his generals. The Grand Duke begged for the artillery and ammunition they desperately lacked, so he could not embark on a coherent plan for victory. Nicholas came to power because of his royal status, and the tsar's belief that God was guiding his decision. He lacked the broad strategic sense and the ruthless drive to command all the Russian armies. His headquarters had a curiously calm atmosphere, despite the many defeats and the millions of casualties. He failed in terms of strategy and tactics, as well as logistics, selection of generals, maintaining morale, and gaining support from the government. On a personal level he was well liked by both officers and men.Paul Robinson, \\"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914‚Äì1915.\\" Historian 75.3 (2013): 475-498. online Peasants from a destroyed village in front of a shack constructed from debris, environs of Warsaw, 1915 After the Great Retreat of the Russian army, the Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Yanushkevich, with the full support of the Grand Duke Nicholas, ordered the army to devastate the border territories and expel the \\"enemy\\" nations within. The Russian authorities launched pogroms against German populations in Russian cities, massacred Jews in their towns and villages and deported 500,000 Jews and 250,000 Germans into the Russian interior. On 11 June 1915, a pogrom began against Germans in Petrograd, with over 500 factories, stores and offices looted and mob violence unleashed against Germans. The Russian military leadership regarded Muslims, Germans and Poles as traitors and spies, while Jews were considered political unreliables. As a result of his failure, the Tsar removed the Grand Duke as commander of the Russian armed forces on 21 August 1915 and took personal command.Robinson 2014, pp. 230‚Äì260 ====The Caucasus==== Upon his dismissal, the Grand Duke was immediately appointed commander-in-chief and viceroy in the Caucasus (replacing Count Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov). While the Grand Duke was officially in command, General Yudenich was the driving figure in the Russian Caucasus army, so the Grand Duke focused on the civil administration.Robinson 2014, pp. 261‚Äì291 Their opponent was the Ottoman Empire. While the Grand Duke was in command, the Russian army sent an expeditionary force through to Persia (now Iran) to link up with British troops. Also in 1916, the Russian army captured the fortress town of Erzerum, the port of Trebizond (now Trabzon) and the town of Erzincan. The Turks responded with an offensive of their own. Fighting around Lake Van swung back and forth, but ultimately proved inconclusive. It is reported that, while visiting the garrison of Kostroma he met Said Nursi, a famous Muslim cleric who was a prisoner of war. Because of Nursi's disrespectful attitude, Grand Duke gave an order to execute him. But after seeing Nursi's submission and faith about the sake of science, he changed his mind.Nursi, Said: Tarih√ße-i Hayat, Envar Ne≈üriyat, Istanbul 1995, pp. 114‚Äì115 (in Turkish)Tarih√ße-i Hayat, Sayfa 103. Risaleinurenstitusu.org. Retrieved on 16 September 2015. Nothing in the Grand Duke's record suggests that he would have even considered such a war crime. At the time he was urging the Tsar to set up colleges for training Muslim clerics so they would not have to study abroad.Robinson 2014, p. 286 Nicholas tried to have a railway built from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories with a view to bringing up more supplies for a new offensive in 1917. But, in March 1917, the Tsar was overthrown and the Russian army began slowly to fall apart. == Revolution == The February Revolution found Nicholas in the Caucasus. He was appointed by the Emperor, in his last official act, as the supreme commander in chief, and was wildly received as he journeyed to headquarters in Mogilev; however, within 24 hours of his arrival, the new prime minister, Prince Georgy Lvov, cancelled his appointment. Nicholas spent the next two years in the Crimean Peninsula, sometimes under house arrest, taking little part in politics. There appears to have been some sentiment to have him head the White Army forces active in southern Russia at the time, but the leaders in charge, especially General Anton Denikin, were afraid that a strong monarchist figurehead would alienate the more left leaning constituents of the movement. He and his wife escaped just ahead of the Red Army in April 1919, aboard the British Royal Navy battleship HMS Marlborough. On 8 August 1922, Nicholas was proclaimed as the emperor of all the Russias by the Zemsky Sobor of the Amur krai /Priamursk region in the Far East by White Army general Mikhail Diterikhs. Nicholas was already living abroad and consequently was not present. Two months later the Priamursk region fell to the Bolsheviks. == In exile == After a stay in Genoa as a guest of his brother-in-law, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, Nicholas and his wife took up residence in a small chateau at Choigny, 20 miles outside of Paris. He was under the protection of the French secret police as well as by a small number of faithful Cossack retainers. He became the symbolic figurehead of an anti-Soviet Russian monarchist movement, after assuming on 16 November 1924 the supreme command of all Russian forces in exile and thus of the Russian All-Military Union, which had been founded in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by Gen Pyotr Wrangel two months prior.‚Ä≥–ü–æ–º–∏—Ä—ô–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–º–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–∫–∏–º –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—ò–∞–º–∞: –ò–∑ —Ç–∞—ò–Ω–∏—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞ –£–î–ë–ï: –†–£–°–ö–ê –ï–ú–ò–ì–†–ê–¶–ò–à–ê –£ –à–£–ì–û–°–õ–ê–í–ò–à–ò 1918‚Äì1941.‚Ä≥ // Politika, 12 December 2017, p. 21. The monarchists made plans to send agents into Russia. Conversely a top priority of the Soviet secret police was to penetrate this monarchist organization and to kidnap Nicholas. They were successful in the former, infiltrating the group with spies. (OGPU later lured the anti-Bolshevik British master spy Sidney Reilly back to the Soviet Union (1925) where he was killed.) They did not succeed however, in kidnapping Nicholas. As late as June 1927, the monarchists were able to set off a bomb at the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas died on 5 January 1929 of natural causes on the French Riviera, where he had gone to escape the rigors of winter. He was originally buried in the church of St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cannes, France. In 2014 Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia (1922‚Äì2014) and Prince Dimitri Romanov (1926-2016) requested the transfer of his remains. The bodies of Nicholas Nikolaevich and his wife were re-buried in Moscow at the World War I memorial military cemetery in May 2015. ==Honours and awards== The Grand Duke received several Russian and foreign decorations:Russian Imperial Army - Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich (the Younger) of Russia (In Russian) ;Russian * 50px Knight 4th Class of the Order of St. George - 1877 * 50px Knight 3rd Class of the Order of St. George - 1914 * 50px Knight 2nd Class of the Order of St. George - 1915 * 50px Knight of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-called - 1856 * 50px Knight of the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky - 1856 * 50px Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Anna - 1856 * 50px Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Stanislaus - 1856 * 50px Knight of the Imperial Order of the White Eagle - 1856 * 50px Knight 1st Class of the Imperial Order of Saint Prince Vladimir - 1896 ;Foreign * 50px Knight of the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (Kingdom of Italy) - 18 June 1890 \\\\- during a visit to Russia of King Victor Emmanuel III * 50px Knight of the Order of the Elephant (Denmark) - 19 July 1909 * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer (Kingdom of Greece) * 50px Grand Cross of the House Order of the Wendish Crown (Mecklenburg) * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of Danilo I (Principality of Montenegro) * 50px Grand Cross of the House and Merit Order of Peter Frederick Louis (Grand Duchy of Oldenburg) - 7 December 1856 * 50px Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle (Kingdom of Prussia) * 50px Pour le M√©rite (military) - 19 November 1878 (Kingdom of Prussia) * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the Cross of Takovo (Kingdom of Serbia) * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania (Kingdom of Romania) * 50px Grand Cross of the Royal Hungarian Order of St. Stephen (Austria-Hungary) - 1896\\"A Szent Istv√°n Rend tagjai\\" * 50px Grand Cross of the Legion d'Honneur (France) - January 1897 * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the W√ºrttemberg Crown (Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg) - 1882 Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des K√∂nigreich W√ºrttemberg (1907), \\"K√∂nigliche Orden\\" p. 28 == Ancestry == ==In popular culture== Grand Duke Nicholas was portrayed in the 1971 film Nicholas and Alexandra by Harry Andrews, and in the 1974 television drama Fall of Eagles by John Phillips . == References == ==Sources== * * Robinson, Paul. \\"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914‚Äì1915,\\" Historian (Fall 2013) 75#3 pp 475‚Äì498 online *Fromkin, David.

At the height of his popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, his Christian Crusade ministry was broadcast on more than 500 radio stations and 250 television stations. He promoted an anti-Communist, segregationist message as well as evangelizing, and founded a radio station, monthly newspaper, and a college in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to support his ministries. In 1974, several students at his American Christian College accused Hargis of sexual misconduct;James Stuart Olson, Historical Dictionary of the 1970s, Greenwood Publishing, 1999, p. 187 . however, the Tulsa district attorney found no evidence or wrongdoing. Hargis went into partial retirement, and the college closed in 1977. He continued to publish his newspaper and write books. ==Biography== Hargis was adopted by a railroad employee, Jimmie Earsel Hargis, and his wife, Laura Lucille Hargis. By the time the boy was ten, his adoptive mother was in poor health and close to death. The boy had been baptized, and had few pleasures other than the family's daily Bible readings because his family was too poor during the Great Depression to own a radio.Adam Bernstein, \\"Evangelist Billy James Hargis Dies; Spread Anti-Communist Message\\", Washington Post, November 30, 2004. When his mother was hospitalized, Hargis promised to devote himself to God if she was spared from death. She recovered and, at age 17, Hargis was ordained in the Disciples of Christ denomination, even before his completing Bible college. After a few years, he left his pastorate for a ministry of radio preaching.Michael Carlson, \\"Billy James Hargis. Rightwing preacher laid low by sexual scandal\\", The Guardian, December 10, 2004. In 1943, Hargis entered Ozark Bible College in Bentonville, Arkansas, and studied there for one year. By 1947, when he became concerned about Communism, he was pastor of the First Christian Church in Sapulpa, a city west of Tulsa. He later received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Pikes Peak Bible Seminary in 1957 and a theology degree from Burton College and Seminary in Colorado in 1958. In 1950, he established an organization called the Christian Crusade. In the mid-1950s, Hargis was closely associated with the evangelist Carl McIntire and in the early 1960s Hargis had developed a close relationship with the resigned United States Army Major General Edwin Walker, but he increasingly went his own way in preaching anti-Communism. His targets included government and popular singers.Glenn H. Utter & John W. Storey, The Religious Right: A Reference Handbook, ABC-CLIO Ltd 2001, 2nd edition, pp. 6f, 92. . In 1957, the Disciples of Christ denomination withdrew his ordination because he was attacking other churches in his anti-Communist crusade, but by then Hargis' radio program was bringing in $1 million annually and he had established a degree of both financial and theological independence. In 1960, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated Hargis, suspecting him of being linked to recent bombing attacks on Little Rock public schools and of planning to bomb Philander Smith College. No evidence was found and no charges were filed. On May 31, 1961, Bob Jones University honored Hargis with an honorary Doctor of Laws.Sword of the Lord, June 23, 1961, p. 4. In 1966, Hargis founded a congregation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called the Church of the Christian Crusade. This was part of a complex of organizations which he founded in Tulsa, including the American Christian College in 1971, and the Christian Crusade monthly newspaper. ==Marriage and family== Hargis married Betty Jane Secrest of Sciotoville, Ohio in 1951. They had three daughters and a son, Billy James Hargis II, who died on September 9, 2013 and Bryan Joseph Hargis who died in infancy. His grandson, Billy James Hargis III, was born on May 10, 1989, and currently resides in Houston, Texas. ==Career== Hargis' motto was \\"All I want to do is preach Jesus and save America.\\" Drawing on premillennialist theology, Hargis believed national and world events were part of a cosmic struggle, where the ultimate actors were Christ and Satan. While communism represented the latter, the United States represented the former. He used this as justification for why the United States should return to what he believed were its founding Christian ideals. ===Positions and activities=== Hargis preached on cultural issues: against sex education and Communism, and for the return of prayer and Bible reading to public schools, long before the rise of the late 20th century Religious Right. His belief in conspiracy theories led to a belief that the government, the media, and pop culture figures were promoting \\"communism\\" in the late 1960s. (His subordinate, Rev. David Noebel, wrote the short work, \\"Communism, Hypnotism and the Beatles\\" (1965), which he expanded into \\"Rhythm, Riots and Revolution\\" the following year. Both pamphlets were published by the Christian Crusade.) Hargis claimed to have written a speech for Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, notable for his anti-Communist crusade. Hargis was a member of the John Birch Society and strongly favored segregation, arguing that desegregation violated the Eighth Commandment by allowing the government to steal from one's property. He also accused Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of being Communist-educated, and published Dr. James D. Bales' anti-King book, The Martin Luther King Story. Like many other Americans on the hard right, he said that the United States should get out of the United Nations and get the United Nations out of the U.S. He was also opposed to the crusades of rival evangelist Billy Graham and endorsed George Wallace, in the 1968 presidential election in part because of Republican nominee Richard Nixon's relationship with Graham. Along with his friend Carl McIntire, who was staunchly anti- Catholic, Hargis was one of the most influential people in a movement later known as the \\"Old Christian Right.\\" However, both Hargis and McIntire would soon lose influence by failing to capitalize on the fact that most Catholics in America were staunchly anti-communist. Hargis addressed audiences with his revival style. He was the author of at least 100 books, including The Far Left, and Why I Fight for a Christian America. In addition, his organization published a pamphlet on sex education, entitled \\"Is the School House the Proper Place to Teach Raw Sex?\\", by Gordon V. Drake, the Christian Crusade's educational director. In 1964, Hargis supported Republican Senator Barry Goldwater in that year's presidential race. However, Goldwater would suffer a significant defeat in the election and the Old Christian Right soon began an irreversible downward spiral. A movement known as the New Christian Right, which sought to capitalize on the mistakes of the Old Christian Right by embracing Roman Catholicism, was formed in the late 1970s following the loss of the Vietnam War. Many had feared the defeat in Vietnam would revive the Counterculture of the 1960s. ==Founding of institutions== In 1950, Hargis founded the Christian Crusade, an interdenominational movement. In 1964, the Internal Revenue Service alleged that Hargis' involvement in political matters violated the terms of the Internal Revenue Code for religious institutions and withdrew the tax-exempt status of the Christian Crusade. Richard Viguerie a pioneer in using direct mail in the 1970s and 1980s to support conservative movements and their causes began his career working for Hargis. Viguerie developed direct mail databases to solicit small donations in an average of 2000 mailings a day from a wide field of ideologically supporters. At the time, Hargis had reported that the average contribution to his movement was $4, from a constituency of 250,000 donors, and it was receiving $1 million annually. In association with his Christian Crusade Hargis published the monthly Christian Crusade Newspaper, with a circulation of 55,000, and Weekly Crusade. He founded the David Livingstone Missionary Foundation, which operated hospitals, orphanages, leprosy villages, medical vans, and mission services in South Korea, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines, and Africa. Hargis founded American Christian College in Tulsa during 1971, to teach Christian principles and provide an alternative to perceived left-wing and counterculture influences. When asked what was taught there, Hargis said, \\"anti-communism, anti-socialism, anti-welfare state, anti-Russia, anti-China, a literal interpretation of the Bible, and states' rights.\\"\\"Billy James Hargis\\", The Economist, December 16, 2004, accessed May 26, 2011. Concerned with the liberalization of abortion laws following the United States Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, Hargis launched Americans Against Abortion in 1973 with David Noebel as its leader.\\"God's Own Party The Making of the Religious Right\\", p. 117. . Daniel K. Williams. Oxford University Press. 2010. Noebel went on to author his book Slaughter of the Innocents that was published by the American Christian College within months of the Roe v. Wade decision, and wrote many provocative articles for fundamentalist publications on the abortion issue. He also started a television show Billy James Hargis and his All-American Kids. It was sold to independent television stations. Students from the college performed in the musical group. ==Scandal== In 1974, when Hargis was nearly fifty, he was forced to resign as president of American Christian College because of allegations that he had seduced college students. Two of his students claimed that they had had sexual relations with Hargis ‚Äî one was female, one was male. Other students corroborated the story. Hargis denied the sexual allegations until his death, both publicly and in his autobiography, My Great Mistake (1985). The account was reported by Time in 1976, along with other alleged incidents at Hargis' farm outside of Neosho, Missouri, and while on tour with his All American Kids musical group.\\"The Sins of Billy James\\" Time, February 16, 1976. The Tulsa district attorney investigated but never brought charges against Hargis. The local newspapers, the Tulsa World and the defunct Tulsa Tribune, declined to publish the accusations. When Hargis stepped down as president of American Christian College, he was succeeded by former vice-president David Noebel. In February 1975, Hargis tried to regain control of the college, but was rejected by its board. By September he returned to his other ministries. They were said to welcome him after he repented. As Jess Pedigo, president of the David Livingstone Society said, \\"There was a danger of bankruptcy.\\" Hargis did not give the deed to the property to the college for months after leaving, which prevented it from gaining regional accreditation. In addition, he withheld the fundraising lists, which previously all the organizations had shared. With declining enrollment after the scandal became public, the college closed in 1977. In 1985 Hargis told a Tulsa reporter, \\"I was guilty of sin, but not the sin I was accused of.\\" About 1976, he eventually retreated to his Missouri farm, where he continued to work, resuming a greatly diminished ministry, issuing daily and weekly radio broadcasts. He continued to publish the monthly newspaper, The Christian Crusade Newspaper, and wrote numerous books. In his final years, suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and a series of heart attacks, Hargis died in a Tulsa nursing home on November 27, 2004 at the age of seventy-nine. ==Legacy== His son, Billy James Hargis II, continued his ministry until his own death. Hargis' organization and college also established and operated Tulsa radio station KBJH (FM 98.5) in the early 1970s. After the college's closing and the demise of his ministry, the station was sold to Epperson Broadcasting. Hargis and his church owned and operated a small AM radio station in Port Neches, Texas, from 1980 to the early 1990s. KDLF radio (so named after the David Livingston Foundation) played Southern Gospel Music and religious programming until it was sold around 1993. In the latter days of Hargis' ownership, the radio station was LMAed to others, but required to play Hargis' hour-long program daily. Hargis' papers, described as \\"a goldmine for students of American politics,\\" are stored at the special collections department of the University of Arkansas Libraries in Fayetteville.\\"Hargis Papers Document Birth of Religious Right\\", University of Arkansas Daily Headlines, June 17, 2009.

A player racking the balls Pool is a classification of cue sports played on a table with six pockets along the , into which balls are deposited. \\"Pool billiards\\" is sometimes hyphenated and/or spelled with a singular \\"billiard\\". The WPA itself uses \\"pool-billiard\\" in its logo but \\"pool-billiards\\" in its legal notices. The organization compounds the words to result in an acronym of \\"WPA\\", \\"WPBA\\" having already been taken by the Women's Professional Billiards Association. Normal English grammar would not hyphenate here, and the term is actually a Germanism. A general rules booklet on pool games in general, including eight-ball, nine-ball and several others. Each specific pool game has its own name; some of the better-known include eight-ball, blackball, nine-ball, ten-ball, seven-ball, straight pool, one-pocket, and bank pool. The generic term pocket billiards is sometimes also used, and favored by some pool-industry bodies, but is technically a broader classification, including games such as snooker, Russian pyramid, and kaisa, which are not referred to as pool games. In most parts of the world, it is commonly referred to as just \\"billiards\\", analogous to the term \\"bowling\\" being commonly used to refer to the game of ten-pin bowling. There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards, such as American four-ball billiards, bottle pool, cowboy pool, and English billiards. ==Etymology== Michael Phelan's billiard saloon in New York City, January 1, 1859. The etymology of \\"pool\\" is uncertain. The Oxford English Dictionary speculates that \\"pool\\" and other games with collective stakes is derived from the French poule (literally translated \\"hen\\"), in which the poule is the collected prize; alternatively it could derive from the verb to pool in the sense of combining objects or stakes. The oldest use of the word \\"pool\\" to describe a billiards-like game was made in 1797 in a Virginia newspaper. The OED defines it as generally \\"any of various types of billiards for two or more players\\" but goes on to note that the first specific meaning of \\"a game in which each player uses a cue ball of a distinctive colour to pocket the balls of the other player(s) in a certain order, the winner taking all the stakes submitted at the start of the contest\\" is now obsolete, and its other specific definitions are all for games that originate in the United States. In the British Empire for most of the nineteenth through early twentieth century, pool referred specifically to the game of life pool. Although skittle pool is played on a pocketless carom billiards table, the term pool later stuck to all new games of pocket billiards as the sport gained in popularity in the United States, and so outside the cue sports industry, which has long favored the more formal term pocket billiards, the common name for the sport has remained pool. The OxfordDictionaries.com definition no longer even provides the obsolete meaning found in the print edition, and refers only to the typical game \\"using two sets [each] of seven coloured and numbered balls ... with one black ball and a white cue ball\\" on a table with pockets. ==History== With the exception of one-pocket, games typically called \\"pool\\" today are descended from two English games imported to the United States during the 19th century. The first was English billiards which became American four-ball billiards, essentially the same game but with an extra red to increase scoring opportunities. It was the most popular billiards game in the mid-19th century until dethroned by the carom game straight rail. American four-ball tournaments tried switching to carom tables in the 1870s but this did not save it from being doomed to obscurity, the last professional tournament was held in 1876. Cowboy pool is a surviving member of this group of games. The second and more influential game was pyramid pool. By 1850 a variant called fifteen-ball pool became popular. Both games were supplanted by continuous pool in 1888, the immediate forerunner of straight pool (1910). New games introduced at the turn of the 20th century include Kelly pool and eight-ball. The distinctive appearance of pool balls with their many colors and division between solid and striped balls came about by 1889. Prior to this, object balls were uniformly deep-red and differentiated only by numbers. English pyramid pool and life pool players were the first to adopt balls with different colors. The stripes were the last addition. ==Equipment== A pool table diagram Pool is played on a six pocket table. Modern pool tables generally range in size from by , to by . The balls range from in diameter to in diameter.Officially but somewhat poorly translated version, from the French original. Under the WPA/BCA (see below) equipment specifications, the weight may be from 5.5 to 6 oz. (156-170 g) with a diameter of 2.25 in. (57.15 mm), plus or minus 0.005 in. (0.127 mm).\\"WPA Tournament Table & Equipment Specifications\\" , World Pool-Billiard Association, November 2001. Modern coin-operated pool tables generally use one of three methods to distinguish and return the cue ball to the front of the table while the numbered balls return to an inaccessible receptacle until paid for again: the cue ball is larger and heavier than the other balls, or denser and heavier, or has a magnetic core. Modern cue sticks are generally long for pool while cues prior to 1980 were designed for straight pool and had an average length of . By comparison, carom billiards cues are generally shorter with larger tips, and snooker cues longer with smaller tips. ==Game types== ===Racked games=== These are games descended from the early 19th century games of pyramid pool and fifteen-ball pool which required balls to be racked due to the large number of them on the table. Of the other pyramid traditions of Continental Europe, only Russian pyramid survives. Snooker, originally known as snooker's pool, can be considered a member of this family. One-pocket initially did not require a rack, it was originally played with just three balls. Conversely, Chicago dispensed with a rack when it emerged from 61. The following games share common equipment such as tables and balls. ====Rotation games==== One of many correct nine-ball racks: the 1 ball at the centered over the , the 9 ball at center, the other balls placed randomly, and all balls touching. Rotation games require players to make legal contact with the lowest numbered ball on the table or a foul is called. The earliest rotation game, originally known as 61, started off as a variant of fifteen-ball pool during the mid-nineteenth century. The name \\"rotation\\" came from how the balls were placed around the table in its unracked offshoot Chicago. 61 has spawned many variations of its own such as American rotation, seven-ball, nine-ball, ten- ball, and Kelly pool. Of these, nine-ball is the most popular and the predominant professional game with ten-ball as its greatest competitor. There are many local and regional tours and tournaments that are contested with nine-ball. The World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) and its American affiliate, the Billiard Congress of America (BCA), publish the World Standardized Rules. The European professional circuit has instituted rules changes to make it more difficult to achieve a legal break shot. The largest nine-ball tournaments are the independent US Open Nine-ball Championship and the WPA World Nine-ball Championship for men and women. Male professionals have a rather fragmented schedule of professional nine-ball tournaments. The United States Professional Poolplayers Association (UPA) has been the most dominant association of the 1990s and 2000s. A hotly contested event is the annual Mosconi Cup, which pits invitational European and U.S. teams against each other in one-on-one and nine-ball matches over a period of several days. The Mosconi Cup games are played under the more stringent European rules, as of 2007. Three-ball originated as a rotation game but the folk rules have changed considerably since the 1980s. It is now generally played such that the player at turn continues shooting until all the balls are pocketed, and the player to do so in the fewest shots wins. It dispenses with some fouls common to both nine- and eight-ball. ====Straight pool==== Also known as 14.1 continuous, this game originated as a slight modification of continuous pool, another offshoot of fifteen-ball pool. The shooter may attempt to shoot at any object ball on the table. The goal is to reach a set number of points determined by agreement before the game. One point is scored for each object ball pocketed where no is made. A typical game might require a player to score 100 points to win. In professional competition, straight pool is usually played to 125 points. Straight pool is a ' game, meaning the player must indicate the intended object ball and pocket on every shot. ====Eight-ball==== In the United States, the most commonly played pool game is eight-ball, which appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century. The goal of eight-ball, which is played with a full rack of fifteen balls and the cue ball, is to claim a suit (commonly stripes or solids in the US, and reds or yellows in the UK), pocket all of them, then legally pocket the 8 ball, while denying one's opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the 8 ball early by accident. In the United Kingdom the game is commonly played in pubs, and it is competitively played in leagues on both sides of the Atlantic. The most prestigious tournaments including the World Open are sponsored and sanctioned by the International Pool Tour. Rules vary widely from place to place (and between continents to such an extent that British-style eight-ball pool/blackball is properly regarded as a separate game in its own right). Pool halls in North America are increasingly settling upon the World Pool-Billiard Association International Standardized Rules. But tavern eight-ball (also known as \\"\\"), typically played on smaller, coin-operated tables and in a \\"winner keeps the table\\" manner, can differ significantly even between two venues in the same city. The growth of local, regional and national amateur leagues may alleviate this confusion eventually. ====One-pocket==== One-pocket owes its origins to 18th century cramp (handicapped) games. It is a strategic game for two players in which each player is assigned one of the corner pockets on the table. This is the only pocket into which he can legally pocket balls. The first player to pocket the majority of the balls (8) in his pocket wins the game. The game requires far more defensive strategy than offensive strategy, much unlike eight-ball, nine-ball, or straight pool. Most times, accomplished players choose to position balls near their pocket instead of trying to actually pocket them. This allows them to control the game by forcing their opponent to be on defense instead of taking a low percentage shot that could result in a loss of game. These low percentage shots are known as \\"flyers\\" by one-pocket aficionados. ====Bank pool==== Bank pool can be played with a full rack (can be a long game), but is more typically played with nine balls (frequently called \\"nine-ball bank\\"). The balls are racked in nine-ball formation, but in no particular order. The object of the game is simple: to be the first player to bank five balls in any order (eight balls when played with a full rack). Penalties and fouls are similar to one pocket in that the player committing the foul must spot a ball for each foul. This must be done before the incoming player shoots. ===Artistic pool=== Artistic pool is the competitive discipline of trick shots inspired by its carom equivalent. Played on pool or snooker tables, players must complete a set number of shots of varying difficulty. ===Hybrid carom or obstacle games=== Cowboy pool and bottle pool are games involving only a few balls which are placed at specific spots on the table. Elements of their games go back to the eighteenth century before balls needed to be racked. Bottle pool shares traits with pin billiards games such as Danish pin billiards. Cowboy pool is a descendant of English billiards. Kaisa is a similar game played with different equipment. ==Governing bodies== As a competitive sport, pool is governed internationally by the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), which has multi- national, regional affiliates comprising the All Africa Pool Association (AAPA), Asian Pocket Billiard Union (APBU, including the Middle East), Billiard Congress of America (BCA, Canada and the US), Confederaci√≥n Panamericana de Billar (CPB, Latin America and Caribbean), European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF, including Russia and the Near East), and Oceania Pocket Billiard Association (OPBA, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands). The WPA represents pool in the World Confederation of Billiards Sports, which in turn represents all forms of cue sports (including carom billiards and snooker) in the International Olympic Committee. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Pub games ja:„Éó„Éº„É´„Éì„É™„É§„Éº„Éâ ","title":"Pool (cue sports)"},{"id":"1272006","text":"Darren Bennett (born 9 January 1965) is a former Australian rules football player and American football punter in the National Football League. As an Australian rules footballer, he played for East Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) between 1982 and 1987 and then in the Australian Football League (AFL) for the West Coast Eagles and the Melbourne Football Club. He was most successful at Melbourne, where he was named as one of the club's 150 Heroes of the last 150 years, kicking 208 goals from just 74 games for the club. As an American football player, following a three club career in the National Football League he is regarded as one of the greatest players of the 1990s and a member of the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team.NFL's All- Decade Team of the 1990s ‚Äì SPECIAL TEAMS/COACHES This combination made him notable as arguably the most successful of the Australian sportsmen linked to professional American Football in history. ==Australian rules football career== Bennett grew up in Perth, Western Australia where he began playing Australian rules football, first playing senior football with East Fremantle in the West Australian Football League. His career with the Sharks was severely affected by injuries to his knee, which kept him out for over a season during 1985 and 1986 ‚Äì in the interim denying him a WAFL premiership. However, training with former star Harry Neesham allowed Bennett to be fit for the 1986 finals,Marsh, David; 'The Hard Work Brings Reward'; The West Australian, 8 September 1986, p. 76 and in the second semi he became the first player ever to score ten goals in a WA(N)FL final.Atkinson, Graeme and Hanlon, Michael; 3AW Book of Footy Records: All the Great Players, Matches, Goals, Kicks, Brawls and Sensations from More Than 100 Years of Aussie Rules in Australia; p. 138.

A serious knee injury curtailed his career with the Eagles after four games. Released by the Eagles, at the end of the 1988 season, he was drafted by the Melbourne Demons with the 13th selection in the 1988 VFL Draft. In both 1989 (34 goals) and 1990 (87 goals) Bennett led the Demons' goal kicking. Bennett was known for kicking long goals, torpedo punts and taking strong marks. Bennett was regarded as one of Melbourne's finest players in the early 1990s. But injuries caught up with him, and he played just two games in 1993. After the season, Bennett quietly retired from the Australian Football League, having totalled 78 games and 215 goals. Bennett participated in an exhibition match at SkyDome in Toronto in 1989; it is believed that he was first exposed to American football during that trip. ==Statistics== : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1987 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  19  4  7  5  24  0  24  17  1  1.8  1.3  6.0  0.0  6.0  4.3  0.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1988 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  19  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1989 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  19  13  34  30  90  27  117  69  6  2.6  2.3  6.9  2.1  9.0  5.3  0.5 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1990 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  19  23  87  54  201  31  232  135  8  3.8  2.3  8.7  1.3  10.1  5.9  0.3 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1991 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  19  22  55  37  177  46  223  132  2  2.5  1.7  8.0  2.1  10.1  6.0  0.1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1992 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  19  14  28  23  76  13  89  54  7  2.0  1.6  5.4  0.9  6.4  3.9  0.5 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1993 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  19  2  4  3  12  2  14  8  0  2.0  1.5  6.0  1.0  7.0  4.0  0.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 78 ! 215 ! 152 ! 580 ! 119 ! 699 ! 415 ! 24 ! 2.8 ! 1.9 ! 7.4 ! 1.5 ! 9.0 ! 5.3 ! 0.3 } ==NFL career== He married in 1993 and went on his honeymoon to California, where he contacted the coaching staff of the San Diego Chargers and asked for a tryout. He wound up impressing the Chargers sufficiently that he was placed on the team's practice squad for the 1994 season. During the spring of 1995, the Chargers sent him to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe, where he led the league in net punting average and earned all-league honours. That fall, he became the Chargers' regular punter. In his rookie season, he finished second in the NFL in punting average and made the AFC Pro Bowl team. He went on to establish himself as arguably the best punter in the NFL for the rest of the 1990s. Despite playing in the league for only half of that decade, he was named as the punter on the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 1990s. On 7 August 1999 Bennett returned home with his adoptive sport and took part in Australia's first American Bowl in Sydney's brand new Stadium Australia versus the Denver Broncos. Bennett was named to another Pro Bowl team in 2000, and continued to be one of the league's leading punters well into the 21st century. Going into the 2004 season, he had averaged 43.8 yards per punt, averaged 27 punts per season inside the 20-yard- line, and had only three blocked punts in his career (one of which happened when the Chargers had only 10 men on the field). As a former Aussie rules player, and considerably larger than most specialist kickers in American football (6'5\\"/1.96 m, 235 lb/106.5 kg), he did not shy away from physical contact on special teams. This willingness to hit, rare among kickers, was never more evident than when he knocked an opposing punt returner out cold in his rookie season. In 2004, after 144 games for the Chargers, he signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings, where he spent one season until being injured in pre-season and then cut in September 2005. However, he was recalled by the team in December 2005, after starting punter Chris Kluwe (who had replaced him on the Vikings squad) was injured; Bennett was signed to a temporary contract. He played one game before being released by the Vikings, having made what was likely his final NFL appearance after 15 Vikings games and a total of 159 NFL games. Bennett is also credited for the introduction into the NFL of the \\"Aussie Rules kick\\" or \\"Drop punt\\" as it is known in Australia. The technique was instrumental in the advancement of Australians into the NFL, and currently half of the punters in the NFL make use of the Aussie Rules punt in pooch-punt situations. Bennett was named to the San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team in 2009. He was inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame in 2012, the first time the Chargers allowed fans to decide the newest member. ==Personal== Bennett and his wife Rosemary reside in San Diego and became US citizens in 2010. They have two sons, one of whom suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Bennett is deeply involved with charities associated with that disease. Bennett coaches high school kickers and punters in San Diego and mentors High School, NCAA and NFL players. ==References== ==External links== * *Official Minnesota Vikings profile * *Darren Bennett's personal website *DemonWiki profile Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:People from Fremantle Category:American football punters Category:Melbourne Football Club players Category:West Coast Eagles players Category:Amsterdam Admirals players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:East Fremantle Football Club players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Australian players of American football Category:People educated at Applecross Senior High School Category:Footballers who switched code Category:Sportsmen from New South Wales Category:Sportspeople from Sydney Category:Australian rules football players that played in the NFL ","title":"Darren Bennett (football player)"},{"id":"1272007","text":"Onslow College is a state co-educational secondary school located in Johnsonville, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand.

Tawa is often the dominant canopy species in lowland forests in the North Island and the north east of the South Island, but will also often form the subcanopy in primary forests throughout the country in these areas, beneath podocarps such as kahikatea, matai, miro and rimu. Individual specimens may grow up to 30 metres or more in height with trunks up to 1.2 metres in diameter, and they have smooth dark bark. The word \\"tawa\\" is the Maori name for the tree. Tawa trees produce small inconspicuous flowers followed by 2‚Äì3.5 cm long fruit of a dark red plum colour. With such large fruits the tawa is notable for the fact that it relies solely on the New Zealand pigeon (kerer≈´) and (where present) the North Island kokako for dispersal of its seed. These are the only remaining birds from New Zealand's original biota large enough to eat the fruits of this tree and pass the seeds through their guts and excrete them unharmed. Tawa can also support significant epiphyte gardens in their canopies, which are one of the few habitats known to be frequented by the enigmatic, arboreal striped skink. This tree gives its name to a northern suburb of Wellington, Tawa. ==Uses== Tawa foliage The wood of this tree can be used for attractive and resilient floorboarding. Although largely protected in conservation areas and by robust environmental legislation, licences are occasionally granted for the odd fallen tree to be milled for its timber. The kernel of the tawa berry was used by MƒÅori as food. The berries were steamed in an umu (earth oven) for two days, then washed to remove the turpentine-flavoured pulp. The dried kernels were stored. When required, they were soaked in hot water and pounded, sometimes flavouring being added to the mashed meal. ==See also== *Beilschmiedia tarairi (taraire) == References == *H.H. Allan, 1961.

Their primary products are loudspeakers and associated audio electronics for professional, home, automotive and multimedia applications. Engineers at Western Electric, who later formed Altec Services Company, developed the technology for motion picture sound that was introduced in 1927, with the release of The Jazz Singer. Originally, Altec Services Company serviced the theater sound systems the company founders had helped develop. In 1941 the Altec Services Company purchased the nearly bankrupt Lansing Manufacturing Company and melded the two names, forming the Altec Lansing Corporation, and with the manufacturing capabilities of the former Lansing Manufacturing Company, they quickly expanded into manufacturing horn loudspeakers. In 1958 the Altec Lansing Corporation was purchased by James Ling who made it part of LTV Ling Altec. LTV spun off Altec which it loaded down with debt first. By 1974, the company was saddled with debt. It was reorganized under Chapter 11 as Altec Corporation and continued for 10 years. Altec filed a second bankruptcy. In 1984, Gulton Industries purchased the brand out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Gulton was acquired by Mark IV Audio.Since then, there has been a string of owners, purchased in 1986 by Sparkomatic, with the Pro equipment still made by Mark IV Audio, Mark IV sold out to Telex, who closed down the Pro division and folded its products into Electro-Voice. In 2005 Altec Lansing Technologies was acquired by Plantronics, 2009 bought by Prophet Equity, and has been owned since 2012 by the Infinity Group, a company which acquires struggling companies. Popular loudspeakers included the Altec Lansing Duplex 600-series coaxial loudspeaker, studio monitors from the 1940s to the 1980s, and the Altec \\"Voice of the Theatre\\" line of loudspeakers widely used in movie theaters, concert halls, and also in rock concerts from the 1960s to the 1990s, such as custom designs used at Woodstock Festival. ==History== ===Conception and early products=== In 1930 AT&T;'s Western Electric established a division to install and service loudspeakers and electronic products for motion-picture use. Named Electrical Research Products, Inc. and commonly referred to by the acronym ERPI, it became the target of an anti- trust suit brought by Stanley K. Oldden. By 1936, Western Electric had shed its audio-equipment manufacturing and sales division, bought by International Projector and Motiograph, and was looking to dissolve the associated service division. ERPI was purchased as part of a consent decree in 1937 by a group of ERPI executives, including George Carrington, Sr., Leon Whitney \\"Mike\\" Conrow, Bert Sanford, Jr., and Alvis A. Ward, with funding from three Wall Street investors. They reincorporated as \\"Altec Service Company\\", the \\"Altec\\" standing for \\"all technical\\". Company executives promised they would never make or sell audio equipment. The Altec Services Company purchased the bankrupt Lansing Manufacturing Company and melded the two names, forming the Altec Lansing Corporation on May 1, 1941. The first Altec Lansing power amplifier, Model 142B, was produced that same year. James Bullough Lansing worked for Altec Lansing, then in 1946 he left to found the James B. Lansing Company (JBL), another manufacturer of high-quality professional loudspeakers, which competed with Altec Lansing. Altec Lansing produced a line of professional and high-fidelity audio equipment, starting with a line of horn- based loudspeaker systems. First developed for use in motion-picture theaters, these products were touted for their fidelity, efficiency and high sound-level capability. Products included \\"biflex\\" speakers (where frequency range was increased by a flexible \\"decoupling\\" of a small center area of the speaker's cone from a larger \\"woofer\\" area) and the 604-series of coaxial speakers (which employed a high-efficiency compression driver mounted to the rear of the 604's low-frequency magnet, and exited through a multicellular horn that passed through center of the woofer's cone). Altec Lansing also made the Voice of the Theatre systems. The design resulted from a collaboration between John Hilliard and Jim Lansing. Douglas Shearer didn't hesitate to approve the Hilliard's proposal and authorized \\"any reasonable budget\\". Hilliard became the team leader of this new project. Hilliard immediately recruited Lansing Manufacturing, Robert Stephens, a design draftsman on MGM's staff, and Harry Kimball. The speaker was named the Shearer horn. Later on, a more refined model, the VOTT, was introduced. The smallest model, the A-7, used a medium- sized sectoral metal horn for high frequencies, which featured dividers (sectors) to provide control sound dispersion, plus a medium-sized wooden low- frequency enclosure, which functioned as a hybrid bass-horn/bass-reflex enclosure. The most often used Voice of the Theatre system was the A-4, many of which are still in use in motion picture theaters . The efficiency of all of these products originally provided high sound pressure levels from the limited amplifier power available at the time. The original Voice of the Theatre series included the A-1, A-2, A-4, and the A-5. The A-7 and A-8 were designed for smaller venues. Bill Hanley used Altec high frequency drivers and horns along with JBL bass drivers in his custom-built loudspeaker system for the Woodstock Festival in 1969. Some professional Altec Lansing products remained in use well into the 1990s. ===Altec Service Co. and Altec Lansing Professional audio products=== James Ling purchased the Altec Lansing Corporation from the ailing George Carrington, Sr., in 1958. By the time James Ling spun Altec Lansing off in 1974, his company, LTV-Ling-Altec, had heavy debts. In 1984, Gulton Industries, Inc., purchased the Altec Sound Products Division from the Altec Lansing Corporation, which was operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Included with the purchase were the tooling, parts and product inventories, distributor network, designs, patents, and assets of the Sound Products Division of Altec Lansing. The motion picture theater sound installation and repair business, Altec Service Co., was sold to J. Bruce Waddell, then head of Altec Service, and comptroller Robert V. Gandolfi. They established it as A.S.C. Technical Services in Richardson, Texas. The Altec Lansing Corporation was formed by Gulton Industries as part of the purchase and headquartered in Oklahoma City, the site of the University Sound factory built by Jimmy Ling when he moved there from White Plains, New York. Prior to the purchase, Altec Lansing had been headquartered in Yorba Linda, California, but it was moved as part of an effort to reduce operating costs. Altec Lansing Corporation produced professional audio products until 1995, when Telex Communications, who had purchased Altec Lansing's parent company, EVI Audio, Inc., in 1997, consolidated all of their electronics manufacturing facilities into one location in Minnesota. Altec Lansing Bookshelf loudspeakers ===Post-1996=== In 1996, Altec Lansing Technologies Multimedia established an R&D; center in Kfar Saba, Israel. The center, known as ALST Technical Excellence Center, cooperate with STMicroelectronics (ALST = Altec Lansing + STMicro) and focused on advanced multimedia technologies such as USB audio, surround sound and wireless audio as well as on handheld video. The center was closed in 2001 and the development activities moved to the Milford headquarters. In May 2000, Altec Lansing's Professional division was closed by Telex and the Altec Lansing was later sold to Sparkomatic and renamed Altec Lansing Technologies.http://www.audioheritage.org/html/profiles/lmco/iconic.htm The Altec Lansing Professional line was relaunched in April 2002 by Altec Lansing Technologies using a few former executives and sound engineers of the old Oklahoma City-based Altec Lansing Corporation, bringing Altec's professional and consumer products under the same roof for the first time since 1986. The company later dropped the professional audio products and Altec Lansing Professional's Oklahoma City offices were closed in late 2006 and all remaining activities relocated to the headquarters in Milford, Pennsylvania. An Altec Lansing PC speaker An Altec Lansing iM227 speaker from the Orbit M series On 30 April 2001 Altec Lansing Technologies launched their first line of headphones named as the AHP series. This series of headphones had various different designs and price ranges. In February 2004, Altec Lansing Technologies reissued a number of loudspeakers starting with the A7 Voice of the Theatre, manufactured in the US with some changes to the enclosure. Similarly, Altec Lansing Technologies reissued the 510, 508 and 305 loudspeakers. Very few were actually made. On July 11, 2005, Altec Lansing Technologies announced that it was to be acquired by Plantronics for approximately $166 million. On September 10, 2008, Altec Lansing Technologies went through a corporate makeover changing its name to Altec Lansing LLC and its logo from a \\"whirlpool\\" to an abstraction of a multi-cellular horn. On 1 October 2009 Altec Lansing LLC announced that it was to be acquired by Prophet Equity for approximately 18 million dollars. In July 2011, Altec Lansing LLC announced the opening of new West Coast headquarters in San Diego, California. Brendon Stead joined as Vice President of Product Management and Engineering. Stead was formerly the General Manager and Vice President of Harman International and Labtec. On October 18, 2012, The Infinity Group bought Altec Lansing for $17.5 million at auction thus saving the company from bankruptcy. Infinity specializes in acquiring and turning around struggling or bankrupt consumer brands. ==References== == External links == * *Website with history and pictures of Altec Lansing.

As a player, he was a defender from 1984 to 2001 and is most noted for his nine-year spell at Manchester United from 1989 until 1998. He also played for Middlesbrough and Darlington and was capped 22 times by England between 1988 and 1996. ==Club career== ===Middlesbrough=== Although born in Ramsgate, Kent, Pallister grew up in Norton, County Durham and supported nearby Middlesbrough F.C.Pally couldn't resist returning His footballing career started at non-league Billingham Town. At the age of 19 he joined his boyhood heroes Middlesbrough as a defender; making 156 League appearances over nearly five seasons, and helping them win promotion to the Football League Second Division in 1987, and First Division in 1988. He moved to Manchester United on 29 August 1989 for ¬£2.3 million. ===Manchester United=== Pallister's transfer broke the national record for a fee paid for a defender, as well as being the highest fee between British clubs, and the second highest fee to be paid by a British club (second only to Ian Rush's return to Liverpool from Juventus a year earlier). Pallister had the rare achievement of representing the English national side before appearing in the top flight; in 1988 when playing in the Second Division for Middlesbrough. Later that year he helped 'Boro win their second successive promotion and reach the First Division, just two years after they almost went out of business, but was unable to keep them there and they were relegated on the final day of the 1988‚Äì89 season. As one of the highest regarded defenders in England, his days at Ayresome Park were looking numbered as soon as Boro were relegated but he did begin the 1989‚Äì90 season still at the club in the Second Division before his move to United was completed. Although it was his excellent defensive displays that helped Manchester United to the league title along with Steve Bruce at the heart of the defence, forming one of the best central defensive partnerships in the club's history, in the 1992‚Äì93 season, he scored a memorable goal in the final home game of the season against Blackburn Rovers. Into stoppage time, with his team winning 2‚Äì1, he stepped up to drive a free-kick into the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty area. It was his first goal of the season and just about summed up an incredible season for Manchester United. He partnered Bruce in central defence for virtually every game until Bruce left United to join Birmingham City on a free transfer at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. The following campaign saw Pallister partnered with either Bruce's former understudy David May or with new signing Ronny Johnsen, and ended with United winning their fourth league title in five seasons. A highlight of this season for Pallister was scoring twice in a 3‚Äì1 win against Liverpool at Anfield. The final season Pallister played for Manchester United was the 1997‚Äì98 season in which Manchester United came second in the league table, losing by one point to Arsenal. During his time at Manchester United, Pallister won the FA Cup in 1990, 1994 and 1996, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, the Football League Cup in 1992 and Premier League titles in 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997, amongst other honours. He was also part of the team that came second in the league in 1992, 1995 and 1998, as well as the team that finished runners-up in the League Cup in 1991 and 1994 and the FA Cup in 1995. By the time of his departure from Old Trafford after nine years, he was the only player to have collected winner's medals in all of the club's successes under Alex Ferguson's management, and second only to Brian McClair (who left United at the same time) he was the club's longest serving player. He also scored some crucial goals for United. He scored an equaliser in extra time against Crystal Palace in the 1994‚Äì95 FA Cup semi- final at Villa Park, forcing a replay which United won and in which Pallister made the scoresheet once again. In April 1997, he scored twice against Liverpool in a match billed the \\"title decider\\" which ended in a 3‚Äì1 United win at Anfield. These would be the last two goals he scored for the club, who went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons shortly afterwards. His first goal for United had come on 12 November 1989, as he scored their only goal in the 1‚Äì0 home win over Nottingham Forest in the First Division. ===Return to Middlesbrough=== With Pallister now aged 33 and United having signed Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven, Pallister was sold back to Middlesbrough in July 1998 for ¬£2.5 million, ¬£200,000 more than when he first moved to Manchester United. He was brought back to Teesside by manager Bryan Robson, who had played alongside Pallister at Old Trafford until 1994. He scored once against Southampton in 55 league appearances, as well as appearing in two FA Cup matches and four League Cup matches. His final playing season, in which Middlesbrough finished 14th in the table, was season 2000‚Äì01. He retired from playing due to a succession of injuries on 4 July 2001, at the age of 36, just three weeks after the appointment of Steve McClaren as manager following the departure of Robson. ==International career== ===B team=== Pallister made his debut for the England B team in May 1989; he started the match against Switzerland before being replaced by Alan McLeary in the 2‚àí0 win at Stadion Sch√ºtzenwiese. He made eight more appearances over the next three years with the last coming in the 3‚àí0 victory against France in February 1992. ===Senior=== Pallister made his debut for England in the friendly with Hungary in April 1988. He played the whole game in the goalless draw at N√©pstadion in Budapest. He had to wait over three years to make his competitive debut when he played in the win against Turkey during qualifying for UEFA Euro 1992. England qualified for the tournament finals in Sweden but Pallister was not selected in the squad. He featured in the United States Cup in June 1993; he started the defeats against the United States and Germany, and the draw against Brazil, as England finished last place in the group. Pallister played three matches as England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He was used sporadically over the next three years, mainly playing in friendlies, before making his last appearances in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Poland in the autumn of 1996. Overall, Pallister won 22 caps and scored no goals. ==Media career== He has since become a regular TV football pundit, appearing on the BBC and ITV. ==Personal life== In September 2010, Pallister became an Operations Director with former club Darlington. ==Honours== Manchester United *Premier League: 1992‚Äì93, 1993‚Äì94, 1995‚Äì96, 1996‚Äì97 *FA Cup: 1989‚Äì90, 1993‚Äì94, 1995‚Äì96 *Football League Cup: 1991‚Äì92 *FA Charity Shield: 1990 (shared), 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997 *European Cup Winners' Cup: 1990‚Äì91 *European Super Cup: 1991 Individual *Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year: 1989‚Äì90 *PFA Players' Player of the Year: 1991‚Äì92 *PFA Team of the Year: 1986‚Äì87 Third Division, 1987‚Äì88 Second Division, 1991‚Äì92 First Division, 1992‚Äì93 Premier League, 1993‚Äì94 Premier League, 1994‚Äì95 Premier League, 1997‚Äì98 Premier League ==References== ==External links== *Gary Pallister blog at 4sportsake.com * *Gary Pallister profile at thefa.com *Gary Pallister - Official Manchester United Website at manutd.com Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:England international footballers Category:England B international footballers Category:Billingham Town F.C. players Category:Middlesbrough F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:People from Ramsgate Category:People from Norton, County Durham ","title":"Gary Pallister"},{"id":"1272044","text":"Michael Clarke (born Michael James Dick; June 3, 1946 - December 19, 1993) was an American musician, best known as the drummer for the 1960s rock group the Byrds from 1964 to 1967. He died in 1993, at age 47, from liver failure, a direct result of more than three decades of heavy alcohol consumption. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Clarke was born in Spokane, Washington. His father was an artist and his mother was a musician. Clarke ran away from home when he was 17 years old and hitchhiked to California to become a musician. In legend, Clarke was said to have been discovered by Byrds' founder David Crosby while playing bongos on a beach. In fact he was discovered by singer- songwriter Ivan Ulz, in North Beach, San Francisco, and was introduced to other group members by Ulz. ===The Byrds=== Clarke was not an accomplished musician prior to joining the Byrds but he did have previous experience of drumming in his younger years before joining the group. He had played the drums before but, after joining the Byrds, not having a drum set, practiced on a makeshift kit of cardboard boxes and a tambourine, but he did have real drum sticks. According to lead guitarist Roger McGuinn's web site, Clarke was hired by McGuinn and Gene Clark (no relation) for his resemblance to Rolling Stones' guitarist Brian Jones. Clarke's strength as a drummer is considered to be illustrated by his jazz-oriented playing on the Byrds' \\"Eight Miles High\\", on the Fifth Dimension album. Unlike the other members of the Byrds, Clarke was not a prolific songwriter. His compositional contributions with the band encompass co-writing credits for the songs \\"Captain Soul\\", an instrumental from the Fifth Dimension album (based on Lee Dorsey's \\"Get Out Of My Life, Woman\\"), and \\"Artificial Energy\\" from The Notorious Byrd Brothers. He was also given an arrangement co-credit for two traditional songs that appeared on Fifth Dimension: \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\" and \\"John Riley\\" (although the latter is credited to Bob Gibson and songwriter/arranger Ricky Neff on the album itself). In August 1967, during the recording sessions for The Notorious Byrd Brothers album, Clarke walked out on the Byrds and was temporarily replaced by session drummers Jim Gordon and Hal Blaine. Clarke had recently become dissatisfied with his role in the band and didn't particularly like the new material that the songwriting members were providing. However, Clarke continued to honor his live concert commitments, appearing at a handful of shows during late August and early September 1967. Clarke returned from his self-imposed exile in time to contribute drums to the song \\"Artificial Energy\\" in early December 1967, but was subsequently fired from the band by McGuinn and bass player Chris Hillman once The Notorious Byrd Brothers album was completed. ===Hiatus from music, Dillard and Clark and Flying Burrito Brothers=== Flying Burrito Brothers (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Rick Roberts, Chris Hillman, Michael Clarke, Bernie Leadon After a short stint in Hawaii working in the hotel business and pursuing his interest in painting, Clarke played briefly with Gene Clark in Dillard and Clark, before following Hillman and Gram Parsons to country-rock pioneers The Flying Burrito Brothers, after their first album had been recorded. Clarke served with the Burritos between early 1969 and 1972, appearing with the band at the infamous Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by The Rolling Stones, in December 1969. During the 1974-1980 period, Clarke was a member of Firefall, followed by a period as the drummer for Jerry Jeff Walker, ending in 1982. ===Byrds lawsuit controversy and Hall of Fame induction=== Between 1983 and 1985, Clarke joined former Byrds' singer Gene Clark in The Firebyrds, a touring band which had been put together to promote Gene Clark's 1984 solo album Firebyrd. In 1985, following the breakup of The Firebyrds, Clarke and Clark again joined forces for a series of controversial shows billed as a \\"20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds\\". Among the other musicians involved in this project were John York, another ex-Byrd from the late 1960s line-up of the group, ex-Burritos and Firefall singer Rick Roberts, ex-member of The Beach Boys early 1970s line-up Blondie Chaplin, and Rick Danko, formerly of The Band. Many nightclubs simply shortened the billing to \\"The Byrds,\\" and the pair soon found themselves involved in acrimonious court battles with Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman over use of the group's name. The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991, where the original lineup played three songs together: \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" and \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\". Gene Clark died less than five months later, of a heart attack, on May 24, 1991.Byrds v. Byrds: A Byrds Celebration and A \\"Byrds Celebration\\" 1991-1997 . Byrd Watcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles; www.ebni.com. From 1987 until his death in 1993, Clarke toured as The Byrds featuring Michael Clarke. Skip Battin and John York, who had played with Roger McGuinn in later versions of the Byrds, also played at various points in The Byrds featuring Michael Clarke. Following the failure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman to obtain an injunction against Clarke, it was generally accepted that Clarke's continuing usage of the name was tantamount to ownership, particularly when not used by any other group member and where other group members, particularly Roger McGuinn, had repeatedly denied any interest in performing again under the Byrds name. Roger McGuinn later acknowledged that ownership of the Byrds name had likely passed to Michael Clarke's estate upon Clarke's death, but David Crosby secured the rights to the band's name in 2002. ===Declining health and death=== By the late 1980s, Clarke's health had declined from a lifetime of hard drinking, resulting in a number of hospital stays. He died of liver failure at the age of 47 at his Treasure Island, Florida, condominium on December 19, 1993. Billy Moore, who had organized a New Year's Eve concert at a resort where Clarke and his band were scheduled to perform, stated that at the time of his death, Clarke had recently learned that he had become terminally ill due to his liver problems. During his final days, Clarke had expressed a wish to appear on television in the hope of alerting children to the dangers of alcoholism. Following his wishes, Clarke's girlfriend Susan Paul started a foundation in Clarke's name, called the Campaign for Alcohol-Free Kids. In 1994, a year after his death, Clarke's paintings were published in Dick Gautier and Jim McMullan's book, Musicians As Artists. ==Discography== * The Byrds: Mr. Tambourine Man (1965) * The Byrds: Turn!

The term is particularly applicable as telecom converges technically with data networks and commercial off-the-shelf commoditized components such as blade servers. Carrier-grade is a term for public network telecommunications products that require up to 5 nines or 6 nines (or 99.999 to 99.9999 percent) availability, which translates to downtime per year of 30 seconds (6 nines) to 5 minutes (5 nines). The term \\"5 nines\\" is usually associated with carrier-class servers, while \\"6 nines\\" is usually associated with carrier-class switches. ==CGL project and goals== The primary motivation behind the CGL effort is to present an open architecture alternative to the closed, proprietary software on proprietary hardware systems that are currently used in telecommunication systems. These proprietary systems are monolithic (hardware, software and applications integrated very tightly) and operate well as a unit. However, they are hard to maintain and scale as telecommunications companies have to utilize the services of the vendor for even relatively minor enhancements to the system. CGL seeks to progressively reduce or to eliminate this dependence on proprietary systems and provide a path for easy deployment and scalability by utilizing cheap COTS systems to assemble a telecommunications system. The CGL effort was started by the Open Source Development Lab (CGL Working Group). The specification is now in the combined Linux Foundation. The latest specification release is CGL 5.0. Several CGL-registered Linux distributions exist, including MontaVista, Wind River Systems and Red Flag Linux.Linux Foundation CGL Workgroup \\"Registered Distributions\\", accessed November 20, 2010. ==Applications and services== The OSDL CGLWG defines three main types of applications that carrier-grade Linux will support ‚Äî gateways, signaling servers, and management. * Gateway applications provide bridging services between different technologies or administrative domains. Gateway applications are characterized by supporting many connections in real-time over many interfaces, with the requirement of not losing any frames or packets. An example of a gateway application is a media gateway, which converts conventional voice circuits using TDM to IP packets for transmission over an IP-switched network. * Signaling server applications, which include SS7 products, handle control services for calls, such as routing, session control, and status. Signaling server applications are characterized by sub-millisecond real-time requirements and large numbers of simultaneous connections (10,000 or more). An example signaling server application would include control processing for a rack of line cards. * Management applications handle traditional service and billing operations, as well as network management. Management applications are characterized by a much less stringent requirement for real-time, as well as by additional database and communication-oriented requirements. A typical management application might handle visitor and home location registers for mobile access, and authorization for customer access to billable services. ==See also== * Hard real-time * Linux-HA * High availability ==Notes== ==External links== * Carrier Grade Linux from the Linux Foundation Category:Computer standards Category:Linux Category:Linux Foundation projects Category:Telecommunications standards ","title":"Carrier Grade Linux"},{"id":"1272055","text":"Miguel √Ångel Su√°rez (July 5, 1939 ‚Äì April 1, 2009) was a Puerto Rican soap opera and movie actor. ==Early years== Su√°rez and his sister were born into a middle class family and raised in the Santurce section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. His father worked at a local supermarket and his mother was a housewife. When Su√°rez was a child, he went with his mother to see a play. This was his first experience with the theater and Su√°rez was so impressed that after the curtains rose and the actors did their show, he knew that he wanted to become an actor. Su√°rez went to school and received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. When Su√°rez and his sister returned from school, their mother would read stories or prepare little plays which helped to develop their imagination.Suarez The supermarket where the elder Su√°rez worked was located next to the radio station \\"Radio El Mundo\\". Manuel M√©ndez Ballester, a well known playwright, who worked as a writer for the radio station, would frequently visit the supermarket and Su√°rez's father soon became friends with Ballester. In 1947, Ballester told the elder Su√°rez that he was in need of an 8-year-old for the protagonist role in a play that he wrote, because the person he had in mind didn't pass the audition. When the elder Su√°rez realized that the \\"part\\" paid more than what he was making working in the supermarket, he took his son to the audition and that was the beginning of Su√°rez's acting career. In 1956, when Su√°rez was 17 years old, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the submarine division. He traveled the world and learned about different customs and cultures. ==Television== When Su√°rez was discharged from the Navy, he returned to Puerto Rico, where he began doing theater work and later starred as Rev. Sullivan in the first soap opera produced by Tommy Muniz for Wapa TV, \\"Las Almas No Tienen Color\\" (1969). In 1972 he was cast in \\"El Hijo De Angela Mar√≠a\\" which was so successful that was soon made into a movie. Afterwards the artistic class in the island went through a crisis and since he was unable to get an acting job, Suarez decided to try his luck elsewhere. He went to Argentina where he was given a role in the soap opera Amor Gitano (Gypsy Love). He later went to Venezuela where he became a renowned actor after participating in the soap operas Corazon de Diamante (Heart of Diamonds) and Laura Benson. In Puerto Rico he participated in many locally produced soap operas, among which was Vivir Para Ti (I live for You). In 1994 he was cast in Se√±ora Tentacion (Mrs. Temptation) with Mexican movie star Luc√≠a M√©ndez. This soap opera was a hit in the Caribbean, Central and South America and in Europe. ==Film== In 1971, Su√°rez was cast in the locally produced Woody Allen movie Bananas with Jacobo Morales. In 1980 he played an inmate in a made-for-TV movie partially filmed in Puerto Rico, 'Escape', with Timothy Bottoms and Colleen Dewhurst. He then went to Hollywood and in 1980 landed a role in the movie Stir Crazy, directed by Sidney Poitier starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. He was sometimes credited under the names Miguel√°ngel Su√°rez and Miguel Su√°rez .

This area has attracted much attention because the market for polyethylene, polypropylene, and related copolymers is large. There is a corresponding intense market for new processes as indicated by the fact that, in the US alone, 50,000 patents were issued between 1991-2007 on polyethylene and polypropylene. Many methods exist to polymerize alkenes, including the traditional routes using Philips catalyst and traditional heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, which still are used to produce the bulk of polyethylene. ==Catalysts based on early transition metals== File:VersifyCats.pngGeneric structure of a post-metallocene catalyst based on Dow's pyridyl-amido design. File:Zirconium bisanionic.pngEarly examples of postmetallocene catalysts included Schiff base ligands. Homogeneous metallocene catalysts, e.g., derived from or related to zirconocene dichloride introduced a level of microstructural control that was unavailable with heterogeneous systems.Brintzinger, H. H.; Fischer, D.; Muelhaupt, R.; Rieger, B.; Waymouth, R. M., \\"Stereospecific Olefin Polymerization with Chiral Metallocene Catalysts\\", Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1143-1170. Metallocene catalysts are homogeneous single-site systems, implying that a uniform catalyst is present in the solution. In contrast, commercially important Ziegler-Natta heterogeneous catalysts contain a distribution of catalytic sites. The catalytic properties of single-site catalysts can be controlled by modification of the ligand. Initially ligand modifications focused on various cyclopentadienyl derivatives, but great diversity was uncovered through high throughput screening. These post-metallocene catalysts employ a range of chelating ligands, often including pyridine and amido (R2N‚àí). These ligands are available in great diversity with respect to their steric and electronic properties. Such postmetallocene catalysts enabled the introduction of Chain shuttling polymerization.Chum, P. S.; Swogger, K. W., \\"Olefin Polymer Technologies-History and Recent Progress at the Dow Chemical Company\\", Progress in Polymer Science 2008, volume 33, 797-819. ==Catalysts based on late transition metals== The copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers has been heavily studied. The high oxophilicity of the early metals precluded their use in this application.Domski, G. J., Rose, J. M., Coates, G. W., Bolig, A.

Efforts to copolymerize polar comonomers led to interest in catalysts based upon nickel and palladium, inspired by the success of the Shell Higher Olefin Process. Typical post-metallocene catalysts feature bulky, neutral, alpha-diimine ligands. The technology was further developed in the laboratories of DuPont‚Äôs Central Research. They have been commercialized as DuPont‚Äôs Versipol olefin polymerization system.US 5,866,663 \\"Process of Polymerizing Olefins,\\" Samuel David Arthur, Alison Margaret Anne Bennett, Maurice S.

These complexes catalyze the homopolymerize ethylene to a variety of structures that range from high density polyethylene through hydrocarbon plastomers and elastomers by a mechanism referred to as ‚Äúchain-walking‚Äù. By reducing the bulk of the alpha-diimine used, the product distribution of these systems can be 'tuned' to consist of hydrocarbon oils (alpha-olefins), similar to those produced by more tradition nickel(II) oligo/polymerization catalysts. As opposed to metallocenes, they can also randomly copolymerize ethylene with polar comonomers such as methyl acrylate. A second class of complexes were discovered simultaneously by Robert H. GrubbsC. Wang, S. Friedrich, T. R. Younkin, R. T. Li, R. H. Grubbs, D. A. Bansleben, M. W.

Simpson, Jerald Feldman, Edward Bryan Coughlin, and Steven Dale Ittel. January 16, 2001. These catalysts feature mono-anionic bidentate ligands related to salen ligands. One interesting feature of these catalysts was that pendant Lewis acid functionality could be incorporated to direct the incorporation of polar comonomers. These catalysts are often better suited for the preparation of specialty oligomers and polymers incorporating reactive functionality. The concept of bulky bis-imine ligands was extended to iron complexes Representative catalysts feature diiminopyridine ligands. These catalysts, illustrated to the left, are highly active do not promote chain walking. As a result, these complexes give very linear high-density polyethylene when bulky and when the steric bulk is removed, they are very active catalysts for ethylene oligomerization to linear alpha-olefins. A salicylimine catalyst system based on zirconium, shown to the right, exhibits high activity for ethylene polymerization.S. Matsui, Y. Tohi, M. Mitani, J. Saito, H. Makio, H. Tanaka, M. Nitabaru, T. Nakano, T, Fujita, Chem. Lett., 1065 (1999). The catalysts can also produce some novel polypropylene structures.Steven D. Ittel and Lynda K. Johnson and Maurice Brookhart, Late- Metal Catalysts for Ethylene Homo- and Copolymerization, Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1169-1203.

It contains two currently recognized species, Torvosaurus tanneri and Torvosaurus gurneyi. In 1979 the type species Torvosaurus tanneri was named: it was a large, heavily built, bipedal carnivore, that could grow to a length of about . T. tanneri was among the largest carnivores of its time, together with Epanterias and Saurophaganax (which could both be synonyms for Allosaurus). Specimens referred to Torvosaurus gurneyi were initially claimed to be up to twelve metres long, but later shown to be smaller. Based on bone morphology Torvosaurus is thought to have had short but very powerful arms. == Discovery == Reconstructed T. tanneri skull, Museo Capellini of Bologna Fossilized remains of Torvosaurus have been found in North America and Portugal. In 1971, Vivian Jones, of Delta, Colorado (USA), in the Calico Gulch Quarry in Moffat County, discovered a single gigantic thumb claw of a theropod. This was shown to James Alvin Jensen, a collector working for Brigham Young University. In an effort to discover comparable fossils, Vivian's husband Daniel Eddie Jones directed Jensen to the Dry Mesa Quarry, where abundant gigantic theropod bones, together with Supersaurus remains, proved present in rocks of the Morrison Formation. From 1972 onwards the site was excavated by Jensen and Kenneth Stadtman. The type species Torvosaurus tanneri was named and described in 1979 by Peter Malcolm Galton and Jensen. The genus name Torvosaurus derives from the Latin word torvus, meaning \\"savage\\", and the Greek word sauros (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ), meaning \\"lizard\\". The specific name tanneri, is named after first counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Nathan Eldon Tanner. In 1985, Jensen could report a considerable amount of additional material, among it the first skull elements.Jensen, J.A., 1985, \\"Uncompahgre dinosaur fauna: A preliminary report\\", Great Basin Naturalist, 45: 710-720 The fossils from Colorado were further described by Brooks Britt in 1991.Britt, B., 1991, \\"Theropods of Dry Mesa Quarry (Morrison Formation, Late Jurassic), Colorado, with emphasis on the osteology of Torvosaurus tanneri\\", Brigham Young University Geology Studies 37: 1-72 The holotype BYU 2002 originally consisted of upper arm bones (humeri) and lower arm bones (radii and ulnae). The paratypes included some back bones, hip bones, and hand bones. When the material described in 1985 is added, the main missing elements are the shoulder girdle and the thighbone. The original thumb claw, specimen BYUVP 2020, was only provisionally referred as it had been found in a site 195 kilometres away from the Dry Mesa Quarry. The holotype and paratypes represented at least three individuals: two adults and a juvenile. In 1991 Britt concluded that there was no proof that the front limbs of the holotype were associated and chose the left humerus as the lectotype. Several single bones and teeth found in other American sites have been referred to Torvosaurus. Maxillae of T. gurneyi and T. tanneri compared In 1992, fossils of a large theropod found at Como Bluff in Wyoming, containing skull, shoulder girdle, pelvis and rib elements, were named by Robert T. Bakker et al. as the species Edmarka rex. Bakker et al were impressed with the size of Edmarka, noting that it \\"would rival T. rex in total length,\\" and viewing this approximate size as \\"a natural ceiling for dinosaurian meat-eaters.\\"Bakker, R.T., Siegwarth, J., Kralis, D. & Filla, J., 1992, \\"Edmarka rex, a new, gigantic theropod dinosaur from the middle Morrison Formation, Late Jurassic of the Como Bluff outcrop region\\", Hunteria, 2(9): 1‚Äì24 This was often considered a junior synonym of Torvosaurus. The same site has rendered comparable remains for which the nomen nudum Brontoraptor has been used.Redman, P.D., 1995, Paleo Horizons, Winter IssueSiegwarth, J., Linbeck, R., Bakker, R. and Southwell, B. (1996). Giant carnivorous dinosaurs of the family Megalosauridae. Hunteria 3:1-77. Most researchers now regard both specimens as belonging to Torvosaurus tanneri. In 2000, material from Portugal was referred to a Torvosaurus sp. by Oct√°vio Mateus and Miguel Telles Antunes.Mateus, O., & Antunes, M. T. (2000). Torvosaurus sp.(Dinosauria: Theropoda) in the late Jurassic of Portugal. In I Congresso Ib√©rico de Paleontologia/XVI Jornadas de la Sociedad Espa√±ola de Paleontolog√≠a (pp. 115-117) In 2006 fossils from the Portuguese Lourinh√£ Formation were referred to Torvosaurus tanneri.Mateus, O., Walen, A., and Antunes, M.T. (2006). \\"The large theropod fauna of the Lourinha Formation (Portugal) and its similarity to that of the Morrison Formation, with a description of a new species of Allosaurus.\\" New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, 36. In 2012, however, Matthew Carrano e.a. concluded that this material could not be more precisely determined than a Torvosaurus sp. In 2013 eggs and embryos were reported from Portugal, referred to Torvosaurus. The species from Portugal was named T. gurneyi in honor of James Gurney in 2014, the creator of the Dinotopia series of books. It is the largest theropod known from Europe. It was the morphological distinctiveness of the holotype maxilla ML1100 that led to the naming of the Portuguese species. In 2020 a fragmentary maxilla referable to Torvosaurus was described from the middle Callovian Ornatenton Formation of Germany. This is the oldest record of the genus, and suggests that megalosaurines originated in Europe. == Description == Restoration of T. tanneri Torvosaurus was a very large predator, with an estimated maximum body length of and mass of for both T. tanneri and T. gurneyi, making Torvosaurus among the largest land carnivores of the Jurassic. Thomas Holtz estimated it at 12 meters (39 feet). Claims have been made indicating even larger sizes. The synonymous Edmarka rex was named thus because it was assumed to rival Tyrannosaurus rex in length. Likewise \\"Brontoraptor\\" was supposed to be a torvosaur of gigantic size.Siegwarth, J., Linbeck, R., Bakker, R. and Southwell, B., 1996, \\"Giant carnivorous dinosaurs of the family Megalosauridae\\", Hunteria 3: 1-77 The T. gurneyi specimens from Portugal initially prompted larger size estimates to be made. In 2006 a lower end of a thighbone, specimen ML 632, was referred to Torvosaurus sp. and later to T. gurneyi. This specimen was initially stated to indicate a length of . Applying the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson, correlating mammal weights to their femur circumference, resulted in a weight of 1930 kilogrammes. However, revised estimates performed in 2014 suggested a slightly smaller total body size for this specimen, of about . Among the differentiating features between T. gurneyi and T. tanneri are the number of teeth and the size and shape of the mouth. While the upper jaw of T. tanneri has more than 11 teeth, that of T. gurneyi has less. Skeletal restoration showing the size of T. gurneyi, known remains highlighted Torvosaurus had an elongated, narrow snout, with a kink in its profile just above the large nostrils. The frontmost snout bone, the praemaxilla, bore three rather flat teeth oriented somewhat outwards with the front edge of the teeth crown overlapping the outer side of the rear edge of the preceding crown. The maxilla was tall and bore at least eleven rather long teeth. The antorbital fenestra was relatively short. The lacrimal bone had a distinctive lacrimal horn on top; its lower end was broad in side view. The eye socket was tall with a pointed lower end. The jugal was long and transversely thin. The lower front side of the quadrate bone was hollowed out by a tear-shaped depression, the contact surface with the quadratojugal. Both the neck vertebrae and the front dorsal vertebrae had relatively flexible ball-in-socket joints. The balls, on the front side of the vertebral centra, had a wide rim, a condition by Britt likened to a Derby hat. The tail base was stiffened in the vertical plane by high and in side view wide neural spines. The upper arm was robust; the lower arm robust but short. Whether the thumb claw was especially enlarged, is uncertain. In the pelvis, the ilium resembled that of Megalosaurus and had a tall, short, front blade and a longer pointed rear blade. The pelvis as a whole was massively built, with the bone skirts between the pubic bones and the ischia contacting each other and forming a vaulted closed underside. == Systematics and classification == Torvosaurus sp. in Japan When first described in 1979 by Galton and Jensen,P. M. Galton and J. A. Jensen. 1979. A new large theropod dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado. Brigham Young University Geology Studies 26(1):1-12 Torvosaurus was classified as a megalosaurid, which is the current consensus. It was later assigned to Carnosauria by Ralph Molnar et al. in 1990,R. E. Molnar, S. M. Kurzanov, and Z. Dong. 1990. \\"Carnosauria\\". In: D. B. Weishampel, H. Osm√≥lska, and P.

Holtz, 1994, \\"The phylogenetic position of the Tyrannosauridae: implications for theropod systematics\\", Journal of Paleontology 68'(5): 1100-1117 all these assignments are not supported by present phylogenetic analysis. In 1985, Jensen assigned Torvosaurus a family of its own, the Torvosauridae. Despite support for this concept by Paul SerenoP.C. Sereno, J.A. Wilson, H.C.E. Larsson, D.B. Dutheil, and H.-D. Sues, 1994, \\"Early Cretaceous dinosaurs from the Sahara\\", Science 266(5183): 267-271 and Mateus, it seems redundant as Torvosaurus is closely related to, and perhaps the sister species of, the earlier Megalosaurus within a Megalosaurinae. However, Torvosauridae may be used as an alternative name for Megalosauridae if Megalosaurus is considered an indeterminable nomen dubium.P.C. Sereno, 1998, \\"A rationale for phylogenetic definitions, with application to the higher-level taxonomy of Dinosauria\\", Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie, Abhandlungen 210(1): 41-83 Though a close relative of Megalosaurus, Torvosaurus is seemingly more advanced or apomorphic. Torvosauruss larger clade, the Megalosauridae, is most commonly held as a basal branch of the Tetanurae, and considered less derived than carnosaurs or coelurosaurs, and likely related to the spinosaurids. The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Carrano, Benson & Sampson (2012), showing the relationships of Torvosaurus:Carrano, M. T.; Benson, R. B. J.; Sampson, S. D. (2012). \\"The phylogeny of Tetanurae (Dinosauria: Theropoda)\\".

This discovery further supports the hypothesis that large theropod dinosaurs were oviparous, meaning that they laid eggs and hence that embryonic development occurred outside the body of female dinosaurs. This discovery was made in 2005 by the Dutch amateur fossil-hunter Aart Walen at the Lourinh√£ Formation in Western Portugal, in fluvial overbank sediments that are considered to be from the Tithonian stage of the Jurassic Period, approximately 152 to 145 million years ago. This discovery is significant paleontologically for a number of reasons: (a) these are the most primitive dinosaur embryos known; (b) these are the only basal theropod embryos known; (c) fossilized eggs and embryos are rarely found together; (d) it represents the first evidence of a one-layered eggshell for theropod dinosaurs; and (e) it allows researchers to link a new eggshell morphology to the osteology of a particular group of theropod dinosaurs.Ricardo Ara√∫jo, Rui Castanhinha, Rui M. S. Martins, Oct√°vio Mateus, Christophe Hendrickx, F. Beckmann, N. Schell & L. C. Alves (2013) Filling the gaps of dinosaur eggshell phylogeny: Late Jurassic Theropod clutch with embryos from Portugal. Scientific Reports 3 : Article number: 1924 doi:10.1038/srep01924 The specimen is housed at the Museu da Lourinh√£, in Portugal. As the eggs were abandoned due to unknown circumstances, it is not known if Torvosaurus provided parental care to its eggs and young or abandoned them shortly after laying. == Paleoecology == Claw cast of T. tanneri, Natural History Museum, London === Provenance and occurrence === The type specimen of Torvosaurus tanneri BYU 2002 was recovered in the Dry Mesa Quarry of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, in Montrose County, Colorado. The specimen was collected by James A. Jensen and Kenneth Stadtman in 1972 in medium-grained, coarse sandstone that was deposited during the Tithonian and Kimmeridgian stages of the Jurassic period, approximately 153 to 148 million years ago.J. A. Jensen and J. H. Ostrom. 1977. A second Jurassic pterosaur from North America. Journal of Paleontology 51(4):867-870 This specimen is housed in the collection of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. === Fauna and habitat in North America === Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of this section of the Morrison Formation included rivers that flowed from the west into a basin that contained a giant, saline alkaline lake and there were extensive wetlands in the vicinity. The Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western Colorado yields one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world.Richmond, D.R. and Morris, T.H., 1999, Stratigraphy and cataclysmic deposition of the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry, Mesa County, Colorado, in Carpenter, K., Kirkland, J., and Chure, D., eds., The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation: An Interdisciplinary Study, Modern Geology v. 22, no. 1-4, pp. 121‚Äì143. The Dry Mesa Quarry has produced the remains of the sauropods Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Barosaurus, Supersaurus, Dystylosaurus and Camarasaurus, the iguanodonts Camptosaurus and Dryosaurus, and the theropods Allosaurus, Tanycolagreus, Koparion, Stokesosaurus, Ceratosaurus and Ornitholestes, as well as Othnielosaurus, Gargoyleosaurus and Stegosaurus. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, amphibians, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial (like Hoplosuchus) and aquatic crocodylomorphans, cotylosaurs, several species of pterosaurs like Harpactognathus, and early mammals, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. === Fauna and habitat in Europe === Femur and tibia referred to T. gurneyi The Lourinh√£ Formation is also Kimmeridgian- Tithonian in age. The environment is coastal, and therefore has a strong marine influence. Its flora and fauna are very similar to the Morrison. Torvosaurus appears to be the top predator here. It lived alongside European species of Allosaurus (A. europaeus), Ceratosaurus, Stegosaurus and presumably Camptosaurus. Theropod Lourinhanosaurus also stalked the area. Lusotitan was the largest sauropod in the region, while the diplodocids Dinheirosaurus and Lourinhasaurus were also present. Dacentrurus and Miragaia were both stegosaurs, while Dracopelta was an ankylosaurian. Draconyx was an iguanodontid related to Camptosaurus. Due to the marine nature of the Lourinh√£ Formation, sharks, plesiochelyid turtles, and teleosaurid crocodyliforms are also present.OCT√ÅVIO MATEUS LATE JURASSIC DINOSAURS FROM THE MORRISON FORMATION (USA), THE LOURINH√É AND ALCOBA√áA FORMATIONS (PORTUGAL), AND THE TENDAGURU BEDS (TANZANIA): A COMPARISON Foster, J.R. and Lucas, S. G. R.M., eds., 2006, Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36. === Coexistence with other large carnivores === Torvosaurus coexisted with other large theropods such as Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Saurophaganax in the United States, and Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Lourinhanosaurus in Portugal. The three appear to have had different ecological niches, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. Torvosaurus and Ceratosaurus may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, more sinuous, bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas Allosaurus had shorter bodies, longer legs, were faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged. == References == == External links == * Largest Predatory Dinosaur in Europe Found at nationalgeographic Category:Megalosaurs Category:Kimmeridgian life Category:Tithonian life Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of North America Category:Jurassic United States Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Paleontology in Colorado Category:Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of Europe Category:Jurassic Portugal Category:Fossils of Portugal Category:Lourinh√£ Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 1979 Category:Taxa named by Peter Galton Category:Taxa named by James A.

The rebellion failed to topple the Qing dynasty, but caused immense economic devastation and loss of life that became major long-term factors in the collapse of the Qing regime in the early 20th century. == Origin == Nian is a word borrowed from the Huaibei dialect, a form of Central Plains Mandarin, where it was used to refer to loosely affiliated gangs or groups or ‚Äúbandits‚Äù. The Nian movement was formed in the late 1840s by Zhang Lexing and, by 1851, numbered approximately 40,000. Unlike the Taiping Rebellion movement, the Nian initially had no clear goals or objectives, aside from criticism of the Qing government. Their slogan was \\"'kill the rich and aid the poor.'\\"Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 108 (2010) However, the Nian were provoked into taking direct action against the Imperial regime following a series of environmental disasters. The 1851 Yellow River flood deluged hundreds of thousands of square miles and caused immense loss of life. The Qing government slowly began cleaning up after the disaster but could not provide effective aid, as government finances had been drained during a recent First Opium War with the British Empire and the ongoing slaughter of the Taiping Rebellion. The damage created by the disaster had still not been repaired when, in 1855, the river burst its banks again, drowning thousands and devastating the fertile province of Jiangsu. Along with the destruction caused by the floods famine spread. At the time, the Qing government was trying to negotiate a deal with the European powers, and as state finances had been so severely depleted, the regime was again unable to provide effective relief. This enraged the Nian movement, which blamed the Europeans for contributing to the nation troubles, and increasingly viewed the Qing government as incompetent. The Nian rebels seemed to have been influenced by the previous 1794 White Lotus Rebellion, recruiting from secret societies and sects such as the White Lotus, and actively borrowing their terminology and symbols, examples being the practice of sworn brotherhood, five colours of banners, flags with eight trigrams, and the widespread use of units of woman warriors. Zhang Lexing, leader of the rebellion, used the title \\"Bright King of the Great Han\\", an address reminiscent of White Lotus leadership positions. Political scientists Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer suggest that the rebellion was fueled, at least in part, by decades of female infanticide caused by the flood-related economic misery, leading to a large population of frustrated young men without any women to marry, perhaps as many as a quarter of all young men in the area being in this category of \\"bare branches\\". == The conflict == The Nian rebels were to a large degree desperate and poor peasants that banded together in bandit groups simply to survive. However, as natural disasters grew worse, these bandit groups grew increasingly large, and eventually became armies that were able to directly challenge the government. Nevertheless, the main interest of most Nian members remained plundering communities that were better off, as well as resisting taxation. Religious motifs likewise were of little importance to the Nian rebels. While the Nian forces possibly inherited some of their symbols such as red turbans and Eight Trigram flags from the White Lotus,Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 108 (2010) the overall influence of spiritual movements such as the White Lotus or the God Worshipping Society on them was low. For example, White Lotus rebels sometimes fought alongside Nian groups, but the latter sometimes also attacked the former in hopes of plunder. On average, the Nian groups in Henan remained more similar to mere bandits than the Nian in Anhui. Overall, the Nian movement \\"remained primarily the expression of mundane strategies of survival\\" according to historian Elizabeth J. Perry. They were never revolutionaries, and besides slogans that called for death of government officials and the rich,Chesneaux, Jean. Peasant Revolts in China, 1840‚Äì1949 p. 33 (C. A. Curwen trans. 1973) as well as hopes for a more just society, they lacked clear, well-defined goals. That some Nian armies became actual rebel movements was mostly due to the ambitions of individual Nian leaders who wanted to become legitimate rulers. The Nian utilized cavalry in part to aid in looting, which served to support both the Nian's forces and their home communities.Siang-tseh Chiang, The Nien Rebellion p. viii (1954) In contrast to their mobile cavalry, the Nian's defensive tactics were based on the so-called \\"earthwall communities\\" they controlled.Siang-tseh Chiang, The Nien Rebellion p. viii-ix (1954) Support of the peasantry proved crucial and provided the true base of the Nian's power.Siang-tseh Chiang, The Nien Rebellion p. ix (1954) In 1851, the Nian began raiding the grain stores and silver caches of villages.Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 108 (2010) Upon the seizure of Nanjing by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, some Nian leaders sought an alliance with the Taiping.Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 108 (2010) While Hong Xiuquan bestowed titles upon the Nian leaders and the Nian and the Taiping occasionally cooperated, full coordination between the two rebellions was never achieved.Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 108-09 (2010) Cases in which Nian armies submitted or even fully joined the Taipings remained rare, as most remained bandit armies that were only interested in imminent profit and survival. In 1855, Zhang Lexing took direct action by launching attacks against government troops in central China. By the summer, the fast-moving Nian cavalry, well-trained and fully equipped with modern firearms, had cut the lines of communication between Beijing and the Qing armies fighting the Taiping rebels in the south. Qing forces were badly overstretched as rebellions broke out across China, allowing the Nian armies to conquer large tracts of land and gain control over economically vital areas. The Nian fortified their captured cities and used them as bases to launch cavalry attacks against Qing troops in the countryside, prompting local towns to fortify themselves against Nian raiding parties. This resulted in constant fighting which devastated the previously rich provinces of Jiangsu and Hunan. In 1856, several Nian bands formed an alliance led by Zhang Lexing, organizing themselves into a loose confederation of five armies. Each army was identified by a colored banner, operated largely autonomous, and recruited mostly people belonging to a single clan. As result, each banner army had a core area which consisted of a number of villages whose inhabitants were related to each other. Due to the widely differing numbers of the involved clans, the banner armies were accordingly smaller or bigger: The yellow banner army, led by Zhang himself, drew its forces from 18 villages; the white banner army of Kung Teh from 13; the red banner army of Hou Shih-wei from 12; the blue banner army of Han Lao-wan from just six; and the black banner army of Su T'ien-fu from one hundred villages. Though Zhang tried to impose more order and coordination upon the alliance, he enjoyed only limited success in this regard. Internal differences caused the alliance to quickly fall apart, and by 1858 it was effectively dissolved. Triumphal Procession after the Campaign against the Nian In early 1856, the Qing government sent the Mongol General Senggelinqin, who had recently crushed a large Taiping army, to defeat the Nian. Senggelinquin's army captured several fortified cities and destroyed most of the Nian infantry, and killed Zhang Lexing himself in an ambush in 1863. However, in late 1864, the Nian movement survived as skilled Taiping commanders Lai Wenguang (Ë≥¥ÊñáÂÖâ) (1827‚Äì1868) and Fan Ruzeng (1840‚Äì1867) arrived to take control of the Nian forces, and the bulk of the Nian cavalry remained intact. Senggelinquin's infantry-based army could not stop the fast moving cavalry from devastating the countryside and launching surprise attacks on Imperial troops. In late 1865, Senggelinquin and his bodyguards were ambushed by Nian troops and killed, in the Battle of Goulawjai, depriving the government of its best military commander. The Qing regime sent General Zeng Guofan (ÊõæÂõΩËó©) to take command of Imperial forces protecting the capital Beijing, and provided him with modern artillery and weapons, purchased from the Europeans at exorbitant prices. Zeng's army set about building canals and trenches to hem in the Nian cavalry, an effective but slow and expensive method. General Zeng was relieved of command after Nian infantry broke through one of his defense lines, and he was replaced by Generals Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang equipped with more crushingly expensive European artillery and firearms. In late 1866, the remaining Nian forces split into two, with the Eastern Army, under command of Lai Wenguang, stationed in central China whilst the Western Army advanced on Beijing. The Western Army, commanded by Zhang Zongyu, Zhang Lexing's brother's son, was defeated southwest of Beijing by Qing troops, leaving large swathes of Nian territory exposed to a Qing counter-attack. By late 1867, Li Hongzhang's and Zuo Zongtang's troops had recaptured most Nian territory, and in early 1868, the remnants were crushed by the combined forces of the government's troops and the Ever Victorious Army. == Military equipment == The Nian rebels were equipped with guns (including modern Western guns), muskets, and a significant quantity of cannons up to 5000 pounds in weight. == Assessment == The Nian rebellion failed to topple the Qing dynasty largely because it failed to make alliances with other rebels, especially the Taiping movement. The Nian only symbolically supported Taiping efforts by accepting the Taiping king's \\"appointments\\", but refusing to follow his orders. Had the Nian and Taipings joined forces, the Qing government would have been faced with a formidable threat, in spite of its alliances with European powers. Despite the Nians' failure to seize power, the events of the rebellion dealt a severe blow to the Qing dynasty. The environmental disasters of 1851 and 1855 devastated the richest provinces of China, depriving the Qing regime of tax income and trade duties. The endless fighting between Nian troops and Qing forces, who made widespread use of scorched earth tactics, ruined the countryside and resulted in countless deaths. Although the Nian rebellion was smaller than that of the Taiping, it severely drained government finances, devastated the richest areas of China, and left China's economy in a very precarious state. In the long term, the Nian rebellion was to become one of the major factors in the collapse of Qing China. ==See also== * List of rebellions in China * Taiping Rebellion * Punti‚ÄìHakka Clan Wars * Miao Rebellion (1854‚Äì73) * Dungan revolt (1862‚Äì1877) * Panthay Rebellion * Nepalese-Tibetan War == References == === Citations === === Sources === * * ==Further reading== * * Ownby, David. \\"Approximations of Chinese Bandits: Perverse Rebels or Frustrated Bachelors?\\" Chinese Masculinities/Femininities.

It originally aired on October 11, 1963 and is one of the most well-known and frequently referenced episodes of the series. The story follows the only passenger on an airline flight to notice a hideous creature lurking outside the plane. In 2019 Keith Phipps of Vulture stated that the episode \\"doubles as such an effective shorthand for a fear of flying\\", making it endure in popular culture. This is the first of six episodes to be directed by Richard Donner. ==Opening narration== ==Plot== While traveling by airplane, Robert Wilson, thinking he sees a gremlin on the wing, tries to alert his wife and the flight crew, but every time someone else looks out of the window the gremlin hides itself near the engine so Robert's claim seems crazy. Robert admits the oddness of the gremlin avoiding everyone else's sight but not his. His credibility is further undermined by this being his first flight since suffering a nervous breakdown six months earlier, which also occurred on an aircraft. Robert realizes that his wife is starting to think he needs to go back to the sanitarium, but his more immediate concern is the gremlin tinkering with the wiring under one of the engine cowlings which could cause the aircraft to crash. In response to his repeated attempts to raise an alarm about the gremlin, the crew gives Robert a sedative to stop him from alarming other passengers. Robert downs it with water, but does not swallow and secretly spits it out. He then steals a sleeping police officer's revolver, straps himself in to avoid being blown out of the aircraft, and opens the emergency exit door to shoot the gremlin. Once the airplane has landed, everyone believes that Robert has gone insane. In a straitjacket as he is whisked away on a gurney, Robert tells his wife that he is alone in his knowledge of what happened during the flight. However, the final scene reveals conspicuous damage to the exterior of one of the aircraft's engines, confirming that Robert was right all along about the gremlin. ==Closing narration== ==Cast== * William Shatner as Robert \\"Bob\\" Wilson * Christine White as Julia Wilson * Ed Kemmer as Flight Engineer * Asa Maynor as Stewardess * Nick Cravat as Gremlin ==Remakes== ===Twilight Zone: The Movie version=== The episode was remade in 1983 by director George Miller as a segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie. John Valentine, played by John Lithgow, suffers from severe fear of flying. The plane flies through a violent thunderstorm, and Valentine hides in the lavatory trying to recover from a panic attack, but the flight attendants coax him back to his seat. He notices a hideous gremlin on the wing of the plane and begins to spiral into another severe panic. He watches as the creature wreaks havoc on the wing, damaging the plane's engine. Valentine finally snaps and attempts to break the window with an oxygen canister, but is wrestled to the ground by another passenger (an off-duty security guard). Valentine takes the passenger's gun, shoots out the window (causing a breach in the pressurized cabin), and begins firing at the gremlin. This catches the attention of the gremlin, who rushes up to Valentine and destroys the gun, then leaps away into the sky. The police, crew, and passengers write off Valentine as insane. However, while a straitjacketed Valentine is carried off in an ambulance, the aircraft maintenance crew arrives and finds the damage to the plane's engines, complete with claw marks. ===2019 version=== Adam Scott was cast in an episode for the 2019 reboot series, entitled \\"Nightmare at 30,000 Feet\\". Other cast mates include Chris Diamantopoulos, China Shavers, Katie Findlay and Nicholas Lea. The remake removes the gremlin completely, though it makes a cameo as a doll that washes up on the atoll near the end, and instead focuses on a sinister podcast hosted by the enigmatic Rodman Edwards (voiced by Dan Carlin). ====Opening narration==== ====Plot==== Justin Sanderson is a magazine journalist suffering from PTSD, who is boarding Golden Airways Flight 1015 for a flight to Tel Aviv. While awaiting his flight, he befriends Joe Beaumont, a former pilot for the company and alcoholic who suffered some unspecified failure in the past. At his seat, Sanderson discovers an MP3 player that has a podcast playing called Enigmatique, which describes a \\"Flight 1015\\" which was lost without explanation. Sanderson begins to panic and tries to make sense of the situation, but is told to calm down. He listens further and hears speculation about passengers who might have been involved somehow in the plane's disappearance; his attempts to investigate only annoy the other passengers and crew. He learns that the last words heard from the pilot were \\"Good night, New York\\", and desperately tries to warn the pilot not to say that, but is restrained by an air marshal. Beaumont approaches and confided that he believes him. Guessing that the flight number ‚Äì and coincidental departure time ‚Äì is the code to the cockpit, Sanderson gets Beaumont access, who overpowers the crew and takes control of the flight. As Beaumont subdues the passengers and crew with oxygen deprivation, Beaumont reveals his plan to crash the plane to atone for his past failures. As Beaumont signs off with \\"Good night, New York\\", it dawns on Sanderson that he indirectly causes the crash. He awakens on an island and learns from the MP3 player that all the passengers actually survived, except for Sanderson who disappeared. The other passengers reveal themselves as they attack and kill Sanderson, whom they blame for the crash. ====Closing narration==== ==Reception== Keith Phipps of Vulture rated the 2019 episode three of five stars, citing that the \\"concept‚Äôs solid\\", though he felt there was implausibility regarding the revelations about Joe and that the final reveal about the passengers killing Justin is \\"a twist too far in an otherwise solid outing.\\" ===Accolades=== Keith McDuffee of TV Squad listed the gremlin as the ninth scariest television character of all time in 2008.McDuffee, Keith. \\"All-time scariest TV characters.\\" TV Squad, October 24, 2008.

He forms a link between earlier painters such as Guo Xi, Fan Kuan and Li Cheng and later artists such as Xia Gui and Ma Yuan. He perfected the technique of \\"axe-cut\\" brush-strokes. ==Biography== Li Tang was born ca. 1050, a native of Heyang. Already in his early years he earned his living by painting. Sometime after 1100, under Emperor Huizong, he earned the highest rank in the Painting Academy at the court in Bianjing (now Kaifeng). He survived the invasion by the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1126-27, and, together with the court, moved to Qiantang (now Hangzhou), which became the capital city of the newly established Southern Song Dynasty. He continued to serve as painter in the court under Emperor Gaozong, and died circa 1130. ==Character of his art== Duke Wen of Jin Recovering His State attributed to Li Tang (1140) Li was among the most influential of the early Southern Song landscape artists and had many followers. He represented a vital link between the Northern Song school (Guo Xi, Fan Kuan, Li Cheng, and others), and the later Southern Song painters, such as Xia Gui and Ma Yuan, both of whom studied Li's art. He developed and perfected the technique of the so-called \\"ax-cut\\" brushstrokes, which gave rocks and mountains a particularly fine quality. ===\\"Wind in Pines Among a Myriad Valleys\\"=== As with most Song artists, few of Li Tang's paintings survive, and most are of questionable authorship. The large hanging scroll Wind in Pines Among a Myriad Valleys (also known as Whispering Pines in the Mountains; National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan) is the only painting that bears a clear signature by the artist, which is placed on one of the peaks in the top section. It reads: \\"Painted by Li Tang of Ho-yang in Spring of the chia-ch'en year of the Hs√ºan-ho Reign of the Great Song [Dynasty].\\" The texture of the rocks in this painting is a standard example of the \\"ax-cut\\" strokes technique. ===Other attributed works=== Li Tang, Gathering Wild Herbs, Palace Museum, Beijing Other works commonly attributed to Li Tang are Intimate Scenery of River and Mountains, a long landscape scroll, and Sitting on Rocks Gazing at the Mist, both in the possession of the National Palace Museum. ==See also== *Chinese art *Chinese painting *Culture of the Song Dynasty *History of Chinese art == Notes == == References == * Barnhart, R.

He founded the not-for-profit production company Giorno Poetry Systems and organized a number of early multimedia poetry experiments and events, including Dial-A-Poem. He became prominent as the subject of Andy Warhol's film Sleep (1964). He was also an AIDS activist and fundraiser, and a long-time practitioner of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.All biographical information sourced from the introduction to Giorno's Subduing Demons in America: Selected Poems 1962‚Äì2007 (Berkeley: Soft Skull/Counterpoint, 2008) ==Biography== Giorno was born in New York City, and was raised both in Brooklyn and the Long Island town of Roslyn Heights. He attended high school at James Madison High School in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University in 1958, where he was a \\"college chum\\" of physicist Hans Christian von Baeyer.Hans Christian von Baeyer, Maxwell's Demon: Why Warmth Disperses and Time Passes (New York: Random House, 1998), 142. While in his early twenties, he briefly worked in New York City as a stockbroker. In 1962 he met Andy Warhol during Warhol's first New York Pop Art solo exhibit at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery. They became lovers and Warhol remained an important influence for Giorno's developments in poetry, performance and recordings. Warhol's 1964 silent film Sleep shows Giorno sleeping on camera for more than five hours. A lesser-known Warhol film featuring Giorno, John Washing (also 1963), runs a mere 4¬Ω minutes. Giorno and Warhol are said to have remained very close until 1964, after which time their meetings were rare. Their relationship was revived somewhat in the last year before Warhol's death. Inspired by Warhol, and subsequent relationships with Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, Giorno began applying Pop Art techniques of appropriation of found imagery to his poetry, producing The American Book of the Dead in 1964 (published in part in his first book, Poems, in 1967). Meetings with William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin in 1964 contributed to his interest in applying cut up and montage techniques to found texts, and (via Gysin) his first audio poem pieces, one of which was played at the Paris Museum of Modern Art Biennale in 1965. Inspired by Rauschenberg's Experiments in Art and Technology events of 1966, Giorno began making \\"Electronic Sensory Poetry Environments\\", working in collaboration with synthesizer creator Robert Moog and others to create psychedelic poetry installation/happenings at venues such as St. Mark's Church in New York. In 1965, Giorno founded a not-for- profit production company, Giorno Poetry Systems in order to connect poetry to new audiences, using innovative technologies. In 1967, Giorno organized the first Dial-A-Poem event at the Architectural League of New York, making short poems by various contemporary poets available over the telephone. The piece was repeated to considerable acclaim at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970, and resulted in a series of LP records compiling the recordings, which were issued by Giorno Poetry Systems. Some of the poets and artists who recorded or collaborated with Giorno Poetry Systems were Burroughs, John Ashbery, Ted Berrigan, Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass, Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Mapplethorpe. Giorno's text-based poetry evolved rapidly in the late 1960s from direct appropriation of entire texts from newspapers, to montage of radically different types of textual material, to the development of his signature double-column poems, which feature extensive use of repetition both across columns and down the page. This device allowed Giorno to mimic the echoes and distortions he was applying to his voice in performance. A number of these poems were collected in Balling Buddha (1970). The poems also feature increasingly radical political content, and Giorno was involved in a number of protests against the Vietnam war. Spiro Agnew called Giorno and Abbie Hoffman \\"would be Hanoi Hannahs\\" after their WPAX radio broadcasts made to the U.S. troops in South Vietnam on Radio Hanoi. Giorno travelled to India in 1971 where he met H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism. He became one of the earliest Western students of Tibetan Buddhism, and participated in Buddhist communities for several decades, inviting various Tibetan teachers to New York City and hosting them. Some of Giorno's poetry reflects Buddhist and other Asian religious themes beginning with his earliest verse, but the poems in Cancer In My Left Ball (1972) and those that follow involve a highly original interpenetration of Buddhist and Western avant-garde practices and poetics. Touring rock clubs in the 1970s with Burroughs, Giorno continued to develop an amplified, confrontational performance poetry that was highly influential on what became the Poetry Slam scene, as well as the performance art of Karen Finley and Penny Arcade, and the early Industrial music of Throbbing Gristle and Suicide. In 1982 he made the album Who Are You Staring At? with Glenn BrancaContinuo.wordpress.com and is prominently featured in Ron Mann's 1982 film Poetry in Motion. He stopped using found elements in his poetry in the early 1980s and henceforth pursued a kind of experimental realism, incantatory and repetitive yet at the same time lyrical. Giorno celebrated queer sexuality from the 1964 \\"Pornographic Poem\\", through his psychedelic evocations of gay New York City nightlife in the 1970s, to more recent poems such as \\"Just Say No To Family Values\\". He founded an AIDS charity, the AIDS Treatment Project in 1984, which continues to give direct financial and other support to individuals with AIDS to the present day. In addition to his collaborations with Burroughs, Giorno produced 55 LPs, tapes, videos and books. He performed at poetry festivals and events, notably in Europe where he was an active participant in the sound poetry scene for several decades. Giorno lived at 255 East 74th Street, when a small carriage house was located on the property. He later lived and worked from three lofts in a building in the Bowery neighborhood on the Lower East Side. In 2007 he appeared in Nine Poems in Basilicata, a film directed by Antonello Faretta based on his poems and his performances. In addition to his solo performances in live poetry shows, since 2005 he had collaborated in some music-poetry shows with Spanish rock singer and composer Javier Colis. The first career- spanning collection of Giorno's poems, Subduing Demons in America: Selected Poems 1962‚Äì2007, edited by Marcus Boon, was published by Soft Skull in 2008. In 2010, Giorno had his first one-person gallery show in New York City, entitled Black Paintings and Drawings, at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, wherein he exhibited works that chronicled the evolution of the poem painting. The first Poem Prints were part of the Dial-A-Poem installation in the 1970 exhibition Information at the Museum of Modern Art. Connecting words and images, the poet uses the materiality of the written word to confront audiences with poetry in different contexts. In 2011, he starred in one of two versions for the music video to R.E.M.'s final single \\"We All Go Back to Where We Belong\\". In September 2019 the film Inhale by J√ºrgen Schneider (http://www.juergen-schneider.org) was released on DVD (http://hybriden- verlag.blogspot.com/2019/09/inhale.html). It shows John Giorno performing at the graduation works in Hall, Tyrol, Austria. ==Death== Giorno died of a heart attack at age 82 on October 11, 2019, at his home in Lower Manhattan. At the time of his death, he was married to Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. ==References== ==Further reading== * Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz, \\"Ghosts of Public Sex.

Involving a former school bus in use by a church youth group and a pickup truck driven by an alcohol-impaired driver, the head-on collision was the deadliest incident involving drunk driving and the third-deadliest bus crash in United States history. Of the 67 people on the bus (counting the driver), there were 27 fatalities in the accident, the same number as the 1958 Prestonsburg, Kentucky, bus disaster and behind the 1976 Yuba City bus disaster (29) and 1963 Chualar bus crashes (32). In the aftermath of the disaster, several family members of victims became active leaders of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), and one (Karolyn Nunnallee) became national president of the organization. The standards for both operation and equipment for school buses and similar buses were improved in Kentucky and many other states. These include an increased number of emergency exits, higher standards for structural integrity, and the use of less volatile diesel fuel (over gasoline). On Interstate 71, the crash site is marked with a highway sign erected by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). Memorial items such as crosses and flower arrangements are regularly placed at the site by families and friends. ==Background== On May 14, 1988, a youth group consisting of mostly teenagers who attended North Hardin High School, James T. Alton Middle School, Radcliff Middle School and four adults from Assembly of God in Radcliff, Kentucky, boarded their church bus and headed to Kings Island theme park in Mason, Ohio, (north of Cincinnati, about 170 miles from Radcliff). The group included church members and their invited guests. As everyone arrived early that Saturday morning, the number of those wanting to go on the trip had grown to more than originally anticipated. The church's principal pastor (who stayed behind) restricted the ridership to the legal limit of 66 persons plus the driver. ===Bus=== The church bus involved in the crash was a conventional type body-on-chassis school bus model. The 1977 Ford B700 school bus chassis was equipped with a Superior school bus body, a model with 11 rows of wide seats on either side of a central aisle wide. The chassis was manufactured at Ford's expansive Kentucky Truck Plant located in Louisville and then was shipped to Lima, Ohio, where the body was installed at Superior Coach Company, a company owned by industrial conglomerate Sheller-Globe Corporation. It was certified as a \\"school bus\\" with an effective build date of \\"March 23, 1977,\\" which is when the chassis began production, as required by federal regulations. Both the vehicle type and the build date were important legal distinctions. March 23 was just nine days before fuel tank guard frames and greater access to emergency exits and a number of other improved safety standards, notably better clear space access to rear emergency exits, were required by revised federal regulations on all school buses built for use in the U.S. with beginning production dates of the chassis on or after April 1 of that year. The completed bus was delivered in time for use during the 197778 school year, and served ten years in use as a school bus. Radcliff Assembly of God acquired the used school bus as surplus from the Meade County school district, and it had been owned by the church for about one year. In use with the church, the bus had successfully made the same round-trip to Kings Island in July 1987, was used daily for short local moves on school days, and had made several other long trips. It was checked over regularly by mechanically-inclined church members, including a civilian motor pool supervisor from nearby Fort Knox. Two new tires of a good commercial quality had been installed a week before the ill-fated trip, and front end suspension and steering parts examined at that time. By all indications, the bus was in good condition mechanically on May 14, 1988. ===Trip=== On the trip, the bus was driven by John Pearman, a part-time associate pastor of the church who was a local court clerk. The group left the church early that morning and traveled uneventfully to the park. They spent the whole day and early evening at Kings Island, then boarded the bus and began traveling out of Ohio and back into Northern Kentucky toward Radcliff. After about an hour, they stopped to fill the 60-gallon (227-litre) fuel tank with gasoline, then resumed the trip southward. ====Collision==== At 10:55 p.m., while heading south on Interstate 71 outside of Carrollton, Kentucky, the bus collided almost head-on with a black 1987 Toyota pickup truck which was traveling the wrong way (north in the southbound lanes) at a high speed on a curved stretch of the highway. The small truck was driven by Larry Wayne Mahoney, a 34-year- old factory worker who was intoxicated. Mahoney later admitted he had been drinking in a bar and at a friend's house prior to the collision. Police also found a twelve-pack of Miller Lite beer in Mahoney's truck which was still cold and had several cans missing. The right front of the pickup truck struck the right front of the bus, breaking off the bus's suspension and driving the leaf spring backward into the gas tank mounted behind an exterior panel but outside the heavier frame, just behind the step well for the front door, rendering the door inoperative. Leaking gasoline from the punctured fuel tank was ignited by sparks caused from metal parts of the suspension scraping along the road. As the seat covers and the highly flammable polyurethane foam padding ignited, the temperature inside the bus rose to an estimated 2,000 degrees and a thick cloud of noxious smoke enveloped the area from the ceiling down to seat level within a minute or two, creating unsurvivable flash-fire conditions. During the accident, the left rear of the pickup truck spun 90 degrees to the right and, while doing so, struck the left side of a 1977 Cadillac Sedan de Ville heading in the same direction of the bus causing damage to the back driver's door and vinyl roof. The car had broken glass along with red plastic material that was from the taillight lens of the Toyota. ===Evacuation difficulties=== Nobody aboard the bus was seriously injured by the actual collision between the two vehicles (though both vehicle drivers sustained injuries). However, the impact of the collision created a secondary situation, as the right front suspension of the Ford chassis broke off through the bus stepwell, puncturing the gasoline fuel tank and igniting the fuel supply. To quickly evacuate the bus in smoke and darkness, all 67 individuals could use only a single designated point of exit: the rear emergency door. In total, 26 passengers and the bus driver died, 34 passengers were injured, and six passengers escaped the bus without serious injury. Larry Mahoney, the driver of the Toyota pickup, sustained injuries from the collision. Almost all of the occupants of the bus began trying to exit through the single rear emergency door. Exceptions were the driver, one chaperone who was said by many survivors to have tried to douse the flames with the fire extinguisher of the bus, and another chaperone, a small-bodied woman who managed to squeeze out a window opening on the left side immediately adjacent to her seating position near the front. Of the four adults aboard the bus, she was the only survivor. Attempts by some of the other passengers to break or kick out any of the split-sash-type side windows were unsuccessful. According to the NTSB investigation, more than 60 persons trying to reach the only available exit (the rear emergency door) created a crush of bodies in the aisle. Many passengers found themselves unable to move. A beverage cooler which had been earlier placed in the aisle near row 10 (of 11 rows of seats) further exacerbated this problem. Passersby and some of the escaped passengers helped to extract immobilized children through the rear door, and help them to ground level about below. Soon the entire interior of the bus flashed over, ultimately burning the trapped 27 people remaining aboard. At that point, no more passengers were accessible from outside the bus. Emergency vehicles had not yet arrived. ===Post-collision=== When fire first broke out immediately after the collision, bus driver John Pearman tried to put it out with a small fire extinguisher while passengers began to evacuate through the center rear emergency door, squeezing through the narrow opening between the two rear seats and jumping to the ground. The front door was blocked by collision damage, and there were no emergency exit windows or roof hatches, as found on commercial buses and some school buses of the time. Only one adult, a woman who was of small stature, managed to escape through a opening side window. When she looked back up from the ground, the window opening was filled with flames. The other three adults aboard, including Pearman, died. Survivors stated that after emptying the small fire extinguisher, Pearman helped some of the many children find their way down the narrow and dark aisle to the only practical way out of the smoke-filled bus. Several older boys attempted to kick out side windows without success. A pileup of passengers formed in and adjacent to the aisle leading to the rear door, which was partially blocked by seat backs from the last row and a cooler stored in the aisle near row 10. Many of those who made it to the area adjacent to the rear door were wedged in so tightly that passersby had to help pull children out by force from the human jam at the rear emergency door. However, within four minutes or less, the entire bus was on fire, and soon the exodus of passengers stopped. At that point, the passersby who had stopped to help could not reach those still aboard due to the raging fire, and turned their efforts to tending to the crowd of 40 mostly injured survivors. ===Emergency response=== After fire, rescue, and Kentucky State Police troopers responded to the scene, treated and transported survivors, and extinguished the fire, a crane was used to load the bus onto a flatbed truck that transported the bus and those persons killed to the National Guard Armory in Carrollton. There, the KSP and the Carroll County coroner went through the interior of the bus seat by seat to find and remove bodies. Most of the bodies were burned beyond recognition. Many bodies were found facing the only exit, the rear door. The coroner later determined that none of the bus occupants suffered broken bones or mortal injuries from the crash impact; all had died from the fire and smoke. Among the bus survivors, one person's leg from just below the knee had to be amputated, and about ten others suffered disfiguring burns. Only 6 bus passengers were uninjured and virtually all suffered varying degrees of emotional trauma and survivor guilt syndrome. When authorities were able to tally the counts from the various hospitals and the bodies aboard the bus, and autopsies had been conducted, it was determined that 27 persons had been killed by the fire, and another 34 aboard the bus injured, as well as the pickup truck driver who was also injured. As of February 2010, this collision had the highest death and injury toll of any school bus crash in United States history; a crash near Prestonsburg, Kentucky, in 1958 also claimed 27 lives, but there were not as many additional injuries. ==Aftermath== ===Changes in Kentucky=== Shortly after the collision, governor Wallace Wilkinson ordered his cabinet to review the state's drunk driving laws and bus safety regulations. At a news conference on May 20, 1988, Wilkinson announced stricter enforcement of drunk driving by the state, including police sobriety checkpoints and more frequent inspections by state Alcoholic Beverage Control. The governor also indicated support for increased safety standards for buses and training for bus drivers, and the state began offering free safety inspections for privately owned buses. Kentucky now requires all school buses to have nine emergency exits‚Äîmore than any other federal or state standard. This includes front and back doors, a side door, four emergency windows and two roof exits. The bus that crashed at Carrollton had only front and back exits, which was to be expected, as the bus was built years before tougher standards were enacted. Buses used by Kentucky schools must also have a cage around the fuel tank, a stronger frame and roof to resist crumpling on impact and rollover, high- backed seats, extra seat padding, a fuel system that slows leaks, flame- retardant seats and floors, reflective tape on all emergency exits, an wide black band with the district name in white letters on the side, and strobe lights on the exterior. Schools also must have a diesel-powered fleet. (Unlike gasoline, diesel fuel is not highly flammable.) In 1991, Kentucky enacted stricter drunk driving laws. ===NTSB report=== The National Transportation Safety Board responded, conducted an investigation and issued a report on March 28, 1989. The NTSB determined that \\"the probable cause of the collision between the pickup truck and the church activity bus was the alcohol-impaired condition of the pickup truck driver who operated his vehicle opposite to the direction of traffic flow on an interstate highway.\\" The agency also found that the design of the 11-year-old bus also contributed to the fatalities. The bus's fuel tank was unprotected, seat covers were made of flammable material, and the rear exit was partially blocked by a row of seats. The board recommended the phaseout of buses not meeting the federal standards established in 1977. The standards required all new school buses to have stronger fuel tanks, stronger seats and more accessible emergency exits. At the time the report was issued, about 22% of school buses in use nationwide were built before the standards were in place. The board also recommended stricter punishments for drunk driving. ===School bus and church bus standards and regulations=== A contributing factor to the crash itself and the severity seemed to be loopholes between the laws and procedures for a school bus and those involving the same vehicle after it was released from school service, but continued to be used for transporting passengers in non-school use. (Had the bus been built new in March 1977 for the non-school use such as a church activity bus, the applicable federal motor vehicle standards in place at that time would have required it to have been built with more emergency exits than were required for school buses). One of the NTSB recommendations after the Carrollton Bus Disaster was that school buses have no fewer emergency exits than required of non-school buses. Some states also require that the usually different seating capacities for children and adults be displayed near the service door of school buses and non-school buses. Most states consider secondary school (middle and high school) age students to be adults with regards to the space occupied in bus seats and aisles by their bodies. ===Sentencing of Larry Mahoney=== Mahoney had been previously arrested for driving under the influence in 1984, for which he was fined US$300 and his driver's license was suspended for six months. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) two hours after the crash was .24 percent‚Äîsubstantially more than the 1988 Kentucky legal limit of .10. Mahoney had no memory of the crash and learned of the collision after waking in the hospital the next day. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years after a jury of the Carroll Circuit Court, under Indictment No. 88-CR-27, convicted him of 27 counts of manslaughter in the second degree, 16 counts of assault in the second degree, and 27 counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree. At trial, he was represented by the Cleveland, Ohio, criminal defense lawyer, William L. Summers. On appeal, in Case No. 1988-CA-1635, Judge Anthony M. Wilhoit of the Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed Mahoney's conviction for drunk driving on the grounds that it constituted double jeopardy under the Kentucky Constitution, ruling that the 27 counts of manslaughter in the second degree subsumed the drunk-driving conviction. The court ruled that, under Kentucky law, the elements of drunk driving were substantially similar to those of manslaughter. This meant that Mahoney's driver's license could be reinstated, even during his imprisonment. The Kentucky Supreme Court subsequently reversed this line of reasoning in another case, Justice v. Commonwealth, 987 S.W.2d 306 (Ky. December 17, 1998). On May 6, 1992, the Kentucky Supreme Court denied review of Mahoney's appeal in Case No. 1992-SC-98. At the Kentucky State Reformatory, Mahoney worked in the medium-security facility as a clerk. He earned his GED high school equivalency diploma and attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Described by authorities as a model prisoner, Mahoney reduced his incarceration by six years with good behavior, known under Kentucky law as \\"good time\\" credit. He declined the Kentucky Parole Board's parole recommendation and served out his sentence, before leaving the prison in La Grange, on September 1, 1999, having served 10 years and 11 months. Local television stations broadcast video of him walking out of the prison. That week, according to a published account in The Courier-Journal (Louisville), some survivors of the crash and families of the victims had said that they were willing to forgive Mahoney although the disaster marked forever the congregation of the First Assembly of God, which had many members on the bus. \\"I feel a little bit sorry for him\\", Katrina Henderson, then 23, told The Courier-Journal in 1998. \\"He didn't wake up one day and say 'I'm going to kill 27 people.' That's not to take any blame away from him. I think that he is a person who made some very bad choices and he paid for those choices\\", said Henderson, who was age 12 when she survived the wreck. The victims were members of a church, and many felt called by their religious beliefs to forgive him. During his trial, the idea was discussed that Mahoney could save lives by talking to school groups, but Mahoney has so far declined. According to a story by The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2003, Mahoney was living in quiet, self-imposed obscurity in rural Owen County, Kentucky, about from the crash site. ===MADD and drunk driving prevention=== The collision riveted the nation's attention on the problem of drunken driving as never before and has been credited in part with causing the steady decline in the number of alcohol-related fatalities. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a grassroots organization, worked both before and after the Carrollton crash to reduce the hazards created by drunk (or drinking) drivers. One of the victims, the youngest killed on the fatal bus, was ten-year-old Patricia \\"Patty\\" Susan Nunnallee. Patty's mother, Karolyn Nunnallee, became an active member of MADD after the crash, eventually becoming MADD's national president. Patty's mother wrote on MADD's memorial web page to Patty: They were traveling on a school bus, so I thought she'd be safe. Janey Fair, whose 14-year-old daughter Shannon was killed, become a national volunteer for MADD, and rose within the organization to become national vice president. She was also head of the Kentucky Victims Coalition. According to the MADD website, \\"MADD helped me find my inner strength and see that life could go on,\\" Janey said. \\"I have found I can make real changes in people's attitudes about drinking and driving and in how our government addresses this critical problem. Additionally, I can help other victims move forward in their lives.\\" Her husband also became active locally in MADD. Joy Williams, wife of Lee Williams, a pastor of the church, and their two young daughters, Kristen and Robin, were among those killed. Dotty Pearman's husband, John Pearman, associate pastor at the church and the bus driver, was also killed while their daughter, Christy, was involved in the crash and survived. In the year after the crash, Lee Williams and Dotty Pearman, who barely knew each other before the crash, became friends and eventually married. Lee and Dotty Williams also volunteer for MADD. Lee is a former chapter president of MADD in Hardin County, Kentucky, and Dotty is the current president. The couple often speaks to school groups, assists with health fairs and participates in other local events. \\"If I can persuade one person not to drink and drive, I've won\\", said Dotty. \\"I especially think it is important to educate children early on about the dangers of drinking and driving. We need to address the issue of alcohol with youth before it becomes a problem.\\" In 2013, MADD produced a documentary about the crash titled Impact: After the Crash. ===Memorials=== Ford Motor Company paid for a black marble memorial in North Hardin Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Radcliff, Kentucky. The stone lists the names of all of the persons who were aboard the bus during the crash. The Kentucky Department of Transportation has two small signs, one in each direction of I-71, reading \\"SITE OF FATAL BUS CRASH MAY 14, 1988\\" at the site of the crash. There has been some controversy over the signs. ==Media coverage== Among the many media agencies that provided thorough coverage, The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky, received the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for General News Reporting for its coverage. Following the NTSB report, and much sooner in many instances, many federal, state, and local agencies and bus manufacturers changed regulations, vehicle features, and operating practices. There was considerable civil litigation. Ford Motor Company, Sheller-Globe Corporation, and others eventually contributed to settlements with all victims and/or their families. The collision and its aftermath, including efforts of some of the families to obtain more than financial settlements, were chronicled by author James S. Kunen in his 1994 book Reckless Disregard: Corporate Greed, Government Indifference, and the Kentucky School Bus Crash. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== *Cincinnati Enquirer (1998): 10th Anniversary of 1988 Bus Crash, with links *Cincinnati Enquirer (1998): Larry Mahoney on the 10th Anniversary of 1988 Bus Crash * *Pentecostal Evangel (February 29, 2004): Inferno on Interstate 71 Category:Bus crashes in the United States Category:1988 road incidents Category:1988 in Kentucky Category:Alcohol- related deaths in Kentucky Category:Carroll County, Kentucky Category:Transportation in Hardin County, Kentucky Category:Interstate 71 Category:Driving under the influence Category:Transportation disasters in Kentucky Category:Road incident deaths in Kentucky Category:May 1988 events in the United States ","title":"Carrollton bus collision"},{"id":"1272144","text":"MTN may refer to: * MTN Group, mobile telephone network operator in African and Middle Eastern countries **MTN-Qhubeka, cycling team sponsored by the telephone company * Maritime Telecommunications Network, satellite phone network * Martin State Airport, Baltimore, US, IATA code * Manitoba Television Network, later CHMI-TV and City Winnipeg and WIFI network * MTN (TV station), Griffith, New South Wales, Australia * Medium term note, a debt note * Michigan Talk Network, radio network * Metriol trinitrate, a liquid explosive similar to nitroglycerin * Montana Television Network, US * Mountain Air Cargo, ICAO airline designator * MountainWest Sports Network, dedicated to the Mountain West Conference * Multilateral trade negotiations, trade talks associated with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization ","title":"MTN"},{"id":"1272145","text":"Hugh Thomas may refer to: * Hugh Thomas (actor) (born 1949), Welsh actor * Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton (1931‚Äì2017), British historian and writer * Hugh Thomas (equestrian) (born 1948), British ex-Olympian and Badminton Horse Trials director and course-designer * Hugh Thomas (choral conductor), American choral conductor, pianist and educator * Hugh Thomas (coach), Australian rules football coach * Hugh Hamshaw Thomas (1885‚Äì1962), British paleobotanist * Hugh Owen Thomas (1834‚Äì1891), Welsh surgeon * Hugh Thomas (priest) (c. 1706‚Äì1780), Dean of Ely and Master of Christ's College, Cambridge ==See also== * Hugh Evan-Thomas (1862‚Äì1928), World War I admiral * Huw Thomas (1927‚Äì2009), Welsh broadcaster, barrister and Liberal politician * ","title":"Hugh Thomas"},{"id":"1272148","text":"', officially the ' (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. It is one of the highland towns forming the southern extremity of Laguna. It is situated at the foot of Mt. Banahaw. Liliw has a total land area of . It is bounded on the north-west by Santa Cruz; north-east by Magdalena; on the east by Majayjay; on the west by Nagcarlan; and on the south by Dolores, Quezon. Liliw is perhaps best known for its cold water spring resorts, native homemade sweets and a sizeable shoe industry that rivals that of Marikina City. The town is also known for its baroque church and its Liliw-style houses. The local government is currently undertaking means to conserve its cultural heritage sites and has proposed to enact a legislation that would mandate the usage of the Liliwstyle architecture as the only means of construction and re-construction in the town. If the ordinance passes, Liliw will have a greater chance to become a heritage town, and further support from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. ==History== Founded in 1571 by Gat Tayaw, the small town of Liliw is nestled at the foot of Mount Banahaw, away from Santa Cruz, Laguna's capital. According to a story, Liliw got its name from a bird. It was said that Gat Tayaw and his followers decided to erect a bamboo pole and to name the town after the bird that would first alight at the top of the pole within four days. A crow, however, was the first bird to alight on the pole. A crow was considered bad and so Gat Tayaw and his men moved south and erected another bamboo pole. A beautiful bird alighted on the pole and sang, \\"Liw, Liw, Liw\\". Thus the town became Liliw. Throughout the Spanish regime, the name Liliw was used. When the Americans came, it became Lilio since the Americans found it easier to pronounce it than Liliw. However, on June 11, 1965, the municipal council passed Resolution No. 38-S-65 which declared Liliw as the official name and spelling of the town. This was to avoid confusion in pronouncing and spelling the name of the town. ==Barangays== Liliw is politically subdivided into 33 barangays. * Bagong Anyo (Poblacion) * Bayate * Bongkol * Bubukal * Cabuyew * Calumpang * Culoy * Dagatan * Daniw * Dita * Ibabang Palina * Ibabang San Roque * Ibabang Sungi * Ibabang Taykin * Ilayang Palina * Ilayang San Roque * Ilayang Sungi * Ilayang Taykin * Kanlurang Bukal * Laguan * Luquin * Malabo-Kalantukan * Masikap (Poblacion) * Maslun (Poblacion) * Mojon * Novaliches * Oples * Pag-asa (Poblacion) * Palayan * Rizal (Poblacion) * San Isidro * Silangang Bukal * Tuy-Baanan ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Liliw was people, with a density of . ==Transportation== Tricycles and jeepneys are popular modes of transportation in Liliw. Buses are available to Santa Cruz, Calamba, and Metro Manila. How to get there Liliw is 110 kilometers from Manila via Santa Cruz and 105 kilometers via San Pablo. For those taking public transport, there are buses in Cubao in Quezon City, Buendia in Makati/Pasay, and Alabang in Muntinlupa going to either Santa Cruz or San Pablo. Travel time from Manila is about two hours. Upon arriving in either Santa Cruz or San Pablo, take a jeepney going to Liliw. Those bringing private vehicles have several options. The trip to Liliw can be combined with Nagcarlan and Majayjay using the San Pablo route or with Pagsanjan and Lake Caliraya using the Santa Cruz route. If it‚Äôs summer, avoid the Santa Cruz route as traffic at the Pansol area can become horrible. The route via San Pablo starts in Manila, enters South Luzon Expressway and exits from Santo Tomas. From there, continue driving to Alaminos town, then enter city of San Pablo, turn left to Rizal, continue driving via Nagcarlan before finally arriving in Liliw. Liliw is known for its baroque style church whose fa√ßade is made of striking red bricks. Known as St. John the Baptist church, its first church was built in wood in 1620. The stronger stone church was built from 1643 to 1646. The present church patio has been developed to promote Catholic teachings. Standing in front of the church are several elevated statues of different saints that are patrons of each of the town‚Äôs barangays (villages). Standing next to the municipal hall is the statue of Gat Tayaw. On Gat Tayaw and P. Burgos streets still stand the ancestral houses of many of Liliw‚Äôs prominent families who got rich during the American time from agricultural products like copra, lanzones, banana, and vegetables like tomatoes and mustasa. Liliw also has many natural attractions like the Kilangin Falls and the colds springs of Batis ng Liliw and Liliw Resort. But the town‚Äôs main attraction is its growing footwear industry. It started in 1931 when Casiano Pisuena became interested in making slippers. His first prototype was made from coconut husk and rubber from tire interiors. He soon became successful and many residents of Liliw followed suit. At present there are about 50 stores selling footwear in Liliw. The regular slippers are still the most popular, but many stores are now selling shoes, handbags and other leather goods. Most stores still carry the three-for-P100 slippers. The annual Tsinelas Festival is celebrated every end of April. ==Gallery== Image:Church of Liliw, Facade.jpgSaint John the Baptist Parish Church File:Liliwjf5832 06.JPGLiliw town hall File:Liliwjf5800 05.JPGPoblacion File:Liliw,Lagunajf5701 08.JPGTsinelas Capital of the Philippines ==References== ==External links== * Liliw Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * 1995 Philippine Census Information * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Laguna (province) Category:Populated places established in 1571 Category:1571 establishments in the Philippines ","title":"Liliw"},{"id":"1272152","text":"Kirk Wesley Rueter (born December 1, 1970) is a former left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. Rueter played for the Montreal Expos and the San Francisco Giants. ==Early life== Rueter was born in Centralia, Illinois, grew up in Hoyleton, Illinois and graduated from Nashville Community High School District 99 in Nashville, Illinois in 1988. He attended and played for Murray State University. ==Professional career== Drafted by the Montreal Expos in , Rueter broke into the majors in at twenty-two years old and posted an 8-0 record in 14 starts.http://www.baseball- almanac.com/players/player.php?p=rueteki01 He pitched for the Expos through the 1996 season and compiled an overall 25-12 record. On July 30, 1996, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants along with Tim Scott for Mark Leiter. Rueter blossomed into one of the Giants' most dependable starters. The following season, Rueter pitched in his first full season and to great success, going 13-6 with a 3.45 ERA in 32 starts with a career high 115 K's. In 1998, despite achieving a career high 16 victories, Rueter's ERA rose from the previous season, finishing with a 4.36 in 187+ innings. In 1999, backed with a lot of run support, Rueter reached 15 wins despite posting an ERA of 5.41, while also serving 28 home runs. In 2000, Rueter was the first pitcher to start a major league game at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco. By the end of the season, Rueter bounced back to post an ERA of 3.96, while also collecting 11 wins. For many fans, Rueter's defining moment as a Giant was his gutsy bullpen performance in Game 2 of the NLDS, where he relieved starter Shawn Estes after Estes sprained his ankle on a baserunning play. , the year of a Giants' World Series appearance, was statistically Rueter's best year. He went 14-8 with a 3.23 ERA. Rueter was the pitcher in Game 4 of the 2002 World Series; he went six innings, allowing three earned runs. Rueter also pitched shutout ball in relief of Liv√°n Hern√°ndez in Game 7 of the 2002 Series, but the Giants failed to score enough runs to come back. In 2003, despite posting a record of 10-5 in 27 starts, Rueter had an ERA of 4.53 and went through control problems throughout the season, recording 47 walks while striking out just 41. He began to struggle in with a 9-12 record and a 4.73 ERA, while continuing with his control issues from the previous season. Despite starting 33 games for the Giants, Rueter issued 66 walks while striking out 56. In , after posting a 2-7 record and 5.95 ERA, the Giants designated him for assignment. His nine-year tenure in San Francisco ended with some controversy, as Rueter complained about having to pitch out of the bullpen and only pitching three times in his last 41 days as a Giant. Rueter's trademarks were his fast-paced pitching style and his large ears. Rueter resides in Nashville, Illinois, with his wife and two daughters and his home is famous for its \\"Shed\\", a large recreational facility filled with games and sports memorabilia. Rueter also resided at the Shed during the off-seasons of his playing career. When the Giants made trips to St. Louis during the baseball season, Rueter invited the team to relax at his Shed. On March 6, 2006, Rueter announced his retirement from the game after 13 seasons. He retired as the Giants franchise record holder for career wins by a left-handed pitcher in the San Francisco Era (since broken by Madison Bumgarner), with 105 of his 130 career wins in a Giants uniform. Rueter has the 20th most wins all-time in Giants franchise history.San Francisco Giants Historical Player Stats He is the third all-time in wins during the San Francisco Era. He made the third most career starts in San Francisco Giants history. Only Juan Marichal and Gaylord Perry had more career starts and wins. The Giants honored Rueter's career during pregame ceremonies on \\"Kirk Rueter Day\\" at SBC Park on August 19, 2006, by giving Rueter a lifesize bobblehead of his likeness and giving him and his family a trip to Hawaii.Kirk Rueter Day ==Scouting report== Throughout his career, Rueter was primarily a control and changeup pitcher. His fastball rarely hit 90 mph. He threw changeups, fastballs, sinkers, curveballs, cut fastballs, and sliders. He also was an exceptional fielder, ranking highly in defensive metrics throughout his career.Rueter's Baseball- Reference.com Bullpen page describes him as one of baseball's all-time best fielding pitchers. He posted a career .988 fielding percentage with only seven errors in 581 total chances covering 1918 innings. Some credited the effects of the QuesTec umpiring system to his decline, because Rueter's success came mostly from being able to \\"paint the corners\\" of the strike zone and the system effectively took that ability away from him because it encouraged umpires to call a tighter strike zone. Rueter was never a strikeout pitcher; he struck out more than a hundred batters in a season only twice in his career. Former teammate Rich Aurilia said, \\"He was very, very capable of winning with his stuff because he had confidence in what he could do. He always pitched to what his strengths were.\\" ==Personal== Although Rueter never attended the University of North Carolina, he is an avid fan of Tar Heels basketball. ==References== ==External links== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Baseball players from Illinois Category:Fresno Grizzlies players Category:Gulf Coast Expos players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Montreal Expos players Category:Murray State Racers baseball players Category:Ottawa Lynx players Category:People from Centralia, Illinois Category:People from Nashville, Illinois Category:People from Washington County, Illinois Category:Phoenix Firebirds players Category:Rockford Expos players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Sumter Flyers players ","title":"Kirk Rueter"},{"id":"1272158","text":"SNN may refer to: * Shannon Airport (Ireland), whose IATA airport code is SNN * Simulated Neural Network or Static Neural Network, another term for an Artificial Neural Network * Spiking neural network, a type of Artificial Neural Network * SNN (gene), a human gene encoding the protein stannin *SNN: Student News Agency, an Iranian news agency running in Tehran, Iran. * SNN: Suncoast News Network, a 24/7 local news operation running in Sarasota, Florida * SNN: Showbiz News Ngayon, a Philippine news show for the showbiz * Sun News Network, a Canadian 24h news network * Sarimanok News Network, a Philippine 24/7 News Channel since 1996, Now ABS-CBN News Channel ","title":"SNN"},{"id":"1272161","text":"Mayville State University (MSU or MaSU) is a public university in Mayville, North Dakota. It is part of the North Dakota University System. ==History== Old Main, Mayville State University Founded as a normal school by provision of the North Dakota Constitution in 1889, Mayville State was granted 30,000 acres (120 km¬≤) of land and organized by the first Legislative Assembly. Classes began in 1889, with funds for the current Old Main a building provided by the Second Legislative Assembly in early 1891, where classes were initially held in 1894. In 1926, the State Board of Higher Education authorized Mayville State to grant a Bachelor of Arts in Education. The Mayville Normal School thus became a teacher's college, providing general education and offering a four-year degree. Successive additions strengthened the curriculum; and as enrollment grew, new buildings appeared. In 1948, the B.A. in Education became a B.S. in Education and the first non-teaching Bachelor of Arts was offered in 1961. In 1973 and 1982, the college established programs in business administration and computer studies respectively. In the early 1980s, the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of General Studies became available. The present name, Mayville State University, was approved by the legislature in 1987. On April 9, 2010, the university broke ground on \\"the first state funded building in more than 40 years.\\" Agassiz Hall, the largest residence hall has been remodeled to provide suite- and apartment-style living accommodations for men and women. An addition to the science and library buildings is providing a new home for the Division of Education and Psychology. Great progress continues to be made on a state-funded HPER project, which involves replacement of the 1929 Old Gymnasium and expansion of classroom and lab/practice space for Sports Management, Fitness and Wellness, Health Education, and Physical Education majors. ==Athletics== Comets Logo Mayville State teams, nicknamed athletically as the Comets, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as a member of the North Star Athletic Association. Men's sports include baseball, basketball and football; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, softball and volleyball. The Mayville State University Comets finished runner-up at the NAIA Division II Men's Basketball National Tournament in 2007. This is the only men's basketball team in North Dakota history to play in a national collegiate championship game. Mayville State's softball team appeared in one Women's College World Series in 1976. == References == ==External links== *Official website *Official athletics website Category:Educational institutions established in 1889 Category:Buildings and structures in Traill County, North Dakota Category:Education in Traill County, North Dakota Category:1889 establishments in Dakota Territory Category:Public universities and colleges in North Dakota ","title":"Mayville State University"},{"id":"1272166","text":"Castrol is a British global brand of industrial and automotive lubricants offering a wide range of oils, greases and similar products for most lubrication applications. ==History== The Wakefield Oil Company was founded by Charles Cheers Wakefield in 1899. The brand \\"Castrol\\" originated after researchers added castor oil to their lubricant formulations. In 1966, Castrol was acquired by company Burmah Oil, which was renamed Burmah-Castrol. Burmah- Castrol was purchased by London-based multinational BP in 2000. ==Sponsorship== ===Motorsport=== A Castrol sponsored NASCAR Pinty's Series (formerly CASCAR) Dodge Charger The brand has been involved in Formula One for many years, supplying to a number of teams, including McLaren (1979‚Äì1980 and 2017‚Äì2020), Williams (1997‚Äì2005), Team Lotus (1992‚Äì1993), Brabham (1983‚Äì1984), Jaguar (2000‚Äì2004), Renault (2017‚Äìpresent) and Walter Wolf Racing. Castrol has sponsored the Ford World Rally Team and M-Sport in the World Rally Championship since 2003, and the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT factory team from 2016, to 2019. It has also sponsored Volkswagen Motorsport activities in the Dakar Rally and later the World Rally Championship since 2005. Audi Sport's activities in rallying and touring car racing have been sponsored by Castrol, as well as its Le Mans Prototypes program since 2011. BMW Motorsport was sponsored by Castrol from 1999 to 2014. Toyota Motorsport GmbH had Castrol sponsorship in the World Rally Championship from 1993 to 1998, and Hyundai Motorsport did so from 2000 to 2002. Also, the Honda factory team at the World Touring Car Championship has Castrol sponsorship since 2012. In the All-Japan GT Championship, the TOM'S Toyota Supra and later the Mugen Honda NSX had Castrol sponsorships. In North America, Castrol has been an active sponsor of NHRA drag racing. Castrol sponsored John Force Racing under the GTX brand from 1987 until the end of the 2014 season. Also, the All American Racers had Castrol sponsorship in the CART World Series from 1996 to 1999. In 2014, Castrol sponsored former Indy 500-winning IndyCar team Bryan Herta Autosport, with English rookie Jack Hawksworth behind the wheel. Castrol is the name sponsor of Castrol Raceway, a multi-track oval, drag, and motocross racing facility in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Castrol is the sponsor of D.J. Kennington in the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and NASCAR Cup Series. In Australia, Castrol is currently a title sponsor of Kelly Racing and driver Rick Kelly, and a primary sponsor of Tickford Racing.

In conjunction with a multi-year series sponsorship, between 2014 - 2016 several race events acquired Castrol naming rights including the Castrol Edge Townsville 500 and the Castrol Gold Coast 600. Castrol was the title sponsor of Team Bray, owned by Australian drag car legend, Victor Bray for 17 years. Castrol was the main sponsor of the Castrol International Rally in Canberra for more than 10 years between 1976 and 1986. The same was true for an International Rally held in South Africa, ending annually in neighbouring Swaziland. It was the most prestigious event on the South African rally calendar at the time, until Castrol ended its sponsorship of this event. Later only some competitors' cars were carrying the bright green and red colours of Castrol sponsorship in national rally events, notably the S.A. Toyota dealer team. In 2019, Castrol extended their sponsorship activities by re-forming a partnership with Jaguar, this time supporting them in Formula E and also NASCAR Cup Series giants Roush Fenway Racing-Ford since 2020 season. ===American football=== Castrol advertising has been a part of telecasts of the National Football League for years. In 2011, Castrol's Edge brand became the official motor oil sponsor for the league, along with Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson endorsing the product; it has since been renewed until the 2017 season. The endorsement deal with Peterson was terminated on 16 September 2014, due to ongoing child abuse allegations. === Cricket === The Castrol Cricket Index for a team is a dynamic indicator of the overall performance of the cricket team. It is calculated by taking into consideration the batting momentum, the bowling efficiency, the performance of the teams in the quick start overs and the extreme performance overs and many other factors. Castrol Cricket also ranks cricketers based on their overall performance. India centric initiatives being undertaken like Castrol World Cup ka Hero was created during the 2011 Cricket World Cup. === Rugby Union === In 2011, Castrol signed a four-year sponsorship deal for the Australian national rugby union team and as the naming rights sponsor of The Rugby Championship. ==Advertising== It's More Than Just Oil. It's Liquid Engineering is the advertising slogan or punchline of Castrol, used mainly for branding its engine oil products. Castrol products are still marketed under the red, white and green colour scheme that dates from the launch of Castrol motor oil in 1909. Advertisements for Castrol oil historically featured the slogan \\"Castrol ‚Äì liquid engineering\\"; this was more recently refreshed and reintroduced as \\"It's more than just oil. It's liquid engineering.\\" In 2008, this slogan was also being featured as the name for a new rewards club called the \\"Castrol Liquid Engineering Crew\\" in which members get the chance to win prizes. For many years, the opening notes of the second Nachtmusik movement of Mahler's Seventh Symphony were used as the signature theme of Castrol TV commercials. Wakefield vehicles advertised the company and Castrol on their sides; models of them were made by Dinky Toys, and in later times became sought-after collectors' items. One example from 1934 to 1935, in very good to excellent condition, was estimated to fetch ¬£1,000-¬£1,500 at auction in 2016. ==References== ==External links== *Official Site ‚Äì Castrol Motor Oil Category:Automotive companies of the United States Category:BP subsidiaries * Category:Chemical companies of the United States Category:Motor oils Category:British companies established in 1899 Category:Energy companies established in 1899 Category:Multinational companies Category:Oil companies of the United States Category:Petroleum products Category:British brands Category:1899 establishments in England ","title":"Castrol"},{"id":"1272169","text":"Deflection or deflexion may refer to: * Deflection (ballistics), a technique of shooting ahead of a moving target so that the target and projectile will collide * Deflection (chess), a tactic that forces an opposing chess piece to leave a square * Deflection (engineering), the displacement of a structural element under load * Deflexion (linguistics), a linguistic process related to inflectional languages * Deflection (physics), the event where an object collides and bounces against a plane surface * Deflection (psychology), a psychological Defence mechanism * Deflection routing, a routing strategy for networks to reduce the need of buffering packets * Deflection yoke, a kind of magnetic lens used in cathode ray tubes * Electrostatic deflection, a technique for modifying the path of charged particles by the use of an electric field * Khet (game), formerly known as Deflexion, an Egyptian-themed chess-like abstract strategy board game using lasers == See also == * * * Deflector (disambiguation) ","title":"Deflection"},{"id":"1272172","text":"Basil Lee Whitener (May 14, 1915 ‚Äì March 20, 1989) was a Democratic U.S. Representative from North Carolina between 1957 and 1969.

In 1919, at the height of the Russian Civil War, Alexandrov graduated from high school in Kiev. The certificate gave the right to enter the university at the physics and mathematics or medical faculty. When the Red Army captured Kiev on February 5, 1919, Alexandrov and a friend were at a dacha in Mlynka. He and his friend encountered a officer of White Guard, who urged them to enlist. They went to the front with the officer. At the age of 16, he became a cadet and fought in the Army of Wrangel as a machine gunner, and was awarded three Crosses of St. George. During the evacuation of remnants of the White Guard army from Crimea to Turkey, Alexandrov refused to leave and preferred to stay. As a result, he was captured and sentenced to death, but he narrowly escaped. ==Scientific career== Later he worked as an assistant at the Kiev Mining Institute as an electrician. He later worked as an electrical engineer at the Kiev Physicochemical Society under the Political Education and a high school teacher in the village of Belki, Kiev region. For several years, he combined his studies at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Kiev University, where he studied from 1924 to 1930, with teaching physics and chemistry at school#79 in Kiev. After graduating from Faculty of Physics in Kiev University in 1930, he worked at the X-ray Physics Department in the Kiev Institute of Health. After his graduation in 1930, he was invited by Abram Ioffe to join him in Leningrad. At Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute, he developed a statistical theory of strength and doctoral dissertation - \\"Relaxation in Polymers\\" (1941). From the spring of 1931, he worked at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, where he became a candidate, and then a professor of physical and mathematical sciences. ===World War II=== Alexandrov became prominent during World War II, when he devised in collaboration with Igor Kurchatov a method of demagnetizing ships to protect them from German naval mines. On 9 August 1941, Alexandrov and Kurchatov arrived in Sevastopol to organize work on equipping the Black Sea Fleet ships with the system, and by the end of October it had been installed on more than 50 ships. At the same time, Alexandrov and Kurchatov continued research to improve it. The method was effective by the end of 1941 and was in active use through the end of the war and afterwards. It was successfully used by the Soviet Navy, during the Siege of Sevastopol, Siege of Leningrad, on the Volga River during the Battle of Stalingrad and in the Baltic Sea campaigns. ===Later career=== Both Alexandrov and Kurchatov worked at the Ioffe Institute by that time (their laboratory separated from the Ioffe Institute and moved to Moscow in 1943 for the work on the Soviet atomic bomb project). From 1946 to 1955, he was director of the Institute for Physical Problems, where he was appointed to replace Pyotr Kapitsa. In 1955, he became deputy director of the Institute of Atomic Energy, and after the death of Kurchatov in 1960, he became its director. On the initiative of Alexandov, power plants for the nuclear icebreakers Lenin, Arktika, and Sibir were developed. Alexandrov was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1962. It was under the leadership of Alexandrov, that technical, organizational and production problems were solved in an unprecedentedly short time during the construction of the USSR's first nuclear submarine with a nuclear propulsion system. As a result, in 1952-1972, Sevmash mastered the serial production of submarines with a nuclear propulsion system and became the largest nuclear submarine shipbuilding center in the USSR and the world. At Sevmash, 163 combat submarines were built. In the 1970s, the company produced Typhoon-class nuclear submarines, which entered into the Guinness Book of Records as the largest submarines in the world. In the 1960s, on the initiative of Alexandov, the largest helium liquefaction plant was built in the USSR . This provided a wide front for fundamental research in the physics of low temperatures, as well as on the technical use of superconductivity. He was the scientific supervisor of the project of RBMK reactor plants. Described by colleagues as a brilliant scientist and organizer, he was deeply affected by the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear accident in history. It killed at least 32 people and caused widespread radioactive contamination. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated as a result. According to him: > \\"To manage such an institute as the IAE, the largest institute and the most > difficult work, and at the same time take care of the Academy - I must say, > it was extremely difficult. In the end it ended sadly. And when the > Chernobyl accident happened, I believe that from that time both my life > began to end, and my creative life.\\" The accident subsequently prompted the Soviet Government to review and suspend the ambitious nuclear power program. As principal designer of the RBMK reactor that exploded at Chernobyl, Alexandrov refused to concede that a design flaw contributed to disaster. Alexandrov died of cardiac arrest on 3 February 1994 in Moscow. He is buried at the Mitinskoe Cemetery in Moscow. ==Personal life== Alexandrov was first married to Antonina Mikhailovna Zolotareva, with whom he had a son Yuri, a physicist. Antonia died in 1947. Alexandrov later remarried to Marianna Alexandrovna Balashov. They had a daughter Maria, who became a biologist, and two sons Peter and Alexander. Peter became a physicist and Alexander became a biologist. Marianna died in 1986. His nephew is Eugene Alexandrov, a Russian physicist and Member of Russian Academy of Sciences (since 1992). ==Honours and awards== ;Army of Wrangel { 60px Cross of St. George, 2nd class - 60px Cross of St. George, 3rd class - 60px Cross of St. George, 4th class - } ;Soviet Union { 20px20px20px Hero of Socialist Labor, thrice (1954, 1960, 1973) - 60px Nine Orders of Lenin (1945, 1949, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1960, 1973, 1978, 1983) - 60px Order of the October Revolution (1967) - 60px Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class (1985) - 60px Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1945) - 60px Medal \\"For the Defence of Leningrad\\" (1942) - 60px Medal \\"For the Defence of Stalingrad\\" (1942) - 60px Medal \\"For the Defence of Sevastopol\\" (1942) - 60px Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\" (1945) - 60px Medal \\"For Distinction in Guarding the State Border of the USSR\\" (1950) - 60px Medal \\"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\" (1945) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945\\" (1965) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"Thirty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\" (1975) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"Forty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\" (1985) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\\" (1969) - 60px Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\" (1974) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"50 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" (1967) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"60 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" (1978) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"70 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" (1988) - 60px Medal \\"In Commemoration of the 800th Anniversary of Moscow\\" (1947) - 60px Medal \\"In Commemoration of the 250th Anniversary of Leningrad\\" (1957) - } ;Foreign { - 60px Order of The People's Republic of Bulgaria, 1st class (Bulgaria) - 60px Order of the Flag of the Republic of Hungary (Hungary) - 60px Order of Sukhbaatar (Mongolia) - 60px Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, Commander with star (Poland) - } ;Other awards * Lenin Prize (1959) * Stalin Prize (1942, 1949, 1951, 1953) * Diploma of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation (1993) * Kurchatov Medal (1968) * Lomonosov Gold Medal (1978) * Vavilov Gold Medal (1978) * XXXVIII Mendeleev Reader (4 February 1982) == References == == External links == * * Category:1903 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Tarashcha Category:People from Tarashchansky Uyezd Category:Russians in Ukraine Category:Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Fifth convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Sixth convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Tenth convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Eleventh convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Russian inventors Category:Russian physicists Category:Russian professors Category:Soviet inventors Category:Soviet physicists Category:Soviet professors Category:20th-century physicists Category:Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv alumni Category:Presidents of the USSR Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Members of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences Category:White movement people Category:Recipients of the Cross of St. George Category:Stalin Prize winners Category:Recipients of the USSR State Prize Category:Lenin Prize winners Category:Heroes of Socialist Labour Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Lomonosov Gold Medal Category:Recipients of the Medal \\"For Distinction in Guarding the State Border of the USSR\\" Category:Recipients of the Order of Sukhbaatar Category:Recipients of the Order of the Flag of the Hungarian Republic Category:Commanders with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland ","title":"Anatoly Alexandrov (physicist)"},{"id":"1272221","text":"North Dakota State College of Science Campus in Wahpeton, ND.

In the most popular version, the two stop in a cherry orchard, and Mary asks her husband to pick cherries for her, citing her child. Joseph spitefully tells Mary to let the child's father pick her cherries.Garvey, Jim. \\"History of Hymns: ‚ÄúThe Cherry Tree Carol‚Äù, Discipleship Ministries, UMC At this point in most versions, the infant Jesus, from the womb, speaks to the tree and commands it to lower a branch down to Mary, which it does. Joseph, witnessing this miracle, immediately repents his harsh words. The more contemporary versions sometimes end here, while others often include an angel appearing to Joseph and telling him of the circumstances of Jesus's birth. Other versions then jump ahead several years, where the next verse picks up with Jesus on his mother's lap, telling her of his eventual death and resurrection. ==Sources== The story is derived from the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, written around the year 650,Ehrman, Bart and Plese, Zlatko, \\"The Gospel of Pseudo -Matthew\\", The Apocryphal Gospels, OUP, 2011, p. 75 which combines many earlier apocryphal Nativity traditions; however, in Pseudo-Matthew, the event takes place during the flight into Egypt, and the fruit tree is a palm tree (presumably a date palm) rather than a cherry tree. In the apocryphal Gospel, Jesus has already been born and so Joseph's truculence is unrelated to any dismay over Mary's pregnancy, but has to do with an inability to reach the fruits of the palm and a concern over the family's lack of water.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 1, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The carol is found in the ‚ÄúN-Town Plays,‚Äù performed in the English Midlands around 1500.Leith, Mary Joan Winn. \\"The Origins of 'The Cherry Tree Carol'‚Äù, Biblical Archaeology Society, December 2, 2018 Having developed out of the folk tradition, there are a number of versions of text and tune. ==Recordings== Many traditional versions have been collected in the last century, such as an audio recording of Bob Arnold of Burford, Oxfordshire, England, and another of Thomas Moran of Mohill, Co. Leitrim, Ireland. The song presumably made its way to the United States centuries ago, where Appalachian singer Jean Ritchie was recorded singing two traditional versions with slightly different tunes. The version sung on Ritchie's album Carols for All Seasons (1959) was taken by Joan Baez, who released her own rendition in 1961 on the album Joan Baez, Vol. 2 with an added guitar accompaniment, bringing this version of the song mainstream popularity.\\"Joan Baez, 'The Cherry-Tree Carol'\\", American Songwriter, December 20, 2010 The song has been recorded by Shirley Collins & Davy Graham (also by herself and with The Young Tradition), Marty Haugen, Kacy & Clayton, the Clancy Brothers (as \\"When Joseph Was an Old Man\\"), Judy Collins, Jos√© Feliciano, Emmylou Harris, Mary Hopkin (as B-side of the single \\"Mary had a Baby/Cherry Tree Carol\\"), the King's College Choir, Cindy Kallet, Magpie Lane, Mark Lanegan, Colin Meloy, the Chad Mitchell Trio, Nowell Sing We Clear, Pentangle, Angelo Branduardi (two Italian versions: \\"Il ciliegio\\" and \\"Rosa di Galilea\\"), Peter Paul and Mary, Jean Ritchie, Casey Stratton, Bob Rowe, John Rutter (with the Cambridge Singers), the Poor Clares from New Orleans (\\"Cherry Tree Carol\\" on their album Songs for Midwinter), Sting (If on a Winter's Night), and Kerfuffle (as \\"Cherry Tree Carol\\" on their Midwinter album Lighten the Dark). ==See also== *List of the Child Ballads ==References== ==External links== * Clancy Bros., \\"When Joseph was an old man\\" Category:Child Ballads Category:Songs about trees Category:Christmas carols Category:Year of song unknown Category:Songwriter unknown Category:Songs about Jesus ","title":"The Cherry-Tree Carol"},{"id":"1272234","text":"Ali Bey () (La Marsa 14 August 1817 - La Marsa 11 June 1902) was the Husainid Bey of Tunis from 1882 until his death. He was the first ruler under the French protectorate. He was named Bey al-Mahalla (Heir Apparent) on 23 August 1863 by his brother Muhammad III as-Sadiq and was made a divisional General and placed at the head of an army column operating in the interior of the country (known in Tunisian Arabic as the mhalla) to assert beylical authority in remote regions, rendering justice in the name of the sovereign and collecting taxes from local tribes. A keen horseman, Ali Bey took personal charge of this work and undertook it thoroughly, twice a year - in the north of the country during the summer in B√©ja and El Kef, and in the south during the winter, in Kairouan and the towns further south. During the Mejba Revolt in 1864, while his ineffective brother remained in the Bardo palace, Ali put down the rebellion with Generals Ahmed Zarrouk, Rustum and Uthman. Portrait of Ali III BeyFollowing the French conquest of Tunisia and the signing of the Treaty of Bardo, Ali Bey succeeded his brother Muhammad III as-Sadiq on 29 October 1882. At the same time, he became an honorary Marshal in the army of the Ottoman Empire, as Tunisia was still nominally an Ottoman province. His first act as sovereign was to accept the resignation of his father's old mamluk, the minister Mohammed Khaznadar, and replaced him, for the first time in the country's history, with a Grand Vizier of native (i.e. non-Turkish) extraction, Mohammed Aziz Bouattour. On 8 June 1883, together with French Resident General Paul Cambon, he signed the Conventions of La Marsa in which he formally renounced his power while retaining nominal authority., The country remained under the occupation of the French expeditionary force of General Forgemol. The entire administration of the country, as well as control of the army, police and foreign affairs, was taken over by the colonial power. On 5 April 1885 there was a political crisis arising from Cambon's decision to revoke the existing concession to supply water to the city of Tunis, which was valid for another eighteen years, and grant a new concession to a French company in which the brother of Prime Minister Jules Ferry had an interest. The entire city council of Tunis resigned, and a mass delegation of more than 2,000 notables from the souks and the traditional authorities of the city of Tunis came to at the palace of La Marsa, appealing for the Bey to revise the new municipal law and to repeal the water concession.http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1967_num_54_194_1445 accessed 29/4/2017 The old ruler, more popular than his late brother, was overcome with emotion at his inability to act on their petition. 'You have come to weep in the house of tears' he replied to them.Honor√© Pontois, Les odeurs de Tunis, √©d. Albert Savine, Paris, 1889, The colonial authorities took punitive action against the leaders of the demonstration without his being able to assist them. Cambon responded to this show of protest by sending leading figures into exile in El Kef and Gabes, and dismissing the top city officials from their posts on the grounds that they were 'fanatics hostile to the Protectorate'. Ali Bey met Sheikh Muhammad Abduh, one of the leading jurists and reformers in the Arab world, when he came to Tunis (December 1884-January 1885) to teach at the Zitouna mosque.http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1967_num_54_194_1445 accessed29/4/2017 Ali Bey withdrew increasingly from the affairs of state before he died.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality, named after the country's national hero Jos√© Rizal, is one of the youngest municipalities in Laguna. This town is the birthplace of the milky mixed vegetable dish called \\"amenudong gulay\\".. The people from this town have an old tradition of celebrating Christmas on January 6. There was also a legend of Michael the Archangel apparitions at the town's biggest natural spring \\"Bukal ni San Miguel\\" during the Spanish era, making St. Michael the town's patron saint. Rizal is the town where the WW2 hero Brig. Gen. Marcos V. Agustin (AKA Marcos Marking), Commander of the Marking's Guerillas is known to be buried and is also the hometown of Filipina actress-politician Angelica Jones. ==History== The kaingineros were among the first reported settlers in this part of Laguna around the 17th century. Around mid-1800, this area was called barrio \\"Pauli\\" and was part of the town of Nagcarlan. Residents from this place used to say that the barrio \\"Pauli\\" got its name from the way that its brook flows at the edge of the settlement, whose stream flows back and forth. ‚ÄúPauli,‚Äù must have come from the Tagalog word ‚ÄúPauli-uli,‚Äù which means coming back and forth. Ever since, local villagers earn their living by farming. The soil in this barrio is rich and is abundant of water for there were numerous natural springs around the settlement, making the settlers enjoy bountiful harvests of coconuts, root crops, vegetables, and rice. Locales also thrive by fishing from the Mayton and Mayit brooks and Lawa ng Kalibato (Calibato Lake), which the village share with the town of Sampalok, which is now San Pablo City. When the Spanish rule ended and the Philippines became a commonwealth state of the United States, Pauli became independent from the town of Nagcarlan and became a new township. The American Federal Government appointed Pedro Urrea the Municipal President. Nevertheless, Pauli's township lasted only for a brief two years. Its inability to support its administrative expenses caused Pauli to affiliate once more with its mother town. However, between 1912 and 1915, residents led by Fortunato Urrea Arban, Agustin Vista, and Felix Isles, former municipal councilors campaigned to regain their municipal status. The petition included the inclusion of barrios Antipolo, Entablado, Laguan, Pook, Mayton, Pauli, Talaga and Tuy. On December 18, 1918, Governor Francis Burton Harrison issued Executive Order 56 creating the Municipality of Rizal, naming the town after the foremost national hero Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Officials inaugurated the new town a year after on January 7, 1919 and had Fortunato Urrea Arban as mayor. Before the citizens of Pauli won back their township, Innocente Sumague donated a piece of land for the construction of a church (Parroquia De San Miguel Arcangel) in 1916. Construction workers quarried Mayton Creek for stones and gravel. The quarry claimed many lives before the construction ended, in time for the midnight mass of Christmas of 1917. Pablo Urrea became the mayor in 1941 and subsequently relinquished his post to lead the guerrilla fighters during the Japanese occupation. ==Geography== It is a landlocked municipality located from the provincial capital Santa Cruz and is bounded on the north by municipality of Calauan, on the east by Nagcarlan, on the west by San Pablo City, and on the south by Dolores, Quezon.

Prior to municipal amalgamation in 1995, Chatham was an incorporated town in Northumberland County along the south bank of the Miramichi River opposite Douglastown. Since amalgamation, it has been sometimes referred to as Miramichi East. Communities amalgamated in 1995 to form the City of Miramichi, New Brunswick ==Impact of geography on history== At Chatham, the Miramichi River is quite wide, the water salt and tidal. Just downstream from the town, the river begins to widen into a broad estuary, where the Miramichi River gradually becomes Miramichi Bay. Because of its eastward facing location, ships coming from the British Isles in early times had easy access through the Strait of Belle Isle and across the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It was more accessible and safer to get to than the ports of Quebec City or Saint John, New Brunswick. In colonial times, the surrounding lands were heavily forested; the stands of eastern white pine were especially valued for ships' masts. The river teemed with fish, Atlantic salmon the most prized. Abundant game roamed the forests, and berries were a valuable food supplement. Atlantic Salmon Scottish immigrants to the area found it familiar. The rocks in the Miramichi are similar to those of Scotland, being a part of the same formation before continental drift separated them. Seabirds and fish are often the same or similar. The Atlantic salmon, the herring gull and the common tern were found in both areas. The Scots had the technology and know-how to cut lumber, fish, farm and build ships. The Irish immigrants did not bring the same skills, as their forests had long been cut down and they did not have such a well- developed fishing industry. They picked up skills from their neighbours. As urban English immigrants did not have these skills, and farmers were used to a more moderate climate, they tended to settle elsewhere. At Chatham, the river banks are low but not subject to flooding, and are thus well suited as a location for wharves. With a deep channel close to the shore, the largest ships in colonial times could approach the wharves. Away from the shore, the land gradually rises several hundred feet. The soil, while sandy and a bit acid, supports potatoes, root crops and apple trees. All these circumstances made Chatham an ideal location for lumbering and fishing. ==History== ===Early settlement=== In 1765, the troop transport Pitt (reputedly named after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham) was shipwrecked in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Tradition holds that one of the ship's boats, named the \\"Chatham\\", washed up near the Miramichi River, giving rise to the town's name.Thomas Barlow Smith, Young Lion of the Woods, p. 7 R.B. Bennett, future Prime Minister of Canada, first entered politics in Chatham. In 1800 Francis Peabody settled in the location that became Chatham, which was then known as The Spruce, after a large spruce tree.W. A. Spray, \\"PEABODY, FRANCIS,\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 7, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed November 8, 2015, . The Miramichi River is nearly a mile wide here. Its channel comes very close to the shore at this spot, so it was a natural place to build wharves. Logs from the large watershed of the river could easily be floated to this point for milling and export. The best salmon fisheries were nearby. Other settlers followed, but growth was relatively slow throughout the early part of the 19th century. The first newspaper published in the North Shore of New Brunswick was the Mercury, founded in Chatham in 1825. By 1834 the first bank opened. A stage coach left each Monday for Fredericton. The settlement attracted a group of aggressive entrepreneurs, Scottish and English, such as Joseph Cunard, William Muirhead, Jabez Bunting Snowball, and later, W.S. Loggie. Gradually, the community became a centre for lumber mills, shipbuilding, and exporting fish and forest products to the British Isles and, later on, to the United States. Lord Beaverbrook In its early days, Chatham was bustling, energetic, growing and confident. Chatham attracted the Maritime lawyer Richard Bedford Bennett, later to be prime minister of Canada. In 1896 when Chatham held its first elections for Town Council, the young Bennett was elected by one vote. He was then employed with the law firm established by Lemuel Tweedie, a former Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. Bennett's campaign manager was a 17-year-old \\"articling\\" student by the name of Max Aitken. Aitken grew up in Newcastle and would later become Lord Beaverbrook. He was appointed the Minister for Aircraft Production in Winston Churchill's World War II cabinet. By 1851, Chatham had 505 employed persons among the following occupations: 170 labourers, 74 servants, 60 shipwrights, 25 joiners, 20 cordwainers, 19 farmers, 16 clerks, 13 blacksmiths, 12 merchants, 10 tailors, 9 storekeepers, 7 sawyers, 7 teachers, 5 blockmakers, 4 sailmakers, 4 riggers, 4 stage drivers, 4 butchers, 4 printers, 3 clergymen, 1 sparmaker, 1 gunsmith, 1 surgeon and 1 constable. A police force was started in 1858, telephones came to the town in 1880, and street lighting was installed in 1888. In 1881, somewhat past the prime of sailing ships, the port of Chatham recorded the following annual traffic: *177 overseas vessels entered- 80,558 tons exported; 11,344 imported: *302 coastal vessels entered‚Äî98,023 tons exported (value $797,179). In 1881, the value of bank deposits was $133,118. Chatham was incorporated as a town in 1896. A large wooden hotel, The Adams House operated from 1884 to the 1950s. The four-storey, brick Touraine Hotel was opened in 1908. It was destroyed by fire just after World War II. The hotel was on a branch line of the Canadian National Railways, which brought tourists from Quebec. ===Heyday=== Centennial (Miramichi) Bridge Chatham in its prime (1880‚Äì1919) had extensive wharves, a pulp mill, three large sawmills, a fish-packing plant, a large foundry/shipbuilding facility with a repair yard for small vessels, an armoury, several sizeable hotels; a Catholic hospital (Hotel Dieu) and associated nursing home as well as a Nursing School, all run by the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph; three secondary schools, a Catholic liberal arts college, the county poor house (the County Home), a race track, an indoor rink, a golf club, facilities for an agricultural exhibition, and several notable churches. The Anglican Church and Rectory were beautiful wood structures. The church burned down in 1960, but the rectory survived and remained in use until 1974. The town was a service and shopping centre for the surrounding area, especially the areas farther down the bay. Students boarded at the Catholic girls and boys schools, and the Catholic college in town. During the period, 1880 to 1960, the Catholic Church was a major employer in Chatham, being especially important after the mills began to close. The New Brunswick Electric Power Commission opened a thermal generation plant in Chatham in 1948. It produced 12,500 kilowatt hours and operated for some years, creating some employment. Until 1967 a ferry boat provided service across the Miramichi River at Chatham, except during the period of winter freeze up. When the Centennial Bridge was opened, the ferry was no longer needed. ==Catholic religious centre== St. Michael's BasilicaThe town is dominated by a large Roman Catholic church, St. Michael's Basilica. This neogothic structure was formerly a cathedral. Next to it, in the same style, is the former bishop's residence, now a convent. From 1860 to 1938 Chatham was the centre of a large Catholic diocese covering the northern part of New Brunswick. The Diocese of Chatham was moved to Bathurst, New Brunswick, in 1938. The Bishop at the time was Bishop Chaisson. The local lore has it that the move took place in the middle of the night so that the local residents would not know. Following the move of the See from Chatham to Bathurst, the Church was petitioned by local residents to be removed from the Diocese of Bathurst. They wanted to become part of the Diocese of Saint John, New Brunswick. A circle around the Parish of Chatham still designates it as part of the Diocese of Saint John, not Bathurst. A Catholic religious order, the Religious Hospitaliers of St. Joseph, established the Hotel Dieu and nursing home, as well as the large elementary/secondary school (St. Michael's Academy). While the nuns are still present as of 2005, their numbers have been much reduced. The Basilian Fathers operated a small liberal arts college, which was later taken over by the Diocese. It evolved into St. Thomas University, now located in Fredericton. The last convocation ceremony held in Chatham for St. Thomas University was in May 1964. ==Ethnic and religious composition== Historically, Chatham has been a majority-Catholic town, with smaller United Church, Anglican, and Presbyterian congregations. Various other Protestant denominations have come and gone, though the Pentecostals have been relatively strong. When it was more of a business centre, the town long had several Jewish families; their numbers have declined. Ethnic backgrounds are Irish, Scottish, English, and French, with the latter gaining somewhat in recent years. Catholic Lebanese immigrants settled here, originally calling themselves Assyrian. Several Norwegian families also immigrated. A few retired military have settled there adding to the mix. ==Slow decline== Chatham achieved peak prosperity during the years immediately prior to World War I, but even then its main export was people. During the war, many young men from Chatham joined the 132nd Battalion of the North Shore Regiment. Many were killed or wounded at Vimy Ridge and on the Somme. The postwar depression of 1919 hit the town, resulting in a major employer, the Snowball sawmill, closing permanently. Young men and women moved to New England to seek work where many had relatives. World War II saw the opening of RCAF Station Chatham, providing an economic stimulus for the town until its closure in 1996. RCAF Station Chatham was established as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. After the war, many different aircraft were deployed at Chatham. RCAF Station Chatham was the site where the Golden Hawks Aerobatic Team was formed before it was moved. The Golden Hawks were a precursor to the current 431 Air Demonstration Squadron, or \\"Snowbirds\\". Golden Hawks, 1959 The primary purpose of the base was to train navigators for flight crews serving in the European Theatre. During the 1960s and 1970s, the base, renamed CFB Chatham in 1968, was an important staging ground for CF-101 Voodoo fighter interceptors, which were under command of NORAD to interdict Soviet nuclear bombers that could have challenged Canadian airspace in Atlantic Canada. The Soviet bombers (predominately the \\"Bear\\") flew the circumpolar route from the Soviet Union to Cuba and enjoyed entering Canadian Airspace over Newfoundland to time the reaction of NORAD. Chatham sent many sons to Europe during World War II as part of the North Shore Regiment. The North Shore Regiment joined the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and the North Nova Scotia Highlanders as the first wave of Canadian Troops to land during the invasion of Normandy. They landed at Juno Beach as part of Operation Overlord. Following the war, the North Shore Regiment was folded into the Royal New Brunswick Regiment (RNBR). The postwar baby boom of the 1950s enabled the town to reach a peak population of 8,600 in 1961. The loss of St. Thomas University, which moved to Fredericton in 1964 adversely affected the town in combination with other changes. The closure of CFB Chatham in 1996 further reduced local employment. The nursing school run by the Religious Hospitaliers of St. Joseph closed soon after the move of St. Thomas University. The loss of these two educational institutions was both symbolic and contributed to Chatham's decline. Over the years migrants from Chatham have moved to where the jobs were. In the mid to late nineteenth century, some left for lumbering opportunities in the United States in areas such as Maine, Wisconsin and Washington. Until the 1930s, the majority went to Boston as a center of business and industry. Few left during the Hungry Thirties. Right after World War II, Montreal seemed to offer opportunities. It was superseded as an attraction by growth in Toronto and other parts of Ontario. Fredericton and Moncton were also work destinations from the 1950s onwards, with Halifax becoming more important after 1965. In recent years, Alberta has attracted more Chatham residents. In 1996, the provincial government imposed an amalgamation of all incorporated municipalities in the lower Miramichi River valley, creating the city of Miramichi. Longtime residents regret the loss of the town's historic name and separate identity. In 1998, the federal government opened a central processing site for the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP) in Chatham. The office is dedicated to implementing the Firearms Act, and will maintain the records of all registered firearms in the country. The office employs several hundred civil servants and has helped to offset employment losses from the base closure. CFP celebrated the 10th anniversary of the opening of Central Processing Site in Miramichi, New Brunswick in 2008.10th anniversary of the Canadian Firearms Program's Central Processing Site, Miramichi, N.B. Today, Chatham is known for its annual Irish Festival. It also has become something of a retirement community, offering good quality, affordable housing. The married quarters of the former military base have been converted to a retirement village, called RMI, or \\"Retirement Miramichi\\" they offer low rental rates, and have 276 units.

Cowles, an 1870s-80s rancher and early businessperson in southwestern San Diego County. ===San Diego State University=== For many years Cowles Mountain was locally known as \\"S\\" Mountain. In 1931, 500 students from San Diego State College, now San Diego State University (SDSU), painted a letter \\"S\\" on the side of the mountain, after which it took on its popular name.

Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the Fleet Acts of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the Royal Navy). It included seventeen modern dreadnoughts, five battlecruisers, twenty-five cruisers and twenty pre- dreadnought battleships as well as over forty submarines. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French. Jonathan Steinberg, \\"The Tirpitz Plan.\\" Historical Journal 16.1 (1973): 196-204. online Tirpitz developed a \\"Risk Theory\\" whereby, if the German Imperial Navy reached a certain level of strength relative to the British Royal Navy, the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a fleet in being). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the British Empire, Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire as the cost of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain in the first decade of the 20th century. This theory was based on the assumption that Great Britain would have to send its fleet into the German Bight for a close blockade of the ports (blockading Germany was the only way that the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany's geographic location, Great Britain could employ a distant blockade by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the English Channel and the area between Bergen and the Shetland Islands. Faced with this option a German Admiral commented, \\"If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one,\\" correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the First World War. Politically and strategically, Tirpitz's Risk Theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to Home Waters. The first evidence of this is seen in the Anglo- Japanese treaty of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian navy in the war of 1904‚Äì06, removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its d√©tente and Entente Cordiale with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at 'risk' from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz 'risk theory' made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany's foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet. == See also == *Anglo-German naval arms race *Battle of Jutland == References == == Further reading == * * * Epkenhans, Michael.

He is best known for his appearances on The Goon Show from 1951 to 1960. The Ray Ellington Quartet had a regular musical segment on the show, and Ellington also had a small speaking role in many episodes, often as a parodic African, Native American or Arab chieftain (but also often, with no attempt to change his normal accent, as a female secretary or a Scotsman). ==Early life== Ellington was born Henry Pitts Brown, at 155 Kennington Road, Kennington, London, England, the youngest of four children. His father was Harry Pitts Brown (c.1877‚Äì1920), an African-American music-hall comedian and entertainer, his mother was Eva Stenkell Rosenthal (b. c.1879), a Russian Jew. His father died when Brown was four years old. Ellington was brought up as a strictly Orthodox Jew and attended the South London Jewish School (1924‚Äì30), before entering show business at the age of twelve, when he appeared in an acting role on the London stage. ==Life and career== Ellington's first break came in 1937 when he joined Harry Roy and His Orchestra as the band's drummer, replacing Joe Daniels. His vocal talents were put to good use too, from the time of his first session when he recorded \\"Swing for Sale.\\" Ellington was called up in May 1940 when he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a physical training instructor where he served throughout the war. He played in various service bands including RAF Blue Eagles (1945). After demobilisation, Ellington resumed his career, fronting his own group, playing at The Bag O'Nails club. Early in 1947, he rejoined the Harry Roy band for a few months. The Ray Ellington Quartet was formed in the same year. Ellington specialised in jazz but experimented with many other genres throughout the show's history and his musical style was heavily influenced by the comedic jump blues of Louis Jordan. Ellington's band was one of the first in the UK to feature the stripped-back guitar/bass/drums/piano format that became the basis of rock and roll, as well as being one of the first groups in Britain to prominently feature the electric guitar. They were also reputedly the first jazz band in the UK to use an amplified guitar, which was produced and introduced by their guitar player, Lauderic Caton. The other members of Ellington's quartet were Dick Katz (piano) and Coleridge Goode (bass). When guitarist Caton moved on he was succeeded in turn by Laurie Deniz, Australian Don Fraser and Judd Proctor, who was a member of the quartet for six years from July 1955. Early in the Goon Show's run, there were many jokes linking Ellington to the African nation of Ghana, thus leading Ellington to say that he came from Ghana. Ellington's recording of \\"The Madison\\" reached No. 36 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1962. He was married to Anita West, who was to become the second female presenter of Blue Peter when she replaced Leila Williams, but she only lasted a few months in this role. They had two young children (Lance and Nina) when the marriage ended in divorce, due to Ellington's constant touring. Ray's son Lance Ellington is a singer who has recorded several jazz-orientated albums, and is one of the backing singers in the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing. Lance Ellington also appeared in tributes to Peter Sellers, in the film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, where he played his father, and took his father's part in the Goon Show '50th Anniversary Cardboard Replica' first broadcast on 12 April 2001, the day after Harry Secombe died.

Its transliteration is z, understood as a phoneme of the Proto-Germanic language, the terminal *z continuing Proto-Indo- European terminal *s. It is one of two runes which express a phoneme that does not occur word-initially, and thus could not be named acrophonically, the other being the ≈ã-rune Ingwaz . As the terminal *-z phoneme marks the nominative singular suffix of masculine nouns, the rune occurs comparatively frequently in early epigraphy. Because this specific phoneme was lost at an early time, the Elder Futhark rune underwent changes in the medieval runic alphabets. In the Anglo-Saxon futhorc it retained its shape, but it was given the sound value of Latin x. This is a secondary development, possibly due to runic manuscript tradition, and there is no known instance of the rune being used in an Old English inscription. In Proto-Norse and Old Norse, the Germanic *z phoneme developed into an R sound, perhaps realized as a retroflex approximant , which is usually transcribed as  Ä. This sound was written in the Younger Futhark using the Yr rune , the Algiz rune turned upside down, from about the 7th century. This phoneme eventually became indistinguishable from the regular r sound in the later stages of Old Norse, at about the 11th or 12th century. The shape of the rune may be derived from that a letter expressing /x/ in certain Old Italic alphabets (), which was in turn derived from the Greek letter Œ® which had the value of /k ∞/ (rather than /ps/) in the Western Greek alphabet. ==Name== The Elder Futhark rune is conventionally called Algiz or Elhaz, from the Common Germanic word for \\"elk\\". There is wide agreement that this is most likely not the historical name of the rune, but in the absence of any positive evidence of what the historical name may have been, the conventional name is simply based on a reading of the rune name in the Anglo-Saxon rune poem, first suggested by Wilhelm Grimm (√úber deutsche Runen, 1821), as eolh or eolug \\"elk\\". Like the ng-rune, the z-rune is a special case inasmuch as it could not have been named acrophonically, since the sound it represents did not occur in word-initial position. Choosing a name that terminates in -z would have been more or less arbitrary, as this was the nominative singular suffix of almost every masculine noun of the language. Since the name eolh, or more accurately eolh-secg \\"elk-sedge\\" in the Anglo- Saxon rune poem represents not the rune's original sound value, but rather the sound of Latin x (/ks/), it becomes highly arbitrary to suggest that the original rune should have been named after the elk. There are a number of speculative suggestions surrounding the history of the rune's name. The difficulty lies in the circumstance that the Younger Futhark rune did not inherit this name at all, but acquired the name of the obsolete Eihwaz rune, as yr. The only independent evidence of the Elder Futhark rune's name would be the name of the corresponding Gothic letter, ezec. The Gothic letter was an adoption of Greek Zeta, and while it did express the /z/ phoneme, this Gothic sound only rarely occurred terminally. Instead, it is found mostly in positions where West and North Germanic have r, e.g. Gothic m√°iza \\"greater\\" (Old Norse meira, English more). The name of the Anglo-Saxon rune is variously recorded as eolx, eolhx, ilcs, ilx, iolx, ilix, elux.Alan Griffiths, 'Rune- names: the Irish connexion' in: Stoklund et al. (eds.), Runes and their secrets: studies in runology, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2006, pp. 93-101. Manuscript tradition gives its sound value as Latin x, i.e. /ks/, or alternatively as il, or yet again as \\"l and x\\". The reading of this opaque name as eolh \\"elk\\" is entirely due to the reading of the Anglo-Saxon rune poem's secg as eolh-secg (eolx-secg, eolug-secg, eolxecg) \\"elk-sedge\\", apparently the name of a species of sedge (Carex). This reading of the poem is due to Wilhelm Grimm (1821), and remains standard. The suggestion is that this compound is realized as eolk-secg, thus containing the Latin x (/ks/) sound sequence. The manuscript testimony that the rune is to be read as il would then be simply a mistaken assumption that its name must be acrophonic. The name of the corresponding Gothic letter ezec, however, suggests that the old name of this rune was not just eolx, but the full eolh-secg. This is puzzling, because the sound value of the rune was clearly not /ks/ in the Elder Futhark period (2nd to 4th centuries). Furthermore, the name of the sedge in question is recorded in the older Epinal-Erfurt glossary as ilugsegg (glossing papiluus, probably for papyrus), which cannot be derived from the word for elk.Bruce Dickins, Runic and Heroic Poems of the Old Teutonic Peoples, Cambridge, 1915, p. 17, note 41. A suggestion by Warren and Elliott takes the Old English eolh at face value, and reconstructs a Common Germanic form of either *algiz or *alhiz. They cite a \\"more fanciful school\\" which assumes an original meaning of \\"elk\\" based on a theonym Alcis recorded by Tacitus (suggesting that the name would have been theophoric in origin, referring to an \\"elk-god\\"). The authors dismiss the Old English \\"elk-sedge\\" as a late attempt to give the then-obsolete rune a value of Latin x. Instead, they suggest that the original name of the rune could have been Common Germanic *algiz ('Algie'), meaning not \\"elk\\" but \\"protection, defence\\".Ralph Warren, Victor Elliott, Runes: an introduction, Manchester University Press ND, 1980, 51-53. Redbond (1936) suggested that the eolhx (etc.) may have been a corruption of helix. Seebold (1991) took this up to suggest that the name of the rune may be connected to the use of elux for helix by Notker to describe the constellation of Ursa major (as turning around the celestial pole). An earlier suggestion is that of Zacher (1855), to the effect that the earliest value of this rune was the labiovelar /hw/, and that its name may have been hweol \\"wheel\\".Julius Zacher, \\"Die rune eolh\\" in: Das gothische Alphabet Vulfilas und das Runenalphabet, Brockhaus, 1855, 72-120. ==Elder Futhark== The varying forms of the rune in the Elder futhark during the centuries. In the Elder Futhark, Algiz represents the Germanic phoneme *z, which does not occur word-initially. It is attested in that position in the earliest inscriptions, e.g. in ansuz (Vimose buckle), √æewaz (Thorsberg chape). It was presumably present in the Ovre Stabu spearhead inscription (ca. AD 180), reading raunija[z], but is hardly legible now. The Nydam axe-handle (4th century) has the name wagagastiz. The Golden Horns of Gallehus (early 5th century) had the personal name hlewagastiz holtijaz. In the earliest inscriptions, the rune invariably has its standard Œ®-shape. From the 5th century or so, the rune appears optionally in its upside-down variant which would become the standard Younger Futhark yr shape. There are also other graphical variants; for example, the Charnay Fibula has a superposition of these two variants, resulting in an \\"asterisk\\" shape (). ==Anglo-Saxon futhorc== The name of the Anglo-Saxon rune is variously recorded as eolx, ilcs, ilix, elux, eolhx. Manuscript tradition gives its sound value as Latin x, i.e. /ks/, or alternatively as il, or yet again as \\"l and x\\". The relevant stanza of the Anglo-Saxon rune poem reads:Dickins, Bruce, Runic and heroic poems of the old Teutonic peoples (1915), p. 16. : sec[g e]ard h√¶f√æ oftust on fenne :∆øexe√∞ on ∆øature, ∆øunda√æ grimme :blode brene√∞ beorna geh∆øylcne :√∞e him √¶nigne onfeng gede√æ. Reading the rune as eolhx (as discussed above), and with the emendation of seccard to secg eard due to Grimm (1821), the stanza becomes about a species of sedge (Cladium mariscus) called \\"elk-sedge\\". In the translation of Page (1999):Page (1999:71). :The Elk-sedge usually lives in the fen, :growing in the water. It wounds severely, :staining with blood any man :who makes a grab at it. The 9th-century abecedarium anguliscum in Codex Sangallensis 878 shows eolh as a peculiar shape, as it were a bindrune of the older with the Younger Futhark , resulting in an \\"asterisk\\" shape similar to ior . The only known instance where the rune does take the sound value of Latin x in epigraphy is the spelling of rex \\"king\\" on the interlace coin dies of king Beonna (mid 8th century). Furthermore, it appears in the inscription on St Cuthbert's coffin (late 7th century) in the abbreviation of the name Christ, where Greek ŒßŒ°œπ is taken as Latin xps and rendered as runic . ==Younger Futhark== In the 6th and 7th centuries, the Elder Futhark began to be replaced by the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia. By the 8th century, the Elder Futhark was extinct, and Scandinavian runic inscriptions were exclusively written in Younger Futhark. The Yr rune is a rune of the Younger Futhark. Its common transliteration is a small capital  Ä. The shape of the Yr rune in the Younger Futhark is the inverted shape of the Elder Futhark rune (). Its name yr (\\"yew\\") is taken from the name of the Elder Futhark Eihwaz rune. Its phonological value is the continuation of the phoneme represented by Algiz, the word-final *-z in Proto Germanic, In Proto-Norse pronounced closer to , perhaps . Within later Old Norse, the Proto-Norse phoneme collapses with by the 12th century. Unicode has \\"Latin Small Capital Letter R\\" at code point U+0280  Ä (IPA‚Äôs symbol for the uvular trill). A corresponding capital letter is at U+01A6 ∆¶, called \\"Latin Letter Yr\\". The rune itself is encoded at U+16E6 \\"Long Branch Yr\\". Variants are \\"Short Twig Yr\\" at U+16E7 and \\"Icelandic Yr\\" at U+16E8 .Unicode Character 'LATIN LETTER YR' (U+01A6) at Fileformat.info. Unicode Character 'LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL R' (U+0280) The Anglo-Saxon calc rune ·õ£ has the same shape as Younger Futhark yr, but is unrelated in origin (being a modification or \\"doubling\\" of cen ·ö≥). Independently, the shape of the Elder Futhark Algiz rune reappears in the Younger Futhark Ma√∞r rune , continuing the Elder Futhark rune *Mannaz. ==Modern usage== ===\\"Life rune\\" and \\"Death rune\\"=== Nazi-era pharmacy logo with the white \\"life rune\\".The logo was introduced by the Deutsche Apothekerschaft (pharmacists' association) in 1936 on the request of chief pharmacist Albert Schmierer (1899‚Äì1974). The symbol was also used in the official emblems of the physicians' and dentists' associations. Elisabeth Huwer, Zur Geschichte des Apothekenwahrzeichens (deutsches-apotheken-museum.de). Prisoner registry card from Mauthausen-Gusen Nazi Concentration Camp with ‚Äúdeath rune‚Äù used to indicate the prisoner‚Äôs date of death (·õ¶ 13.X.42) Contemporary (1999) use of the \\"life rune\\"/\\"death rune\\" notation in a grave marker in Niederaula, Germany. Such usage of the \\"Totenrune\\" saw a resurgence during the Nazi era.https://www.vikingrune.com/2009/07/norse-runic-third-reich-symbols/ The Man and Yr runes in Guido von List's Armanen Futharkh were based on the Younger Futhark. List's runes were later adopted and modified by Karl Maria Wiligut who was responsible for their adoptions in Nazi occultism. Both List and Wiligut have an \\"Yr\\" rune of the same shape as the Younger Futhark Yr rune. In this context, the Man rune (identical in shape to the Elder Futhark Algiz) came to be understood in the Germanic mysticism of the early 20th century as symbolizing \\"life\\" and called the \\"life rune\\" (). This term occurs as early as the 1920s in the literature of Germanic mysticism,Hermann Schwarz, Gott jenseits von theismus und pantheismus, Junker und D√ºnnhaupt, 1928. and it came to be widely used within the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany, e.g. in official prescriptions for the various uniforms of the '.Robert Ley, Organisationsbuch der NSDAP (1943). The Yr rune came to be seen as the \\"life rune\\" inverted and interpreted as \\"death rune\\" (') During the World War II era, these two runes ( for \\"born\\", for \\"died\\") came to be used in obituaries and on tomb stones as marking birth and death dates, replacing asterisk and cross symbols (* for \\"born\\", ‚úù for \\"died\\") conventionally used in this context in Germany. It has always been clear that this association is an innovation of modern esotericism, without direct precedent in the medieval usage of the Younger Futhark alphabet. This fact was pointed out in an article in the German journal Stimmen der Zeit as early as in 1940.Stimmen der Zeit, vol. 137, Abtei Maria Laach, Herder, 1940 After 1945, the term \\"life rune\\" continued to be used as v√∂lkisch nationalism. Contemporary examples include use by the American National Alliance (as of 2007),From the official National Alliance website: \\"The Life Rune signifies life, creation, birth, rebirth, and renewal. It expresses in a single symbol the raison d‚Äôetre of the National Alliance and of the movement of Aryan renewal.\\" \\"The Life Rune: an ancient symbol used by the National Alliance\\" (natall.com). and in reference to the Algiz rune in the logo of the Flemish nationalist as levensrune (as of 2016).Ons symbool, de Algiz rune (voorpost.org) The term \\"death rune\\" has been used in the context of esotericist or occultist aesthetics associated with black metal, in the name of Deathrune Records (as of 2011), formerly Records, a minor black metal record label.Die Todesrune Records, Encyclopaedia Metallum (2011). ===Pop culture=== Following Ralph Blum (1982), the Algiz rune is given a sense of \\"protection\\" in some modern systems of runic divination.e.g. \\"Protection, a shield. The protective urge to shelter oneself or others. Defense, warding off of evil, shield, guardian\\" Meanings of the Runes (sunnyway.com). \\"It is a powerful rune of protection and, spiritually, it symbolizes reaching up to the divine.\\" ALGIZ - The Rune of Protection and Opportunity (runemaker.com). \\"protection, assistance, defense, warning, support, a mentor, an ethical dilemma\\" The Meanings of the Runes (runestones.com). Blum (1982) himself glosses for Algiz with \\"Protection; Sedge or Rushes; An Elk\\".Blum (1982), pp. 86f. \\"The protection of the Warrior is like the curved horns of the elk, or like the sedge grass, for both serve to keep open space around you.\\" Blum's gloss \\"protection\\" is apparently inspired by the \\"more fanciful school\\" deriving the rune's name from Alcis cited by Warren and Elliot (1980, discussed above) ==See also== *Elder Futhark *Younger Futhark ==Notes== ==References== * Dobbie, Elliott Van Kirk (1942).

Self-pity is pity directed towards oneself. Two different kinds of pity can be distinguished, \\"benevolent pity\\" and \\"contemptuous pity\\" (see Kimball), where, through insincere, pejorative usage, pity is used to connote feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.Stuff Pity! ==Psychological origins== Psychologists see pity arising in early childhood out of the infant's ability to identify with others.D Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1995) p. 98-9 Psychoanalysis sees a more convoluted route to (at least some forms of) adult pity by way of the sublimation of aggression ‚Äì pity serving as a kind of magic gesture intended to show how leniently one should oneself be treated by one's own conscience.O Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 476 Alexander sees with a look of pity that Darius has died from his wounds.

This version is copy L created in 1795 and currently held by the Yale Center for British Art. ==Religious views== *In the West, the religious concept of pity was reinforced after acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God pitying all humanity, as found initially in the Jewish tradition: ‚ÄúLike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him‚Äù.King James Version, ‚Äò‚ÄôHoly Bible‚Äô‚Äô (USA 1979) p. 780 (Psalm 103:13) The Hebrew word \\"Hesed\\" translated in the LXX by \\"Eleos\\" carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy and loving-kindness. (See The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 698a.) *In Mahayana Buddhism, Bodhisattvas are described by the Lotus Sutra as those who ‚Äúhope to win final Nirvana for all beings ‚Äì for the sake of the many, for their weal and happiness, out of pity for the world‚Äù.E Conze ed., Buddhist Scriptures (Penguin 1959) p. 209 ==Philosophical assessments== *Aristotle in his Rhetoric argued (Rhetoric 2.8) that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer. He defines pity as follows: \\"Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one's own, to suffer, and this when it seems near\\". Aristotle also pointed out that \\"people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves\\", arguing further that in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate. Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear.Aristotle. Poetics, section 6.1449b24-28. *David Hume in his Treatise of Human Nature (Sect. VII Of Compassion), argued that \\"pity is concern for ... the misery of others without any friendship...to occasion this concern.\\" He continues that pity \\"is derived from the imagination.\\" When one observes a person in misfortune, the observer initially imagines his sorrow, even though they may not feel the same. While \\"we blush for the conduct of those, who behave themselves foolishly before us; and that though they show no sense of shame, nor seem in the least conscious of their folly,\\" Hume argues \\"that he is the more worthy of compassion the less sensible he is of his miserable condition.\\" *Jean- Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: \\"It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pity which hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see in distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands for laws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one is tempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity which will always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, or infirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain and difficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himself by any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublime maxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have others do to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness a great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. \\" *Nietzsche pointed out that since all people to some degree value self-esteem and self-worth, pity can negatively affect any situation. Nietzsche considered his own sensitivity to pity a lifelong weakness;W Kaufmann ed., The Portable Nietzsche (London 1987) p. 440 and condemned what he called ‚ÄúSchopenhauer‚Äôs morality of pity...pity negates life‚Äù.W Kaufmann ed., The Portable Nietzsche (London 1987) p. 540 and p. 573 ==Literary examples== *Juvenal considered pity the noblest aspect of human nature.J D Duff ed., Fourteen Satires of Juvenal (Cambridge 1925) p. 450 *Mystic poet William Blake was ambivalent about Pity, initially casting it in a negative role, before viewing Pity as an emotion that can draw beings together. In The Book of Urizen Pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains (Urizen 13.50‚Äì51). However, Pity furthers the fall, \\"For pity divides the soul\\" (13.53), dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Blake maintained that Pity disarmed righteous indignation leading to action; and, railing further against Pity in The Human Abstract, Blake exclaims: \\"Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor\\" (1‚Äì2). *J.

The Series was a rematch of the 1955 World Series. It was the last all-New York City Series until 44 years later in 2000, as the Dodgers and the New York Giants moved to California after the 1957 season. Additionally, it was the last time a New York team represented the National League until 1969 when the New York Mets defeated the Baltimore Orioles in five games. The Yankees won the Series in seven games, capturing their seventeenth championship. Brooklyn won Games 1 and 2, but New York pitchers threw five consecutive complete games (Games 3‚Äì7) to cap off the comeback. The highlight was Don Larsen's perfect game in Game 5. Larsen was named the Series MVP for his achievement. The Dodgers scored 19 runs in the first two games, but only six in the remaining five games, with just one in the final three games. This was the last World Series to date not to have scheduled off days (although Game 2 was postponed a day due to rain). As of March 2020, four original television broadcasts from this Series (Game 2 partial, Games 3 and 5, Game 7 partial) had been released on DVD.http://www.raresportsfilms.com/1956-world-series.html ==Summary== ‚Ä†: postponed from October 4 due to rain ==Matchups== ===Game 1=== Gil Hodges Three batters into the game, the Yankees led 2‚Äì0 on a Mickey Mantle home run. Brooklyn struck back with a Jackie Robinson homer in the second inning and a three-run Gil Hodges shot in the third, then won behind Sal Maglie's complete game. ===Game 2=== Duke Snider Neither starting pitcher survived the second inning, Don Newcombe giving up a Yogi Berra grand slam, and Don Larsen giving up four unearned runs. Little-known pitcher Don Bessent worked the final seven innings for the win. Game 2 set a number of peculiar records in World Series history, which are either matched or comparable with similar World Series records and performances, in limited instances: *Game 2 is the first of only two World Series games in history in which a grand slam-hitting team failed to win the game. While the Yankees won the series, the 1988 Oakland Athletics would produce a grand slam in Game 1, lose that game, and furthermore lose that series. *The number of Yankee runs put up in the game, eight, is the largest number of runs accumulated in a World Series game, by a team which lost the game, yet went on to win the series. This record is shared in common only with Game 3 of 1947, also a Yankee/Dodgers series. *The combined run count of both teams in the game, 21, is the largest such combined run count between two teams in any one World Series game, such that the losing team won the series. The complementary record, the largest combined game run count with the game winning team being the series winning team, and the game losing team being the series losing team (and highest combined team run count ever in a World Series game) was set in Game 4 in 1993. ===Game 3=== Enos Slaughter Whitey Ford pitched a complete game, scattering eight hits, and got the support he needed from an Enos Slaughter three-run homer in the sixth that gave the Yankees a 4‚Äì2 lead; they never trailed in the game afterwards. ===Game 4=== Hank Bauer Hank Bauer's two-run homer in the seventh off Don Drysdale, pitching in relief, put the game away for the Yankees, who got a complete-game six-hitter from Tom Sturdivant. Mantle hit a home run off Ed Roebuck in the previous inning. ===Game 5=== Don Larsen's perfect game In Game 5, Don Larsen, dislaying an unusual \\"no-windup\\" style and \\"working the curveball beautifully\\",Comment made by Bob Neal, Game broadcast, Mutual Broadcasting System pitched the only postseason perfect game, and the only postseason no-hitter until 2010. While striking out seven Dodgers, Larsen had only one at-bat reach a three-ball count (against Pee Wee Reese, in the first inning). Of several close moments, the best remembered is Gil Hodges' fifth- inning line drive toward Yankee Stadium's famed \\"Death Valley\\" in left-center, snared by center fielder Mickey Mantle with a spectacular running catch. In addition to that, Yankees fielders had to record three more lineouts, and shortstop Gil McDougald had to make a play on a ball that caromed off third baseman Andy Carey‚Äôs glove. Brooklyn's Sal Maglie gave up only two runs on five hits and was perfect himself until a fourth-inning home run by Mantle broke the scoreless tie. The Yankees added an insurance run in the sixth as Hank Bauer's single scored Carey, who had opened the inning with a single and was sacrificed to second by Larsen. The final out of the game came on a called third strike against Dale Mitchell and generated one of the most iconic images in sports history, when catcher Yogi Berra leaped into Larsen's arms. A reporter asked Yankees manager Casey Stengel if this was the best game Larsen had ever pitched. Stengel diplomatically answered, \\"So far!\\" For Larsen, this was an especially satisfying performance, as he had acquired perhaps a better reputation as a night owl than as a pitcher. Stengel once said of Larsen, \\"The only thing he fears is sleep!\\" Larsen's perfect game was also the last game that umpire Babe Pinelli called behind the plate. Sports cartoonist Willard Mullin drew an illustration of a happy Larsen painting a canvas titled The Perfect Game, observed by Mullin's classic \\"Brooklyn Bum.\\" Referencing the old saw \\"I don't know much about art, but I know what I like\\", the disgusted- looking Bum came up with a variation: \\"I don't care if it is art‚ÄîI don't like it!\\" Brooklyn starter Sal Maglie appeared on the game show What's My Line? the night before the game, with former Yankee Phil Rizzuto as one of the panel members. ===Game 6=== Jackie Robinson In a 10-inning scoreless pitching duel with both starters going all the way, Jackie Robinson's walk-off single to left in the bottom of the 10th won the game for Clem Labine and kept the Dodgers' championship hopes alive. Tough-luck loser Bob Turley gave up a 10th- inning walk to Jim Gilliam, a sacrifice bunt by Pee Wee Reese and intentional pass to Duke Snider before the decisive hit. Game 6 is one of only three games in World Series history to be scoreless through nine innings, the others being Game 2 in 1913 and Game 7 in 1991. ===Game 7=== Yogi Berra Yogi Berra's two homers led New York to an unexpectedly easy 9‚Äì0 title-clinching victory. Yankee pitcher Johnny Kucks struck out Jackie Robinson to end the Series. It would be Robinson's final at-bat, as he retired at the season's end. After belting the Yankee pitching staff for 19 runs and 21 hits in the first two games, the Dodger bats went silent in the next five games, scoring only six runs on 21 hits, batting only .142 (21‚Äìfor‚Äì148). New York outscored Brooklyn 22‚Äì6 in Games 3‚Äì7, the Yankees winning their 17th World Series. ==Composite line score== 1956 World Series (4‚Äì3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.) ==Broadcasting== NBC televised the Series, with announcers Mel Allen (for the Yankees) and Vin Scully (for the Dodgers). In 2006, it was announced that a nearly-complete kinescope recording of the Game 5 telecast (featuring Larsen's perfect game) had been preserved and discovered by a collector. That kinescope recording aired during the MLB Network's first night on the air on January 1, 2009, supplemented with an interview of both Larsen and Yogi Berra by Bob Costas. The first inning of the telecast is still considered lost and was not aired by the MLB Network or included in a subsequent DVD release of the game. The Mutual network aired the Series on radio, with Bob Wolff and Bob Neal announcing. This was the final World Series broadcast for Mutual, which had covered the event since 1935; NBC's radio network would gain exclusive national rights to baseball the following season. ==Notes== ==See also== *1956 Japan Series ==References== ==External links== * Kodak Presents ‚Äì Baseball's 25 Greatest Moments: Don Larson's Perfect Game * The Deadball Era Audio ‚Äì Jackie Robinson drives in the winning run in Game 6 * The Deadball Era Audio ‚Äì Final Out of Don Larson's Perfect Game Category:World Series World Series Category:New York Yankees postseason Category:Brooklyn Dodgers postseason Category:Jackie Robinson World Series Category:Sports competitions in New York City World Series ","title":"1956 World Series"},{"id":"1272341","text":"Jovo Stanisavljeviƒá ƒåaruga Jovan \\"Jovo\\" Stanisavljeviƒá (; 1897‚Äì27 February 1925), known by his nickname ƒåaruga (–ß–∞—Ä—É–≥–∞), was an outlaw (hajduk) in Slavonia in the early 20th century. ==Biography== Stanisavljeviƒá was born in 1897, into a Serb Orthodox family in the village of Slavonske Bare (part of Zdenci) in the Virovitica County, autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austro-Hungary. He was named after his paternal grandfather Jovan, who went by the family nickname of ƒåaruga (\\"troublemaker\\"). His father Prokopija was a peasant, and his mother Ika died when he was ten. His father remarried, and he had a tough upbringing, later running away from home to Osijek, where he went to a locksmith school. When World War I broke out, he stopped his studies and enrolled in the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, he posed as an officer and deserted the front lines. Shortly afterwards, he killed a man who was courting his girlfriend, and after a local nobleman threatened to arrest him, he killed him too. He was eventually apprehended, tried, and convicted, and started serving his sentence in the Sremska Mitrovica penitentiary. He managed to escape from prison and had a warrant for his capture, returning home where he was unwelcomed. ƒåaruga left for the woods, where he befriended a gang, Kolo gorskih tiƒáa (\\"Band of Mountain Birds\\"), composed mostly of deserters, who all detested the rich Slavonian peasants and robbed them mercilessly, and were not afraid of killing people. He used the false names Nikola Drezgiƒá and Mile Bariƒá. The war was long over, but ƒåaruga and the gang were still pillaging the countryside, and became hunted by the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Eventually in 1922 he decided to leave for Zagreb, where he posed as a rich gentleman from Vinkovci and also continued his life of thievery. He would later return to Slavonia to continue stealing together with his group members. On 14 October 1923, however, they attempted to rob the Eltz family estate in Ivankovo near Vinkovci. They killed a man on site, while another snuck out and called the gendarmerie. After the skirmish that ensued they managed to escape but without their loot. More importantly, the police got on their trail and soon captured them. By February 1925, ƒåaruga's trial at the court in Osijek was finished, and he was subsequently hanged in front of a crowd of 3,000. ƒåaruga's demise attracted a lot of popular attention at the time, and numerous popular books.

Bc4 White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing his d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim \\"develop knights before bishops\\", White leaves his f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2‚Äìf4. The f2‚Äìf4 gives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening can transpose into either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into Giuoco Piano and Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns the Bishop's Opening the codes C23 and C24. ==History and use== The Bishop's Opening is one of the oldest openings to be analyzed; it was studied by Lucena and Ruy Lopez. Later it was played by Philidor. Larsen was one of the few grandmasters to play it often, after first using it at the 1964 Interzonal tournament. Although the Bishop's Opening is uncommon today, it has been used occasionally as a surprise by players such as Kasparov. Nunn uses it to avoid Petrov's Defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6), and L√©k√≥ played it in the 2007 World Championship against Kramnik, known to consistently play the Petrov. Weaver Adams in his classic work White to Play and Win claimed that the Bishop's Opening was a win for White by from the second move. He was unable to prove this by defeating players stronger than himself, however, and later abandoned the Bishop's Opening for the Vienna Game, making the same claim. Grandmaster Nick de Firmian, in the 14th edition of Modern Chess Openings, concludes that the Bishop's Opening leads to with best play by both sides, and notes that, \\"Among modern players only Bent Larsen has played it much, but even Kasparov gave it a whirl (winning against Bareev).\\"Id. at 143. ==Main variations== Because White's second move makes no direct threat, Black has many possible second-move responses. As shown below, the Bishop's Opening offers opportunities to transpose to several other Open Games. ===Berlin Defense: 2...Nf6 === Probably Black's most popular second move is 2...Nf6, forcing White to decide how to defend the e-pawn. { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\"   } After 3.d3 Black must be careful not to drift into an inferior variation of the King's Gambit Declined. One continuation that avoids this pitfall is 3...c6 4.Nf3 d5 5.Bb3 Bd6. White sometimes chooses the Bishop's Opening move order to transpose into the Giuoco Piano while preventing Black from playing Petrov's Defense. For example, 2...Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 reaches the quiet Giuoco Pianissimo. The Urusov Gambit is named after Russian Prince Sergey Semyonovich Urusov (1827‚Äì1897). After 2...Nf6 3.d4 exd4 (3...Nxe4 4.dxe5 gives White some advantage) 4.Nf3, Black can transpose to the Two Knights Defense with 4...Nc6, or can decline the gambit with 4...d5 5.exd5 Bb4+ 6.c3 (6.Kf1 is recommended by Michael Goeller, winning a pawn at the expense of castling rights) 6...Qe7+ 7.Be2 dxc3, when 8.bxc3 and 8.Nxc3 both offer approximately equal chances. Instead, Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxe4 5.Qxd4 Nf6 (5...Nd6 6.0-0 gives White an overwhelming attack), and White will continue with Nc3, Bg5, Qh4, 0-0-0, and usually intends to meet ...0-0 and ...h6 with the piece sacrifice Bxh6, exposing the black king. Black has a solid position with no clear weaknesses, but White has attacking chances and piece activity as compensation for the pawn. The Urusov Gambit is also occasionally reached via the Petrov Defence after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4. The Boden‚ÄìKieseritzky Gambit is named after English player and chess writer Samuel Boden and Lionel Kieseritzky. Boden published the first analysis of it in 1851. Opening theoreticians consider that after 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxe4 4.Nc3 Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, White's attack is not quite worth a pawn. The game may continue 6.0-0 Nc6 (not 6...Be7? 7.Nxe5! with a tremendous attack, but 6...d6 is also ) 7.Nh4 g6 8.f4 f5 9.Nf3 (9.Nxf5? d5!) e4 10.Ng5 (10.Ne5 Qe7! threatening Qc5+ is strong) Bc5+. In practice, Black's lack of and inability to castle can prove very problematic. Safer for Black are Paul Morphy's solid 5...c6 6.Nxe5 d5, returning the pawn with equality, and 4...Nc6 (instead of 4...Nxc3) 5.0-0 (5.Nxe4 d5) Nxc3 6.dxc3 Qe7! when, according to Bobby Fischer in My 60 Memorable Games, \\"White has no compensation for the Pawn.\\" Black can also decline the pawn with 3...Nc6, transposing into the Two Knights Defense. He must, however, be willing to offer a gambit himself after 4.Ng5. White may invite an offshoot of the Boden‚ÄìKieseritzky Gambit with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Nc3. Irregular move orders are 2.Nc3 (Vienna) Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nf3 and 2.Nf3 Nf6 (Russian or Petrov Defence) 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3. ====Summary after 2...Nf6==== *3.Nc3 (Vienna Game, by transposition) *3.d3 *3.d4 (Ponziani's Gambit) **3...exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 (Center Game, by transposition) **3...exd4 4.Nf3 (Urusov Gambit) ***4...Bc5 5.0-0 Nc6 (Max Lange Attack, by transposition) ***4...Nc6 (Two Knights Defense, by transposition) ***4...Nxe4 5.Qxd4 (Urusov Gambit Accepted) *3.Nf3 (Petrov's Defense, by transposition) **3...Nxe4 4.Nc3 (Boden‚ÄìKieseritzky Gambit) *3.f4 (Greco Gambit) **3...Nxe4 4.d3 Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 or 5...e4 **3...exf4 (King's Gambit, by transposition) ===Classical Defense: 2...Bc5 === { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\"   } The Classical Defense is Black's symmetrical response, 2...Bc5. White can then transpose into the Vienna Game (3.Nc3) or the Giuoco Piano (3.Nf3 Nc6), or remain in the Bishop's Opening with the Wing Gambit (3.b4) or the Philidor Variation (3.c3). The main line of the Philidor Variation runs: 3.c3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.e5 d5! 6.exf6 dxc4 7.Qh5 0-0 8.Qxc5 Re8+ 9.Ne2 d3 10.Be3. Transpositions into the King's Gambit Declined and the Giuoco Piano are also possible after 3.d3. The Wing Gambit results in positions similar to those in the Evans Gambit. It can transpose into the Evans Gambit, for instance by 3.b4 Bxb4 4.c3 Ba5 5.Nf3 Nc6. Black's most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5, named for the English player and author William Lewis (1787‚Äì1870) who published analysis of the line in 1834. Among amateurs, 3.Qf3 and 3.Qh5 are also popular, threatening an immediate Scholar's mate. But the threat is easily met (e.g. 3.Qh5 Qe7) and the moves are considered inferior since they hamper White's development or leave the queen exposed, leading to loss of tempo. ====Summary after 2...Bc5==== *3.b4 (Wing Gambit) *3.c3 (Philidor Variation) **3...d5 (Lewis Countergambit) **3...d6 **3...Nf6 *3.Nc3 (Vienna Game, by transposition) *3.d3 *3.Nf3 Nc6 (Giuoco Piano, by transposition) *3.Qg4 ===Other Black responses=== Other Black second moves are rarely played. If Black tries to transpose into the Hungarian Defense with 2...Be7?, then 3.Qh5 wins a pawn. The Calabrese Countergambit (2...f5) is named after Greco's homeland, Calabria. It is considered dubious, as the line recommended by Carl Jaenisch, 3.d3 Nf6 4.f4 d6 5.Nf3, gives White the advantage. Other analyses, however, have found that the sharp 3.f4! or safe 3.Nc3 are better for White than 3.d3. ====Summary of other Black responses==== *2...c6 (Philidor Counterattack) *2...Nc6 *2...d6 *2...f5?!

Until it was banned in 1992, one of several themed annual \\"spirit days\\" was Slave Day. According to a 1999 Salon article written on the school's history, \\"students dressed in tattered clothes and chains were \\"auctioned\\" to other students, whom they were then required to serve for the day.\\" Images of this day from the 1987-1988 year book circulated in 2020, drawing shock from students and community members. Reports of racial and ethnic intolerance began as early as 1995, when an American-born Asian-American senior at the school was beaten by a group of teenagers shouting racial slurs and telling him to go back to China. The one assailant who took responsibility was sentenced to 20 hours of community service. In early 1998, a student yelled racial epithets at members of the visiting Tamalpais High School basketball team. In reaction to the slurs and actions committed by the San Marin High student, parents of four of the black students from Tamalpais filed suit against the Novato Unified School District, charging that a \\"climate of intolerance\\" was allowed at San Marin. The Marin County Athletic League put San Marin on probation for more than a year, citing its \\"hostile environment\\". }Fiona Morgan, salon.com, \\"Pride and prejudice: Is Novato, Calif., a breeding ground for hatred ‚Äì or jus t like every other American suburb?,\\" 1999-04-29 , accessed March 7, 2007The Economist, \\"Hate Crimes Continue to Increase Nationally ‚Äì Even in Wealthy Suburbs,\\" 1999-02-27, accessed March 7, 2007Dave Allen, Marin Independent Journal, February 7, 2008, \\"Parents' behavior prompts code of conduct at San Marin High\\", accessed February 11, 2007 In the 1998‚Äì99 school year, San Marin received widespread media coverage after repeated incidents of hate crimes committed against one of their openly gay students. He was beaten by three youths off campus on September 15, 1998, soon after forming the Gay-Straight Alliance at San Marin. The Novato Police offered a reward, but the attackers were never identified. Some students at the school, which had been stressing tolerance at a series of \\"respect days\\" that year, spoke out in support of the victim and 1000 students and faculty walked out of San Marin to show support for him and pride in their school. The next day, San Marin's principal was reassigned to a District office. Novato's city manager, Rod Wood, referred to \\"a small group of individuals who are fairly socially maladjusted\\", who identified themselves as white supremacists and called themselves \\"the hicks\\". The school's behavior code was modified, outlining a range of punishments for racial/ethnic/sexual slurs including reprimand, parental notification, detention on Saturday afternoon, expulsion and police referral. Misbehavior by the parents of a San Marin basketball player on February 2, 2008, in two games with Tam High teams led to drafting of the first code-of-conduct contracts for parents of athletes at a Marin County school. Following a girls junior varsity game at Tam, the mother of a San Marin player followed two referees, shouting obscene insults; later, at San Marin, two parents of San Marin players confronted Tam's coach after he made a gesture indicating that the home team had choked. Novato police were called and the parents were later asked not to attend the remaining games of the season. The code of conduct put into place by Principal Robert Vieth models the importance of sportsmanship and respect. ==Notable alumni == *Mike Wise (1982) ‚Äì NFL and UC Davis defensive end *Richard Day (writer) (1980) - Hollywood writer and producer, best known for Mad About You and Arrested Development *Brad Muster (1983) ‚Äì NFL and Stanford University running back *Bud Norris (2003) ‚Äì MLB pitcher (Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals) *Brett Carolan (1989) ‚Äì NFL tight end; Marin Athletic Foundation Outstanding Student Athlete *Michael Kearney (1990) ‚Äì graduated at age 6 after one year at San Marin; world's youngest college graduate *Mike McCoy (1990) ‚Äì NFL Head Coach (San Diego Chargers) and University of Utah quarterback *Bret Bergmark (1992) ‚Äì mixed martial artist (\\"The Angry Hick\\") *Meagan McCray (2005) ‚Äì Women's Professional Soccer goalkeeper *Manny Wilkins (2013) - Arizona State Sun Devils football quarterback 2014-2018 *Brent Moore (1981) - linebacker for the Green Bay Packers *Juan Alderete (1981) - Grammy-award winning bassist for The Mars Volta and Marilyn Manson ==References== == External links == * San Marin High School website * Novato Unified School District * Archive of Pony Express 2003‚Äì2006 Category:High schools in Marin County, California Category:Public high schools in California Category:Novato, California ","title":"San Marin High School"},{"id":"1272373","text":"The Three Knights Game is a chess opening which most commonly begins with the moves: :1. e4 e5 :2.

The relevant ECO code is C46. ==Black's third move== After tries such as 3...d6 or 3...Be7, White can play 4.d4, leaving Black with a cramped position resembling Philidor's Defense. If Black plays 3...Bc5 instead, White can eliminate Black's outpost at e5: 4.Nxe5 Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5. Since tournament praxis shows the line seems to favor White, Black usually plays 3...Bb4 or 3...g6. Continuations then are typically 3...Bb4 4.Nd5 and 3...g6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5. Another alternative for Black is 3...f5!? - the Winawer Defense (or Gothic Defense). Then 4.Bb5 transposes into the Schliemann variation of the Ruy Lopez with 4.Nc3.

The program has been dominant with an overall record of 95-5 in these four years. In the early 2010s, the team petitioned to play up in the strongest division of the NCS (division 1) for all four of these championships. The 2016 team was undefeated and ranked #24 nationally. The team's national presence increased in 2017, the team was ranked #12 in the nation and #2 in California. By 2018, the teams‚Äô national ranking increased to #8 and topped the 4-peat off with a #1 overall ranking in the state. The boys' lacrosse program has won three (MCAL) county championships, once in 2005 and again in 2011, and once more in 2013. In 2013, they went on to go to the NCS final, where they once again met Redwood, this time in the championship, where they lost. Both the Boys' and Girls' programs have Varsity and JV teams. ===Football=== The Hornets football program has won three California sectional (North Coast Section) titles in the last twenty years (2005, 2006 & 2007). On Dec. 9th, 2007, the varsity football team was elected to play in California's Div. II State Championship in Carson, CA. Novato lost to Oceanside of San Diego, 28-14 after a significant loss of their quarterback due to leg injury. Novato's most recent notable season for varsity was 2014 as they were crowned MCAL champions. 2017 is the most notable for Junior Varsity as they went 7-2, winning the first Novato City Football Championship for NHS at any level in 3 years. Novato has not had a freshman team since 2015, yet won the Freshman MCAL title in 2013 and 2011. In July 2017, Novato's varsity football team was dropped due to lack of summer turnout. The school's loss gained local media coverage and was revived due to a player and parent push for fellow students to fill the spots of the team. The program has both JV and Varsity teams. The varsity team won their first MCAL game since 2016 against Drake in 2019. ===Soccer=== The boys' soccer team came in first in the North Coast Section tournament for the first time in school history in 2007 beating Marin Catholic 1-0. As of the 2018-19 season, Novato had both Varsity and Junior Varsity for Boys and Girls' programs. ===Baseball=== The baseball program has won four MCAL titles and won the North Coast Section championship in the spring of 2007. Varsity's last notable season was 2015 when the team went to MCAL semifinals and NCS playoffs. In 2019, the Varsity team beat rival San Marin for the first time since 2015. Novato offers both JV and Varsity teams as of 2020. ===Basketball=== The girls' basketball program won the California state Div. II championship in the 1986 season, in which they went undefeated, 35-0. In the 2017-18 season, the boys' program had Freshman, JV, and Varsity teams, with the Varsity team making playoffs for the first time in 6 years. The girls' program had a JV and Varsity team, with Varsity notably going deeper into playoffs than in previous years. On December 3rd, 2019, the Boy‚Äôs varsity team beat cross town rival San Marin for the first time in five years. ===Water Polo=== The Novato High School Varsity Water Polo team received third place at the county level. Both the boys' and girls' programs had JV and Varsity teams in the fall 2017 season. (Marin County Athletic League) in 2005 and 2006.. ===Wrestling=== The varsity wrestling team won the MCAL league title in 2012 and 2014, 2012 being the first MCAL title since 1993. The 1969 wrestling team, coached by the \\"Father of Marin wrestling\\", Ralph Cutler, won the NorCal championship tournament led by undefeated twin brothers, Ken & Kirt Donaldson. The Donaldson's were named Co-Outstanding Wrestlers, and subsequently attained NCAA Division I All-American status for the USAF Academy in 1971. Three-sport athlete Paul Robertson, was the 141 lbs. NorCal wrestling champion in 1970. ===Cheer and Dance=== Novato has both Varsity and JV Cheer and Dance teams.

One is a popular movement of Palestinian youth in the West Bank and Gaza in the 1980s. The other is an offshoot of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades which has links to the dominant Fatah movement. The group has carried out attacks against Israeli military personnel in the Gaza Strip and were regarded as Yasser Arafat's \\"own troops\\". During the First Intifada that started in 1987, the Hawks were led by young Palestinians in the large cities of Nablus, Tulkarm, Ramallah and Bethlehem in the West Bank, and Gaza City and Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. Most of their attacks were carried out using improvised weapons; stone throwing, stabbing attacks, and use of stolen firearms. The amount of weaponry that they received from PLO sources outside of Israel was negligible, and most of their successes were in the use of stabbing attacks or roadside ambushes of Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian territories. This organisation was disbanded under the provisions of the Oslo Accords. The group reappeared during the Al-Aqsa Intifada by claiming joint responsibility with Hamas for an attack on the Rafah border crossing on the Israeli military-controlled Egyptian border crossing with Gaza near Rafah on December 12, 2004, which resulted in 5 Israeli soldiers being killed and ten others wounded. Hawk member Yasser Abu Samahdaneh was responsible for the death of \\"at least\\" 35 Arabs, many of whom were \\"personal enemies or political rivals he arbitrarily executed,\\" and of an Killing of Yehoshua Weisbrod. Following the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004, the Fatah hawks suffered like many other Fatah-based militant groups from increasing Palestinian apathy as the corrupt and old faced style Fatah lost public confidence in favour of Hamas. The number of attacks have decreased.

An accounting information system is generally a computer-based method for tracking accounting activity in conjunction with information technology resources. The resulting financial reports can be used internally by management or externally by other interested parties including investors, creditors and tax authorities. Accounting information systems are designed to support all accounting functions and activities including auditing, financial accounting & reporting, -managerial/ management accounting and tax. The most widely adopted accounting information systems are auditing and financial reporting modules. ==History== Traditionally, accounting is purely based on manual approach. Experience and skillfulness of an individual accountant are critical in accounting processes. Even using the manual approach can be ineffective and inefficient. Accounting information systems resolve many of above issues. AISs can support an automation of processing large amount of data and produce timely and accuracy of information. Early accounting information systems were designed for payroll functions in 1970s. Initially, accounting information systems were developed \\"in-house\\" as no packaged solutions were available. Such solutions were expensive to develop and difficult to maintain. Therefore, many accounting practitioners preferred the manual approach rather than computer-based. Today, accounting information systems are more commonly sold as prebuilt software packages from large vendors such as Microsoft, Sage Group, SAP AGSAP and Oracle CorporationOracle where it is configured and customized to match the organization's business processes. Small businesses often use accounting lower costs software packages such as Tally.ERP 9, MYOB and Quickbooks. Large organisations would often choose ERP systems. As the need for connectivity and consolidation between other business systems increased, accounting information systems were merged with larger, more centralized systems known as enterprise resource planning (ERP). Before, with separate applications to manage different business functions, organizations had to develop complex interfaces for the systems to communicate with each other. In ERP, a system such as accounting information system is built as a module integrated into a suite of applications that can include manufacturing, supply chain, human resources. These modules are integrated together and are able to access the same data and execute complex business processes. Today, Cloud-based accounting information systems are increasingly popular for both SMEs and large organisations for lower costs. With adoption of accounting information systems, many businesses have removed low skills, transactional and operational accounting roles. ==An example of architecture== An AIS typically follows a multitier architecture separating the presentation to the user, application processing and data management in distinct layers. The presentation layer manages how the information is displayed to and viewed by functional users of the system (through mobile devices, web browsers or client application). The entire system is backed by a centralized database that stores all of the data. This can include transactional data generated from the core business processes (purchasing, inventory, accounting) or static, master data that is referenced when processing data (employee and customer account records and configuration settings). As transactions occur, the data is collected from the business events and stored into the system's database where it can be retrieved and processed into information that is useful for making decisions. The application layer retrieves the raw data held in the log database layer, processes it based on the configured business logic and passes it onto the presentation layer to display to the users. For example, consider the accounts payable department when processing an invoice. With an accounting information system, an accounts payable clerk enters the invoice, provided by a vendor, into the system where it is then stored in the database. When goods from the vendor are received, a receipt is created and also entered into the AIS. Before the accounts payable department pays the vendor, the system's application processing tier performs a three-way matching where it automatically matches the amounts on the invoice against the amounts on the receipt and the initial purchase order. Once the match is complete, an email is sent to an accounts payable manager for approval. From here a voucher can be created and the vendor can ultimately be paid. ==Advantages and implications== A big advantage of computer-based accounting information systems is that they automate and streamline reporting, develop advanced modelling and support data mining. Reporting is major tool for organizations to accurately see summarized, timely information used for decision-making and financial reporting. The accounting information system pulls data from the centralized database, processes and transforms it and ultimately generates a summary of that data as information that can now be easily consumed and analyzed by business analysts, managers or other decision makers. These systems must ensure that the reports are timely so that decision-makers are not acting on old, irrelevant information and, rather, able to act quickly and effectively based on report results. Consolidation is one of the hallmarks of reporting as people do not have to look through an enormous number of transactions. For instance, at the end of the month, a financial accountant consolidates all the paid vouchers by running a report on the system. The system's application layer provides a report with the total amount paid to its vendors for that particular month. With large corporations that generate large volumes of transactional data, running reports with even an AIS can take days or even weeks. After the wave of corporate scandals from large companies such as Tyco International, Enron and WorldCom, major emphasis was put on enforcing public companies to implement strong internal controls into their transaction- based systems. This was made into law with the passage of the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002 which stipulated that companies must generate an internal control report stating who is responsible for an organization's internal control structure and outlines the overall effectiveness of these controls.http://www.coso.org/ Since most of these scandals were rooted in the companies' accounting practices, much of the emphasis of Sarbanes Oxley was put on computer-based accounting information systems. Today, AIS vendors tout their governance, risk management, and compliance features to ensure business processes are robust and protected and the organization's assets (including data) are secured. ==Implementation== Many large and SMEs are now adopting cost effective cloud-based accounting information system in recent years. Looking back years ago, most organizations, even larger ones, hire outside consultants, either from the software publisher or consultants who understand the organization and who work to help select and implement the ideal configuration, taking all components into consideration. The steps to implement an accounting information system are as follows: ;Detailed Requirements Analysis: where all individuals involved in the system are interviewed. The current system is thoroughly understood, including problems, and complete documentation of the system‚Äîtransactions, reports, and questions that need to be answered‚Äîare gathered. User needs that are not in the current system are outlined and documented. Users include everyone, from top management to data entry. The requirements analysis not only provides the developer with the specific needs, it also helps users accept the change. Users who have the opportunity to ask questions and provide input are much more confident and receptive of the change, than those who sit back and don't express their concerns. ;Systems Design (synthesis): The analysis is thoroughly reviewed and a new system is created. The system that surrounds the system is often the most important. What data needs to go into the system and how is this going to be handled? What information needs to come out of the system how is it going to be formatted? If we know what needs to come out, we know what we need to put into the system. The program we select will need to appropriately handle the process. The system is built with control files, sample master records, and the ability to perform processes on a test basis. The system is designed to include appropriate internal controls and to provide management with the information needed to make decisions. It is a goal of an accounting information system to provide information that is relevant, meaningful, reliable, useful, and current. To achieve this, the system is designed so that transactions are entered as they occur (either manually or electronically) and information is immediately available online for management. :Once the system is designed, an RFP is created detailing the requirements and fundamental design. Vendors are asked to respond to the proposal, to provide demonstrations of the product, and to specifically respond to the needs of the organization. Ideally, the vendor will input control files, sample master records, and be able to show how transactions are processed that result in the information that management needs to make decisions. An RFP for the information technology infrastructure follows the selection of the software product because the software product generally has specific requirements for infrastructure. Sometimes, the software and the infrastructure is selected from the same vendor. If not, the organization must ensure that vendors will work together without \\"pointing fingers\\" when there is an issue with either the software or the infrastructure. ;Documentation:As the system is being designed, it is documented. The documentation includes vendor documentation of the system and, more importantly, the procedures or detailed instructions that help users handle each process specific to the organization. Most documentation and procedures are online and it is helpful if organizations can add to the help instructions provided by the software vendor. Documentation and procedures tend to be an afterthought but is the insurance policy and the tool used during testing and training‚Äîbefore launch. The documentation is tested during the training so that when the system is launched, there is no question that it works and that the users are confident with the change. ;Testing: Before launch, all processes are tested from input through output, using the documentation as a tool to ensure that all processes are thoroughly documented and that users can easily follow the procedures: They know it works and that the procedures will be followed consistently. The reports are reviewed and verified, so that there's no garbage in-garbage out. This is done in a test system not yet fully populated with live data. Unfortunately, most organizations launch systems before thorough testing, adding to end-user frustration when processes don't work. The documentation and procedures may be modified during this process. All identified transactions must be tested during this step. All reports and online information must be verified and traced through the audit trail so that management is ensured that transactions will be handled consistently and that the information can be relied upon to make decisions. ;Training: Before launch, all users need to be trained, with procedures. This means a trainer using the procedures to show each end user how to handle a procedures. The procedures often need to be updated during training as users describe their unique circumstances and the \\"design\\" is modified with this additional information. The end user then performs the procedure with the trainer and the documentation. The end user then performs the procedure with the documentation alone. The end user is then on his or her own with the support, either in person or by phone, of the trainer or other support person. This is before data conversion. ;Data Conversion: Tools are developed to convert the data from the current system (which was documented in the requirements analysis) to the new system. The data is mapped from one system to the other and data files are created that will work with the tools that are developed. The conversion is thoroughly tested and verified before final conversion. There's a backup so it can be restarted, if necessary. ;Launch: The system is implemented only after all of the above is completed. The entire organization is aware of the launch date. Ideally, the current system is retained and often run in \\"parallel\\" until the new system is in full operation and working properly. With the current mass-market software used by thousands of companies and fundamentally proven to work, the \\"parallel\\" run that is mandatory with software tailor-made to a company is generally not done. This is only true, however, when the above process is followed, the system is thoroughly documented and tested, and users are trained before launch. ;Tools: Online resources are available to assist with strategic planning of accounting information systems. Information systems and financial forms aid in determining the specific needs of each organization, as well as assigning responsibility to principles involved.Accounting Information Systems: Information on Collection, Storage and Processing of Financial and Accounting Data. Accounting Information Systems. Retrieved 7 December 2012. ;Support: The end users and managers have ongoing support available at all times. System upgrades follow a similar process and all users are thoroughly apprised of changes, upgraded in an efficient manner, and trained. :Many organizations chose to limit the time and money spent on the analysis, design, documentation, and training, and move right into software selection and implementation. If a detailed requirements analysis is performed with adequate time being spent on the analysis, the implementation and ongoing support will be minimal. Organizations that skip the steps to ensure the system meets their needs are often left with frustrated end users, costly support, and information that is not current or correct. Worse yet, these organizations build the system three times instead of once. ==Evolution== Accounting Information System is characterize by large amount of different approaches and methodologies Over the past 50 years. Due to the restrictions and weaknesses of previous models each new model evolved. Interestingly After the production of newest technique the newer or recent models of evolution does not eliminate or replace the older or previous technique instantly. However Several Generations and peers of systems exists among different institutions, organizations , groups at the same time and possibly exists with in a single or same institution. Similarly The up-to-date inspector needs to be aware with the functioning features of all AIS approaches that he or she is likely to encounter. currently there are four approaches can be identified which has been evolved during last 50 years. ;* Manual Process Model ;* Flat File Model ;* Database Model System ;* REA Model (Resource, Event and Agents) ==Career== Many AIS professionals work for consulting firms, large corporations, insurance companies, financial firms, government agencies and public accounting firms, among other types of companies. With technological advancement, traditional accounting practice will shift to accounting information systems practice. Both accounting and information technology professional bodies are working on the new directions of accounting programs and industry practices. System Auditors is one of the top choices in the past two decades, they look at the controls, data processing, data integrity, general operation, maintenance, security and other aspects of all types of information systems used by businesses. Some job titles in this field of work include financial manager, financial examiner and chief financial officer. Other job titles include computer systems analyst, a computer information systems manager or a computer software engineer or programmer specializing in financial software. There are industry associations offer certificates that related to AIS area include CISA, AIS, CISSP, CIA, AFE, CFE, and CITP. == See also == * Accounting software * List of ERP software packages *Final accounts ==References== Category:Information systems Category:Accounting software ","title":"Accounting information system"},{"id":"1272414","text":"Wunjo may refer to: **wunj≈ç, a rune of the Germanic alphabet *Vunjo language, a Bantu language spoken in Tanzania ","title":"Wunjo"},{"id":"1272427","text":"', officially the ' (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. The Municipality of Alaminos is an AGRO-INDUSTRIAL town that lies within the third congressional district of the Province of Laguna and is part of the CALABARZON. Based on the municipal zoning, the Industrial sites are located along Maharlika Highway of Barangays San Andres, San Juan, San Agustin and San Benito. Here, lands are available for Industrial and Commercial purposes. Barangays San Andres and San Juan will also be developed as technopark for farm housing, industrial and commercial purposes. ==History== Alaminos began as a barrio of San Pablo City which was then only a town of the Province of Batangas. Its initial name was Trenchera denoting the presence of long and deep ravines. The early inhabitants of Trenchera were believed to be insurectors and possibly fugitives who took advantage of the numerous trenches for hiding as well as for defense against the Spanish authority. Sometime in 1873 when a certain Don Andres Penaloza was the Gobernadorcillo (equivalent to Mayor) of the town of San Pablo, Trenchera was formally separated and became pueblo or town but remained part of the Province of Batangas. Don Cirilo Baylon, a wealthy resident of Trenchera and with good command of the Spanish language invited Captain-General Juan de Alaminos Nivera, the Chief Executive of the Province of Batangas whose capital seat was Lipa. The Captain-General accepted the invitation and came in colorful carriage drawn by two horses. With Don Cirilo Baylon leading, he was warmly received by the residents of Trenchera. Dona Gregoria Baylon, the younger sister of Don Cirilo Baylon presented bouquets of fresh flowers to the Captain-General. During the program in honor of the Captain General and his party, Don Cirilo Baylon presented the petition of the residents asking that Trenchera be made into a duly organized and recognized town. The petition was read in public and the Captain General gave assurance to consider their wish favorably. In less than 2 months the official paper proclaiming Trenchera as a new pueblo or town arrived from Lipa. At the same time, Don Cirilo Baylon was appointed the first Gobernadorcillo or Town Mayor in concurrent capacity as Capitan de los Constables de Pueblo or the equivalent of the local police chief. In appreciation of Capitan General Juan de Alaminos Nivera, the new pueblo was named Alaminos in 1873 and remained part of the Province of Batangas until 1903. ==Geography== Alaminos has a land area of and is situated southeast of Manila. The municipalities of Calauan and Bay are located north of Alaminos, the city of San Pablo on the south and the municipality of Santo Tomas in Batangas province on its west. There are three main rivers in Alaminos, namely Kaquinkong, Onipa and Tigas. The Maharlika Highway passes through the municipality and is connected directly to Manila through the South Luzon Expressway. ===Barangays=== Alaminos is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Four are which is classified as urban barangays; Barangay I, II, III and IV. The rest of the eleven barangays are classified as rural. San Gregorio is the biggest barangay measuring 840.6190 hectares followed by Santa Rosa measuring 802.28 hectares. ===Climate=== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Alaminos, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Municipal Government== ===Mayors of Alaminos=== Alaminos Municipal Hall The following is the list of mayors of Alaminos since 1944.

Each account maintained by an organization is known as a ledger account, and the collection of all these accounts is known as the general ledger. The general ledger is the backbone of any accounting system which holds financial and non-financial data for an organization. An organization's statement of financial position and the statement of income and comprehensive income are both derived from the general ledger. Each account in the general ledger consists of one or more pages. The general ledger is where posting to the accounts occurs. Posting is the process of recording amounts as credits (right side), and amounts as debits (left side), in the pages of the general ledger. Additional columns to the right hold a running activity total (similar to a chequebook). The listing of the account names is called the chart of accounts. The extraction of account balances is called a trial balance. The purpose of the trial balance is, at a preliminary stage of the financial statement preparation process, to ensure the equality of the total debits and credits. The general ledger should include the date, description and balance or total amount for each account. It is usually divided into at least seven main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, owner's equity, revenue, expenses, gains and losses. The main categories of the general ledger may be further subdivided into subledgers to include additional details of such accounts as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc. Because each bookkeeping entry debits one account and credits another account in an equal amount, the double-entry bookkeeping system helps ensure that the general ledger is always in balance, thus maintaining the accounting equation: : \\\\mbox{Assets} = \\\\mbox{Liabilities} + \\\\mbox{(Shareholders' or Owners' equity)}.Meigs and Meigs. Financial Accounting, Fourth Edition. McGraw-Hill, 1983. pp.19-20. The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the balance sheet. Although a general ledger appears to be fairly simple, in large or complex organizations or organizations with various subsidiaries, the general ledger can grow to be quite large and take several hours or days to audit or balance. In a manual or non-computerized system, the general ledger may be a large book. Organizations may instead employ one or more spreadsheets for their ledgers, including the general ledger, or may utilize specialized software to automate ledger entry and handling. When a business uses enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, a financial-features module produces subledgers and the general ledger, with entries drawn from a database that is shared with other processes managed through the ERP. == References == Category:Accounting journals and ledgers Category:Accounting terminology ","title":"General ledger"},{"id":"1272434","text":"Marantz is a company that develops and sells high-end audio products.Audio Illusions: Marantz The company was founded in New York, but is now based in Japan.

This view held that allegiance to the Crown was not incompatible with allegiance to the Pope. ==Background== With the deterioration of relations with the American colonies, the British government was faced with the necessity of increasing troop recruitments. While the Catholic Relief Act of 1778 some provisions of the Penal Laws, its main purpose was to encourage the Catholic gentry to support enlistments. According to historian Thomas Bartlett, \\"It firmly established the principle of Catholic relief as a key element of war-time strategy.\\"\\"The Catholic Question in the Eighteenth Century\\", History Ireland, Issue 1 (Spring 1993), Volume 1 The passing of this act was the occasion of the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots (1780). ==Catholic Committee== ===First English Catholic Committee=== Cisalpinism was more a political than theological position, directed toward helping the question of emancipation.\\"Review of The Sequel to Emancipation by Bernard Ward\\", The American Catholic Quarterly, (James Andrew Corcoran, Patrick John Ryan, Edmond Francis Prendergast, eds.) Hardy and Mahony., 1915, p. 707 It sought accommodation of the English Roman Catholic Church within the Protestant State in the 18th century, when the Penal Laws persecuting the Catholic Church were still in place. Thirty Catholic laymen met in 1782 to elect a \\"Catholic Committee\\" of five, for a period of five years, \\"to promote and attend to the affairs of the Roman Catholic body in England.\\"Catholic Progress, Vol. 8, Young men's Catholic assoc, London, Burns & Oates, 1879, p. 358 According to the Secretary to the Committee, Charles Butler, \\"A variety of circumstances prevented them making any particular exertions in the cause entrusted to them.\\" The Committee first action was to write to the four Apostolic Vicars that one of the causes raised against further repeal of the penal laws was the title \\"apostolic vicar\\" and the perception of too close a dependence on the \\"Court of Rome\\". The Committee proposed the restoration of the hierarchy with the apostolic vicars becoming Bishops in Ordinary, governing their own dioceses. From the perspective of the actual working of ecclesiastical affairs, each of the Apostolic Vicars had a different opinion; and the matter was dropped.Ward, Bernard. The Dawn of the Catholic Revival in England, 1781-1803, Vol. 1, Longmans, Green, 1909, p. 96 ===Second English Catholic Committee=== The powers of the first committee having expired at the end of its term in 1787, a new committee was constituted made up of ten members. In February, the Committee sent a letter to the Prime Minister protesting various prohibitions for which they suffered severe penalties. Among those listed were: * keeping schools for educating their children in their own religious principles at home; * sending their children abroad for education; * practicing law; * serving in the House of Commons; * taking their hereditary seat in House of Lords; -and as loyal subjects, they petitioned for redress of their grievances.Butler, Charles. Historical Memoirs of the English, Irish, and Scottish Catholics, J. Murray, 1822, p. 6 In May 1788, the following year, the following members were added: James Talbot, vicar apostolic of the London district -although he never attended a meeting, Charles Berington, co-adjutor of the Midland district, and Joseph Wilks, a Benedictine monk. Although it looked like a way to safeguard the English Catholic population, Bishop Charles Walmesley (1722‚Äì1797), the Vicar Apostolic of the west of England, thought Cisalpinism would mean a new oath of allegiance that would \\"exclude the Pope's spiritual jurisdiction\\" and \\"diminish our dependence in spirituals on the Church in Rome, and by degrees to shake it off entirely; likewise to take off the abstinence of Saturday, to reduce Lent to a fortnight before Easter, and to have the Liturgy in English\\". The publication of the \\"Staffordshire Creed\\" by some Staffordshire clergy to Bishop Walmesley complained about the excommunication of the Benedictine Joseph Wilks. The creed also contained the Rights of the Priesthood against the Episcopacy, and this at a time when many Catholic laity were still being accused of treason. In 1797 Bishop Walmesley publicly excommunicated the signatories of the \\"Staffordshire Creed\\". One of the defenders of the Cisalpine tradition who even objected to the Asperges (sprinkling of Holy Water) before Mass was John Lingard, author of the hymn Hail Queen of Heaven the Ocean Star and first Rector of Ushaw College Seminary. Father Daniel Rock, chaplain to Lord Shrewsbury of Alton Towers from 1827 to 1841, continued for a short time elements of the Cisalpine tradition. It was the chance meeting at Alton Towers of Lord Shrewsbury with Father F. W. Faber that promoted Ultramontanism. ==References== ==Sources== *J A Hilton, Catholic Lancashire (1994) *The London Oratory Centenary (1884-1984) Published 1984 *Fr Faber by G Chapman *P McPartland, The Eucharist Makes the Church, published by T and T Clark 1983 ==See also== *Cisalpine Club * Ultramontanism Category:History of Catholicism in England Category:Catholic Church in England Category:People excommunicated by the Catholic Church Category:18th century in England Category:18th-century Catholicism Category:19th century in England Category:19th-century Catholicism ","title":"Cisalpinism"},{"id":"1272439","text":"The Shukhov Radio Tower (), also known as the Shabolovka Tower (), is a broadcasting tower deriving from the Russian avant-garde in Moscow designed by Vladimir Shukhov. The 160-metre-high free-standing steel diagrid structure was built in the period 1920‚Äì1922, during the Russian Civil War. ==History== Shabolovskaya telecentre ===Designing=== Vladimir Shukhov invented the world's first hyperboloid structure in the year 1890. Later he wrote a book \\"Rafters\\" where he proved that the triangular shapes are 20-25% heavier than the arched ones with a ray grating. After that, Shukhov filed a number of patents for a diagrid. He aimed not only to achieve greater strength and rigidity of the structure, but also ease and simplicity through the use of as little building material as possible. The first diagrid tower was built for the All-Russia Exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896, and later was bought by Yury Nechaev- Maltsov, famous manufacturer of the city. Shukhov was responsible for constructions of a new types of lighthouses, masts, water and transmission towers. Broadcasting tower at Shabolovka has become one of the diagrid structures in the form of a rotated hyperboloid. The Khodynka radio station, built in 1914, couldn't longer handle the increasing amount of radiograms. On July 30, 1919, Vladimir Lenin signed a decree of the Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense, which demanded ‚Äúto install in an extremely urgent manner a radio station equipped with the most advanced and powerful devices and machines‚Äù, sufficiently to ensure the security of the country and constant communication with other republics. Tower designing was started immediately across many bureaus. Later that year Shukhov‚Äôs Construction Office won a competition. Shukhov‚Äôs engineering talents have become popular against the background of a shortage of metal in the country during the World War I and Civil War. Often Shukhov used materials of disassembled bridges and factories. The complexity of the work was also determined by the lack of qualified workers after the World War I, laborers had to be trained directly at the construction site. The planned height of the new nine-sectioned hyperbolic tower was 350 meters (15 meters above the Eiffel Tower, which was taken into consideration when creating the plan) with an estimated mass of 2,200 tons (the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons). However, in the context of the Civil War and the lack of resources, the project had to be revised: the height was reduced to 148.5 meters, the weight ‚Äî to 240 tons. New project was approved by Lenin personally. ===Installation=== Tower construction was carried out without any cranes and scaffolding, but only with winches. 240 tons of metal that was required for construction, was allocated by Lenin‚Äôs personal decree from the stocks of the Military Department. For lifting five wooden winches were used, which were moved to the upper sections. The tower is composed of six sections, one above the other. Each section is an independent hyperboloid based on a larger one. Installation of each section was carried out inside the contour and then lifted up to a predetermined height. In order for the base of the section to pass, the bottom diameter was tightened, and after stretching into the installed section, it was loosened, attached and mounted. The initial project implied that the bearing ribs located in the vertical sections of the tower would contact the imaginary surface of the hyperboloid only at the nodal points located on the horizontal belts of the hyperboloid. The lower supporting ring was attached to the foundation with an anchor bolts on both sides from the nodal supporting gusset plates. On June 29, 1921, during the uplifting of the fourth section, an accident occurred ‚Äî cable broke, as a result whole fourth section fell from a height of 75 meters and damaged the fifth and sixth sections, which were assembled on the ground. During the investigation, the real cause of the accident was confirmed - metal fatigue, after that work was resumed. The report on the inspection of the tower‚Äôs construction in 1937 states: ‚Äú... metal of the Shukhov Tower can be attributed to the steel St - 1, St - 2 and St - 3. Samples have an overestimated content of harmful impurities: either sulfur or phosphorus, in some samples ‚Äî both of them.\\" The sixth section was installed and finally secured on February 14, 1922. On February 28 they put a mast on the tower, after that Shukhov's job was done. On March 19, broadcasting transmitters were installed on the tower and the radio broadcasting began. The first was a concert of Russian music with the participation of Nadezhda Obukhova and Boris Evlakhov. Transmitter power on the tower was 100 kW, and the range - around 10000 km. It was more powerful than the radio stations of Paris, New York and Berlin. ==Structure== The Shukhov tower is a hyperboloid structure (hyperbolic steel gridshell) consisting of a series of hyperboloid sections stacked on one another to approximate an overall conical shape. The tower has a diagrid structure, and its steel shell experiences minimum wind load (a significant design factor for high-rising buildings). The tower sections are single-cavity hyperboloids of rotation made of straight beams, the ends of which rest against circular foundations. ==Location== The tower is located a few kilometres south of the Moscow Kremlin, but is not accessible to tourists. The street address of the tower is \\"Shabolovka Street, 37\\". ==Possible demolition== As of early 2014, the tower faced demolition by the Russian State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting, after having been allowed to deteriorate for years despite popular calls for its restoration. Following a concerted campaign calling for the preservation of the tower, on July 3 the Ministry of Culture of Russia announced that the tower will not be demolished, and in September 2014 that Moscow City Council had placed a preservation order on the tower in order to safeguard it. In January 2017 the RTRS placed a request for tender for a plan to renovate and preserve the monument. ==Models== There is a model of Shukhov's Shabolovka Tower at the Information Age gallery at the Science Museum in London. The model is at 1:30 scale and was installed in October 2014. ==In culture== * In 1922 one of the members of ASNOVA Vladimir Krinsky made a mural \\"Radio speaker of the Revolution\\" with a picture of a tower. * A science fiction novel by the Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy The Garin Death Ray was inspired by the public reaction towards construction of the tower. * Shukhov Tower was a logo of a \\"L'art de l'ing√©nieur\\" exhibition in Centre Georges-Pompidou * In the novel A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles, set in 1922, the character Mikhail Fyodorovich Mindich declares the Shukhov tower a thing of beauty, \\"a two hundred foot structure of spiraling steel from which we can broadcast the latest news and intelligence - and, yes, the sentimental strains of your Tchaikovsky ...\\" (Windmill Books, p.85) ==Gallery== Image:Shukhov Hyperboloid Tower Project of 350 metres of 1919 year.jpgShukhov Tower Project of 350 metres, 1919.

The parish is bounded by those of Zennor in the west, Gulval in the south, Ludgvan in the west and south, and St Ives and the Atlantic Ocean in the north and east. The church is about two miles (3 km) from St Ives and six miles (10 km) from Penzance.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Towednack lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. ==History== ===Towednack gold hoard=== A Cornish cross in the churchyard Trevalgan Hill In December 1931 a hoard of gold ornaments was found in the parish. A sunken lane, known locally as Badger‚Äôs Lane, leads down from Lady Downs onto the road to Amalveor. Here at SW4794 3759, concealed in an ancient stone hedge, was found a collection of beautiful gold objects, including two twisted neckrings, four armrings and two lengths of unfinished gold rod. One necklet consists of a single twisted strand of gold, and the other consists of three strands loosely twisted together. The gold is very fine, and probably came from Ireland. These ornaments date from the late Bronze Age and they now reside in the British Museum. A replica of the hoard can be seen at the Penlee House Museum in Penzance.Towednack Gold Hoard In 2007 there were calls in the local Cornish press for the gold hoard to be returned to Cornwall from the British Museum. ===Parish church=== The church is dedicated to St Tewennocus and did not become parochial until 1902. It was built in the 13th century and has a plain tower. A south aisle was added in the 15th century. The font is of granite, 1720, and stands on a base which is an inverted Norman font.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radcliffe. Penguin Books; p. 222 Towednack church is claimed to be the last church in which services were conducted in the Cornish language (in 1678), though the claim is also made for Ludgvan. The parish saint disguised under the name 'Tewennocus' is almost certainly St Winwalo (pet-form: Winnoc), also commemorated at Gunwalloe and Landewednack, as well as Landevennec, Brittany: the place-name being derived from Old Cornish \\"te-Winnoc\\" (thy St Winnoc [Winwalo]), now represented as Late Cornish Te Wydnek. The aisle, chancel and nave was restored under the direction of Mr Sedding in 1870 and in 1880 the tower and its roof restored. The cost of the 1880 building work was paid for by money from the weekly offertory. The Cornishman newspaper described the parish thus, > The parish is poor; the people are only a few hundreds; many (probably most) > of them are Dissenters who never enter a Church; and the Church itself is > small; and yet the offertory has been the means of doing more than Church- > rates ever did. When the two broken bells are re-cast (will any rich man do > this for poor Towednack?) this parish will process the most thoroughly > restored Church in West Cornwall. One of the bells has the inscription ‚Ä≥Baragwanath‚Ä≥ (wheat bread), a name which was still common in this part of Cornwall at the time of the visit of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society. in September 1882. They noted, ‚Ä≥a true chancel-arch‚Ä≥, which was described as the church's ‚Ä≥peculiar and rare feature‚Ä≥. Also seen was the benchends and their medallion-portraits of the 1633 bearded and hatted churchwardens. Their inscriptions are ‚Ä≥James Trewhela, warden‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥Master Matthew Trenwith, warden‚Ä≥. Further restoration work was carried out in 1884 with the repacement of the wooden floor of the nave, which was destroyed by dry rot. The new floor was cement, covered with a wooden platform between the benches and red tiles replaced the ‚Ä≥rough‚Ä≥ slate floor of the aisle. Until 1902 Towednack was a chapelry of Lelant; right of sepulture was only obtained in 1532. The early incised cross on a stone in the porch and the altar slab suggest that the subordination to Lelant only began after the Norman Conquest.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 206 The stone in the porch forms a bench; the cross shaft has crosses at both ends.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; p. 421 Over the porch is a typical sundial of a wide class of Cornish church dials from 1720. The inscription reads ‚Ä≥Bright Sol and Luna Time and Tide doth hold. Chronodix Humbrale‚Ä≥. There was a Cornish cross at Tredorwin; it was found in use as a building stone in a cottage at Coldharbour in 1880.Langdon (1896), p. 118 It is now in the churchyard (illustrated right). The Gorsedh Kernow was held in the parish in 1933, and the church was the first to hold a service, in Cornish, in modern times. ===Mining=== In the early part of the 19th-century Towednack was one of the richest tin-producing districts in west Cornwall. Mines included Wheal Reeth, Wheal Margaret, Reeth Consols and Georgia, and Conquer Downs. ==Folklore== A story told by the Rev. W. S. Lach-Szyrma, to a group of antiquarians from the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, was the legend of the tower: * ... the tower was never completed as during the night the 'Evil One' would knock down what the men had built the previous day. This went on for some time until the men gave up and the tower remains as it is today (1882). Similar legends also refer to nearby Lelant church and Brent Tor on Dartmoor.Anon. (1883) \\"An Account of the Annual Excursion, 22 Sep 1882\\". Transactions of the Natural History and Antiquarian Society of Penzance; p. 202. ==Local government== For the purposes of local government Towednack is a civil parish electing a parish council every four years. The principal local authority in this area is Cornwall Council. ==Popular media== In 1975 the church was the scene for the marriage and burial services in Poldark, a BBC series based on the novels of Winston Graham. It was also used as a location in the 1979 BBC series Penmarric. ==References== ==External links== * Church of St Towennac * Towednack page at West Penwith Resources * Cornwall Record Office Online Catalogue for Towednack Category:Bronze Age sites in Cornwall Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall Category:Gold objects Category:Hamlets in Cornwall ","title":"Towednack"},{"id":"1272465","text":"In physics and materials science, a drop tower or drop tube is a structure used to produce a controlled period of weightlessness for an object under study.

A view down the shaft of NASA Glenn's 2.2 second drop tower. A large (deflated) air bag is at the bottom. For a typical materials science experiment, a sample of the material under study is loaded into the top of the drop tube, which is filled with inert gas or evacuated to create a low-pressure environment. Following any desired preprocessing (e.g. induction heating to melt a metal alloy), the sample is released to fall to the bottom of the tube. During its flight or upon impact the sample can be characterized with instruments such as cameras and pyrometers. Drop towers are also commonly used in combustion research. For this work, oxygen must be present and the payload may be enclosed in a drag shield to isolate it from high-speed \\"wind\\" as the apparatus accelerates toward the bottom of the tower. See a video of a microgravity combustion experiment in the NASA Glenn Five Second Drop Facility at . Fluid physics experiments and development and testing of space-based hardware can also be conducted using a drop tower. Sometimes, the ground-based research performed with a drop tower serves as a prelude to more ambitious, in-flight investigation; much longer periods of weightlessness can be achieved with parabolic-flight-path aircraft or with space-based laboratories aboard the Space Shuttle or the International Space Station. The duration of free-fall produced in a drop tube depends on the length of the tube and its degree of internal evacuation. The 105-meter drop tube at Marshall Space Flight Center produces 4.6 seconds of weightlessness when it is fully evacuated. In the drop facility Fallturm Bremen at University of Bremen a catapult can be used to throw the experiment upwards to prolong the weightlessness from 4.74 to nearly 9.3 seconds.VON KAMPEN, P., K√ñNEMANN, T., and RATH, H.J.

The NASA Glenn Research Center has a 5 second drop tower (The Zero Gravity Facility) and a 2.2 second drop tower (The 2.2 Second Drop Tower). Much of the operating cost of a drop tower is due to the need for evacuation of the drop tube, to eliminate the effect of aerodynamic drag. Alternatively the experiment is placed inside an outer box (the drag shield) for which, due to its weight, during its fall the reduction of acceleration due to air drag is less. ==Historical uses== Though the story may be apocryphal, Galileo is popularly thought to have used the Leaning Tower of Pisa as a drop tower to demonstrate that falling bodies accelerate at the same constant rate regardless of their mass. Drop towers called shot towers were once useful for making lead shot. A short period of weightlessness allows molten lead to solidify into a quasi-perfect sphere by the time it reaches the floor of the tower. Drop tubes are used for handloading black powder; the drop allows the powder to settle into a case, improving the compression of powder charges. ==List of drop towers== *The vacuum-dynamic stand in Academician V.P.Makeyev State Rocket Centre *NASA Glenn Research Center 2.2 Second Drop Tower *NASA Glenn Research Center Zero-G Research Facility *Micro-Gravity Laboratory of Japan (MGLAB) (Closed June 2010)http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/kaihatu/space/kaihatsushi/detail/1299905.htm [In Japanese] *HASTIC 50m Drop Tower, Sapporo *Fallturm Bremen *Applied Dynamics Laboratories drop tower for spinning spacecraft *Experimental drop tube of the metallurgy department of Grenoble *NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Drop Tube Facility is currently mothballed *Dryden Drop Tower, Portland State University, Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science *National Microgravity Laboratory (China) * The pagoda at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was used during the Second World War as a drop tower for testing bomb designs.A Year In The Life Of Kew Gardens, 2007, pg86, Joanna Jackson *Queensland University of Technology drop tower, Brisbane (Closed 2014) ==See also== *Glenn Research Center *Marshall Space Flight Center *Magnetic levitation *Microgravity Environment *Shot tower *Weightlessness ==References== Category:Laboratory equipment Category:Towers Category:Weightlessness ","title":"Drop tube"},{"id":"1272468","text":"Rose of Viterbo, T.O.S.F. (c. 1233 ‚Äì March 6, 1251), was a young woman born in Viterbo, then a contested commune of the Papal States. She spent her brief life as a recluse, who was outspoken in her support of the papacy. Otherwise leading an unremarkable life, she later became known for her mystical gifts of prophecy and having miraculous powers. She is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church. == Life == The chronology of her life remains uncertain, as the acts of her canonization, the chief historical sources, record no dates. Most scholars agree she was probably born around the year 1233. Born of poor and pious parents, even as a child Rose had a great desire to pray and to aid the poor. She prayed much for the conversion of sinners. Rose was not yet 10 years old when the Blessed Virgin Mary is said to have instructed her to take the habit of the Third Order of St. Francis and to preach penance in Viterbo, at that time under the rule of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Saint Rose The Communion of Saint Rose of Viterbo, by Juan Antonio de Fr√≠as y Escalante Rose was soon admitted to the Franciscan Third Order and adopted its religious habit, a simple tunic with a cord around her waist. While walking the streets with a crucifix in her hand, she would exhort others to be faithful to the Catholic Church.\\"St. Rose of Viterbo\\", FaithND, University of Notre Dame She lived a life of prayer, penance and solitude in her father's home. Every now and then she would emerge from her solitude to entreat the people to do penance. Her mission seems to have lasted for about two years. In January 1250, Viterbo, her native city, was then in revolt against the pope. When she was 12, she began preaching in the streets against Frederick's occupation of Viterbo. She and her family were exiled from the city and took refuge in Soriano nel Cimino. When the pope's side won in Viterbo, Rose was allowed to return. On December 5, 1250, Rose allegedly foretold the speedy death of the emperor, a prophecy fulfilled on December 13. Soon afterwards she went to Vitorchiano, whose inhabitants, according to surviving reports, were affected by a supposed sorceress. Rose secured the conversion of all, even of the sorceress, reportedly by standing unscathed for three hours in the flames of a burning pyre. Rose wished to enter the Poor Clare Monastery of St. Mary in the city, but was refused because of her poverty, as she was not able to provide the dowry required for admission. She accepted her rejection, nonetheless foretelling her admission to the monastery after her death. Rose died on March 6, 1251, in her father's home. It was long believed that Rose had died of tuberculosis. In 2010, however, researchers examining her remains concluded that she had died of complications due to Pentalogy of Cantrell. == Veneration == La Macchina of Saint Rose The process of Rose's canonization was opened in the year of her death by Pope Innocent IV, but was not definitively undertaken until 1457. Originally buried at the parish church of Santa Maria in Poggio, in 1257 Pope Alexander IV ordered it moved to the monastery she had desired to enter, at which time it was renamed in her honor. When the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church was reformed after the Second Vatican Council, her feast day was transferred to the date of her death. September 4 is the date of the translation of her relics to the Monastery of St. Damian. It is this latter date on which her feast is celebrated in Viterbo and by the Franciscans. On September 3, the eve of the feast of St. Rose, the people of Viterbo follow the transportation of La Macchina (\\"the Machine of St. Rose\\") a massive tower, illuminated with 3,000 tiny electric lights and 880 candles, and topped off with a statue of her, which is carried for 1,200 metres through the darkened streets of the old medieval town on the backs of around 100 volunteers called \\"facchini\\". The tradition goes all the way back to September 4, 1258, when the body of the saint was exhumed and transported to the Monastery of Saint Damian; but it was not until 1664, following seven years of plague in the city, that a \\"machine\\" first appeared. In gratitude for having survived such a terrible pestilence the citizens voted to renew the veneration of their saint every year. St. Rose of Viterbo Convent, named for her, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, is the motherhouse of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration.Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration The convent is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Viterbo University is a Catholic, Franciscan university in the liberal arts tradition, founded by these Franciscan Sisters, also located in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Rose of Viterbo is one of the religious figures featured in the award-winning series of saint plays by Erik Ehn. The play celebrating her life premiered in October 2008 at Goshen College. ==See also== * Saint Rose of Viterbo, patron saint archive == Notes == == Sources == * ANDREUCCI, Andrea Girolano.

(Homewood IL: Irwin, Inc. 1992),195. or property, plant and equipment (PP&E;), is a term used in accounting for assets and property that cannot easily be converted into cash. This can be compared with current assets such as cash or bank accounts, described as liquid assets. In most cases, only tangible assets are referred to as fixed. IAS 16 (International Accounting Standard) defines Fixed Assets as assets whose future economic benefit is probable to flow into the entity, whose cost can be measured reliably. Fixed assets belong to one of 2 types: \\"Freehold Assets\\" ‚Äì assets which are purchased with legal right of ownership and used, and \\"Leasehold Assets\\" ‚Äì assets used by owner without legal right for a particular period of time. A fixed asset can also be defined as an asset not directly sold to a firm's consumers/end-users. As an example, a baking firm's current assets would be its inventory (in this case, flour, yeast, etc.), the value of sales owed to the firm via credit (i.e. debtors or accounts receivable), cash held in the bank, etc. Its non-current assets would be the oven used to bake bread, motor vehicles used to transport deliveries, cash registers used to handle cash payments, etc. While these non-current assets have value, they are not directly sold to consumers and cannot be easily converted to cash. These are items of value that the organization has bought and will use for an extended period of time; fixed assets normally include items such as land and buildings, motor vehicles, furniture, office equipment, computers, fixtures and fittings, and plant and machinery. These often receive favorable tax treatment (depreciation allowance) over short-term assets. It is pertinent to note that the cost of a fixed asset is its purchase price, including import duties and other deductible trade discounts and rebates. In addition, cost attributable to bringing and installing the asset in its needed location and the initial estimate of dismantling and removing the item if they are eventually no longer needed on the location. The primary objective of a business entity is to make profit and increase the wealth of its owners.Business In the attainment of this objective it is required that the management will exercise due care and diligence in applying the basic accounting concept of \\"Matching Concept\\". Matching concept is simply matching the expenses of a period against the revenues of the same period. The period of use of assets, in the generation of revenue, is usually more than a year, i.e. long term. It is therefore obligatory that in order to accurately determine the Net Income or profit for a period, depreciation be applied on the total value of the asset and charged against the same revenue of the same period. This is essential in the prudent reporting of the net revenue for the entity in the period. Net book value of an asset is basically the difference between the historical cost of that asset and its associated depreciation. From the foregoing, it is apparent that in order to report a true and fair of the financial jurisprudence of an entity it is relatable to record and report the value of fixed assets at its net book value. Apart from the fact that it is enshrined in Standard Accounting Statement (SAS) 3 and IAS 16 that value of asset should be carried at the net book value, it is the best way of consciously presenting the value of assets to the owners of the business and potential investor. ==Depreciating a fixed asset== Depreciation is, simply put, the expense generated by the uses of an asset. It is the wear and tear of an asset or diminution in the historical value owing to usage. Further to this; it is the cost of the asset less any salvage value over its estimated useful life. A fixed asset can be depreciated using the straight line method which is the most common form of depreciation. Tax depreciation is commonly calculated differently than depreciation for financial reporting. ==See also== *Bentley Infrastructure 500 *Capital asset *Depreciation *Fixed asset turnover *Fixed assets management *Fixed assets register *Like-kind exchange *List of business and finance abbreviations *Revaluation of fixed assets ==References== Category:Accounting terminology ","title":"Fixed asset"},{"id":"1272487","text":"General Jackson may refer to: ==People== * Andrew Jackson (1767‚Äì1845), War of 1812 general and seventh president of the United States * Jaxon or General Jackson (1941‚Äì2006), an American cartoonist * James S.

Khanzhonkov worked as a consultant in the post-revolutionary Goskino until he was banned from cinema in 1926. ==Early Years== Khanzhonkov was born in the small village of Khanzhonkova of the Don Host Oblast (modern-day Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast) into a noble family of Don Cossacks. His father Alexei Petrovich Khanzhonkov was a landlord who went bankrupt. His mother Paraskeva Sergeevna Khanzhonkova (n√©e Dmitrieva) came from a colonel's family who owned a Singer shop in Moscow.

He took part in the Russo-Japanese War which undermined his health. In 1905, upon a discharge from military training due to health issues, Khanzhonkov sat in on a screening of Train Pulling into a Station by the Lumiere Brothers.Prominent Russians: Aleksansdr Khanzhonkov in Russiapedia This marked the onset of his interest and subsequent investment in film, primarily as a producer but also as a director. ==Career== In 1906 Khanzhonkov founded Russia's first cinema factory, A. Khanzhonkov and Co., whose main financial backer was Ivan Ozerov, an influential banker and member of the Russian State Council. Initial productions were shot on stage in the vein of Melies and were overshadowed by the work of Alexander Drankov. Known for his unabashed commercialism, Drankov would remain a competitor up to the revolution of 1917. It wasn't until 1911 that Khanzhonkov's factory would receive widespread acclaim with the release of Defence of Sevastopol. One of the earliest full length Russian feature films, it was equally notable for its technical aspects. By the end of 1912, Khanzhonkov had established a permanent studio in Moscow and went on to produce over a hundred films over the course of the next several years. Much of Khanzhonkov's work during this time period went \\"virtually unseen by the Russian masses\\" and often took aim at aristocratic sensibilities or adapted great Russian novels of the 19th century. Nonetheless, Khanzhonov helped create many standards in Russian cinema production; the first confirmed use of artificial light in the Russian film industry takes place in a Khanzhonkov documentary piece. During the Russian Revolution, Khanzhonkov fled Russia to Constantinople and Vienna, and, despite previous affiliation with the royal family, returned upon invitation to the USSR in 1923 and was appointed director of the new Soviet studio Proletkino and later as a production consultant for Goskino. His career in the Soviet Union ended in 1926: he was forced to abdicate after a corruption scandal struck Proletkino, and never worked in cinema again. Khanzhonkov spent the rest of his life in Yalta, living on a personal pension from the state. There he survived the Nazi occupation of Crimea in 1941‚Äì1944, and died in Yalta after many years of declining health on September 26, 1945. == Bibliography == * Aleksandr Khanzhonkov (1937).

During this time Cale was also producing records for other artists, working on albums such as Horses by Patti Smith, one of the most influential of all proto-punk records. In addition to his lead vocals on Fear, Cale also played keyboards, guitars, viola, violin and bass, and was joined by Fairport Convention's Richard Thompson, Roxy Music's Brian Eno and Phil Manzanera, and other artists who were signed to Island at the time. \\"Gun\\" features an unusual two-man guitar solo from Manzanera and Eno, with the latter using a synthesizer to process the former's guitar playing in real-time.

One of Heaven Seventeen's keyboard players was Ivan Doroschuk, who later formed Men Without Hats. Howe also later joined Men Without Hats, as a guitarist, prior to forming Rational Youth with Vorn. The band was formed in the summer of 1981 by Howe and Vorn, joined by keyboardist Mario Spezza. The band's second professional engagement was opening for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, in Montreal. The band recorded their first single \\"I Want To See The Light\\" in 1981 for YUL Records, an independent label established by Marc Demouy, a record importer and retailer, and Pat Deserio. Demouy also became the band's manager. Shortly after the single was issued, Spezza left and was replaced by Kevin Komoda (keyboards). The Howe/Vorn/Komoda trio then recorded the album Cold War Night Life, which was issued in early 1982 and was the first all-synth pop release in Canada. It became one of the biggest-selling Canadian independent albums at the time. Vorn left the band at the beginning of 1983 to resume communication studies at university. He earned a doctorate in communication studies at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, and is a full professor in the Department of Studio Arts at Concordia University. He has been active in the field of robotic art since 1992.Biography - Bill Vorn - Robotic Art. Billvorn.concordia.ca, Retrieved 2013-01-08. Following Vorn's departure, the group ‚Äî now consisting of Howe (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Komoda (keyboards), Denis Duran (bass) and Angel Calvo (drums) -- was signed to Capitol Records. That year, Rational Youth issued an eponymous EP. Following the release of the EP and immediately before a national promotional tour, Komoda, Duran and Calvo left the band, purportedly because of about the level of full-time commitment. Howe, left with the band name but no band, did not form another band to tour in support of the EP. Komoda later became a radio producer for CBC Radio's Brave New Waves. A subsequent album, Heredity, was released in 1985 under the Rational Youth name, although Howe was now the only permanent group member. The album was recorded with the participation of over a dozen session musicians, including Dee Long of Klaatu (guitars, keyboards), Ken Sinnaeve of Tom Cochrane and Red Rider (bass), and Ben Mink of FM (violin, mandolin). Peter McGee (guitars, keyboards) and John Jones (keyboards) also made significant contributions to the record and participated in the songwriting. Amongst the eight keyboard players employed, ex-members Vorn and Komoda also appeared on Heredity, both credited with \\"additional keyboards\\". Howe and Long produced. The decision to release the album under the Rational Youth name was that of the record company, Capitol Records, though Howe did not oppose the decision. The record, while successful, is viewed as having created a different audience for Rational Youth, confusing older fans. All three singles from the album (\\"No More And No Less\\", \\"Call Me\\" and \\"Bang On\\") scraped into the lower reaches of the Canadian charts, hitting chart peaks of #87, #89 and #91, respectively. Howe put a band together and toured in support of Heredity during 1985 and 1986. The touring band consisted of Howe (vocals, keyboards), Rick Joudrey (bass), Owen Tennyson (drums), Kevin Breit (guitars) and Jim MacDonald (keyboards). Shortly after filming a cameo in the film Crazy Moon (to which they contributed two songs), Howe placed the band on \\"indefinite hiatus\\" in February 1986. However, continued interest in the band, particularly in Europe, resulted in Cold War Night Life being reissued on compact disc in 1997. This in turn led to a 1997 reunion concert with Howe and Vorn in Lund, Sweden. In 1999, Rational Youth, with a new lineup of original frontman Howe and new keyboard players Jean-Claude Cutz and Dave Rout, released its first album after fourteen years, To the Goddess Electricity. Cutz and Rout had been members of techno-industrial band Digital Poodle.Discogs, Profile of Digital Poodle. Retrieved 2013-01-07. Rational Youth toured throughout Scandinavia over the next two years, playing its final concert on November 3, 2001, at the Tinitus FestivalTinitus Festival Website. Tinitus.com, Retrieved 2013-01-18. in Stockholm, Sweden. Original members Tracy Howe and Bill Vorn came together again in 2009, at the initiative of Marc Demouy, recording a new version of their 1982 track \\"Dancing On The Berlin Wall\\" in honour of the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Wall. In 2010, the recording was issued by YUL Records as a CD EP. In 2011, another CD EP was released, City Of Night /Cite Phosphore, consisting of re-recordings of an early single, as well as remixed versions of the original recording. Later that year, Kevin Komoda rejoined, thus reuniting the Cold War Night Life Rational Youth trio. This trio issued yet another re-recorded single, the CD EP Coboloid Race/I Want To See The Light 30th Anniversary Edition. The release included newly re-recorded songs and newly discovered alternative mixes from the original 1981 sessions.News Release, November 22, 2011, \\"YUL Records 30th Anniversary Releases! Rational Youth, Monty Cantsin & Cham-pang!\\". Ulrecords.blogspot.ca. Retrieved 13-01-31. In 2013, the band issued a number of archival recordings, including live material recorded in Ottawa and Winnipeg in 1983. A rarities compilation called Magic Box was also released, which consisted of early 1980s Rational Youth demos and remixes, and solo recordings from Howe, Vorn and Komoda. In 2014 the band did a few shows as a six piece, featuring Tracy Howe on vocals and synth, Kevin Komoda on synths, Brian Arsenault on synths, Scott Cameron on bass, Paul Grainville on drums, backing vocals, Gaenor Howe on electronic percussion, theremin, backing vocals. This lineup played in Montreal on January 10, Ottawa on January 18 and four shows in Scandinavia in April and May 2014, billed together with the band Psyche. In November 2014, Rational Youth paired with Psyche to record and issue a cover of AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\", a collaborative single that credited both bands. In May 2016 Rational Youth released the EP \\"Future Past Tense\\" through Artoffact Records. In September 2016, the band appeared on the compilation, Heresy, released by Cold War Night Life. A play on the title of Heredity, Heresy also featured covers of Rational Youth tracks by eighteen artists from Canada, Norway, Britain, Sweden and Germany. Contributions included recordings by former band members, Dave Rout and Kevin Komoda, as well as collaborators Psyche. In 2019, Cold War Night Life was re-released in deluxe 2-LP and CD formats by Universal Music Canada. ==Discography== ===Singles=== * \\"I Want to See the Light/Coboloid Race\\" (12\\", 1981) * \\"Cit√© Phosphore\\" (7\\", 1982) * \\"City of Night\\" (12\\", 1982) * \\"Saturdays in Silesia\\" (7\\"/12\\", 1982) * \\"In Your Eyes\\" (7\\"/12\\", 1983) * \\"Dancing on the Berlin Wall\\" (Dutch 12\\", 1984; unauthorised extended edit) * \\"No More and No Less\\" (7\\"/12\\", 1985) - hit No. 87 on the RPM Canadian charts * \\"Call Me\\" (7\\"/12\\", 1985) - hit No. 89 on the RPM Canadian charts * \\"Bang On\\" (7\\"/12\\", 1985) - hit No. 91 in the RPM Canadian charts * \\"Malade\\" (7\\", 1985) * 3 Remixes For The New Cold War (EP, 1998) * \\"Everything Is Vapour/Money And Blood\\" (CD single, 1999) * \\"Dancing On The Berlin Wall\\" (CD single, 2010) * \\"City Of Night\\"/\\"Cite Phosphore\\" (CD single, 2011) * \\"Coboloid Race\\"/\\"I Want To See The Light\\" (30th Anniversary Edition) (CD single, 2011) * Rational Youth & Psyche: \\"Thunderstruck\\" (7\\" single, 2014) ===Albums=== ====Studio albums==== * Cold War Night Life (1982) * Rational Youth (EP) (1983) * Heredity (1985) * To the Goddess Electricity (1999) * Future Past Tense (EP) (2016) ====album==== * Live 1983 (2013) ====Compilations==== * Total Rational!

It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, Tsugaru Strait to the north and Mutsu Bay to the west and south. Shaped like an axe pointing west, the peninsula has a thin \\"axe handle\\" connecting the mountainous \\"axe blade\\" to the mainland of Honsh≈´ to the south. The peninsula contains the northernmost point on Honsh≈´, Cape ≈åma, and the largest sand dunes in Japan (the Sarugamori Sand Dunes). The peninsula owes its name to its being the lower (shimo) portion of the former Kita District (North District) of Mutsu Province before the premodern province was divided in 1868. Administratively the area is a part of Aomori Prefecture, and the bulk of the area falls within the jurisdiction of the city of Mutsu, with a number of small towns and villages along the periphery. Most of the inhabitants live in coastal areas rather than the mountainous interior. Portions of the peninsula are within the borders of Shimokita Hant≈ç Quasi- National Park, including Cape ≈åma, the coastline of the village of Sai to the south, including seaside cliffs said to resemble Buddhas at Hotokegaura, Cape Shiriya to the northeast, and the volcanic interior of the peninsula, including Mount Osore and Lake Usori. Tourist attractions include Yagen Valley, known for its hot springs. Economically, the mainstays of the local economy are commercial fishing, forestry, and seasonal tourism. The main commercial centre is the city of Mutsu. The village of Rokkasho, at the southern end of Shimokita Peninsula, home to a range of nuclear facilities. In 2012, Japan set a new world record for ocean drilling depth, reaching 2,111 meters below the seafloor off Shimokita Peninsula. Since the Eemian interglacial some 125,000 years ago the coast of the eastern tip of the peninsula has been uplifted on average 0.14‚Äì0.25 meters every thousand years (m/kyr). Slightly to the west the a north-facing sandy coast has uplift rates of 0.14‚Äì0.23 m/kyr for the same period. Further to the west, on top of the trace line of the volcanic front rates over the same period are in the order of 0.09‚Äì0.18 m/kyr. This uplift is related to the activity of offshore geological faults that has bended strata into an anticline. This peninsula is also called \\"Axe Peninsula\\" from the shape. ==See also== * Shimokita District (the peninsula proper) * Kamikita District (the isthmus connecting the peninsula to Honshu) ==External links== * (≈åmazaki: Northernmost point) * (Shiriyazaki: North-eastern point) ==References== Category:Peninsulas of Japan Category:Landforms of Aomori Prefecture Category:Mutsu, Aomori Category:Sai, Aomori Category:≈åma Kazamaura Higashid≈çri Yokohama Noheji Rokkasho ","title":"Shimokita Peninsula"},{"id":"1272552","text":"Osore Volcano is the name of a Buddhist temple and folk religion pilgrimage destination in the center of remote Shimokita Peninsula of Aomori Prefecture, in the northern T≈çhoku region of northern Japan. The temple is located in the caldera of an active volcano and is believed in Japanese mythology to be one of the gates to the underworld. ==Etymology== The mountain was once called Usoriyama by the Ainu people, but was gradually changed by the Japanese to Osore, meaning dread, which may be a statement to the sites of enshrined dead in the area. ==Mount Osore volcano== The mountain is one peak of the , a series of eight somma volcanos ranging from east to west in the centre of Shimokita Peninsula. Mount Osore has a height of . Although Mount Osore last erupted over 10,000 years ago,The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History states that an eruption occurred in 1787, but this is not corroborated by Japanese sources the area has many fumaroles emitting steam and/or volcanic gases (especially sulfur dioxide) indicating that it is still an active volcano. Lake Usori is a caldera lake at the center of Mount Osore, with highly acidic waters. During the Meiji period, sulphur deposits in the area were exploited, partly to meet the demand for gunpowder production by the growing Japanese military; however the deposits were not economical to mine due to the remoteness of the site and the increasing availability of sulphur as a byproduct of petroleum refining. ==Bodai-ji temple and pilgrimage location== The mountain is the location of a S≈çt≈ç Zen Buddhist temple, , which claims to have been founded in 862 AD by the famed monk Ennin, with Jiz≈ç Bosatsu as its main image. The temple was abandoned in 1457 and restored back to use in 1530. In popular folk religion, the otherworldly setting of Mount Osore, with its charred landscape of blasted rocks filled with bubbling pits noted for unearthly hues and noxious fumes came to be one of several places in Japan identified to be an entrance to the Underworld. A small brook running to the neighboring Lake Usori was equated to the Sanzu River, a river that deceased souls need to cross on their way to the afterlife. A unique feature of Bodai- ji is the presence of mediums known as itako who claim to summon the souls of the dead and deliver messages in their voices. These mediums were traditionally blind and had to receive extensive spiritual training and purification rituals; however, in modern times their number has dwindled and not all are blind. The temple has a twice-yearly Itako Taisai festival held in summer and autumn. The temple also maintains a hot spring resort for use by pilgrims and tourists. ===In modern culture=== The work of contemporary artist Nara Yoshitomo, who is a native of Aomori Prefecture, is believed to be influenced, if at least subconsciously, by Mount Osore (Ivy, 2010). For instance, his piece entitled ‚ÄúNot Everything But/ Green House‚Äù depicts a small female child standing over a pile of discarded dolls of varying characteristics and eras much like those observed at Mount Osore.A picture of this piece while at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in March 2009 may be seen here. As part of a collection of fictional fungi, artist Takeshi Yamada created the Oh-dokuro-dake (or ‚Äúskull mushroom‚Äù) and the story surrounding their presence on Mount Osore for his \\"center for medical mycology\\" art project. == Gallery == Image:Osorezan Aomori 01.jpgS≈çmon gate of Bodai-ji Image:Sanmon Gate of Bodai-ji Temple at Mount Osore.jpgSammon gate of Bodai- ji Image:Osorezan.jpgLake Usori Image:OsorezanEffigy.jpgEffigy of a child ==Notes== ==References== * Fackler, M.

The -bourne element is agreed to derive from Old English burna ('stream, river'), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. It is thought to occur in the names of Great and Little Missenden, and also in the Hertfordshire place-name Miswell. Frank Stenton and Allen Mawer guessed that it came from a hypothetical Anglo-Saxon personal name Myrsa, which they also supposed to be found in the name of Mursley.A. Mawer and F. M. Stenton, The Place-Names of Buckinghamshire, English Place-Name Society, 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1925). Eilert Ekwall suggested that it came from a lost Old English word related to English moss, and to Danish mysse and Swedish missne (which denote plants of the genus Calla, such as water arum).Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names, 4th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. 328 (s.v. Misbourne). Recent researchers have tentatively preferred Ekwall's guess, in which case the name Misbourne would once have meant something like 'river where water-plants/marsh-plants grow'.A. D. Mills, A Dictionary of English Place Names (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 330.Hough, Carole, 'Place-Name Evidence for Anglo- Saxon Plant-Names', in From Earth to Art, the Many Aspects of the Plant-world in Anglo-Saxon England: Proceedings of the First ASPNS Symposium, University of Glasgow, 5‚Äì7 April 2000, ed. by Carole Hough, Costerus New Series, 148 (Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2003), pp. 41-78. ==History== River Misbourne was diverted via culverts under M25 motorway. This is the downstream portal of the culvert. The railway viaduct is visible over the trees in the background. In 1906 the Great Western Railway (GWR) constructed the Chalfont Viaduct to carry trains between London and across the river. In the mid-1980s, when the M25 was being constructed, the Misbourne was diverted under the motorway via underground concrete culverts. The route of the motorway was then aligned to pass through the arches of the Chalfont Viaduct. ==Flow== The river is a 'perch' stream, flowing over a bed of impermeable material on top of a porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable since in periods of low rainfall the water table drops below the level of the impermeable layer. If groundworks are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear. The Misbourne has had intermittently reduced or stopped-flow due to abstraction for domestic supply from the aquifers feeding it. This has caused its course to be neglected to lead to partial obstruction. When the water company undertook remedial measures to restore the flow, there were episodes of flooding in both Chalfont St Peter and Chalfont St Giles. Subsequent work has restored the integrity of the course. The upper part of the river was dry for over 3 years starting in November 2003 but re- appeared in February 2007 following several months of above-average rainfall which raised the water table.Misbourne starts flowing again (Bucks Free Press article) == References == == External links == 1Misbourne Category:Rivers of Buckinghamshire Category:Amersham ","title":"River Misbourne"},{"id":"1272574","text":"The Irish Church may refer to: *Church of Ireland *Roman Catholic Church in Ireland *Presbyterian Church in Ireland ==See also== * Christianity in Ireland ","title":"Irish Church"},{"id":"1272582","text":"Chartered accountants were the first accountants to form a professional accounting body, initially established in Scotland in 1854. The Edinburgh Society of Accountants (1854), the Glasgow Institute of Accountants and Actuaries (1854) and the Aberdeen Society of Accountants (1867) were each granted a royal charter almost from their inception. The title is an internationally recognised professional designation; the certified public accountant designation is generally equivalent to it. Women were able to become chartered accountants only following the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 after which, in 1920, Mary Harris Smith was recognised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and became the first woman chartered accountant in the world. Chartered accountants work in all fields of business and finance, including auditing, taxation, financial and general management. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies. Chartered accountants' institutes require members to undertake a minimum level of continuing professional development to stay professionally competitive. They facilitate special interest groups (for instance, entertainment and media, or insolvency and restructuring) which lead in their fields. They provide support to members by offering advisory services, technical helplines and technical libraries. They also offer opportunities for professional networking, career and business development. ==Countries== === Australia === Chartered accountants of Australia belong to the Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand (CA ANZ, formerly the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia) and use the designatory letters CA. Some senior members (at least 15 years' membership) of the institute may be elected fellows and use the letters FCA. Of equal legal status and recognition in Australia as qualified professional accountants are Institute of Public Accountants (IPA) and CPA Australia. On 28 June 2016, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CA ANZ announced a strategic alliance to provide an opportunity for dual membership of both bodies, which will add value for the members locally and globally. ACCA members resident in Australia and New Zealand will be invited to apply for CA membership and CA ANZ members will be invited to apply for ACCA membership, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria of the other body. ===Bangladesh=== The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) is the national professional accounting body of Bangladesh. Established in 1973, it is the sole organization with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation in Bangladesh. Senior members (at least five years' membership) of the institute are called \\"fellow members\\" and use the letters FCA. Bangladesh has more than 1,900 registered Chartered Accountants and more than 28,000 articled students. === Belgium === The European Institute of Chartered Accountants (EICA) is incorporated in Belgium. Qualified members of the institute use designation Chartered Accountant (CA). To attain membership, the applicant needs to complete examination requirements along with practical work experience; hold a postgraduate degree in a relevant field with 7 years experience; or belong to one of a specified list of professional bodies. ===Bermuda=== The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda works with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and is the sole organisation in Bermuda with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation. === Canada === In Canada, chartered accountants belong to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) by way of membership in at least one provincial or territorial institute (or \\"order\\" in Quebec). In order to become a member, a candidate requires an undergraduate degree plus experience and, depending on the province, additional education. Candidates in all provinces are required to pass the three-day Uniform Evaluation (UFE) now Common Final Examination (CFE). Since 2012, the CICA has been in a process of unification with the other two accounting bodies in Canada. Canadian CA's, along with Certified General Accountants (CGAs) and Certified Management Accountants (CMAs), have now adopted the designation Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA), making the term \\"chartered accountant\\" obsolete. === Czech Republic === In the Czech Republic, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Czech Republic and use the designatory letters CAE (Chartered Accountant expert). Chartered Accountants may also be members of the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic (KACR), with whom the ICAEW launched its ACA qualification in 2015. === European Union === Under the Mutual Recognition Directive, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals holding a professional qualification can become members of the equivalent bodies in another member state. They must, however, pass an aptitude test in understanding local conditions (which for accountants will include local tax and company law variations). The local title is, however, not available for use if the professional does not choose to join the local professional body. For example, a holder of the French ' qualification could practise as an accountant in England without taking a local test but could only describe him or herself as \\"expert-comptable (France)\\" not \\"Chartered Accountant\\". Within the EEA, only the UK and Ireland have bodies that issue the Chartered Accountant title. ===India=== In India, Chartered Accountants are regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) which was established by the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. Associate members of the ICAI are entitled to add the prefix CA to their names. Members who are in full-time practice, and have completed five years of practice, can use FCA. As of 1 April 2019, the Institute had 291,698 members. Entry to the profession can be made by taking the CA Foundation Course after completion of schooling (12th grade). Alternatively, graduates may train as an articled assistant for three years in a chartered firm before final exam or after completion of Intermediate of Cost Accountant or Company Secretary. A comprehensive 100 hours of information technology training and an orientation programme for soft skills development have to be completed before being articled. However the CA certification is limited to the geographical boundary of India and is not valid in countries that follow different standards of accounting practice. After clearing of CA final examination, one may apply for membership to ICAI. === Ireland === In Ireland, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Chartered Accountants Ireland and use the designatory letters ACA or FCA. Chartered accountants may also be members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. === Nepal === In Nepal, the profession of Chartered Accountancy is regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN) which was established by parliament under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1997. After completion of three levels of examination (CAP I, CAP II, and CAP III) with three years of articleship training under a qualified CA, one can get the membership of ICAN and with the Certificate of Practice (COP), one can practise as a professional accountant. === New Zealand === In New Zealand, Chartered Accountants belong to the Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand (CA ANZ, formerly New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) and use the designatory letters CA. Some senior members may be elected fellows and use the letters FCA. There is also a mid-tier qualification called Associate Chartered Accountant with the designatory letters ACA. Associate chartered accountants are not eligible to hold a certificate of public practice and therefore cannot offer services to the public. === Pakistan === The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) is the professional body of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan, established on 1 July 1961 under the Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961. ICAP is the sole body and authority in Pakistan which has a mandate to regulate the accounting and auditing profession in the country. It adopts and develops the national auditing standards and develops accounting standards for the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). It represents accountants employed in public practice, business and industry, and the public sector. The Institute is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), which is the global organization for the accountancy profession. ICAP has more than 7,000 active members and more than 25,000 students. Other national accountancy bodies include Institute of cost and management accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP),https://www.icmap.com.pk PIPFA, etc. ICAP and ICMAP are full members of International federation of accountants and PIPFA is an associate member. Besides these national accountancy bodies, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) & Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) UK Bodies also has a strong presence in Pakistan. === Singapore === The Chartered Accountant of Singapore (CA (Singapore)) title is protected under the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) Act. The pathway to obtain the designation is owned by the SAC, a statutory body of the government. The Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) is a designated entity in the SAC Act and confers the CA (Singapore) designation on behalf of SAC. The Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification programme has three components: academic base, professional programme and 3 years of practical experience. ISCA and the SAC have worked to raise the profile and promote the Singapore CA Qualification for international recognition. Applicants who are eligible for the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification foundation programme should have either accredited degrees, other degrees, undergraduates and local polytechnic diplomas. Those with who are eligible for direct entry into the professional programme should have local accountancy degrees from Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Social Sciences, and Singapore Institute of Technology.

To qualify as a CA (SA), one requires a specialised bachelor's degree in accounting, followed by a Certificate in the Theory of Accounting (CTA); depending on the university, this is offered as a postgraduate honours degree or as a postgraduate diploma. This formal education is followed by two external competency exams set by SAICA. A separate registration is needed for Chartered Accountants wishing to act as auditors in public practice as a registered auditor (RA). The RA designation is conferred by IRBA (Independent Regulatory Board For Auditors, previously known as Public Accountants and Auditors Board [PAAB]) under the Auditing Profession Act (AP Act).Auditing Profession Act s37(2) Candidates must complete three years of practical experience, working for a registered training office ‚Äì the Training In Public Practice (TIPP) programme. Articled clerks who switch employers during this period are required to extend their training by six months. The Training Outside Public Practice (TOPP) programme has a financial management focus; TOPP trainees can thus become Chartered Accountants with a more limited knowledge and experience of auditing than those who undergo the TIPP programme, but with a more extensive financial management and business experience. Chartered accountants who are not registered auditors may not act as or hold out to be auditors in public practice.Auditing Profession Act s41(a) However, the AP Act does not prohibit non-RAs from using the description 'internal auditor' or 'accountant', or from auditing a not-for-profit club, institution or association if they receive no fee for such audit.Auditing Profession Act s41(3) In South Africa the Companies Act was replaced, with effect in July 2010, to allow companies without a public interest to choose between an audit or an independent review. A review is not an attest function and can be performed by accountants who are members of bodies that are registered in terms of the Close Corporations Act of 1984, which include SAIBA, CIMA, SAICA, SAIPA and ACCA. === Sri Lanka === In Sri Lanka, the title of Chartered Accountant (CA Sri Lanka) can be used by only members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. These could be Associate Members (ACA) and Fellows (FCA). Chartered accountants holding practising certificates may also become Registered Auditors, who are able to perform statutory financial audits in accordance with the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. Chartered Accountants can also register as company secretaries. === United Kingdom === The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is an awarding body, conferring the postnominals ACA and FCA.

The Whigs' key policy positions were the supremacy of Parliament (as opposed to that of the king), tolerance of Protestant dissenters and opposition to a \\"Papist\\" (Roman Catholic) on the throne, especially James II or one of his descendants.Ronald Hamowy, \\"Whiggism\\" in The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, Cato Institute 2008), , OCLC 750831024, LCCN 2008009151, DOI 10.4135/9781412965811.n328 pp 542‚Äì43 After the huge success (from the Whig point of view) of the Glorious Revolution of 1688‚Äì1689, Whiggism dominated English and British politics until about 1760, although in practice the Whig political group splintered into different factions. After 1760, the Whigs lost power ‚Äì apart from sharing it in some short-lived coalition governments ‚Äì but Whiggism fashioned itself into a generalised belief system that emphasised innovation and liberty and was strongly held by about half of the leading families in England and Scotland, as well as most merchants, dissenters, and the middle classes. The opposing Tory position was held by the other great families, the Church of England, most of the landed gentry and officers of the army and the navy. Whigs also opposed Jacobitism, a movement of traditionalists tolerant of Roman Catholicism, with substantial Tory overlaps. While in power, Whigs frequently referred to all opponents as \\"Jacobites\\" or dupes of Jacobites. Whiggism originally referred to the Whigs of the British Isles, but the name of \\"Old Whigs\\" was largely adopted by the American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies. Following independence, American Whiggism became known as republicanism. The term \\"Old Whigs\\" was also used in Great Britain for those Whigs who opposed Robert Walpole as part of the Country Party. Another meaning of whiggism given by the Oxford English Dictionary is \\"moderate or antiquated Liberalism\\".Whiggism, n. at oed.com. Retrieved 16 August 2011 (subscription required) ==Coining of \\"whiggism\\"== Quickly following the adoption of \\"whig\\" as the name of a political faction, the word \\"whiggism\\" was already in use by the 1680s. In 1682, Edmund Hickeringill published his History of Whiggism.Edmund Hickeringill, The history of Whiggism: or, The Whiggish-plots, principles, and practices, (mining and countermining the Tory-plots and principles) in the reign of King Charles the first, during the conduct of affaires, under the influence of the three great minions and favourites, Buckingham, Laud, and Strafford; and the sad forre-runners and prologues to that fatal-year (to England and Ireland) 41: Where in (as in a mirrour) is shown the face of the late (we do not say the present) times [In two parts] (London: Printed for E. Smith, at the Elephant and Castle in Cornhill, 1682) In 1702, writing satirically in the guise of a Tory, Daniel Defoe asserted: \\"We can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whiggisme, Faction, and Schism is melted down like the Old-Money\\".Daniel Defoe, The shortest way with the Dissenters: or Proposals for the establishment of the Church (1702), p. 15 The name probably originates from a shortening of Whiggamore referring to the Whiggamore Raid. ==Origins== The true origins of what became known as whiggism lie in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the power struggle between the Parliament of England and King Charles I, which eventually turned into the English Civil Wars, but only after the example of the successful use of violent opposition to the king set by the Bishops' Wars, which were fought between the same king in his capacity as king of Scotland on the one side and the Parliament of Scotland and the Church of Scotland on the other. However, the immediate origins of the Whigs and whiggism were in the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1678 to 1681, in which a \\"country party\\" battled a \\"court party\\" in an unsuccessful attempt to exclude James, Duke of York, from succeeding his brother Charles II as king of England, Scotland and Ireland. This crisis was prompted by Charles's lack of a legitimate heir, by the discovery in 1673 that James was a Roman Catholic, and by the so-called \\"Popish Plot\\" of 1678.Odai Johnson, Rehearsing the revolution (2000), p. 14 While a major principle of whiggism was opposition to popery, that was always much more than a mere religious preference in favour of Protestantism, although most Whigs did have such a preference. Sir Henry Capel outlined the principal motivation of the cry of \\"no popery\\" when he said in the House of Commons on 27 April 1679: Although they were unsuccessful in preventing the accession of the Duke of York to the throne, the Whigs in alliance with William of Orange brought him down in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. By that event, a new supremacy of parliament was established, which itself was one of the principles of whiggism, much as it had been the chief principle of the Roundheads in an earlier generation.Melinda S. Zook, Radical Whigs and conspiratorial politics in late Stuart England (1999), p. xiv The great Whiggish achievement was the Bill of Rights of 1689. It made Parliament, not the Crown, supreme. It established free elections to the Commons (although they were mostly controlled by the local landlord), free speech in parliamentary debates, and claimed to give all the king's English subjects freedom from ‚Äòcruel or unusual punishment‚Äô. Robert Blackburn, \\"Britain's unwritten constitution\\" British Library (2015) ==Variations== Title page of Sidney's Discourses Concerning Government (1698) Lee Ward (2008) argues that the philosophical origins of Whiggism came in James Tyrrell's Patriarcha Non Monarcha (1681), John Locke's Two Treatises of Government (1689) and Algernon Sidney's Discourses Concerning Government (1698).Lee Ward, The Politics of Liberty in England and Revolutionary America (Cambridge University Press, 2004) All three were united in opposing Sir Robert Filmer's defence of divine right and absolute monarchy. Tyrrell propounded a moderate Whiggism which interpreted England's balanced and mixed constitution \\"as the product of a contextualized social compact blending elements of custom, history, and prescription with inherent natural law obligations\\".Ward, p. 14 However, Sidney emphasised the main themes of republicanism and based Whig ideology in the sovereignty of the people by proposing a constitutional reordering that would both elevate the authority of Parliament and democratise its forms. Sidney also emphasised classical republican notions of virtue.Ward, ch. 6 Ward says that Locke's liberal Whiggism rested on a radically individualist theory of natural rights and limited government.Ward, ch. 8‚Äì9 Tyrrell's moderate position came to dominate Whiggism and British constitutionalism as a whole from 1688 to the 1770s.Ward, ch. 11 The more radical ideas of Sidney and Locke, argues Ward, became marginalised in Britain, but emerged as a dominant strand in American republicanism. The issues raised by the Americans, starting with the Stamp Act crisis of 1765, ripped Whiggism apart in a battle of parliamentary sovereignty (Tyrrell) versus popular sovereignty (Sidney and Locke).Ward, pp. 327‚Äì50 ==Across the British Empire== Whiggism took different forms in England and Scotland, even though from 1707 the two nations shared a single parliament.Jonathan Hearn, Claiming Scotland: national identity and liberal culture (2000), p. 138 While English whiggism had at its heart the power of parliament, creating for that purpose a constitutional monarchy and a permanently Protestant succession to the throne, Scottish Whigs gave a higher priority to using power for religious purposes, including maintaining the authority of the Church of Scotland, justifying the Protestant Reformation and emulating the Covenanters. There were also Whigs in the North American colonies and while whiggism there had much in common with that in Great Britain, it too had its own priorities. In the unfolding of the American Revolution such whiggism became known as republicanism.George Herbert Guttridge, English whiggism and the American revolution (1974), pp. 10, 68 In India, Prashad (1966) argues that the profound influence of the ideas of Edmund Burke introduced Whiggism into the mainstream of Indian political thought. The Indians adopted the basic assumptions of Whiggism, especially the natural leadership of an elite, the political incapacity of the masses, the great partnership of the civil society and the best methods of achieving social progress, analysing the nature of society and the nation and depicting the character of the ideal state.Ganesh Prashad, \\"Whiggism in India,\\" Political Science Quarterly Vol. 81, No. 3 (Sep. 1966), pp. 412‚Äì31 in JSTOR ==Further reading== * Carswell, John, The Old Cause: Three Biographical Studies in Whiggism (London: The Cresset Press, 1954) online text, deals with Thomas Wharton, George Dodington, and Charles James Fox * H.

In 1625, he built Renishaw Hall which is now owned by Sir Reresby Sitwell's daughter, Alexandra and her family. Sitwell exploited the minerals beneath his estate, chiefly iron and built a blast furnace at Plumbley a mile north west of Eckington in the 1630s with his mother's second husband, Henry Wigfall. In 1652 Sitwell built a furnace at Foxbrooke, close to Renishaw, which became the core of the largest ironworks in Derbyshire. Sitwell made saws at Pleasley and in 1656, installed a rolling and slitting mill at Renishaw to supply the rod iron used by numerous local nailmakers. During the Industrial Revolution coal and iron ore were mined and local streams, such as the Moss Brook, were harnessed to provide power for factories. The Sitwells built a large foundry and ironworks. Scythes, sickles and nails were made in the town for local use and for export. The Moss Brook was dammed to provide water power at eight sites including ChapelWheel, Carlton Wheel and Fields Wheel, to grind the blades. The remains of an old forge and drift mines exist in the valley. Eckington had a coal mine in the eastern part of the town, one of the very few in the country which is still operated. ==Governance== Historically, Eckington was an ecclesiastical parish in the hundred of Scarsdale in Derbyshire.

In 1944, the sisters formed the Convent of the Annunciation. In 1947 it was renamed Annunciation Priory. ===First Buildings=== Architect Marcel Breuer designed the college's original campus (c. 1955) In the early 1950s, Annunciation Priory requested that modernist architect Marcel Breuer design a new campus. At the time, Breuer was finishing the new abbey and several university buildings at Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville in Minnesota. In 1955, Breuer accepted the commission only after visiting the site, meeting with the sisters, and being \\"overwhelmed by the power and presence of the landscape setting and the mission.\\" Breuer's designs used native granite prairie stone, complex concrete shapes, and a juxtaposition light and shadow. The first buildings were a convent, dining hall, and classrooms. The school was officially founded as a women's college in 1959 as Mary College. Our Lady of the Annunciation Chapel was consecrated in 1963 in the second phase of construction. As the school grew, it endeavored to preserve the spirit of Breuer's modernist prairie architecture while implementing new programs and new buildings by lesser-known architects. === Coeducation and University Status === Mary College rapidly expanded and became fully co-educational in the 1960s. It achieved university status ‚Äî becoming the University of Mary ‚Äî in 1986. The University of Mary is the only private, Catholic university in North Dakota.

Its undergraduate programs have grown from nursing and education to 65+ degrees, ranging from accounting to Catholic studies. In 1986, the university began offering master's degrees in nursing, management, and education. It has added master's programs in business administration, counseling, occupational therapy, physical therapy, public administration, project management, clinical exercise physiology, kinesiology, speech-language pathology, music, Catholic studies, and bioethics. Doctorates are currently offered in education, nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. ===2000 and later=== In 2001, the University of Mary unveiled its vision as \\"America's Leadership University.\\" In 2005, the master's degree in physical therapy was replaced by a Doctor of Physical Therapy ‚Äî the university's first doctorate. The first 26 candidates in this program received their entry-level clinical doctorate in 2006. Since then, doctorates have been added in Education, Nursing, and Occupational Therapy. The University of Mary has expanded options in order to make education accessible to working adults and to support lifelong learning in the region and beyond. The University of Mary Online offers accelerated undergraduate and graduate programs for the adult learner. Today, the University of Mary has 14 satellite campuses in the Upper Midwest and beyond, including the Butler Center in downtown Bismarck, Fargo Center in Fargo, North Dakota, and Billings Center in Billings, Montana. Since 2005, the University of Mary has offered bachelor's and master's programs online. In 2006, UMary initiated the Gary Tharaldson School of Business. Named for Gary Tharaldson, a North Dakota hospitality entrepreneur and industry innovator, the new school was designed to bridge the gap between the academic and business world. The flagship facility that houses the Gary Tharaldson School opened in September 2008. From the fall of 2009 to the Spring of 2010, the University of Mary searched for a facility as the base for its Rome, Italy program. It found one a ten-minute bus ride from the city center. The first students to study in this Rome program left the United States in the Fall of 2010. The Catholic Studies Program, an initiative of UMary President Monsignor James P. Shea, was also launched in the fall of 2010. On October 19, 2010, the program was named in honor of Bishop Paul Albert Zipfel, sixth bishop of the Diocese of Bismarck, North Dakota. The Catholic Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program designed to explore the Catholic Church's contributions to and influence on human thought and culture, past and present. The program invites students of any faith who wish to deepen their knowledge of Catholicism's rich history and living tradition. With a full-time faculty and staff of more than 300, the University of Mary remains committed to continuing the mission of its founding Sisters: serving the people of the region in a spirit that fosters servant-leadership, preparing leaders in the service of truth. ==Campus== A portion of the University of Mary's main campus, seen from the east, overlooking the Missouri River valley The University of Mary is a rural campus located about south of Bismarck and was built on a high prairie bluff overlooking the \\"Capital City.\\" The campus includes 24 buildings. Several of the original buildings on campus were designed by architect Marcel Breuer. The Harold Schafer Leadership Center is home to a leadership program that the university offers. The upper floor usually holds conferences and meetings while the lower floor is home to IT training centers. The Benedictine Center for Servant Leadership is one of the oldest buildings on campus, since it previously served as the library and a priory for the Sisters. It primarily houses the university's administrative offices, including the Offices of the President, Academic Affairs, Undergraduate Admissions, UMary Online, Public Affairs, Financial Aid, the Registrar, Student Accounts, Student Success Center, Student Development, Career and Testing Services, M-Card Office, and the Business Office. It is also home to the Liffrig School of Education and Behavioral Sciences, three residence halls (below), and the Hauer Family Theater. St. Joseph's Hall for Men is a men's faith-based residence hall. Boniface Hall is a women's residence hall. St. Scholastica's Hall for Women is a women's faith-based residence hall. Roers Hall is a freshman women's residence housing the Saint Scholastica community on its third floor. Welder Library was built in 1990 and is named for the university's president emerita, Sister Thomas Welder. The library houses 61,000 print volumes, more than 340,000 eBooks, 3,600 multimedia items, and databases providing access to over 60,000 journals. The library building is also home to the humanities division of the School of Arts and Sciences. Greg Butler Hall is a women's residence hall located just southeast of the Welder Library. Hillside Hall is a women's residence hall located just northeast of the Welder Library. An outdoor track and baseball field are located east of both halls. The McDowell Activity Center (MAC) is the center of the athletics department and includes offices and lockers on the lower level and a weight room. The main use for this center is for the men's and women's basketball teams and the women's volleyball team. The McDowell Activity Center is located just north of Hillside Hall. The Tschider Center for Health Sciences occupies one wing of this building, and provides both office and classroom space for the human performance programs. The Lumen Vitae University Center (LVUC) serves as a community gathering space for students and faculty. The campus restaurant, the Crow's Nest, offers 24/7 dining. The Bookstore and Marauders Mart are located near the Crow's Nest. The Harold J. Miller Center is one of the oldest buildings on campus and houses science, math, occupational therapy, and a computer lab. This building is connected to the east side of University Hall. Arno Gustin Hall includes the main auditorium for the campus The Clairmont Center houses the music department as well as some classrooms and Heskett Hall, which is a small performing stage and home to a few lecture classes. The Casey Center for Nursing Education houses the nursing and physical therapy departments. In addition, the information desk is located here as well as a lounge just east of the information area. Tennis courts are accessible just outside the north end of this part of the building. In addition, there are practice fields for football, softball, soccer, track & field, and baseball on campus. On April 25, 2019, construction began on the new school of engineering which will be housed in the renovated University Hall. Deichert and Boyle Halls are student apartments located at the far north end of campus. Just beyond Deichert Hall, on the northernmost side of campus, lie \\"The Cloisters.\\" The Cloisters is available to only upper and graduate level students. The Cloisters consists of three buildings, two suite-styled apartments and a student commons/campus pub. The two apartments are named after the Benedictine heritage sites Subiaco (women's) and Monte Cassino (men's). The student commons/campus pub is named \\"Chesterton's,\\" in honor of the famous Christian essayist of the 20th century, G.K. Chesterton.

The rune survives in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc as ƒíoh \\"yew\\" (note that eoh \\"horse\\" has a short diphthong). ƒíoh could behave as both a vowel (perhaps /iÀê/), and as a consonant (in the range of /x ~ √ß/). As a vowel, ƒíoh shows up in j√Øslheard (·õ°·õá·õã·õö·öª·õ†·ö±·õû) on the Dover Stone. As a consonant, ƒíoh shows up in alme√Øttig (·ö™·õö·õó·õñ·õá·õè·õè·õÅ·ö∑) on the Ruthwell Cross. It is commonly transliterated as √Ø. Although seemingly redundant in extant inscriptions, it is theorized that the rune may have originally stood for a long vowel somewhere around , continuing Proto-Indo-European language *. Another theory postulates the rune was originally a bindrune of ·õÅ and ·õÉ, having the value of /ji/ and /ij/. Two variants of the word are reconstructed for Proto-Germanic, *ƒ´haz (*ƒì2haz, PIE *), continued in Old English as ƒìoh (also ƒ´h), and *ƒ´waz (*ƒì2waz, Proto-Indo- European *), continued in Old English as ƒ´w (whence yew). The latter is possibly an early loan from the Celtic, compare Gaulish ivos, Breton ivin, Welsh ywen, Old Irish ƒìo. The common spelling of the rune's name, \\"Eihwaz\\", combines the two variants; strictly based on the Old English evidence, a spelling \\"Eihaz\\" would be more proper. The Anglo-Saxon rune poem: : Eoh by√æ utan unsme√æe treo∆ø, : heard hrusan f√¶st, hyrde fyres, : ∆øyrtrumun under∆øre√æyd, ∆øyn on e√æle. : The yew is a tree with rough bark, : hard and fast in the earth, supported by its roots, : a guardian of flame and a joy upon an estate. The rune is not to be confused with the Sowilo rune, which has a somewhat similar shape, or with Ehwaz, the rune expressing short e or ƒì1. In the Younger Futhark, there is the terminal -R rune Yr \\"yew\\", but neither its shape nor its sound is related to the Eihwaz rune: it is, rather, a continuation of Algiz. ==See also== * Wolfsangel ==References== Category:Runes ","title":"Eihwaz"},{"id":"1272618","text":"American Hockey League (now NHL) referee Dean Morton In ice hockey, an official is a person who has some responsibility in enforcing the rules and maintaining the order of the game. There are two categories of officials, on- ice officials, who are the referees and linesmen that enforce the rules during game play, and off-ice officials, who have an administrative role rather than an enforcement role. == On-ice officials == An official about to drop the puck during a faceoff. As the name implies, on-ice officials do their job on the hockey rink. They are traditionally clad in a black hockey helmet, black trousers, and a black-and-white vertically striped shirt. They wear standard hockey skates and carry a finger whistle, which they use to stop play. They communicate with players, coaches, off-ice officials, both verbally and via hand signals. Starting in 1955 with the introduction of the black-and-white jersey, NHL on-ice officials wore numbers on their back for identification. In 1977, NHL officials removed the number and had only their surnames on the back of their jerseys for identification, normally in a single row across the shoulders. (Some officials with long names would have their name in two rows, the most notable example being Andy Van Hellemond.) However, in 1994, NHL officials returned to wearing solely numbers on their shirts, a procedure adopted by other sports leagues. In the early days of hockey when the NHL was formed (1917), the referees would be clad in a vest and tie along with their pants and carry a bell, not a whistle, to stop the game in progress. In those days, penalties were assessed more on common sense rather than following strict rules, and the official would deem what was allowed and not, as well as the length of the penalties. Later, NHL referees wore cream-colored sweaters over a shirt and tie, from the 1930s to the early 1950s. They then briefly wore orange sweaters with half-zip fronts (and without neckties), until the black-and-white-striped jersey was introduced in 1955. === Referees === A referee is responsible for the general supervision of the game and can be identified by the red or orange armbands. Under most officiating systems, the referee is the only official with the authority to assess penalties for violations of the rules. However, the linesmen can report a variety of penalties, such as Too many men on the ice and major penalties, to the referee, who may then assess the penalty. The referee also conducts the opening face-off in each period and face-offs that follow after a goal is scored, which are done at the centre ice face-off dot. === Linesmen === Linesmen are primarily responsible for watching for violations involving the centre line and the blue line. Such infractions include icing and offside, after which the linesmen conduct faceoffs. They are also expected to break up scuffles, fistfights and other altercations that occur during the game. In some leagues, the rules allow linesmen to call some penalties (such as Too many men on the ice), while others only allow them to report the infraction to the referee. ==== Assistant referees ==== In some leagues, the linesmen are given the title of assistant referee. When given this title, they are given more responsibility to stop play and to call penalties that the referee may not see. The NCAA previously used this designation prior to altering its officiating systems in 2006. === On-ice officiating systems === * The three- official system uses one referee and two linesmen. This is the most commonly used system. The NHL previously used this system until changing to the four- official system in the late 1990s. The highest level for this system is the ECHL, which does official development for the NHL. These officials are working in a four-official system; the two middle officials are the referees, identifiable by their orange armbands * The four-official system adds a second referee for a total of two referees and two linesmen. In this system, each referee works either the lead/front or the trail/back position. The lead position is normally in corner of the end zone, while the trail position is the neutral zone, diagonally opposite each other. As the game transitions from one end of the ice to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. The four-official system is used in the NHL, AHL, and at other high levels, such as major junior, junior 'A', and top European leagues. In 2007-2008, college hockey used the system in some games on a trial basis.College men's hockey: Early reviews favor ref experiment Duluth News Tribune (October 25, 2007) The IIHF first implemented this system for men‚Äôs games at the 2008 IIHF World ChampionshipIIHF.com-2010 Olympic Format decided and for women‚Äôs games at the 2014‚Äì15 IIHF European Women's Champions Cup; the four-man officiating system has subsequently been the standard in IIHF competition. The NCAA voted in July 2012 to make the four-official system mandatory for men's games starting in the 2013-14 season. * In the two-official system, each official acts as both referee and linesman. Each official has the responsibility to call both penalties and line violations. In this system, neither official wears red or orange armbands or both will wear one armband each. This is used at lower levels of youth hockey and in most adult recreational leagues. * In the 2-1 system (the least common of the on-ice official systems), also called the modified three-man, there are two referees and one linesman. There are a variety of ways to divide the responsibilities between the referees and linesmen. Typically, the back referee is responsible for making the initial call at the blue line when the puck first enters the zone, and after that the linesman takes over. This system is currently being used in Division III NCAA levels in the United States, and in National Federation of State High School Associations sanctioned games. * The 1-1 system (sometimes called Texas two- man) uses one referee and one linesman. This is usually seen in adult recreational leagues (sometimes called \\"beer league\\" - C, D and I divisions) as a cost-saving measure; the pace of play at this level is typically slow enough for the two officials to cover events between them. This can also be an informal system used ad hoc when one of the officials does not show up for a game scheduled to use the three-official system, or when an official is hurt during a game. The referee in this system also has the duties of a linesman. * Beginner-level adult leagues sometimes will only use a single on-ice official who is responsible for calling line violations and penalties. The official will not usually wear orange or red armbands in this system. == Off-ice officials == Off-ice officials, with the exception of the video goal judge in professional leagues, do not have any direct impact on the outcome of the game. They serve primarily administrative and advisory roles. === Goal judge === The goal judge determines whether a player has scored a goal by watching to see if the puck has crossed the goal line completely. They act only in an advisory role; the referee has the sole authority to award goals, and thus can override the opinion of the goal judge. One goal judge is positioned outside the rink directly behind each goal net. For arenas so equipped, the goal judge turns on a red light behind the goal to signal a score. The red goal light, and the adjacent green light are connected to the arena game clock. When the clock operator stops the clock, or the time remaining expires, the red light is not able to be activated. In the NHL, the green light is activated only when the game clock reads 00.0 seconds: in lower levels the green light may be linked to the scoreboard's siren or turn on whenever time is stopped. In games governed by the IIHF, goal judges wear the same black-and-white striped shirts as on-ice officials. This is not the case for goal judges in North America for games under different hockey codes: their goal judges are usually dressed in apparel bearing a league or hockey association logo, such as sport coats or athletic jackets. In the mid 2000s, the National Hockey League relocated goal judges to higher locations (most commonly the press box, a catwalk or the lower section of the upper deck) with wireless signals. The idea was to allow teams to sell the prime seats, but also to give officials a better view of the action as to be able to reject goals if violations (illegally kicked in, player in the crease, offside) took place. However, with the expansion of video replay and the addition of a second referee on the ice, the role of the goal judge became relegated to activating the goal lights. The league ceased using goal judges after the 2018‚Äì2019 season. The video goal judge now activates the goal lights from the video replay booth. Goal judges were first used around 1877 in Montreal, and were initially called umpires. === Video goal judge === The video goal judge reviews replays of disputed goals. As the referee does not have access to television monitors, the video goal judge's decision in disputed goals is taken as final. In the NHL, goals may only be reviewed in the following situations: puck crossing the goal line completely and before time expired, puck in the net prior to goal frame being dislodged, puck being directed into the net by hand or foot, puck deflected into the net off an official, and puck deflected into the goal by a high stick (stick above the goal) by an attacking player. All NHL goals are subject to review, and although most arenas have a video goal judge, officials from the NHL Hockey Operations Department, located in the Situation Room (also known as the \\"War Room\\") at the NHL office in Toronto, will often make the final decision. Arena video goal judges are used in case the communication link with Toronto is not working, and also for other situations such as timing or proper statistic attribution. === Official scorer === The official scorer keeps the official record of the game. He is responsible for obtaining a list of eligible players from both teams prior to the start of the game. He awards points for goals and assists, and his decision in this regard is final. The official scorer typically sits in an elevated position away from the edge of the rink. === Penalty timekeeper === The penalty timekeeper records the penalties imposed by the referee. He is responsible for ensuring that the correct penalty times are posted on the score clock and that players leave the penalty box at the appropriate times. === Game timekeeper === The game timekeeper is responsible for stopping and starting the game clock. === Statistician === The statistician records all required data concerning individual and team performances. == See also == * Director of Officiating (NHL) * List of NHL on- ice officials * Hockey Canada Officiating Program == References == == External links == * Hockey Referee HQ * HockeyOfficials.com * HockeyRefs.com * National Association of Sports Officials * NHL Officials Association * Hockey Canada Officiating Program * USA Hockey Officiating Program * National Ice Hockey Officials Association * Ice Hockey Australia Officiating Program * Norwegian Ice Hockey Officials Club * Swiss Hockey Officials * Belgian Referee Commission * Danish Ice Hockey Officials Club * French Referee Commission * German Hockey Officiating * Off-Ice Officials at Michigan State University * Wasatch Ice Hockey Officials Association * Atlantic Amateur Hockey Association Officiating Program * Eastern Collegiate Officials Association * Mid-Atlantic Hockey Officials Association * Metro New York / New Jersey Chapter of the National Ice Hockey Officials Association * Northeast Ice Hockey Officials Association Category:Sports officiating ","title":"Official (ice hockey)"},{"id":"1272619","text":"Eckington is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C., located south of the Prospect Hill and Glenwood Cemeteries. Eckington is less than southeast of Howard University and exactly one mile north of the United States Capitol. Eckington is also the home of the District of Columbia office of Sirius XM Radio. Eckington is bordered by: *Rhode Island Avenue and the Edgewood neighborhood to the north *North Capitol Street and the Bloomingdale neighborhood to the west *Florida Avenue and the Truxton Circle and NoMa neighborhoods to the south and *The Metro rail Red Line and the Metro's Brentwood Yard to the east The closest metro stations serving Eckington are NoMa‚ÄìGallaudet U Station, located south of Eckington, and Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood Station, located northeast of Eckington. ==History== The land which became Eckington was the country home of Joseph Gales, Jr., owner of the National Intelligencer and mayor of Washington from 1827 to 1830. Gales bought the Northeast tract in 1815, and in 1830 erected a two-story house on the hilltop, about where Third and U Streets intersect today. Gales named his estate Eckington after The Village in England in which he was born. During the American Civil War, the house was used as a hospital for the 7th Regiment of New York. After the war, Eckington, commonly known as Gales Woods, was a popular picnic ground. In 1887, Eckington was bought by George Truesdell and his wife Frances, who subdivided the property, improved it substantially for habitation, sold lots, and built several houses. Truesdell undertook extensive grading operations to level the landscape of his Eckington subdivision. He laid down water and sewer pipes, paved streets in asphalt and concrete, and erected a stand pipe near the old Gales house. A steam pump brought water to the stand pipe, which distributed water throughout the new neighborhood. Truesdell erected five \\"pretty cottages\\" which, according to an 1888 newspaper account, were \\"all fitted up as city houses,\\" with steam heat and hot and cold running water. Eckington was wired for electricity in 1889, two years before electricity was installed in the White House. In three years, Truesdell spent $500,000 improving the subdivision. The contractor for Truesdell's houses was John H. Lane, who moved from Dupont Circle into one of those houses at 1725 Third Street. From 1889 to 1897, Lane developed nearly 20 properties in Eckington. None of Truesdell's original five houses exists today, although several detached houses from the late 19th century, by Lane and others, dot the streets of Eckington. The first three decades of the 20th century brought a boom in rowhouse construction to Eckington as it did in many parts of the District of Columbia. Truesdell placed restrictive covenants in the deeds of Eckington's residential properties that required that each house cost at least $2,000 and be set back from the building line. There was to be no manufacturing. The Union Army veteran did not place racial restrictions in the deeds, although as late as 1930, there were no African American families living in Eckington. The Eckington & Soldiers Home Railway Company began service on October 17, 1888. It was Washington's first electric railway and followed by just a few months the first practical electric railway in Richmond, Virginia. The line ran from Seventh Street and New York Avenue NW to Fourth and T Streets NE in Eckington, then was extended in 1889, up Fourth Street to Michigan Avenue and The Catholic University of America. Col. Truesdell's subdivision straddled the narrow tracks of the Metropolitan Branch of the B&O; Railroad. The Met Branch was a line that brought commuters into the city from Maryland beginning in 1873. In 1888, the B&O; bought just north of Florida Avenue and built a passenger station. Passengers were to disembark and ride the new electric line into the city. A few years later, the B&O; built a huge freight depot next to the passenger station. This freight center spurred the development of manufacturing and warehousing along the west side of the tracks from Florida Avenue north to Rhode Island Avenue, Truesdell's covenants notwithstanding. The National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) was at 4th and S Streets and Judd and Detweiler printers was at Florida Avenue and Eckington Place. There were as many as 20 warehouses, mostly for groceries and home and building supplies. When the tracks were greatly expanded after the construction of Union Station, the east side of Eckington disappeared under them, including two of Truesdell's original houses. In 1907, a bridge at 4th and T St. NE was built over the tracks to connect Eckington with the Brentwood neighborhood to the east. It was designed to carry motor traffic and pedestrians. A trolley connection at the west end of the bridge stopped in 1962, and the bridge was demolished in the late 1960s.http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/29893/a-bridge-used-to-connect- eckington-and-brentwood/ Although the streetcar had been a community center for both Eckington and Bloomingdale, the adjacent neighborhood to the west, after the streetcar line was removed in the 1950s North Capitol Street was dug into a trench to facilitate high-speed, high-volume traffic. The entrenched highway created a stark separation between Eckington from Bloomingdale. North Capitol Street remains noisy and difficult to cross; this, along with the railroad tracks on its east, gives Eckington its relatively isolated quality. ==References== == External links == * Eckington History Brochure * Reports Debate Congressional Record * Congressional Cemetery Obituaries * Officials Probe Eckington Streetcar Disaster Category:Neighborhoods in Northeast (Washington, D.C.)

From 18 April 2004 to 20 October 2010, she was the first deputy prime minister, minister of the Presidency and cabinet spokesperson in the government of Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero.Ministry of Presidency - First Vice Presidency of the Government of Spain She is the first female deputy prime minister and president of the Council of State in Spanish history. ==Early life and career== Fern√°ndez de la Vega is the daughter of Wenceslao Fern√°ndez de la Vega Lomb√°n who was a public servant during Franco's dictatorship, a delegate of the ministry of employment headed at that time by Ferm√≠n Sanz Orrio (1957‚Äì1962). She was born in Valencia in 1949. She earned a degree in law from the Complutense University of Madrid in the early 1970s. In 1974 she entered Spain's Cuerpo de Secretarios Jur√≠dicos Laborales, a specialised body of the civil service. ==Political career== Fern√°ndez de la Vega started her political career in the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, remaining a member of it until 1979. From 1982 until 1985, she was the director of the advisory cabinet of the minister of justice, and in 1985 she was appointed general director of services at the ministry of justice. In 1986 she became a member of the legal cooperation committee of the Council of Europe. In 1990, she was chosen as a spokesperson of the general council of judicial power by the Senate (1994‚Äì1996). On 13 May 1994, the then Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch appointed her as the 1st Secretary of State for Justice. Fern√°ndez de la Vega was elected a member of the Spanish Congress for Ja√©n for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party candidacy for the 1996-2000 term, being re-elected in the elections of 2000 for Segovia. During this term she became general secretary of the Socialist parliamentary group. In the Spanish general election of 2004 she became a member of the parliament for Madrid, and on 18 April of that year she was appointed first vice president and minister of Presidency, remaining the incumbent of each. Fern√°ndez de la Vega was the first woman to take on the functions of the prime minister in the history of Spanish democracy, when, on 24 April 2004, during the first official visit abroad of Spain's Prime Minister, Zapatero, she presided over the Council of Ministers. In March 2006, the first vice president went on an African tour with the state secretary for cooperation, Leire Paj√≠n, visiting Kenya and Mozambique, in whose capital, Maputo, they celebrated International Women's Day and closed the forum \\"Spain-Africa: Women for a better world\\". For the 2008 elections, Fern√°ndez de la Vega headed the list for the PSOE in Valencia. She left all the political offices in October 2010. == President of the Council of State == After leaving the first political line, on July 3, 2018, prime minister Pedro S√°nchez chose her to chair over the Council of State, the supreme consultative council of the Spanish government. She assumed the office on July 5, 2018, becoming the first woman to chair the Council. ==Other activities== * Judges for Democracy (Jueces para la Democracia), Member * Graduate School for Global and International Studies, University of Salamanca, Member of the Advisory BoardAdvisory Council Graduate School for Global and International Studies, University of Salamanca.

The precise conditions vary from language to language, and can be quite intricate. The phenomenon of \\"pronoun-dropping\\" is also commonly referred to as zero or null anaphora. In the case of pro-drop languages, null anaphora refers to the fact that the null position has referential properties, meaning it is not a null dummy pronoun. Pro-drop is only licensed in languages that have a positive setting of the pro-drop parameter, which allows the null element to be identified by its governor. In pro-drop languages with a highly inflected verbal morphology, the expression of the subject pronoun is considered unnecessary because the verbal inflection indicates the person and number of the subject, thus the referent of the null subject can be inferred from the grammatical inflection on the verb. Even though in everyday speech there are instances when who or what is being referred to can be inferred from context, non-pro-drop languages still require the pronoun. However, pro-drop languages allow those referential pronouns to be omitted, or be phonologically null. Among major languages, two which might be called pro-drop languages are Japanese and Korean (featuring pronoun deletion not only for subjects, but for practically all grammatical contexts). Chinese, Slavic languages, Summary. American Sign Language and Vietnamese also exhibit frequent pro-drop features. In contrast, non-pro-drop is an areal feature of many northern European languages (see Standard Average European), including French, (standard) German, EnglishMartin Haspelmath, The European linguistic area: Standard Average European, in Martin Haspelmath, et al., Language Typology and Language Universals, vol. 2, 2001, pp. 1492-1510 and Emilian.Fabio Foresti, Dialetti emiliano-romagnoli, Enciclopedia Treccani All languages might be considered only partially pro-drop in that they allow deletion of the subject pronoun. These null-subject languages include most Romance languages (French is an exception) as well as all the Balto-Slavic languages and to a limited extent Icelandic. Colloquial and dialectal German, unlike the standard language, are also partially pro-drop; they typically allow deletion of the subject pronoun in main clauses without inversion, but not otherwise. Hungarian allows deletion of both the subject and object pronouns. ==History of the term== The term \\"pro-drop\\" stems from Noam Chomsky's \\"Lectures on Government and Binding\\" from 1981 as a cluster of properties of which \\"null subject\\" was one (for the occurrence of pro as a predicate rather than a subject in sentences with the copula see Moro 1997). Thus, a one-way correlation was suggested between inflectional agreement (AGR) and empty pronouns on the one hand and between no agreement and overt pronouns, on the other. In the classical version, languages which not only lack agreement morphology but also allow extensive dropping of pronouns‚Äîsuch as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese‚Äîare not included, as is made clear in a footnote: \\"The principle suggested is fairly general, but does not apply to such languages as Japanese in which pronouns can be missing much more freely.\\" (Chomsky 1981:284, fn 47). The term pro-drop is also used in other frameworks in generative grammar, such as in lexical functional grammar (LFG), but in a more general sense: \\"Pro-drop is a widespread linguistic phenomenon in which, under certain conditions, a structural NP may be unexpressed, giving rise to a pronominal interpretation.\\" (Bresnan 1982:384). The empty category assumed (under government and binding theory) to be present in the vacant subject position left by pro-dropping is known as pro, or as \\"little pro\\" (to distinguish it from \\"big PRO\\", an empty category associated with non-finite verb phrases).R.L. Trask, A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics, Routledge 2013, p. 218. ==Examples== === Japanese === Consider the following examples from Japanese: : :Kono kƒìki wa oishii. Dare ga yaita no? :This cake TOPIC tasty-PRESENT. Who SUBJECT bake-PAST EXPLAIN.? :\\"This cake is tasty. Who baked it?\\" : :Shiranai. Ki ni itta? :know-NEGATIVE. like-PAST? :\\"I don't know. Did you like it?\\" The words in bold in the English translations (it in the first line; I, you, and it in the second) appear nowhere in the Japanese sentences but are understood from context. If nouns or pronouns were supplied, the resulting sentences would be grammatically correct but sound unnatural. (Learners of Japanese as a second language, especially those whose first language is non-pro-drop like English or French, often supply personal pronouns where they are pragmatically inferable, an example of language transfer.) === Chinese === The above-mentioned examples from Japanese are readily rendered into Chinese: : :Zh√® ku√†i d√†ngƒÅo hƒõn h«éochƒ´. She√≠ k«éo de? :This piece cake DEGREE tasty. Who bake-MODIFY? :\\"This cake is tasty. Who baked it?\\" : :B√π zhƒ´d√†o. X«êhuan ma? :Not know. like QUESTION-YES/NO? :\\"I don't know. Do you like it?\\" Unlike in Japanese, the inclusion of the dropped pronouns does not make the sentence sound unnatural. ===Arabic=== Arabic is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example: :ÿ≥ÿßÿπÿØ ÿ∫Ÿäÿ±ŸÉÿå Ÿäÿ≥ÿßÿπÿØŸÉ :sƒÅ ªid ghayrak, yusƒÅ ªiduk. :Help other, help.PST.3SG you. :If you help another, he helps you. === Turkish === :Sen-i g√∂r-d√º-m :2SG-ACC see-PST-1SG :I saw you. The subject \\"I\\" above is easily inferable as the verb g√∂r-mek \\"to see\\" is conjugated in the first person simple past tense form. The object is indicated by the pronoun seni in this case. Strictly speaking, pronominal objects are generally explicitly indicated, although frequently possessive suffixes indicate the equivalent of an object in English, as in the following sentence. :Gel-diƒü-im-i g√∂r-d√º-n m√º? :come-NMLZ-POS.1SG-ACC see- PST-2SG Q :Did you see me coming? In this sentence, the object of the verb is actually the action of coming performed by the speaker (geldiƒüimi \\"my coming\\"), but the object in the English sentence, \\"me\\", is indicated here by the possessive suffix -im \\"my\\" on the nominalised verb. Both pronouns can be explicitly indicated in the sentence for purposes of emphasis, as follows: :Sen ben-im gel-diƒü-im-i g√∂r-d√º-n m√º? :2SG 1SG-POSS come-\\"ing\\"-POS.1SG-ACC see-PST-2SG Q :Did you see me coming? === Swahili === In Swahili, both subject and object pronouns can be omitted as they are indicated by verbal prefixes. :Ni-ta-ku-saidia. :SUBJ.1SG'-FUT-OBJ.2SG-help :I will help you. ===English=== English is not a pro-drop language. Nonetheless, subject pronouns are almost always dropped in imperative sentences (e.g., Come here), with the subject \\"you\\" understood or communicated non-verbally.Geoffrey K. Pullum, Rodney Huddleston, A Student's Introduction to English Grammar, 2005, , p. 170 In informal speech, the pronominal subject is sometimes dropped. This ellipsis has been called \\"conversational deletion\\" and \\"left-edge deletion\\",Randolph H. Thrasher, Shouldn't ignore these strings: A study of conversational deletion, PhD dissertation, 1974, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (not seen)Randolph H. Thrasher, \\"One way to say more by saying less: A study of so-called subjectless sentences\\", 1977, Kwansei Gakuin University Monograph Series 11 Tokyo: Eihosha (not seen) and is common in informal spoken English as well as certain registers of written English, notably diaries.Andrew Weir, \\"Left-edge deletion in English and subject omission in diaries\\", English Language & Linguistics 16:1:105-129 (March 2012) Most commonly, it is the first person singular subject which is dropped.Susanne Wagner, \\"Never saw one ‚Äì first- person null subjects in spoken English\\", English Language and Linguistics 22:1:1-34 (March 2018) Some other words, especially copulas and auxiliaries, can also be dropped. *[Have you] ever been there? *[I'm] going to the shops. [Do you] want to come? *[I] haven't been there yet. [I'm] going later. *Seen on signs: [I am/We are] out to lunch; [I/we will be] back at 1:00 [P.M]. *What do you think [of it]? ‚Äì I like [it]! (the latter only in some dialects and registers) *[Do you] want a piece of cake? In speech, when pronouns are not dropped, they are more often reduced than other words in an utterance. Relative pronouns, provided they are not the subject, are often dropped in short restrictive clauses: That's the man [whom] I saw. The dropping of pronouns is generally restricted to very informal speech and certain fixed expressions, and the rules for their use are complex and vary among dialects and registers. A noted instance was the \\"lived the dream\\" section of George H. W. Bush's speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. ==Null-subject languages== === Modern Greek === Subject pronouns are usually omitted in modern Greek. Example: :ŒíŒªŒ≠œÄŒµŒπœÇ ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩŒø œÑŒø Œ∫ŒøœçœÑœÉŒøœÖœÅŒø; ŒòŒ± ŒÆœÑŒ±ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œªœå Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ œÜœâœÑŒπŒ¨. ŒïŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ œÑŒµŒªŒµŒØœâœÇ ŒæŒµœÅœå. :See that the log? Would be good for the fire. Is completely dried (literal, direct translation) :(Do) you see this log? It would be good for the fire. It has completely dried. (idiomatic translation) === Romance languages === Most Romance languages (with the notable exception of French) are often categorised as pro-drop too, most of them only in the case of subject pronouns. Unlike in Japanese, however, the missing subject pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb, which inflects for person and number of the subject. ====Spanish==== In Spanish, the verb is inflected for both person and number, thus expression of the pronoun is unnecessary because it is grammatically redundant. In the following example, the inflection on the verb ver, 'see', signals informal 2nd person singular, thus the pronoun is dropped. Similarly, from both the context and verbal morphology, the listener can infer that the second two utterances are referring to the log, so the speaker omits the pronoun that would appear in English as \\"it.\\" :¬øVes este tronco? Ser√≠a bueno para la fogata. Est√° completamente seco. (Spanish) :See this log? Would be good for the campfire. Is completely dry (literal, direct translation) :(Do) you see this log? It would be good for the campfire. It is completely dry (English gloss) Although Spanish is a pro-drop language, not all grammatical contexts allow for a null pronoun. There are some environments that require an overt pronoun. In contrast, there are also grammatical environments that require a null pronoun. According to the Real Academia Espa√±ola, the expression or elision of the subject pronoun is not random. Rather there are contexts in which an overt pronoun is abnormal, while in other cases the overt pronoun is possible or even required. The third person pronouns (√©l, ella, ellos, ellas) in most contexts can only refer to persons. Therefore, when referring to things (that are not people) an explicit pronoun is usually disallowed. Subject pronouns can be made explicit when used for a contrastive function or when the subject is the focus of the sentence. In the following example, the first person explicit pronoun is used to emphasize the subject. :Yo [y no t√∫ u otra persona] creo que eso estuvo mal. :I [and not you or another person] think that that was wrong. Subject pronouns can also be made explicit in order to clarify ambiguities that arise due to verb forms that are homophonous in the first person and third person. For example, in the past imperfect, conditional, and the subjunctive, the verb forms are the same for first person singular and third person singular. In these situations, using the explicit pronoun yo (1st person singular) or √©l, ella (3rd person singular) clarifies who the subject is, since the verbal morphology is ambiguous. ====Italian==== :Vedi questo tronco? Andrebbe bene da bruciare. √à completamente secco. (Italian) :See this log? Would go well for burning. Is completely dry (literal, direct translation) :Do you see this log? It would be fit for burning. It is completely dry. (English gloss) ====Portuguese==== Examples of omitted subject: :Est√°s a ver este tronco? Seria bom para a fogueira. Secou completamente. (European Portuguese) :Are to see this log? Would be good for the campfire. Dried completely (literal, direct translation) :(Do) you see this log? It would be good for the campfire. It has completely dried. (English gloss) :Est√° vendo esse tronco? Seria bom pra fogueira. Secou completamente. (Brazilian Portuguese) :Are seeing this log? Would be good for- the campfire. Dried completely (literal, direct translation) :(Do) you see this log? It would be good for the campfire. It has completely dried. (English gloss) Omission of object pronouns is likewise possible when the referent is clear, especially in colloquial or informal language: :Acho que ele vai rejeitar a proposta, mas pode aceitar. :Think that he goes (to-)reject the proposal, but may accept. (literally) :I think he is going to turn down the proposal, but he may accept it. :Ainda tem macarr√£o? N√£o, papai comeu. :Still is there pasta? No, daddy ate. (literally) :Is there pasta left? No, daddy ate it. The use of the object pronoun in these examples (aceit√°-la, comeu-o) would be grammatical but rather unnatural, especially in Brazil. :Ela me procurou ontem e n√£o achou. :She me sought yesterday and not found. (literally) :She looked for me yesterday and didn't find me. Here n√£o me achou would also be possible. :A: Eu te amo; voc√™ tamb√©m me ama? B: Amo, sim. :A: I you love; you too me love? B: Love-1-SING, yes. (literally) :A: I love you; do you love me too? B: I do. Omission of the object pronoun is possible even when its referent has not been explicitly mentioned, so long as it can be inferred. The next example might be heard at a store; the referent (a dress) is clear to the interlocutor. In both Brazilian and European Portuguese the pronoun is omitted. :Viu que bonito? N√£o gosta? Pode comprar? (BP) ::Saw how beautiful? Don't like? Can buy? (using polite 2nd person) (BP) :Viste que bonito? N√£o gostas? Podes comprar? (EP) ::Saw how beautiful? Don't like? Can buy? (using informal 2nd person) (EP) :Have you seen how beautiful it is? Do you like it? Can you buy it? (English gloss) Modern Spanish and Portuguese are also notable amongst Romance languages because they have no specific pronouns for circumstantial complements (arguments denoting circumstance, consequence, place or manner, modifying the verb but not directly involved in the action) or partitives (words or phrases denoting a quantity of something). However, Medieval language had them, e.g. Portuguese hi and ende. Compare the following examples in which Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Romanian have null pronouns for place and partitives, but Catalan, French, Occitan, and Italian have overt pronouns for place and partitive. Languages in Europe Circumstantial complement denoting place * \\"I'm going [there]!\\" ** Spanish ¬°Voy! ** Portuguese Vou! ** Galician Vou! ** Romanian MƒÉ duc! ** Catalan Hi vaig! ** French J'y vais ! ** Occitan I vau! ** Italian Ci vado! Partitive denoting quantity * \\"I have four of them.\\" ** Spanish Tengo cuatro. ** Portuguese Tenho quatro. ** Galician Te√±o catro. ** Romanian Am patru. ** Catalan En tinc quatre. ** French J'en ai quatre. ** Occitan N'ai quatre. ** Italian Ne ho quattro. === Slavic languages === All Slavic languages behave in a similar manner to the Romance pro-drop languages. Example: :–ë–∞—á—É [—è–≥–æ]. –Ü–¥–∑–µ. Belarusian :–í–∏–∂–¥–∞–º –≥–æ. –ò–¥–≤–∞. Bulgarian :Vidim ga. Dolazi. Croatian :Vid√≠m ho. Jde. Czech :–ì–æ –≥–ª–µ–¥–∞–º. –î–æ–∞—ì–∞. Macedonian :Widzƒô go. Idzie. Polish :–í–∏–∂—É [–µ–≥–æ]. –ò–¥—ë—Ç. Russian :–í–∏–¥–∏–º –≥–∞. –î–æ–ª–∞–∑–∏. Serbian :Vid√≠m ho. Ide. Slovak :Vidim ga. Prihaja. Slovene :–ë–∞—á—É [–π–æ–≥–æ]. –Ü–¥–µ. Ukrainian :\\"I see him. He is coming.\\" Here he in the second sentence is inferred from context. In the East Slavic languages even the objective pronoun \\"–µ–≥–æ\\" can be omitted in the present and future tenses (both imperfect and perfective). As with the Romance languages mentioned above, the missing pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb (–í–∏–∂—É, –í–∏–∂–¥–∞–º, Widzƒô, Vidim, etc...). However, the past tense of both imperfective and perfective in modern East Slavic languages inflects by gender and number rather than the person due to the fact that the present tense conjugations of the copula \\"to be\\" (Russian –±—ã—Ç—å, Ukrainian –±—É—Ç–∏, Belorussian –±—ã—Ü—å) have practically fallen out of use. As such, the pronoun is often included in these tenses, especially in writing. ===Finno-Ugric languages=== In Finnish, the verb inflection replaces first and second person pronouns in simple sentences, e.g. menen \\"I go\\", menette \\"all of you go\\". Pronouns are typically left in place only when they need to be inflected, e.g. me \\"we\\", meilt√§ \\"from us\\". There are possessive pronouns, but possessive suffixes, e.g. -ni as in kissani \\"my cat\\", are also used, as in Kissani s√∂i kalan (\\"my cat ate a fish\\"). A peculiarity of colloquial Finnish is that the pronoun me (\\"we\\") can be dropped if the verb is placed in the passive voice (e.g. haetaan, standard \\"it is fetched\\", colloquial \\"we fetch\\"). In the Estonian language, a close relative of Finnish, the tendency is less clear. It generally uses explicit personal pronouns in the literary language, but these are often omitted in colloquial Estonian. Hungarian is also pro-drop, subject pronouns are used only for emphasis, as example (√ân) mentem \\"I went\\", and because of the definite conjugation, object pronouns can be often elided as well; for example, the question (Te) l√°ttad a macsk√°t? \\"Did (you) see the cat?\\" can be answered with just l√°ttam \\"(I) saw (it)\\", because the definite conjugation renders the object pronoun superfluous. ===Hebrew=== Modern Hebrew, like Biblical Hebrew, is a \\"moderately\\" pro-drop language. In general, subject pronouns must be included in the present tense. Since Hebrew has no verb forms expressing the present tense, the present tense is formed using the present participle (somewhat like English I am guarding). The participle in Hebrew, as is the case with other adjectives, declines only in grammatical gender and number (like the past tense in Russian), thus: :I (m.) guard (ani shomer) = :You (m.) guard (ata shomer) = :He guards (hu shomer) = :I (f.) guard (ani shomeret) = :We (m.) guard (anachnu shomrim) = Since the forms used for the present tense lack the distinction between grammatical persons, explicit pronouns must be added in the majority of cases. In contrast, the past tense and the future tense the verb form is inflected for person, number, and gender. Therefore, the verb form itself indicates sufficient information about the subject. The subject pronoun is therefore normally dropped, except in third-person. : I (m./f.) guarded (shamarti) = :You (m. pl.) guarded (sh'martem) = :I (m./f.) will guard (eshmor) = :You (pl./m.) will guard (tishm'ru) = Many nouns can take suffixes to reflect the possessor, in which case the personal pronoun is dropped. In daily modern Hebrew usage, inflection of nouns is common only for simple nouns, and in most cases, inflected possessive pronouns are used. In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are treated mostly like adjectives and follow the nouns which they modify. In biblical Hebrew, inflection of more sophisticated nouns is more common than in modern usage. ==Generalizations across languages== Spanish, Italian, Catalan, Occitan and Romanian can elide subject pronouns only (Portuguese sometimes elides object pronouns as well), and they often do so even when the referent has not been mentioned. This is helped by person/number inflection on the verb. It has been observed that pro-drop languages are those with either rich inflection for person and number (Persian, Polish, Portuguese, etc.) or no such inflection at all (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.), but languages that are intermediate (English, French, etc.) are non-pro-drop. While the mechanism by which overt pronouns are more \\"useful\\" in English than in Japanese is obscure, and there are exceptions to this observation, it still seems to have considerable descriptive validity. As Huang puts it, \\"Pro-drop is licensed to occur either where a language has full agreement, or where a language has no agreement, but not where a language has impoverished partial agreement.\\"Huang, C.-T. James. \\"On the distribution and reference of empty pronouns\\". Linguistic Inquiry 15: 531-574. 1984. ===Other language families and linguistic regions=== Among the Indo-European and Dravidian languages of India, pro-drop is the general rule though many Dravidian languages do not have overt verbal markers to indicate pronominal subjects. Mongolic languages are similar in this respect to Dravidian languages, and all Paleosiberian languages are rigidly pro-drop. Outside of northern Europe, most Niger‚ÄìCongo languages, Khoisan languages of Southern Africa and Austronesian languages of the Western Pacific, pro-drop is the usual pattern in almost all linguistic regions of the world. In many non-pro- drop Niger‚ÄìCongo or Austronesian languages, like Igbo, Samoan and Fijian, however, subject pronouns do not occur in the same position as a nominal subject and are obligatory, even when the latter is present. In more easterly Austronesian languages, like Rapa Nui and Hawaiian, subject pronouns are often omitted even though no other subject morphemes exist. Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages of Australia also typically omit subject pronouns even when there is no explicit expression of the subject. Many Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages, however, have clitics, which often attach to nonverbal hosts to express subjects. The other languages of Northwestern Australia are all pro-drop, for all classes of pronoun. Also, Papuan languages of New Guinea and Nilo-Saharan languages of East Africa are pro-drop. Among the indigenous languages of the Americas, pro- drop is almost universal, as would be expected from the generally polysynthetic and head-marking character of the languages. That generally allows eliding of all object pronouns as well as subject ones. Indeed, most reports on Native American languages show that even the emphatic use of pronouns is exceptionally rare. Only a few Native American languages, mostly language isolates (Haida, Trumai, Wappo) and the Oto-Manguean family are known for normally using subject pronouns. ===Pragmatic inference=== Classical Chinese exhibits extensive dropping not only of pronouns but also of any terms (subjects, verbs, objects, etc.) pragmatically inferable, giving a very compact character to the language. Note, however, that Classical Chinese was a written language, and such word dropping is not necessarily representative of the spoken language or even of the same linguistic phenomenon. ==See also== * *; many languages such as Arabic and Hebrew lack a \\"to be\\" verb which is implicit in the subject. ==References== ==Further reading== *Bresnan, Joan (ed.)

The parts are typically manufactured in one country or region, then exported to another country or region for final assembly. A common form of knock-down is a complete knock-down (CKD), which is a kit of entirely unassembled parts of a product. It is also a method of supplying parts to a market, particularly in shipping to foreign nations, and serves as a way of counting or pricing. CKD is a common practice in the automotive, bus, heavy truck and rail vehicle industries, as well as electronics, furniture and other products. Businesses sell knocked-down kits to their foreign affiliates or licensees for various reasons, including the avoidance of import taxes, to receive tax preferences for providing local manufacturing jobs, or even to be considered as a bidder at all (for example, in public transport projects with \\"buy national\\" rules). A semi-knocked-down kit (SKD) or incompletely disassembled kit (although it has never been assembled) is a kit of the partially assembled parts of a product. Both types of KDs, complete and incomplete, are collectively referred to within the auto industry as knocked-down export (KDX), and cars assembled in the country of origin and exported whole to the destination market are known as built-up export (BUX). Technically, the terms \\"knock-down\\", \\"incompletely disassembled kit\\" and \\"kits of parts\\" are all misnomers, because the knock-downs were never built up in the first place, and the shipments of parts are often not in the form of kits, but rather bulk-packed by type of part into shipping containers. The degree of \\"knock-down\\" depends on the desires and technical abilities of the receiving organization, or on government import regulations. Developing nations may pursue trade and economic policies that call for import substitution or local content regulations. Companies with CKD operations help the country substitute the finished products it imports with locally assembled substitutes. Knock-down kit assembling plants are less expensive to establish and maintain, because they do not need modern robotic equipment, and the workforce is usually much less expensive in comparison to the home country. The plants may also be effective for low-volume production. The CKD concept allows firms in developing markets to gain expertise in a particular industry. At the same time, the CKD kit exporting company gains new markets that would otherwise be closed. ==Automotive== CKD kit as delivered to AB Nyk√∂pings Automobilfabrik for assembly, probably a Plymouth In the automotive industry, the most basic form of a vehicle in KD kit lacks the wheels, internal combustion engine, transmission, and battery. They are either supplied as parts for assembly (a \\"complete\\" kit), or obtained from third parties (an \\"incomplete\\" kit); all of the interiors are already installed at the originating factory. The term SKD for semi-knocked-down refers to a kit with a complete, welded car body, usually coated or already painted. To gain some extra tax preferences, the manufacturer needs to further localise the car, i.e. increase the share of parts produced by local manufacturers, such as tires, wheels, seats, headlights, windscreens and glass, batteries, interior plastics, etc., even down to the engine and transmission. At some point, the steel body could be pressed, welded, and painted locally, which effectively makes KD assembly only a couple of steps away from full-scale production. By the time that Henry Ford co-wrote his 1922 memoir My Life and Work, the Ford Motor Company was already shipping car parts from its Michigan plants for final assembly in the regions of the United States or foreign countries where the cars would be sold. During World War II, a great number of US- and Canadian-built vehicles ‚Äî most notably light and heavy trucks like Willys MB/Ford GPW/GPA, GMC-353/CCKW and vehicles from the CMP family ‚Äî were crated and shipped overseas in KD form, in various degrees of completeness, to Allied countries, in order to sustain their war effort. Assembly lines were preferably set up in local automotive factories where appropriate tooling and equipment could be easily found but, where needed, other types of buildings could be used, especially in on-the-field situations, and on occasion even open-air rebuilding camps were set up, managed by military personnel. Owing to male mobilization, sometimes a female workforce was employed. CKD military vehicles could be stored for shipment in one-vehicle-per-crate form (or SUP, Single Unit Pack), or as several vehicles (usually two to three) divided in two or more crates. Vehicles shipped to certain countries could be lacking some items, such as cabs, beds or tires, that were built and provided locally. Mahindra & Mahindra Limited in India began its business in 1947 with assembling CKD Jeeps. Mahindra expanded their operations to include domestic manufacture of Jeep vehicles with a high level of local content under license from Kaiser Jeep Corporation and later American Motors (AMC). In the 1950s and 1960s Lotus Cars sold its Lotus Seven car in CKD form to avoid the UK purchase tax that applied to sales of fully assembled vehicles. By 1959, and with the introduction of the Mini, the products of BMC were still either imported or assembled from CKD kits in several international markets. In 1961, Renault began negotiations for a first partnership agreement with AMC for assembly of Rambler automobiles in Europe. Beginning in 1962, and continuing until 1967, AMC also sold CKD kits of its passenger cars to Renault. They were assembled in Renault's factory in Haren, Belgium, and sold through its dealers in Algeria, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The deal allowed AMC to sell its cars in new markets without having to make a major Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The arrangement was good for the French automaker because its product range was lacking large cars and it needed to offer an \\"executive\\" model in its European markets. The situation had changed by 1977. It was now AMC that sought outside support for a new car in the United States sub-compact market segment, which led to the first of many agreements with Renault. Volvo's Halifax Assembly Plant, which opened 1963, completed vehicles in CKD form from Sweden for North American consumers. Halifax Assembly closed in December 1998. In 1967, Rootes Group UK began exporting CKD Hillman Hunters to Iran where they were sold as the Paykan (meaning \\"arrow\\" in Persian). Bought by Chrysler in 1967 and then part of the sale to the PSA Group by the Chrysler Corporation of its European operations in late 1978, the Rootes business basis in Iran became the primer for the very significant PSA Peugeot Citro√´n business in Iran involving engine and CKD deliveries, particularly from the 405, introduced in 1990 and facelifted as the Pars in 1999 and 206 introduced in 2001.Paul, Peugeot Pars: petite histoire de la 405 iranienne !, uploaded on 15 Sept. 2015, con sulted on 17 Febr. 2017 In 2004, Peugeot's partner Iran Khodro produced 281'000 Peugeot vehicles, securing a 36% market share. In 1967 as well, Peugeot introduced CKD-based production of a light pick-up vehicle based on the Peugeot 403 in Peugeot's Berazategui factory (in Buenos Aires) under the name Peugeot 4TB.Mauricio Uldane, La primera camioneta de SAFRAR, article containing many additional links, consulted on 17 Febr. 2017 In 1973, this model was replaced by the 404 pick-up and later (1990) by the 504 pick-up. The 404 and 504 were massively marketed worldwide through local CKD assembly shops: the 404 was assembled, besides France and Argentina, in Australia, Belgium, Canada (at the SOMA plant shared with Renault), Chile, Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Per√∫, Rhodesia, South Africa and Uruguay; the 504, mainly in Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South-Africa, Australia and China by the Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company which developed a specific crew cab version. In 1968, the independent German automotive firm, Karmann, began assembly of CKD kits of AMC's newly introduced Javelin for distribution in Europe. American Motors also provided right-hand drive versions of their automobiles to markets such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The components were shipped in containers to Australia from AMC's plants in Kenosha, Wisconsin, or Brampton, Ontario. Assembly of Rambler and AMC vehicles in Australia was done by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Local content requirements were met by using Australian suppliers for the interiors (seats, carpeting, etc.) as well as for lights, heaters, and other components. Various Rambler models were assembled in New Zealand from the early 1960s until 1971 by Campbell Motors in Thames (later Toyota New Zealand), which had also built Toyota, Datsun, (later known as Nissan), Hino, Renault, and Peugeot cars. New Zealand had developed a car assembly industry as a means of import substitution and providing local employment, despite the small size of the local market. Following economic reforms in the 1980s, including the lowering of import tariffs, the ability to import Australian- built vehicles duty-free under the CER agreement, many car companies ended assembly in New Zealand and switched to importing completely built up vehicles from Japan, Australia, or Europe. More significantly, the easing of import restrictions led to a large number of Japanese used imports, which were far cheaper than locally assembled used cars, and continue to outnumber so-called 'NZ New' vehicles. The last companies to assemble CKD kits in New Zealand were Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Honda, which closed their plants in 1998, when the government announced plans to abolish import tariffs on cars. More recent examples include Ukraine, which has almost prohibitive import taxes on finished cars. AutoZAZ assembles CKD kits of some Lada, Opel, Mercedes-Benz, and Daewoo cars.\\"ZAZ increased car output by 7% in Q1 2006\\" Bank AVAL, retrieved on: 3 September 2007. It went as far as adopting a version of Daewoo Lanos for full-scale production and equipping it with a domestic engine. The German automotive giant - Volkswagen Group also produces SKDs in the Ukraine at its Solomonovo plant, producing cars under its ≈†koda and Volkswagen Passenger Cars marques. In Russia, the most well-known KD assembling facilities are owned by Avtotor, which produces Hummer H2, BMW 3 Series and BMW 5 Series in Kaliningrad, and Renault Logan in Moscow using facilities that once belonged to AZLK. In Kaluga, Volkswagen Group is currently constructing a new plant, which when completed, is expected to have an annual output of 150,000 units. Daimler AG has a CKD assembly plant in South Carolina that re-assembles Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for sale in the United States and Canada at Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner dealers, along with Dodge dealers prior to Fiat Group's takeover of Chrysler Group LLC -- essentially to circumvent the 25% tariff on imported light trucks known as the \\"Chicken Tax\\". The Sprinter was eventually replaced in the Dodge/Ram lineup with the similar Ram ProMaster, a rebadged Fiat Ducato. Unlike the CKD Dodge Sprinter, the ProMaster is fully imported to the US from a Chrysler plant in Mexico, which is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement and not subject to the Chicken Tax. In 2009, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited announced that it would export pickup trucks powered by diesel engines from India to the United States in knockdown kit (CKD) form, again to circumvent the chicken tax. Mahindra planned to export CKDs to the United States as complete vehicles that will be assembled in the United States from kits of parts shipped in crates. However, Mahindra's United States CKD and export plans never materialized and were subject to several lawsuits. Since 2013 Tesla operates an assembly plant in Tilburg, Netherlands. It is used for the assembly of their Model S sedan and Model X SUV for the European Union, but not all of Europe since only cars imported to the EU benefit from circumventing the 10% import duty (e.g. cars to Norway are shipped directly from the United States). For the most part the car is still manufactured in the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. During the final assembly in the Netherlands various parts are added to the car most notably the rear subframe with the drive train as well as the battery pack. ==Buses== *Motor Coach Industries opened its Pembina, North Dakota, assembly plant in 1963, as part of an expansion into the US market. Unfinished KD (knocked down) coach bodies are shipped from Winnipeg, Manitoba, by flatbed trailer and completed, outfitted and delivered at Pembina. This practice simplifies US Customs and meets the \\"Buy America Act\\" provisions (49 USC 5323(j) and 49 CFR Part 661) for public agencies purchasing new equipment with federal funds.\\"MCI Celebrates 80 Years of Bus Production\\", National Bus Trader, June 2013. *North American Bus Industries opened operations in Anniston, Alabama, in 1993, with incomplete buses shipped from Budapest, Hungary, to Anniston for final assembly. NABI expanded production operations in Anniston to allow full production with its first fully domestically produced bus unit in 2008. ==Rail== *The practice of selling \\"knocked down\\" railcars, called by that name, pre-dates the 20th century, as evidenced by an advertisement by J. G. Brill and Company in the Street Railway Journal from 1898. *Many rail equipment builders have used kits or incomplete vehicles, often to meet local assembly and production requirements or quotas, or to satisfy tariffs. Some examples include: **Between 1938 and 1951, the St. Louis Car Company shipped PCC streetcar body shells and trucks north for assembly by Canadian Car & Foundry. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) PCC fleet was purchased and delivered in this method.Market Street Railway: \\"Historic Streetcars: Car 1074\\" Market Street Railway, San Francisco. **Bombardier ships incomplete cars from its plant at La Pocati√®re, Quebec, to Plattsburgh, New York, and (until 2002) Barre, Vermont, facilities for final assembly. These are to meet \\"Buy America Act\\" provisions for US public transit agencies and tariff rules. Since 2009 the Plattsburgh assembly plant has full stainless steel welding and fabrication capability, allowing for cars to be fully assembled and completed on site. **Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) has an assembly plant in Yonkers, New York, that completes final assembly of cars using bodies shipped from Kobe, Japan. KHI also has a car body plant in Lincoln, Nebraska, full cars are built there and can be shipped to Yonkers for completion. **Alstom's Hornell, New York, assembly plant produces final completed cars using stainless body assemblies shipped from the Lapa plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The same production method was used by Morrison Knudsen when it built new passenger cars at the Hornell shops in the 1990s. **From their first US order from the South Shore Line in 1982 until the opening of a full body manufacturing and assembly line in Rochelle, Illinois, thirty years later,\\"Expansion of Rochelle Production Facility\\", Nippon Sharyo USA, Inc, 30 April 2013. Nippon Sharyo sent commuter train bodies from Japan to US finishers, including an American unit of Sumitomo. **Hyundai Rotem opened an assembly facility in South Philadelphia, located in an industrial park off Columbus Boulevard. Car shells are assembled, outfitted and completed for delivery at this site, which is served by Conrail on the Philadelphia Belt Line, allowing delivery of new cars by rail. **The London Underground 1995 and 1996 Stock fleets have aluminium bodies built by Alstom in Barcelona with assembly completed at the Metro- Cammell works in Washwood Heath, Birmingham. ==Aircraft== Unserviceable military aircraft are also sold as \\"knock-downs\\" after they have ended their service life, packaging them with serviceable aircraft. This allows them to be used for cannibalization of spare parts. The European aircraft manufacturer Airbus uses knock-down kits to assemble A320 family aircraft outside Europe. The Airbus A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, China, assembles fuselage, wing, and tail sections made in Europe with avionics and engines made in the EU or the United States and locally sourced components for interiors. Airbus has opened a similar A320 final assembly line in the United States in September 2015, located in Mobile, Alabama; again using European-made fuselages, wings, and tail sections. However, the Mobile final assembly line will use more locally sourced components than the Tianjin line; engines, interior components, and avionics will be sourced mainly from American suppliers. Both the Airbus Tianjin and Mobile plants receive their fuselages, wings, and tail sections from Europe via ocean freight using specially designed ships, as the plants are located in port cities. ==Housing== Advertisement for knocked-down kits for houses, in Popular Mechanics, May 1908 A 1908 advertisement in Popular Mechanics attests that knock-down kits for houses were on the market by the early 20th century, if not before. ==Furniture== ==See also== *Rules of origin ==References== Category:Automotive technologies Category:Manufacturing Category:International trade pl:Systemy monta≈ºu samochod√≥w#CKD ","title":"Knock-down kit"},{"id":"1272666","text":"View of Neve Yaakov from the east Neve Yaakov also Neve Ya'aqov, (; lit.

Established in 1924 during the period of the British Mandate, it was depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The area was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War and a new neighborhood was built nearby, at which time international opposition to its legitimacy began. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this, defining it as a neighborhood within the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem Municipality, which provides all services.

Neve Yaakov is one of Jerusalem's Ring Neighborhoods. ==History== Neve Yaakov 1938 Neve Yaakov 1938 High-rise apartment buildings along Neve Yaakov Blvd. Petrie Park in Neve Yaakov. Neve Yaakov was established in 1924 on a parcel of land purchased from the Arabs of Beit Hanina by members of the American Mizrachi movement.Hall, J.

HaKfar HaIvri Neve Yaakov (The Jewish Village of Neve Yaakov) was named for the leader of the movement, Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines (1839‚Äì1915). It was an hour's walk to the Old City, where most Jews of Jerusalem lived at the time. Until they were abandoned in 1948, Neve Yaakov and Atarot were the only Jewish settlements north of the Old City. The first houses were ready for occupancy in Av (summer) 1925. The village's rav, Rabbi Yitzchak Avigdor Orenstein, ruled that new homeowners could move into their homes even during The Nine Days, saying that the mitzvah of settling the Land of Israel overrode the laws of the mourning period. Rabbi Orenstein himself moved into his new house during The Nine Days, while village administrator Dov Brinker moved his furniture and belongings into his new house on Tisha B'Av itself. The village, home to 150 families, suffered from financial problems and lack of a regular water supply. After years of hauling water in buckets from a well six kilometers away, the village received a government water pipeline in 1935. Electricity was hooked up in 1939. After years of peaceful co-existence with the surrounding Arab villagers, from whom they purchased vegetables, fruit and eggs, the inhabitants of Neve Yaakov were attacked during the 1929 Palestine riots, and many families returned to the Old City. According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Neve Yaakov had a population of 101 inhabitants, in 20 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 42 In the course of the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine, shots were heard from the Arab side almost every night. The British Mandate government supplied a cache of arms to defend Neve Yaakov, and members of the Zionist Haganah pre-state army moved in to guard the village and its water pipeline. During the peaceful years from 1940 to 1947, the village operated a school that accepted students from all over the country. Children's summer camps and convalescent facilities were opened, taking advantage of the rural atmosphere and fresh air. Veteran Jerusalem residents remember hiking to Neve Yaakov to buy fresh milk from dairy farmers. During the last months of the British Mandate snipers in Neve Yaakov shot at traffic on the Jerusalem/Ramallah road. In March 1948 the British Army introduced convoys to protect travellers.Hurnard, Hannah (1997) Watchmen on the Walls.

The region was occupied by the Jordanians until the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel captured the Old City and its surroundings. ==Re-establishment of Neve Yaakov== Aerial view of Neve Yaakov, with the Mir Forest and Pisgat Ze'ev North to the left According to ARIJ, Israel has confiscated land from three nearby Palestinian communities in order to establish Neve Yaakov: *551 dunams from Beit Hanina,Beit Hanina Town Profile, ARIJ, 2012, pp. 13-14 *385 dunams from Hizma,Hizma Village Profile, ARIJ, 2012, p. 17 *315 dunums from Al-Ram.Ar Ram Town Profile, ARIJ, 2012, p. 19 In August 1970 3,500 acres of privately owned and titled Palestinian land was confiscated for \\"public purposes\\". On this land 4 residential colonies were established including Neve Yaakov with 4,000 apartments. In 1972, a new Jewish neighborhood was constructed on the site of the original village, with 4,900 apartments in high-rise buildings. The new neighborhood was populated by Jewish immigrants from Bukhara, Georgia, Latin America, North Africa, France and Iran. In the 1990s, when large waves of Russian and Ethiopian Jews came to Israel, many settled in Neve Yaakov. In October 1971, Rabbi Meir Kahane presented the Minister of Immigrant Absorption, Natan Peled, a memo detailing plans for a community for American Jews in Neve Yaakov. ===Kiryat Kaminetz=== In 1982, Kiryat Kaminetz, a housing development on the eastern edge of Neve Yaakov named for the Jewish community of Kamenets, Poland destroyed in the Holocaust, was built on the eastern side of the existing neighborhood. Several hundred apartments were populated by young, Haredi Jewish families, many of them from English-speaking countries. In 1992, 700 new apartments were added to Kiryat Kaminetz on the eastern slope of the mountain; this new neighborhood is also known as Neve Yaakov Mizrach (Neve Yaakov East). The latter has a high concentration of Hasidic and Sephardic Haredi families, with a variety of schools and synagogues serving each population. Neve Yaakov Mizrach is also home to two yeshivas catering to American students: Yeshivas Bais Yisroel and Yeshivas Lev Aryeh. The Haredi character of the neighborhood has expanded further since 2004 with an influx of newlywed couples, both Israeli-born and immigrants originating from English-speaking countries, to the older sections of Neve Yaakov. This new trend has been characterized by calling the older section the Mitchared (literally, \\"Haredization\\"). In 2009 the Haredi presence in Neve Yaakov was estimated at 900 families. Figures as of January 2016 from the Jerusalem Municipality showed a total population of 24,225, of which nearly half are under the age of 21. Seventy-six percent of the population is under the age of 40. Neve Yaakov is noted as having the largest kindergarten enrollment in the city. The 2016 figures cite 91 percent as being enrolled in Haredi kindergartens. In the elementary school system, 86 percent of children are enrolled in Haredi schools. ==References== == External links == * Nefesh B'Nefesh Community Guide for Neve Yaakov, Jerusalem, Israel * Go Jerusalem.com guide of Neve Yaakov, Jerusalem, Israel * Photos of Neve Yaakov, Jerusalem, Israel Category:Israeli settlements Category:Neighbourhoods of Jerusalem Category:Orthodox Jewish communities in Jerusalem Category:Jewish villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:1929 Palestine riots ","title":"Neve Yaakov"},{"id":"1272674","text":"De la Vega is a surname in the Spanish language, most of its bearers belonging to the nobility.

A member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), he previously was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1985 to 1989 and again from 1993 until 1996. == Personal life == Karolos Papoulias was born in Ioannina and is the son of Major general Gregorios Papoulias. He obtained a Law degree from the University of Athens, a master's degree in Public International Law and International Relations from the University of Milan, and a doctorate in Private International Law from the University of Cologne. He is an associate of the Munich Institute for Southeast Europe. Apart from his native Greek, he also speaks French, German and Italian. A former pole-vault and volleyball champion, Papoulias has been chairman of the National Sports Association since 1985. He is also a founding member and until recently president of the Association for the Greek Linguistic Heritage. He was active in the left-wing EPON youth as a young man. Karolos Papoulias is married to Mary Panou and has three daughters. == Role in PASOK, parliamentary and government offices == Papoulias was a founding member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and a close associate of its leader Andreas Papandreou. Since December 1974 he was continually elected to the PASOK Central Committee. He was also member of the Coordination Council, the Executive Bureau and the Political Secretariat, as well as Secretary of the PASOK International Relations Committee from April 1975 to 1985. For a number of years he was also a member of the Coordinating Committee of the Socialist and Progressive Parties of the Mediterranean. He was first elected to the Greek Parliament in 1977 for Ioannina, and held his seat continuously through the subsequent legislative elections until his 2004 election as President of the Republic. He held several high offices during the PASOK cabinets: * Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, from 21 October 1981 to 8 February 1984. * Alternate Minister for Foreign Affairs, from 8 February 1984 to 5 June 1985 and again from 5 June 1985 to 26 July 1985. * Minister for Foreign Affairs, from 26 July 1985 to 2 July 1989. * Alternate Minister for National Defence, from 23 November 1989 to 13 February 1990 in the ecumenical government of Xenophon Zolotas . * Minister for Foreign Affairs, from 13 October 1993 to 22 January 1996. == Papoulias as Minister for Foreign Affairs == In the 1980s, Papoulias played a key role in trying to reach a solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He mediated a safe departure of trapped Palestinian militants and Yasser Arafat from Lebanon on board Greek vessels in 1983. He created diplomatic relations with the Arab world and achieved, among other things, the normalization of relations between Greece and Egypt and the establishment of tripartite cooperation between Iran, Armenia and Greece. He held talks with a total of 12 Turkish Foreign Ministers to normalize Greco- Turkish relations. This resulted in the signing of the Papoulias-Yƒ±lmaz memorandum in 1988. He supported Turkey's European aspirations conditional on their respect for international law and European Union values. In the period 1993‚Äì1996 and particularly at the crucial Essen Summit he played an important role in starting accession talks between the Republic of Cyprus and the European Union. President Karolos Papoulias with Prime Minister George Papandreou in November 2011 As president-in-office of the European Union and member of the contact group for the former Yugoslavia he worked to bring about a resolution of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He signed the Interim Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, aiming at the establishment of better relations between that country and Greece. He was very interested in relations between Greece and the Balkan states and it was upon his initiative that the first meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Balkans was organized in Belgrade in 1988. There, he began talks with Bulgaria and the then Soviet Union on the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline. He was responsible for the signing of the protocol of mutual civil and military assistance with Bulgaria in the 1980s. He restored friendly and neighbourly relations with Albania by ending the state of war between that country and Greece. Papoulias has been supportive of any step towards d√©tente, peace and disarmament e.g. the \\"Initiative of the Six\\" for peace and disarmament, the participation of Greece in the Conference on Disarmament and Peace in Europe and in the Conference for the Abolition of Chemical Weapons, his proposals to create a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and the promotion of the idea of making the Mediterranean a sea of peace and cooperation. The JANNINA 1 tripartite cooperation conference, between Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, was his idea and he was a strong supporter of the Black Sea Conference, which he also chaired. With his visit to Washington in 1985 and the return visit of Secretary of State George Shultz, he revitalized Greek- American relations which had gone through a delicate phase during the previous years. Arms as knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (Sweden) == Election to the Presidency == On 12 December 2004, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, leader of the governing New Democracy party, and George Papandreou, leader of the PASOK opposition, nominated Papoulias for the presidency, which is chosen by the Parliament. On 8 February 2005, he was elected by 279 of 300 votes to a five-year term. He was sworn in as the 6th President of the Third Hellenic Republic on 12 March 2005, succeeding Konstantinos Stephanopoulos. After securing the support of the two major political parties, he was re-elected to a second and final term on 3 February 2010 with a parliamentary majority of 266 votes. His presidential term ended in March 2015 and was replaced by Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who was elected Greece‚Äôs new president in a parliamentary vote in February 2015. ==Honours== * : Grand Star of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (2007) * : Knight Grand Cross of the Grand Order of King Tomislav (\\"For outstanding contribution to the promotion of friendship and development co-operation between the Republic of Croatia and the Hellenic Republic.\\" ‚Äì 21 March 2007) * : Knight of the Order of the Elephant (May 24, 2006) * : Knight Grand Cross with Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (January 18, 2006) * : Knight of the Order of the Seraphim (May 20, 2008) * : Knight of the Order of the White Eagle (July 8, 2013) * : Order of the Republic of Serbia (February 25, 2013) ==References== https://archive.is/20130208185608/http://news.silobreaker.com/biography-for- karolos-papoulias-5_2258120401743773696_4 == External links == * Official Website of the President of Greece ‚Äì - - - Category:1929 births Category:Foreign ministers of Greece Category:Greek MPs 1977‚Äì1981 Category:Greek MPs 1981‚Äì1985 Category:Greek MPs 1985‚Äì1989 Category:Greek MPs 1989 (June‚ÄìNovember) Category:Greek MPs 1989‚Äì1990 Category:Greek MPs 1990‚Äì1993 Category:Greek MPs 1993‚Äì1996 Category:Greek MPs 1996‚Äì2000 Category:Greek MPs 2000‚Äì2004 Category:Greek sportsperson-politicians Category:Grand Order of King Tomislav recipients Category:Knights Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic Category:Living people Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:PASOK politicians Category:People from Ioannina Category:Presidents of Greece Category:University of Cologne alumni Category:University of Milan alumni Category:Zosimaia School alumni ","title":"Karolos Papoulias"},{"id":"1272687","text":"The Kylver stone. The Kylver stone, listed in the Rundata catalog as runic inscription G 88, is a Swedish runestone which dates from about 400 AD. It is notable for its listing of each of the runes in the Elder Futhark. ==Description== The Kylver stone was found during the excavation of a cemetery near a farm at Kylver, St√•nga, Gotland in 1903. The stone was a flat limestone rock used to seal a grave and the runic inscription was written on the underside, and could therefore not be read from above. The dating of the stone from 400 CE is based upon the archeological dating of the graves. The Kylver stone was removed from Gotland and brought to the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm where it is not on display . The fact that the inscription was on the inside of a cover to a grave has resulted in speculation that it represented a use of the Elder Futhark to pacify the dead man in some manner. However, it has been pointed out that there is nothing in the inscription to support this. In addition, there is no evidence that the inscription was made for the purpose of being used on the cover of a grave. There are many examples where stone with runic inscriptions was reused for other purposes. It has been suggested that the likely purpose of making the inscription was for practice or instruction in the carving of the Elder Futhark. ==Inscription== The Kylver stone is inscribed with the earliest known sequential listing of the 24 runes of the Elder Futhark, :300px : :[f] u √æ a r k g [w] h n i j p √Ø z s t b e m l ≈ã d o with the a (·ö®), s (·õä), and b runes (·õí) mirrored compared to later use, and the z rune (·õâ) upside down (·õ¶). The dots in the image indicate incorrect or unorthodox forms like these in the original inscription. The f (·ö†) and w runes (·öπ) runes are only partially inscribed. After the last rune follows a spruce- or tree-like rune, with six twigs to the left and eight to the right of a single stave. This is interpreted as a bindrune of stacked Tiwaz rune, or possibly of six Tiwaz and four Ansuz runes to invoke Tyr and the √Üsir for protection.Spurkland (2005:16): \\"The twigs on the left of the stave represent six t runes while the twigs on the right, in pairs, stand for four a runes: tttttt, aaaa, or six times 'T√Ωr' and four times '√°ss' in the meaning of 'god'. It could be a good protection to take into the grave.\\" At a separate space the word ·õä·ö¢·õñ·ö¢·õä sueus is inscribed. The meaning of this latter palindromic word is unknown, but it is possible that it is associated with magic. One suggestion presented by Marstrander is that it is a magical writing of the word 'eus' (the nominative form of the word horse) starting from the e and writing either way. p. 315 However, this suggestion has been criticized as being \\"linguistically impossible\\" for that time period. The small inscription also uses the Younger Futhark version of the s-rune. It is also possible that it refers to the Germanic tribe of the Suiones that inhabited the region, whose realm laid the basis for what became Sweden. ==See also== *Rundata *Runic magic *Vadstena bracteate ‚Äì Another Elder Futhark inscription. ==References== ==External links== *Photograph ‚Äì Swedish National Heritage Board Category:Rune- and picture stones on Gotland Category:Gotland Category:Elder Futhark inscriptions ","title":"Kylver Stone"},{"id":"1272692","text":"Lepta (, ) is the second full-length album by the Russian folk metal band Arkona.

Its capital was the city of Spoleto. == Lombards == The Lombards, a Germanic people, had invaded Italy in 568 AD and conquered much of it, establishing the Kingdom of the Lombards, which was divided among several dukes dependent on the King. The King himself had established his seat in Pavia in 572. In the following years they also conquered much of southern and central Italy, conquering the important hub of Spoleto, in what is now Umbria, in 570. A decade of interregnum after the death of Alboin's successor (574), however, left the Lombard dukes (especially the southern ones) well settled in their new territories and quite independent of the Lombard kings at Pavia. By 575 or 576 Faroald had seized Nursia and Spoleto, establishing his duchy and sponsoring an Arian bishop. Within Spoleto, the Roman capitolium dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva had already been occupied by the bishop's cathedral (the see was founded in the 4th century) which incorporated the pagan structure (now the church of San Ansano). The Lombard dukes restored the fortifications of the high rocca, whose walls had been dismantled by Totila during the Gothic War. The dukes of Spoleto waged intermittent war with the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna, and Spoleto's territories fluctuated with the fortunes of the times over much of Umbria, Lazio, the Marche and the Abruzzi. Never as important as the Duchy of Benevento, Spoleto has a fairly obscure spot in Lombard history, nevertheless. Its second Duke Ariulf made frequent expeditions against the Byzantines (in 579‚Äì592 against Ravenna and in 592 against Rome). Ariulf was succeeded by Theudelapius, son of Faroald, whom the Catholic Encyclopedia credits with the first building of Spoleto's cathedral. Then came Atto (653), Thrasimund I (663), and Faroald II (703), who ruled conjointly with his brother Wachilap. Faroald II captured Classis, the port of Ravenna, according to Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards: \\"In that time too Faroald, the first dux of the Spoletans, invading Classis with an army of Lombards, left the wealthy city despoiled and bare of all its riches.\\" He was then obliged by Liutprand, King of the Lombards to restore it, a measure of the loose central control of Lombard rule that Liutprand was occupied in tightening, at least as Paul interpreted events for his Frankish patrons. At Spoleto Faroald was deposed by his son Transemund II (724), who also rebelled against Liutprand and formed an alliance with Pope Gregory III, who sheltered him in Rome in 738. Ilderic, who had replaced him as duke, was slain by Transemund in 740, but in 742 Transemund was forcibly retired to a monastery by Liutprand, who conferred the duchy that he had rewon by force of arms upon Agiprand (742). By the time of Liutprand's death (744), Spoleto was more securely in central control from Pavia, and Theodicus succeeded peaceably. Three 8th-century dukes were Kings of the Lombards, a sign that in that period Spoleto was linked more closely to the kingdom than was Benevento. ==Imperial fief== In 776, two years after the fall of Pavia, Spoleto fell likewise to Charlemagne and his Carolingian Empire, and he assumed the title King of the Lombards. Though he granted the territory to the Church, he retained the right to name its dukes, an important concession that can be compared to the as-yet uncontested Imperial right to invest territorial bishops, and perhaps at times a matter of contention between Emperor and Papacy, for Pope Adrian I had recently named a duke of Spoleto. In 842 the former duchy was resurrected by the Franks to be held as a Frankish border territory by a dependent margrave. Among the more outstanding of the Frankish dukes, Guido I divided the duchy between his two sons Lambert and Guido II, who received as his share the lordship of Camerino, which was made a duchy. Lambert was a doughty fighter against Saracen raiders, but who equally massacred Byzantines (as in 867), and was deposed in 871, restored in 876, and finally excommunicated by Pope John VIII. In 883 Guido II reunited the dukedom, henceforth as the Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino. After the death of Charles the Fat in 888, Guido had himself crowned Roman Emperor and King of Italy by Pope Stephen V (891). The following year Pope Formosus crowned Guido's son Lambert II as duke, king and emperor. The dukes of Spoleto continued to intervene in the violent politics of Rome. Alberico I, Duke of Camerino (897), and afterwards of Spoleto, married the notorious Roman noblewoman Marozia, mistress of Pope Sergius III (904‚Äì911), and was killed by the Romans in 924. His son Alberico II overthrew the senatrix in 932 though her son, his half-brother, was Pope John XII. About 949 the Frankish King Berengar II of Italy retook Spoleto from its final margrave. At this time the Emperor Otto I detached from the Duchy of Spoleto the lands called Sabina Langobardica and presented them to the Holy See. Now the control of Spoleto became increasingly a gift of the Emperors. In 967, Otto II briefly united the Duchy of Spoleto with that of Capua and Benevento, which was then ruled by Pandulf Ironhead; but after Pandolfo's death he detached Spoleto, which in 989 he granted to Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany. The duchy was united with Tuscany a second time in 1057 and it remained so until the death of the Countess Matilda. During the Investiture Controversy with the papacy the Emperor Henry IV named other dukes of Spoleto. After this the dukedom was in the family of the Werner (Guarnieri) of Urslingen, Margraves of Ancona. The city was destroyed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1155, but was soon rebuilt. In 1158 the emperor gave the duchy to Guelf VI of Este; Henry VI invested Conrad of Urslingen with it, upon whose death in 1198 it was ceded to Pope Innocent III, but then was occupied by Otto of Brunswick in 1209, who made Dipold von Vohburg duke. ==Papal fief== Otto made a gift of Imperial rights in Spoleto to the Papal States in 1201, and soon afterward (1213), the duchy was brought under direct papal rule with a governor, usually a cardinal, though it remained a pawn in the struggles of Frederick II until the extinction of the House of Hohenstaufen. The territories of Spoleto were annexed to the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples. The title of Duchy of Spoleto was later used by members of the House of Savoy. ==See also== *Duke of Spoleto == References == == External links == * The History Files: Lombard Dukes of Spoleto. * Spoleto on the Catholic Encyclopedia, showing a somewhat different list of dukes, working no doubt from the Liber Pontificalis Category:1201 disestablishments in Europe Category:13th-century disestablishments in Italy Category:Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire) Category:History of Catholicism in Italy Category:States and territories established in the 570s Category:570 establishments Category:Spoleto Category:States and territories established in the 840s Category:Lombards Category:842 establishments Category:Duchies of the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Duchy of Spoleto"},{"id":"1272711","text":"Papoulias (or Papoulia, maiden name) is a Greek surname.

It was the first production helicopter powered by a gas turbine engine instead of the heavier conventional piston powerplant. On 12 March 1955, the prototype SE 3130 performed its maiden flight. The Alouette II was a widely used type and popular with operators, with over 1,300 rotorcraft eventually being constructed between 1956 and 1975. The type was predominantly used for military purposes in observation, photography, air-sea rescue, liaison and training, but it has also carried anti-tank missiles and homing torpedoes. As a civilian helicopter, the Alouette II has been used for casualty evacuation (with two external stretcher panniers), crop-spraying and as a flying crane, with a external underslung load. A high-altitude derivative, the SA 315B Lama, was developed and entered operational service in July 1971. The Alouette II also was further developed into the larger and more powerful Alouette III. In 1975, production of the type was terminated, having been effectively succeeded by these newer rotorcraft. Despite it being long out of production, considerable numbers of Alouette II were still in service at the start of the 21st century. ==Development== Although Sud-Est's previous helicopter design, the SE 3120 Alouette, broke helicopter speed and distance records in July 1953, it was too complex an aircraft to market successfully. With the records falling, the French government started showing interest, but with their financial backing, the state gave an ultimatum that within two years a helicopter had to be in production, otherwise all rotary wing activities would cease. SNCASE came up with seven helicopter designs powered by turboshaft engines: X.310A ‚Äì X.310G. Earlier Joseph Szydlowski, the founder of Turbomeca, had successfully managed to develop the Artouste, a single shaft turbine engine derived from his Or√©don turbine. The X.310G design was chosen and, together with the Artouste engine, was fast-tracked towards production as the SE 3130 Alouette II. A West German Alouette II patrolling the border with East Germany, 1985 On 12 March 1955, the prototype SE 3130 performed its maiden flight;McGowen 2005, p. 74. within three months, on 6 June, a pre-production Alouette II, flown by Jean Boulet, established a new helicopter altitude record of .\\"FAI Record ID #9876 ‚Äì Altitude without payload.

According to the manufacturer, such early demonstrations of the Alouette II had served to promote the performance and advantages of turbine helicopters over their piston-engined counterparts. In April 1956, the first production Alouette II was completed, making it the first production turbine- powered helicopter in the world.\\"1955: SE3130 \\"Alouette II\\".\\" Eurocopter, Retrieved: 20 December 2015. Upon completion, several of the initial production models were dispatched for a series of evaluation flights in the Alps.

In 1975, production of the Alouette II ended after more than 1,300 had been built; in 1969, a new high-altitude variant, the A√©rospatiale SA 315B Lama had been developed to replace it in this niche capacity. A slightly larger and more powerful helicopter in the form of the A√©rospatiale Alouette III has also entered production, which had negatively impacted upon the demand for the older II model.McGowen 2005, p. 227. ==Design== The A√©rospatiale Alouette II is a French light helicopter, incorporating many innovations of its time. It was powered by a single Turbomeca Artouste II turboshaft engine capable of generating a maximum output of 400 hp. The speed of the main rotor is controlled by an automated fuel supply governor, eliminating the necessity of a twist-grip throttle and a conventional link between the throttle and the collective-pitch. Instead, the Alouette II uses a simple control lever arrangement, which acts to directly regulate the collective-pitch and actuate the governor while immediately and automatically applying the correct level of power to conform with flight condition. Without a clutch, the transmission is considerably simplified in both design and maintenance aspects. Despite being a light helicopter, the Alouette II possesses a reasonable lift capacity and can carry underslung loads on an external sling; during one high-profile public demonstration, one helicopter was able to air-lift a compact Citroen truck weighing in excess of half a ton without visible difficulty. While flying at sea level, the Alouette II uses only 300 of the powerplant's available 400 hp; accordingly, performance can be maintained while operated at a high altitude and within tropical conditions where the additional power would come into play. It was capable of flying at altitudes of up to 2,286 meters above sea level while possessing an average climb rate of 250 meters per minute and a typical maximum range of 563 miles. Various alternative landing gear configurations could be fitted, including skids, wheels, or pontoons. The Alouette II is capable of accommodating a seating arrangement for up to five personnel, including the pilot; access to the cabin was provided via a pair of side- hinged doors. The compact cockpit was provided with a dome-shapred windscreen which provided for excellent levels of external visibility. The Alouette II also made innovative use of armaments. It was the first helicopter worldwide to be equipped with anti-tank munitions in the form of the SS.11 MCLOS wire- guided anti-tank missile.Helicopters at War ‚Äì Blitz Editions, p. 63, .Boyne 2011, p. 74. In addition to anti-tank missiles, the French Army chose to arm their Alouette IIs with machine guns, while the French Navy outfitted theirs with aerial torpedoes to conduct anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties. Under operational conditions, the Alouette II often proved to be a relatively maintenance-intensive rotorcraft.Cocks 2015, pp. 22‚Äì23. It required a high level of regular lubrication, the main rotorhead alone featuring 20 grease nipples that had to be re-lubricated after every five flight hours, while the drive shaft for the tail rotor was similarly demanding. Due to its high susceptibility to dust ingestion, some operators would have to remove the Alouette's rectangular sand filters after every landing in order to clean them. ==Operational history== An Alouette II in flight, 2010 On 3 July 1956, prior to even entering civil service, the Alouette II was responsible for breaking new ground when it became the first helicopter to perform a mountain rescue mission, having been deployed to evacuate a mountaineer who had suffered from cardiac arrest at over . On 3 January 1957, the Alouette II was called upon again in order to rescue the crew of a crashed Sikorsky S-58, which had been searching for missing mountaineers Jean Vincendon and Fran√ßois Henry on Mont Blanc. On 2 May 1957, following a series of airborne trials, the Alouette II was awarded a French domestic certificate of airworthiness, which cleared the type to enter service with civil operators. Initial production was allocated to fulfil those orders placed by the French military, as well as by civilian customers. During 1957, the first deliveries of the Alouette II were made to the French Army.Cocks 2015, pp. 18‚Äì19. Shortly thereafter, large-scale orders for the type were received from several foreign nations, including the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, and Austria.McGowen 2005, p. 75. Almost immediately upon entering service, French forces commenced active combat operations using their fledgling Alouette II fleet; the type being placed into heavy use in the Algerian War, during which it made valuable contributions to France's activities in the theatre. When used as a troop- transport, up to four fully equipped soldiers could be airlifted at a time. Additionally, a number of Alouette IIs were modified to become what has been argued by some to have been the world's first helicopter gunships; in this capacity, it would have been typically armed with Nord Aviation-built SS.10 or SS.11 anti-tank missiles. Am Alouette SE.3130 II, formerly V-54 of the Swiss Air Force, now on the UK civil register as G-BVSD. It was built in 1964. The nation of Rhodesia emerged as a prolific user of both the Alouette II and its enlarged sibling, the Alouette III.Cocks 2015, p. 18. Early operations were flown with an emphasis on its use by the Army and British South Africa Police, including paramilitary and aerial reconnaissance operations. Throughout the 1960s, the type progressively spread into additional roles, including aerial supply, casualty evacuation, communications relays, and troop-transports.Cocks 2015, p. 20. Rhodesian aerial operations would typically involve flying under relatively high and hot conditions, which reduced the efficiency of aircraft in general; however, the Alouette II proved to be both hardy and relatively resistant to battle damage.Cocks 2015, p. 19. In order to extend the inadequate range of the type, fuel caches were strategically deployed across the country to be used for refuelling purposes. In order to improve performance, Rhodesia's Alouette II fleet was subject to extensive modifications, including changes to their refuelling apparatus, gun sights, cabin fittings, armouring, and armaments.Cocks 2015, pp. 20‚Äì22. Over time, the Rhodesian Security Forces developed an innovative deployment tactic of rapidly encircling and enveloping enemies, known as the Fireforce, for which the Alouette II served as a core component. The quick-reaction Fireforce battalions were centred at Centenary and Mount Darwin; however, a deliberate emphasis was placed on locating both rotorcraft and troops as close to a current or anticipated theatre of operations as would be feasibly possible.Cocks 2015, pp. 21‚Äì22. By 1975, at which point production of the type was terminated, in excess of 1,300 Alouette IIs had been constructed. The rotorcraft was also in use in over 80 countries, including 47 separate armed forces.Boyne 2011, p. 101. The Alouette II was produced and sold under licence by Brazil, Sweden, India and in the United States. While succeeded in some respects by the SA 315B Lama, which was itself a derivative of the Alouette II; the French Army ultimately replaced their Alouette II fleet with a newly developed observation and reconnaissance helicopter in the form of the A√©rospatiale AS350 √âcureuil.McGowen 2005, p. 124. During July 2018, a single Alouette II was involved in the escape of the French gangster R√©doine Fa√Ød from prison. The rotorcraft, which had been hijacked by gang members who held the pilot hostage at gunpoint, flew into the courtyard of R√©au prison, before flying to Roissy in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris; the event allegedly occurred in under ten minutes from take-off to escape.Sage, Andy. ‚ÄúHostage ordeal of helicopter pilot used for R√©doine Fa√Ød jail breakout.‚Äù ‚Äò'thetimes.co.uk'‚Äô, 4 July 2018.‚ÄúPrison break: French pilot of hijacked helicopter speaks of terrifying ordeal.‚Äù ‚Äò'thelocal.fr'‚Äô. 4 July 2018. ==Variants== * SE 3130 Alouette II ‚Äì After 1967 called SA 313B Alouette II. * SE 3131 Gouverneur ‚Äì Refined executive version with enclosed tailboom,\\"Business and Touring Aircraft: Sud-Aviation\\".

He won the Heisman Trophy in 1943 playing as a quarterback for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. ==Early life== Bertelli was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts, on June 18, 1921, to Italian immigrant parents. At Cathedral High School in Springfield, he won all-state honors in football, baseball, and hockey, and was senior class president. ==College career== When Bertelli entered Notre Dame in 1940, he was 6 feet 1 inch and 173 pounds, a skinny but highly regarded tailback in the single-wing formation used by most college teams. When Coach Elmer Layden left to become commissioner of the National Football League, Notre Dame's new coach Frank Leahy immediately noticed Bertelli's passing talents. As a sophomore, Bertelli, still a single- wing tailback, led the nation with a 56.9 percent passing average, completing 70 of 123 attempts. In 1942, Leahy switched to a modified T formation, in which Bertelli would play under the center and take every snap. As he told his budding star, \\"Bert, you're the finest passer and the worst runner I've ever coached.\\" That summer, preparing for his new role, Bertelli said he took \\"a thousand snaps...maybe a million.\\" Bertelli and the T-formation were an immediate success. He passed for 1,039 yards and 10 touchdowns. Celebrated sportswriter Grantland Rice referenced Bertelli as \\"the T-formation magician.\\" During his senior year in 1943, the Marine Corps activated Bertelli after six games of Notre Dame's 10-game season. In the six games Bertelli started in, he threw 36 passes, completing 25 with 10 touchdowns. Bertelli's six-game 1943 performance was enough to win the Heisman Trophy earning 648 votes; he was informed of his Heisman win while in boot camp at Parris Island. During Bertelli's three seasons, Notre Dame lost only three games. In 1943, Notre Dame won 43 to 5 on average. Bertelli's collegiate career earned him multiple awards. He was named to the 1942 and 1943 All-American teams. In the Heisman voting for America's outstanding college football player, Bertelli finished second in 1941 and sixth in 1942 before capturing the trophy in 1943. Though on active duty with the Marine Corps, the Boston Yanks selected Bertelli as their number one draft choice in 1944. Bertelli was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972. ==Military service== Bertelli during Marine Corps training While at Notre Dame, Bertelli enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1942 prior to his activation to active duty in the fall of 1943. In 1944, Bertelli was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, where he served as an infantry and recreation officer. After stops at Quantico, Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton, Bertelli embarked to participate in combat operations in the Pacific. After arriving from Guam in February 1945, he served in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a liaison officer with the 21st Marine Regiment, where he was nearly killed when a Japanese mortar shell landed 15 feet away from his position; four others were also caught in the explosion, with a doctor suffering serious wounds but surviving. Bertelli returned to Guam in March 1945 and served in Sasebo, Japan. When World War II ended, Bertelli was stationed in Nagasaki with the 2nd Marine Division as a second lieutenant. On January 1, 1946, he captained a Marine football team, the Nagasaki Bears, in the Atom Bowl against National Football League star Bill Osmanski and his Isahaya Tigers, where he threw two touchdown passes in the first half; although the two had promised to ensure the game end in a tie to promote unit morale, Osmanski scored the game-winning extra point in the 14‚Äì13 Tiger win. Bertelli's son Mike quipped in 2005, \\"My dad didn't lose any sleep over it, but of all the games he played in, he remembered that incident.\\" Bertelli later entered the United States Marine Corps Reserve where he was promoted to the rank of captain and served until 1957. ==Professional career== After returning to the United States in 1946, Bertelli signed with the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference; he also recruited Atom Bowl players Bill Joslin and Gorham Graham, who were still stationed in Japan, to play with him. Bertelli played for the Chicago Rockets between 1947 and 1948. After several knee surgeries, he retired prior to the 1949 season. After his retirement from professional football, Bertelli moved to Clifton, New Jersey, and operated several businesses, with Bertelli Enterprises, Inc. becoming a retail liquor outlet. He was the color analyst for the Princeton University football games broadcast on radio station WVNJ, 620 AM and 100.3 FM in the 1950s and 60s. ==Death and family== On June 26, 1999, Bertelli died at the age of 78 after a losing battle with brain cancer. He was buried in Immaculate Conception Cemetery, Montclair. He was survived by his wife, the former Gilda Passerini whom he married in 1944, and four children. Bertelli is the father of Robert Bertelli, better known as Bob Bert, a musician who played in Sonic Youth and other bands. ==References* * Category:1921 births Category:1999 deaths Category:All-American college football players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Chicago Rockets players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Los Angeles Dons players Category:National Football League first overall draft picks Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey players Category:United States Marines Category:Sportspeople from Clifton, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Springfield, Massachusetts Category:People from West Springfield, Massachusetts Category:Players of American football from Massachusetts Category:Burials in New Jersey ","title":"Angelo Bertelli"},{"id":"1272728","text":"The stained-glass ceiling is a sociological phenomenon in religious communities similar to the concept of the \\"glass ceiling\\". This concept revolves around the apparent difficulty for women who seek to gain a role within church leadership. The use of the term \\"stained-glass ceiling\\" is metaphorical, indicating a certain level of power or authority within structures that women tend not to rise above within church hierarchies. This could range from a group's de jure barring of women from positions like priest, bishop, pastor, rabbi, or similar clerical figures, to gender discrimination at the level of local congregations that prevent women from rising to any role of particular status or power. The stained-glass ceiling is a particular aspect of a broader trend of gender segregation and discrimination in religious communities, by use defined social roles and barriers typically justified by either tradition, dogma, or doctrine of the church group. The phrase \\"stained-glass\\" refers to the frequent placement of stained-glass artwork in places of Christian worship. ==Statistics== Among the most significant examples of resistance to female clergy has been in the position of senior pastor in large church settings. For example, in the United Methodist Church only two female ministers have ever led churches with membership numbers within the top 100 of United Methodist churches in the U.S. The most recent national data (2005) indicates that there are no female ministers currently leading top 100 membership UMCs. Resistance has eased more rapidly for the position of bishop in the United Methodist Church. For 2004‚Äì2008, 15 of the 50 (30%) United Methodist bishops serving the U.S. are women. ==Notable people== * Marjorie Matthews, elected bishop in the United Methodist Church in 1980.

It involves allowing private network communications to be sent across a public network (such as the Internet) through a process called encapsulation. Because tunneling involves repackaging the traffic data into a different form, perhaps with encryption as standard, it can hide the nature of the traffic that is run through a tunnel. The tunneling protocol works by using the data portion of a packet (the payload) to carry the packets that actually provide the service. Tunneling uses a layered protocol model such as those of the OSI or TCP/IP protocol suite, but usually violates the layering when using the payload to carry a service not normally provided by the network. Typically, the delivery protocol operates at an equal or higher level in the layered model than the payload protocol. == Uses == A tunneling protocol may, for example, allow a foreign protocol to run over a network that does not support that particular protocol, such as running IPv6 over IPv4. Another important use is to provide services that are impractical or unsafe to be offered using only the underlying network services, such as providing a corporate network address to a remote user whose physical network address is not part of the corporate network. === Circumventing firewall policy === Users can also use tunneling to \\"sneak through\\" a firewall, using a protocol that the firewall would normally block, but \\"wrapped\\" inside a protocol that the firewall does not block, such as HTTP. If the firewall policy does not specifically exclude this kind of \\"wrapping\\", this trick can function to get around the intended firewall policy (or any set of interlocked firewall policies). Another HTTP-based tunneling method uses the HTTP CONNECT method/command. A client issues the HTTP CONNECT command to a HTTP proxy. The proxy then makes a TCP connection to a particular server:port, and relays data between that server:port and the client connection. Because this creates a security hole, CONNECT-capable HTTP proxies commonly restrict access to the CONNECT method. The proxy allows connections only to specific ports, such as 443 for HTTPS. == Technical overview == As an example of network layer over network layer, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), a protocol running over IP (IP protocol number 47), often serves to carry IP packets, with RFC 1918 private addresses, over the Internet using delivery packets with public IP addresses. In this case, the delivery and payload protocols are the same, but the payload addresses are incompatible with those of the delivery network. It is also possible to establish a connection using the data link layer. The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) allows the transmission of frames between two nodes. A tunnel is not encrypted by default, it relies on the TCP/IP protocol chosen to determine the level of security. SSH uses port 22 to enable data encryption of payloads being transmitted over a public network (such as the Internet) connection, thereby providing VPN functionality. IPsec has an end-to-end Transport Mode, but can also operate in a tunneling mode through a trusted security gateway. To understand a particular protocol stack imposed by tunneling, network engineers must understand both the payload and delivery protocol sets. == Common tunneling protocols == * IP in IP (Protocol 4): IP in IPv4/IPv6 * SIT/IPv6 (Protocol 41): IPv6 in IPv4/IPv6 * GRE (Protocol 47): Generic Routing Encapsulation * OpenVPN (UDP port 1194) * SSTP (TCP port 443): Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol * IPSec (Protocol 50 and 51): Internet Protocol Security * L2TP (Protocol 115): Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol * VXLAN (UDP port 4789): Virtual Extensible Local Area Network. * WireGuard == Secure Shell tunneling == A Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel consists of an encrypted tunnel created through an SSH protocol connection. Users may set up SSH tunnels to transfer unencrypted traffic over a network through an encrypted channel. For example, Microsoft Windows machines can share files using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, a non-encrypted protocol. If one were to mount a Microsoft Windows file-system remotely through the Internet, someone snooping on the connection could see transferred files. To mount the Windows file-system securely, one can establish a SSH tunnel that routes all SMB traffic to the remote fileserver through an encrypted channel. Even though the SMB protocol itself contains no encryption, the encrypted SSH channel through which it travels offers security. Once an SSH connection has been established, the tunnel starts with SSH listening to a port on the remote or local host. Any connections to it are forwarded to the specified address and port originating from the opposing (remote or local, as previously) host. Tunneling a TCP- encapsulating payload (such as PPP) over a TCP-based connection (such as SSH's port forwarding) is known as \\"TCP-over-TCP\\", and doing so can induce a dramatic loss in transmission performance (a problem known as \\"TCP meltdown\\"), which is why virtual private network software may instead use a protocol simpler than TCP for the tunnel connection. However, this is often not a problem when using OpenSSH's port forwarding, because many use cases do not entail TCP-over-TCP tunneling; the meltdown is avoided because the OpenSSH client processes the local, client-side TCP connection in order to get to the actual payload that is being sent, and then sends that payload directly through the tunnel's own TCP connection to the server side, where the OpenSSH server similarly \\"unwraps\\" the payload in order to \\"wrap\\" it up again for routing to its final destination. Naturally, this wrapping and unwrapping also occurs in the reverse direction of the bidirectional tunnel. SSH tunnels provide a means to bypass firewalls that prohibit certain Internet services so long as a site allows outgoing connections. For example, an organization may prohibit a user from accessing Internet web pages (port 80) directly without passing through the organization's proxy filter (which provides the organization with a means of monitoring and controlling what the user sees through the web). But users may not wish to have their web traffic monitored or blocked by the organization's proxy filter. If users can connect to an external SSH server, they can create an SSH tunnel to forward a given port on their local machine to port 80 on a remote web server. To access the remote web server, users would point their browser to the local port at http://localhost/ Some SSH clients support dynamic port forwarding that allows the user to create a SOCKS 4/5 proxy. In this case users can configure their applications to use their local SOCKS proxy server. This gives more flexibility than creating an SSH tunnel to a single port as previously described. SOCKS can free the user from the limitations of connecting only to a predefined remote port and server. If an application doesn't support SOCKS, a proxifier can be used to redirect the application to the local SOCKS proxy server. Some proxifiers, such as Proxycap, support SSH directly, thus avoiding the need for an SSH client. In recent versions of OpenSSH it is even allowed to create layer 2 or layer 3 tunnels if both ends have enabled such tunneling capabilities. This creates \`tun\` (layer 3, default) or \`tap\` (layer 2) virtual interfaces on both ends of the connection. This allows normal network management and routing to be used, and when used on routers, the traffic for an entire subnetwork can be tunneled. A pair of \`tap\` virtual interfaces function like an Ethernet cable connecting both ends of the connection and can join kernel bridges. == See also == * HTTP tunnel * ICMP tunnel * NVGRE * GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) * Pseudo-wire * Tunnel broker * Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) * Virtual private network (VPN) * Stunnel * OSI model (Diagram) == References == == External links == * PortFusion distributed reverse / forward, local forward proxy and tunneling solution for all TCP protocols * SSH VPN tunnel, see the SSH-BASED VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS section * BarbaTunnel Project - Free open source implementation of HTTP-Tunnel and UDP-Tunnel on Windows Category:Network protocols Category:Computer security ","title":"Tunneling protocol"},{"id":"1272745","text":"Stephen Maxwell (11 October 1942 - 24 April 2012) was a Scottish nationalist politician and intellectual and, from the 1980s, a leading figure in the Scottish voluntary sector. Born in 1942 in Edinburgh to a Scottish medical family, he was brought up in Yorkshire, England, where his father, John, accepted a job as a surgeon on return from service in India during the Second World War. Maxwell was educated at Pocklington School, Yorkshire, and at 17 won a scholarship to study Moral Sciences at St John's College, Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge he made an unsuccessful attempt to move into journalism before going on to study for an MA in International Relations at the London School of Economics. On completion of the MA (for which he was awarded a distinction) he spent two years working on a PhD thesis on the irrationality of nuclear deterrence, also at the LSE. In the late 1960s he abandoned academia in England and returned to Scotland, where he balanced his work at the University of Edinburgh with campaigning for the Scottish National Party (SNP). In 1973, at the age of 31, he was appointed Head of Press for the SNP. His friend Owen Dudley Edwards, an Irish-born Edinburgh historian, remembers his press briefings as unique: \\"Hostile journalists were staggered to hear him explain that their objections to this or that in the party were not really rewarding subjects but that a more useful question to raise would be this other.\\" During the 1970s Maxwell played a formative role in developing the SNP's industrial and defence policies and became known as one of the most radical and articulate figures in the party. In 1979 he directed the SNP's campaign for a Yes vote in the referendum on Scottish devolution. The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and heralded the start of a period of decline in the SNP's fortunes. In 1979 Maxwell, together with Margo MacDonald, Owen Dudley Edwards and a number of younger nationalist activists (including Alex Salmond and Kenny McAskill) established the 79 Group, a left-wing faction within the SNP. Maxwell stood as the group's candidate in the 1979 Scottish National Party leadership election, taking a distant second place.Peter Lynch, \\"SNP - The History of the Scottish National Party\\" (Welsh Academic Press, 2002), p. 170. In 1981 Maxwell wrote and published a pamphlet, The Case for Left-Wing Nationalism, which became the 79 Group's defining statement. Later that year, the 79 Group was expelled by the party leadership, partly because of its alleged affiliations to Irish republicanism. Throughout the 1980s Maxwell wrote extensively for left-wing publications including Radical Scotland. Following a second failed attempt to move into journalism, he became involved with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations (SCVO). He worked for the SCVO until he retired from his post as Associate Director in 2009. Between 2010 and his death in April 2012 he chaired the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum and worked on a book, Arguing for Independence: Evidence, Risk and the Wicked Issues, which examines six cases for Scottish independence: the democratic, the economic, the social, the international, the cultural and the environmental. It was published in September 2012. Upon his hearing of Maxwell's death, Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond said, \\"During Stephen‚Äôs long career he made an immense contribution to the national movement in Scotland, and was a key figure in the development of the modern SNP. But Stephen‚Äôs loss will be felt much more widely than just politics. Over a quarter of a century with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, Stephen was a tireless campaigner for the third sector in Scotland, helping it through the difficult days of the 1980s and establishing it as a major force in post-devolution Scotland. Above all, I will remember Stephen‚Äôs courtesy to all, his extraordinary intellect combined with gentle persuasiveness, and his lifelong service to others.\\" ==Death== He died on 24 April 2012, aged 69.

Since at least the 1990s, scientists have researched whether the now-ubiquitous radiation associated with mobile phone antennas or cell phone towers is affecting human health. Mobile phone networks use various bands of RF frequency, some of which overlap with the microwave range. Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation. In response to public concern, the World Health Organization established the International EMF Project in 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300 GHz. They have stated that although extensive research has been conducted into possible health effects of exposure to many parts of the frequency spectrum, all reviews conducted so far have indicated that, as long as exposures are below the limits recommended in the ICNIRP (1998) EMF guidelines, which cover the full frequency range from 0‚Äì300 GHz, such exposures do not produce any known adverse health effect. In 2011, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an agency of the World Health Organization, classified wireless radiation as Group 2B ‚Äì possibly carcinogenic. That means that there \\"could be some risk\\" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of wireless devices needs to be conducted. The WHO states that \\"A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.\\" International guidelines on exposure levels to microwave frequency EMFs such as ICNIRP limit the power levels of wireless devices and it is uncommon for wireless devices to exceed the guidelines. These guidelines only take into account thermal effects, as non-thermal effects have not been conclusively demonstrated. The official stance of the British Health Protection Agency (HPA) is that \\"[T]here is no consistent evidence to date that WiFi and WLANs adversely affect the health of the general population\\", but also that \\"... it is a sensible precautionary approach ... to keep the situation under ongoing review ...\\". In a 2018 statement, the FDA said that \\"the current safety limits are set to include a 50-fold safety margin from observed effects of Radio-frequency energy exposure\\". ==Exposure== === Mobile phones === A mobile phone connects to the telephone network by radio waves exchanged with a local antenna and automated transceiver called a cellular base station (cell site or cell tower). The service area served by each provider is divided into small geographical areas called cells, and all the phones in a cell communicate with that cell's antenna. Both the phone and the tower have radio transmitters which communicate with each other. Since in a cellular network the same radio channels are reused every few cells, cellular networks use low power transmitters to avoid radio waves from one cell spilling over and interfering with a nearby cell using the same frequencies. Mobile phones are limited to an equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) output of 3 watts, and the network continuously adjusts the phone transmitter to the lowest power consistent with good signal quality, reducing it to as low as one milliwatt when near the cell tower. Tower channel transmitters usually have an EIRP power output of around 50 watts. Even when it is not being used, unless it is turned off, a mobile phone periodically emits radio signals on its control channel, to keep contact with its cell tower and for functions like handing off the phone to another tower if the user crosses into another cell. When the user is making a call, the phone transmits a signal on a second channel which carries the user's voice. Existing 2G, 3G, and 4G networks use frequencies in the UHF or low microwave bands, 600 MHz to 3.5 GHz. Many household wireless devices such as WiFi networks, garage door openers, and baby monitors use other frequencies in this same frequency range. Radio waves decrease rapidly in intensity by the inverse square of distance as they spread out from a transmitting antenna. So the phone transmitter, which is held close to the user's face when talking, is a much greater source of human exposure than the tower transmitter, which is typically at least hundreds of metres away from the user. A user can reduce their exposure by using a headset and keeping the phone itself farther away from their body. Next generation 5G cellular networks, which began deploying in 2019, use higher frequencies in or near the millimetre wave band, 24 to 52 GHz. Millimetre waves are absorbed by atmospheric gases so 5G networks will use smaller cells than previous cellular networks, about the size of a city block. Instead of a cell tower, each cell will use an array of multiple small antennas mounted on existing buildings and utility poles. In general, millimeter waves penetrate less deeply into biological tissue than microwaves, and are mainly absorbed within the first centimeter of the body surface. === Cordless phones === The HPA also says that due to the mobile phone's adaptive power ability, a DECT cordless phone's radiation could actually exceed the radiation of a mobile phone. The HPA explains that while the DECT cordless phone's radiation has an average output power of 10 mW, it is actually in the form of 100 bursts per second of 250 mW, a strength comparable to some mobile phones.http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/Radiation/UnderstandingRadiation/InformationSheets/info_CordlessTelephones/ === Wireless networking === Most wireless LAN equipment is designed to work within predefined standards. Wireless access points are also often close to people, but the drop off in power over distance is fast, following the inverse-square law. However, wireless laptops are typically used close to people. WiFi had been anecdotally linked to electromagnetic hypersensitivity but research into electromagnetic hypersensitivity has found no systematic evidence supporting claims made by sufferers. Users of wireless networking devices are typically exposed for much longer periods than for mobile phones and the strength of wireless devices is not significantly less. Whereas a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) phone can range from 21 dBm (125 mW) for Power Class 4 to 33 dBm (2W) for Power class 1, a wireless router can range from a typical 15 dBm (30 mW) strength to 27 dBm (500 mW) on the high end. However, wireless routers are typically located significantly farther away from users' heads than a phone the user is handling, resulting in far less exposure overall. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) says that if a person spends one year in a location with a WiFi hot spot, they will receive the same dose of radio waves as if they had made a 20-minute call on a mobile phone. The HPA's position is that \\"... radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones.\\" It also saw \\"... no reason why schools and others should not use WiFi equipment.\\" In October 2007, the HPA launched a new \\"systematic\\" study into the effects of WiFi networks on behalf of the UK government, in order to calm fears that had appeared in the media in a recent period up to that time\\". Michael Clark of the HPA says published research on mobile phones and masts does not add up to an indictment of WiFi. ==Effects studied== ===Blood‚Äìbrain barrier=== A 2010 review stated that \\"The balance of experimental evidence does not support an effect of 'non-thermal' radio frequency fields\\" on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, but noted that research on low frequency effects and effects in humans was sparse. A 2012 study of low-frequency radiation on humans found \\"no evidence for acute effects of short-term mobile phone radiation on cerebral blood flow\\". ===Cancer=== There is no strong or consistent evidence that mobile phone use increases the risk of getting brain cancer or other head tumors. The United States National Cancer Institute points out that \\"Radiofrequency energy, unlike ionizing radiation, does not cause DNA damage that can lead to cancer. Its only consistently observed biological effect in humans is tissue heating. In animal studies, it has not been found to cause cancer or to enhance the cancer-causing effects of known chemical carcinogens.\\" The majority of human studies have failed to find a link between mobile phone use and cancer. In 2011 the IARC, a World Health Organization working group, classified mobile phone use as \\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\\". The IARC summed up their conclusion with: \\"The human epidemiological evidence was mixed. Several small early case‚Äìcontrol studies were considered to be largely uninformative. A large cohort study showed no increase in risk of relevant tumours, but it lacked information on level of mobile-phone use and there were several potential sources of misclassification of exposure. The bulk of evidence came from reports of the INTERPHONE study, a very large international, multicentre case‚Äìcontrol study and a separate large case‚Äìcontrol study from Sweden on gliomas and meningiomas of the brain and acoustic neuromas. While affected by selection bias and information bias to varying degrees, these studies showed an association between glioma and acoustic neuroma and mobile-phone use; specifically in people with highest cumulative use of mobile phones, in people who had used mobile phones on the same side of the head as that on which their tumour developed, and in people whose tumour was in the temporal lobe of the brain (the area of the brain that is most exposed to RF radiation when a wireless phone is used at the ear)\\" The CDC states that no scientific evidence definitively answers whether mobile phone use causes cancer.What has research shown about the possible cancer- causing effects of radiofrequency energy?, United States National Cancer Institute In a 2018 statement, the US Food and Drug Administration said that \\"the current safety limits are set to include a 50-fold safety margin from observed effects of radiofrequency energy exposure\\". On 1 November 2018, the US National Toxicology Program published the final version (after peer review that was performed through March 2018) of its \\"eagerly anticipated\\" study using rats and mice, conducted over some ten years. This report concludes after the review with an updated statement that \\"there is clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of radio frequency radiation (RFR) like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors.... There was also some evidence of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats. For female rats, and male and female mice, the evidence was equivocal as to whether cancers observed were associated with exposure to RFR\\". An early analysis of preliminary results issued by the National Toxicology Program had indicated that due to such issues as the inconsistent appearances of \\"signals for harm\\" within and across species and the increased chances of false positives due to the multiplicity of tests, the positive results seen are more likely due to random chance. The full results of the study were released for peer review in February 2018. ===Male fertility=== A decline in male sperm quality has been observed over several decades. Studies on the impact of mobile radiation on male fertility are conflicting, and the effects of the radio frequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) emitted by these devices on the reproductive systems are currently under active debate. A 2012 review concluded that \\"together, the results of these studies have shown that RF-EMR decreases sperm count and motility and increases oxidative stress\\". A 2017 study of 153 men that attended an academic fertility clinic in Boston, Massachusetts found that self-reported mobile phone use was not related to semen quality, and that carrying a mobile phone in the pants pocket was not related to semen quality. ===Electromagnetic hypersensitivity=== Some users of mobile phones and similar devices have reported feeling various non-specific symptoms during and after use. Studies have failed to link any of these symptoms to electromagnetic exposure. In addition, EHS is not a recognized medical diagnosis. ===Glucose metabolism=== According to the National Cancer Institute, two small studies exploring whether and how mobile phone radiation affects brain glucose metabolism showed inconsistent results. ===Effects on children=== A report from the Australian Government's Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) in June 2017 noted that: ==Base stations== Cellular Mobile and UHF Antenna Tower with multiple Antennas Experts consulted by France considered it was mandatory that the main antenna axis should not to be directly in front of a living place at a distance shorter than 100 metres.http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&parentid;=424 page 37 This recommendation was modified in 2003T√©l√©phonie mobile et sant√©, Rapport √† l'Agence Fran√ßaise de S√©curit√© Sanitaire Environnementale, 21 March 2003 at http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&parentid;=424 to say that antennas located within a 100-metre radius of primary schools or childcare facilities should be better integrated into the city scape and was not included in a 2005 expert report.T√©l√©phonie mobile et sant√©, Rapport du groupe d‚Äôexperts, l'Agence Fran√ßaise de S√©curit√© Sanitaire Environnementale, April 2005 at http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&parentid;=424 The Agence fran√ßaise de s√©curit√© sanitaire environnementale , says that there is no demonstrated short-term effect of electromagnetic fields on health, but that there are open questions for long-term effects, and that it is easy to reduce exposure via technological improvements.\\"Radiofr√©quences : actualisation de l'expertise (2009)\\", l'Agence Fran√ßaise de S√©curit√© Sanitaire Environnementale, April 2005 at http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&parentid;=424 A 2020 study in Environmental Research found that \\"Although direct causation of negative human health effects from RFR from cellular phone base stations has not been finalized, there is already enough medical and scientific evidence to warrant long-term liability concerns for companies deploying cellular phone towers\\" and thus recommended voluntary setbacks from schools and hospitals. ==Safety standards and licensing== To protect the population living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to harmonize the different standards in existence. Radio base licensing procedures have been established in the majority of urban spaces regulated either at municipal/county, provincial/state or national level. Mobile telephone service providers are, in many regions, required to obtain construction licenses, provide certification of antenna emission levels and assure compliance to ICNIRP standards and/or to other environmental legislation. Many governmental bodies also require that competing telecommunication companies try to achieve sharing of towers so as to decrease environmental and cosmetic impact. This issue is an influential factor of rejection of installation of new antennas and towers in communities. The safety standards in the US are set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC has based its standards primarily on those standards established by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) a Congressionally chartered scientific organization located in the WDC area and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), specifically Subcommittee 4 of the \\"International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety\\". Switzerland has set safety limits lower than the ICNIRP limits for certain \\"sensitive areas\\" (classrooms, for example). In March 2020, for the first time since 1998, ICNIRP updated its guidelines for exposures to frequencies over 6 GHz, including the frequencies used for 5G that are over 6 GHz. The Commission added a restriction on acceptable levels of exposure to the whole body, added a restriction on acceptable levels for brief exposures to small regions of the body, and reduced the maximum amount of exposure permitted over a small region of the body. ==Lawsuits== In the US, personal injury lawsuits have been filed by individuals against manufacturers (including Motorola, NEC, Siemens, and Nokia) on the basis of allegations of causation of brain cancer and death. In US federal courts, expert testimony relating to science must be first evaluated by a judge, in a Daubert hearing, to be relevant and valid before it is admissible as evidence. In a 2002 case against Motorola, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of wireless handheld telephones could cause brain cancer and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff's cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs, accepted a motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts, and denied a motion to exclude the testimony of the defendants' experts. Two separate cases in Italy, in 2009 and 2017, resulted in pensions being awarded to plaintiffs who had claimed their benign brain tumors were the result of prolonged mobile phone use in professional tasks, for 5‚Äì6 hours a day, which they ruled different from non- professional use. ==Precautions== ===Precautionary principle=== In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the precautionary principle could be voluntarily adopted in this case. It follows the recommendations of the European Community for environmental risks. According to the WHO, the \\"precautionary principle\\" is \\"a risk management policy applied in circumstances with a high degree of scientific uncertainty, reflecting the need to take action for a potentially serious risk without awaiting the results of scientific research.\\" Other less stringent recommended approaches are prudent avoidance principle and as low as reasonably practicable. Although all of these are problematic in application, due to the widespread use and economic importance of wireless telecommunication systems in modern civilization, there is an increased popularity of such measures in the general public, though also evidence that such approaches may increase concern. They involve recommendations such as the minimization of usage, the limitation of use by at-risk population (e.g., children), the adoption of phones and microcells with as low as reasonably practicable levels of radiation, the wider use of hands-free and earphone technologies such as Bluetooth headsets, the adoption of maximal standards of exposure, RF field intensity and distance of base stations antennas from human habitations, and so forth. Overall, public information remains a challenge as various health consequences are evoked in the literature and by the media, putting populations under chronic exposure to potentially worrying information. ===Precautionary measures and health advisories=== In May 2011, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer announced it was classifying electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and other sources as \\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\\" and advised the public to adopt safety measures to reduce exposure, like use of hands-free devices or texting.http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf Some national radiation advisory authorities, including those of Austria, France, Lay article in making comment at Germany, and Sweden, have recommended measures to minimize exposure to their citizens. Examples of the recommendations are: * Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head. * Keep the mobile phone away from the body. * Do not use telephone in a car without an external antenna. The use of \\"hands-free\\" was not recommended by the British Consumers' Association in a statement in November 2000, as they believed that exposure was increased. However, measurements for the (then) UK Department of Trade and IndustryManning, MI and Gabriel, CHB, SAR tests on mobile phones used with and without personal hands-free kits, SARtest Report 0083 for the DTI, July 2000 (PDF) at http://straff-x.com/SAR-Hands-Free-Kits- July-2000.pdf and others for the French T√©l√©phonie mobile & sant√©, Report for l'Agence fran√ßaise de s√©curit√© sanitaire environnementale (Afsse), June 2005 at http://www.afsse.fr/index.php?pageid=671&parentid;=619# showed substantial reductions. In 2005, Professor Lawrie Challis and others said clipping a ferrite bead onto hands-free kits stops the radio waves travelling up the wire and into the head. Several nations have advised moderate use of mobile phones for children.For example, Finland and France A journal by Gandhi et al. in 2006 states that children receive higher levels of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). When 5- and 10-year olds are compared to adults, they receive about 153% higher SAR levels. Also, with the permittivity of the brain decreasing as one gets older and the higher relative volume of the exposed growing brain in children, radiation penetrates far beyond the mid-brain. ==== 5G ==== The FDA is quoted as saying that \\"...continues to believe that the current safety limits for cellphone radiofrequency energy exposure remain acceptable for protecting the public health.‚Äù In the beginning of the year 2020 Slovenia stopped the deployment of the 5G technology as a precaution due to health concerns. During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation circulated claiming that 5G networks contribute to the spread of COVID-19. ===Bogus products=== Products have been advertised that claim to shield people from EM radiation from mobile phones; in the US the Federal Trade Commission published a warning that \\"Scam artists follow the headlines to promote products that play off the newsand prey on concerned people.\\" According to the FTC, \\"there is no scientific proof that so-called shields significantly reduce exposure from electromagnetic emissions. Products that block only the earpieceor another small portion of the phoneare totally ineffective because the entire phone emits electromagnetic waves.\\" Such shields \\"may interfere with the phone's signal, cause it to draw even more power to communicate with the base station, and possibly emit more radiation.\\" The FTC has enforced false advertising claims against companies that sell such products. ==See also== *Electromagnetic radiation and health *Bioelectromagnetism * BioInitiative Report * COSMOS cohort study * Microwave News * Possible health effects of body scanners * Radiation biology ==References== ==External links== * Summary and full text of \\"Possible effects of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) on Human Health\\", the 2007 scientific assessment of the European Commission's SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks). * WHO International EMF Program * FDA Cell Phone Facts * FCC Radio Frequency Safety * Medline Plus, by US National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health (NIH) * Public health and electromagnetic fields: Overview of European Commission activities Category:Radiobiology Category:Mobile telecommunications Category:Wireless Category:Health effects by subject Category:Medical physics Category:Environmental controversies ","title":"Wireless device radiation and health"},{"id":"1272759","text":"Blackfoot is an American Southern rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, United States, formed during 1969. Though they primarily play with a Southern rock style, they are also known as a hard rock act. The band's classic lineup consisted of guitarist and vocalist Rickey Medlocke, guitarist Charlie Hargrett, bassist Greg T. Walker, and drummer Jakson Spires. They had a number of successful albums during the 1970s and early 1980s, including Strikes (1979), Tomcattin' (1980) and Marauder (1981). ==History== ===Early years=== During the spring of 1969, Rickey Medlocke and Greg T. Walker met New York City native Charlie Hargrett in Jacksonville and organized the band \\"Fresh Garbage\\", featuring Medlocke on drums and vocals, Walker on bass, Hargrett on guitar and Ron Sciabarasi on keyboards. They played most of their shows at The Comic Book Club on Forsyth Street. That autumn, Fresh Garbage dissolved following the departure of Sciabarasi, who was drafted and sent to Vietnam. However, Medlocke, Walker and Hargrett regrouped and formed the band \\"Hammer\\", with Medlocke switching to vocalist/guitarist and with new recruits Jakson Spires (drums; born on April 12, 1951, died on March 16, 2005), DeWitt Gibbs (keyboards) and Jerry Zambito (guitars) joining the band. Gibbs and Zambito had previously played together in Tangerine. They soon relocated to Gainesville, Florida to be the house band of Dub's, a well-known topless bar on the outskirts of town. About the beginning of 1970, the band relocated to Manhattan after a friend, who was working in a music publishing company, told her boss about the band and he had them move to New York City. During the early spring of the same year, the band, after learning of another band on the West Coast named Hammer, decided to change their name to Blackfoot to represent the American Indian heritage of its members: Jakson Spires (from Oklahoma) had a Cheyenne/French father and a Cherokee mother; Rickey Medlocke's father was Lakota Sioux and Blackfoot Indian, and his mother's side is Creek/Cherokee, Scottish and Irish; Greg \\"Two Wolf\\" Walker is part Eastern (Muskogee) Creek, a tribe recognized by the state of Florida, but not federally. Charlie Hargrett was the only white man of the original, classic line-up. When the band failed to acquire a contract as a result of their relocation, Gibbs quit the band and Medlocke began playing rhythm guitar full- time. During the spring of 1971, Medlocke and Walker accepted an offer to join Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blackfoot ended for a time. Still in New Jersey, Charlie Hargrett played briefly in \\"No Name\\" a band formed around him. They rehearsed at Bondy's House nearby in Morristown and included New Jersey locals Steve Bondy on guitar, Bert Carey on bass and Andy Peebles on drums. \\"No Name\\" played covers as well as original songs briefly in Budd Lake & Stanhope, New Jersey. There was a brief attempt to regroup during 1972, but Medlocke quit again and Walker joined the band Cross Country for a short period. Hargrett remained in the north, living in Hackettstown, New Jersey. During August 1972, Blackfoot's old friend and roadie, John Vassiliou, visited Hargrett with Reidsville, North Carolina bassist Leonard Stadler from the band Blackberry Hill. Hargrett decided to relocate to North Carolina and invited Medlocke, who had left Lynyrd Skynyrd by this time, to reform Blackfoot with Stadler on bass guitar and Spires returning as drummer. Danny Johnson (later with the bands Derringer and Steppenwolf), from a Louisiana group, Axis, was employed as second guitarist. But Medlocke soon decided to be both main vocalist and guitarist again, and so Johnson's tenure with the band was brief. During the summer of 1973, Stadler quit the band after a tumor was discovered on one of his lungs. It later dissolved, but Stadler decided to leave secular music to join a gospel group. He eventually became a Methodist minister. Greg T. Walker was invited to rejoin at this juncture. By 1974, the band had returned their base of operations to the Northeast (Northern New Jersey) and Medlocke developed nodes on his vocal cords and temporarily lost his voice. Another singer, Patrick Jude, was brought into the band. After a brief time, Medlocke was able to sing again and Jude was dismissed. Soon afterward, Medlocke and Walker sent producers/session players Jimmy Johnson and David Hood a copy of Blackfoot's material. Johnson and Hood had worked with Medlocke and Walker in Muscle Shoals, Alabama when they were there recording with Lynyrd Skynyrd. No Reservations was released by the company Island Records during 1975 as part of a deal organized by Blackfoot's then manager Lou Manganiello, and their second record album, Flying High, was vended by Epic Records company during 1976. Both record albums were produced by Johnson and Hood. ===Mid 1970s=== By late 1975, the group was living back in Gainesville, Florida. During 1977, they communicated with Black Oak Arkansas' manager, Butch Stone, who hired them as the backing group for one of his clients, Ruby Starr, who had been a backup singer for Black Oak but was now becoming self-employed. After the stint with Ruby ended during 1978, they met Brownsville Station manager Al Nalli and his partner Jay Frey, who got them a contract with Atco Records. Blackfoot Strikes, produced by Al Nalli and engineered by Brownsville Station drummer Henry Weck, was recorded in Nalli's basement studio in Ann Arbor, Michigan and was completed by January 1979. It was destined to be the band's most commercially successful effort. The song \\"Train, Train\\", written by Rickey's grandfather, \\"Shorty\\" Medlocke, became their first success and best known song. \\"Highway Song\\" proved to be another success for them later that year. The group toured frequently during 1979; late during the year they opened for the band The Who at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan while developing their next album, Tomcattin, which was released during 1980. They went on to release the album Marauder during 1981 and Highway Song during 1982. ===1980s=== During the early 1980s, the \\"Southern rock\\" genre was considered passe by the pop music press, so the band began attempting to change their style somewhat. They decided to add keyboards to the group once again. Organist Ken Hensley (ex-Uriah Heep) was contacted and agreed to join during 1982 in time for their next record album, Siogo. But the poor sales for Siogo had the band thinking they might have to \\"modernize\\" for the new MTV generation. It was thought that perhaps Hargrett with his \\"biker type\\" appearance might not be appropriate for television. Hargrett reluctantly decided to end his employment with the band during January 1984 ,having not played on their next album, Vertical Smiles, which had been recorded in Atlanta in late 1983 with former Yes band's engineer Eddy Offord. This album was rejected by Atco. But the revamped version, which was released finally during October 1984, also failed to sell well. Ken Hensley, no longer accustomed to Blackfoot's intense tour schedule, quit by late 1984 and was replaced by former Axe band's singer/guitarist Bobby Barth. But by December 1985, with their popularity waning and good-quality engagements becoming few, the band decided to quit. During February 1986 the Blackfoot company was dissolved. Medlocke decided to continue with a new team that included Doug \\"Bingo\\" Bare (keyboards, synthetics, backup vocals, ex- Whiteface), Jerry \\"Wizzard\\" Seay (bass, backing vocals, from Mother's Finest) and Harold Seay (drums, percussion). For their 1987 album Rick Medlocke and Blackfoot (their final album for Atlantic Records), the new group was attempting a more radio-style 1980s rock music sound. Jeff Stevens played bass guitar for one track. During 1988, Wizzard and Seay quit and Gunner Ross (drums, percussion), bassist Mark Mendoza (formerly of The Dictators) and Neal Casal (guitar) were employed. Mendoza quit by the end of the year and Rikki Mayr (ex-Lizzy Borden band) began playing bass for the band during early 1989. ===1990s=== During 1990, a new album, Medicine Man, was released by the independent Loop company. By 1992, Medlocke had revamped the team yet again and hired three other players: guitarist Mark Woerpel (former front man for the band Warp Drive out of Milwaukee, who had also done some studio work for Medlocke for earlier albums), Benny Rappa (drums, percussion, a former Whiteface player) and Tim Stunson on bass guitar. Another new album, After the Reign, was released during 1994 by the company Wildcat and, like Medicine Man, had something of the band's old style. Also during 1994, the Rhino Records collection Rattlesnake Rock N' Roll: The Best of Blackfoot was released. By 1996, Blackfoot was: Medlocke, drummer Stet Howland, John Housley (from Ragady Ann) for lead and rhythm guitar and Bryce Barnes (from Edwin Dare) for bass guitar. That same year, Medlocke rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd, this time as a guitarist. But he continued to tour with Blackfoot honoring all dates booked through 1997, then disbanded the group to concentrate on Lynyrd Skynyrd. Live On The King Biscuit Flower Hour, a 1983 concert recording, was released during early 1998, and EMI released Live during 2000, also culled from the band's heyday. ===2004-2011=== During 2004 a second resurrection of Blackfoot occurred with original members Jakson Spires, Greg T. Walker and Charlie Hargrett. Medlocke was not available, so the lead vocals role was given to Bobby Barth (band member of Axe). Spires died suddenly on March 16, 2005, at age 53, of an aneurysm, but the band decided to persevere. In compliance with the will of Spires, Austrian drummer Christoph Ullmann was hired as the new drummer. During 2006, the band toured and was joined by Skinny Molly's Jay Johnson (the son of Jimmy Johnson, their original co-producer) for guitar and vocals after Barth was sidelined for a shoulder and neck operation. Barth resumed performing later that year, as Johnson stayed on for a short time. During November 2006, Ullman left to return to Austria and was succeeded by Mark McConnell. In April 2007 Blackfoot dismissed Johnson and McConnell. That year the band toured and consisted of bassist Walker, Hargrett, Barth and drummer Michael Sollars. Later that year a live DVD was released. In 2009 Scott Craig was employed as drummer to succeed Sollars. During the spring of 2010, Barth was forced to undergo emergency back surgery. Former Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Mike Estes and current vocalist/guitarist for Skinny Molly was then employed for lead vocals/guitar and Kurt Pietro (drummer of Skinny Molly) replaced Scott Craig on drums. In the summer of 2011 Charlie Hargrett was replaced by Randy Peak. ===2012-2015=== In 2012, Rickey Medlocke reformed Blackfoot with a completely new line-up (see Members below), with him acting as their producer. Walker, Hargrett, Estes and Pietro subsequently regrouped under the band name Fired Guns. In 2015, Walker, Hargrett, Barth and Ullman began performing together again under the band name Warrior's Pride. Medlocke continues to perform with Lynyrd Skynyrd. === 2016 === On August 5, 2016, Blackfoot released their first album in 20 years, Southern Native.

The parish, which lies about north-east of the town of Holsworthy, comprises the five hamlets of Thornbury, Woodacott, Brendon, Lashbrook and South Wonford. These five hamlets are spread over an area of some , with a distance of from Brendon to Thornbury Church. Hence, the community is quite widespread, with the only focal point being the Green at Woodacott Cross. The parish is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Milton Damerel, Bradford, Cookbury and Holsworthy Hamlets. In 2011, its population was 290, in 120 households, little changed from the 291 residents it had in 1901. The parish church, dedicated to St Peter, is in the hamlet of Thornbury and has a fine Norman south doorway dated to around 1150. Although most of the rest of the fabric dates to the early 14th century, it was partly hidden by a heavy restoration in 1876 during which the tower was also increased in height by five feet. In the churchyard there is an arch which used to lead to the village pound where stray animals were kept. In 2014 a group of volunteers photographed and transcribed all of the gravestones and inscriptions in and around both the Church and Chapel. The results are available here. There is a Methodist Chapel at Woodacott, which was originally built in 1833, with the current building dating from 1891. It is now closed for worship. The nearest primary school is in Bradford.

Allen provided pivotal leadership for transforming the segregated and economically stagnant Old South into the progressive New South. Allen took the helm of the Ivan Allen Company, his father's office supply business, in 1946 and within three years had the company bringing in annual revenues of several millions of dollars.Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn: A nonfiction account of Ivan Allen's rise to social, economic, and political prominence In 1961, he authored a white paper for revitalizing Atlanta. It was adopted by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and became the Six Point Forward Atlanta program. This plan would become his roadmap as mayor for creating an economic surge that established the infrastructure, business, education, arts, sports, and international presence that are the foundations for modern Atlanta.Mayor: Notes on the Sixties Allen was a founding member of Atlanta's influential Commerce Club, which he chaired until his death in 2003.(2003) Ivan Allen Jr. Family-placed Death Notice. Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Atlanta, GA. He became president of the city Chamber of Commerce in 1961 and during this same year ran for mayor, defeating the staunch segregationist, Lester Maddox. Convinced that the South could never thrive economically under segregation, Allen supported the demands of African Americans for their accommodation at public facilities. On his first day in office, he ordered the removal of all \\"white\\" and \\"colored\\" signs from facilities in city hall. Racial alliances forged by Allen with Martin Luther King Jr. and others in the African American community, along with his advocacy for the public accommodation of African Americans in the white community, allowed Allen to guide Atlanta through the turbulence of racial integration without the violence that occurred in many southern cities. In a key address to the public, he asked Atlantans to eliminate racial segregation and in doing so, to set an example to inspire \\"all the world\\". At the behest of President John F. Kennedy, Allen testified before Congress on behalf of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was the only white southern politician of significance to do so. After his testimony, Allen and his family were under death threats and required police protection for a year. ==Early life== Ivan Earnest Allen Jr. was born in Atlanta on March 15, 1911, the only son of Ivan Allen Sr. (1876‚Äì1968) and Irene Beaumont Allen (1889‚Äì1972). His father Allen Sr. was co-founder of the Ivan Allen Company (1900), an office supply and furniture store that, by 1925, had about fifty employees and was one of Atlanta's best-known businesses. Allen Sr. was also a founding member of the Atlanta Rotary Club, served as president of the new Atlanta Convention Bureau (1913‚Äì1917), president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (1917), two years as senator in the Georgia state legislature (1918‚Äì1919), and was the treasurer of the Georgia Democratic Party in 1936. In an effort to attract northern capital to Atlanta, Allen Sr. headed the Atlanta chamber's \\"Forward Atlanta\\" booster campaign (1926‚Äì1929), a strategy that would lure almost 700 new businesses to Atlanta and serve to influence Allen Jr.'s future as a businessman and civic leader. From an early age, Allen understood that his family was one of privilege. He began attending Boys High School in 1927, and was one of the few students to own a car. That same year, his father's name was published for the first time in the Social Cities Register, an annual list of elites in Richmond, Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah, and Augusta. He regularly attended the First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta with his parents, and would later serve as an elder for many years and an active member until his death. ==Education== Initially an indifferent student, Allen asserted himself during his last year at Boys High, earning a spot on the honor roll. In 1929, he enrolled in the School of Commerce at the Georgia Institute of Technology. During his first year at Georgia Tech, he was one of only five students in the student body of about two thousand to make straight A's. He graduated cum laude in 1933, with a Bachelor of Science in Commerce. While at Georgia Tech, he served as president of the student body, vice president of the Inter- Fraternity Council, cadet colonel of the ROTC, president of Omicron Delta Kappa, vice-president of ANAK, president of the Georgia Phi chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, was a member of the Honor Roll, and a member of the Dean's List. At one point, he led a student protest against Governor Eugene Talmadge when the board of regents abolished the School of Commerce at Tech and moved it to the University of Georgia. During one summer as a college student he served as postmaster, strung tennis rackets, and worked as a counselor for young campers at Camp Greenbriar in Alderson, West Virginia. He was paid $500 and invested this money in Coca-Cola stock, of which he wrote was \\"my first investment and probably the greatest I ever made\\". ==Business career== After graduating from Georgia Tech in 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression, Allen refused offers from other companies and began his lifetime of work in the family business, which was at the time called the Ivan Allen‚ÄìMarshall Company. That summer, he worked in the basement of the business, learning from a black employee named Arthur Wright and earning $100 per month. At the time, the business consisted of one Atlanta store and grossed $196,000. In 1936, he married Louise Richardson, granddaughter of Hugh T. Inman, and member of one of the most prominent families in Atlanta. He continued working at the company until he was called to the army to serve in World War II from 1942 to 1945. After the War, he worked in the statehouse from the fall of 1945 until the spring of 1946. In March 1946, Allen Sr. asked his son to return to the family business, in light of the fact that his partner, Charles Marshall, was in poor health and had decided to retire. Allen resigned from his position as executive secretary to the governor, and became president his father's company in 1946. In 1948, Marshall died and willed his half of the Ivan Allen‚ÄìMarshall Company to Allen Jr., giving the Allen family ownership of the firm. By 1949, the firm had more than two hundred employees and annual revenues of several million dollars. Together with his father, he changed the name to the Ivan Allen Company in 1953. The company would flourish over the next four decades under his leadership and that of his late son, Ivan Allen III, becoming the region's preeminent office supplies and furniture dealer, with 17 offices across the South. Ivan Allen Jr. was president of Ivan Allen Company from 1946 to 1970 and chairman from 1970 to 1995. In 1988, the Ivan Allen Company boasted $116 million in revenues. In 1999, the supplies division of the Ivan Allen Company was sold to Staples, Inc. The furniture division, now known as Ivan Allen Workspace, is headed by his son, Inman Allen. ==Political and civic involvement== In 1936, Allen actively campaigned for Georgia Governor Eurith D. Rivers, serving in a number of state-government positions during the Rivers administration between 1936 and 1940. As treasurer of the State Hospital Authority, he raised $2.5 million by passing the state's first revenue certificate bond issue to rebuild the white section of the old state mental hospital at Milledgeville. When Pearl Harbor was struck in late 1941, he was called into the army as a reserve officer. During World War II, he served as a supply officer and directed the field division of the Selective Service System in Georgia for the United States Army. He entered the service in 1942 as a second lieutenant and was discharged in 1945 as a major. When the War ended, an old college friend who was also the progressive young Governor of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, went to Washington and asked the Secretary of Defense to release Allen from his duties. Allen was discharged and immediately became executive secretary to Governor Arnall until March 1946. He was later chief of staff for Governor M.E. Thompson (1947‚Äì1948). While working at Ivan Allen‚ÄìMarshall Company, he began to participate in civic affairs, such as the Boy Scouts and the Community Chest. He served as a member of the state Board of Education and the state Department of Veteran Services. He was a director of the Bank of Georgia, a trustee at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, an executive board member of the state's Family Welfare Society and of the Atlanta YMCA, president of the Young Democrats Club of Georgia, and president of the Atlanta Improvement Association (1951). For almost ten years, he led the state Chamber of Commerce in industrial development projects. With friends Mills B. Lane, Jack Glenn, Philip Alston, Richard Rich, Lawrence Gellerstedt Jr., and others, he founded The Commerce Club, which served as a venue for business networking and hospitality. He served as chairman until his death. Allen was an active member of the Atlanta Rotary Club from 1939 until his death. He served as president of the Community Chest and United Way, president of the Atlanta Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and president of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. In 1947, he was selected to head the Community Chest fund drive, during which time he became the first white member of the Community Chest leadership to attend the opening fundraising dinner for the black division of the Community Chest. In 1958, he served as a member on the Atlanta Citizens Advisory Committee on Urban Renewal. He was elected president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce in 1960 and, in 1961, proposed the Six Point Forward Atlanta program, which became the cornerstone of his platform in his successful campaign for mayor in 1961.Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage] ==Bids for governor== In 1954, Ivan Allen Jr. made a brief bid for Georgia Governor on a segregationist platform. In a field of nine candidates, he lost to segregationist Marvin Griffin. In 1957, Allen resigned from his position as president of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce, hired a press agent, and delivered speeches across Georgia as a potential candidate for the 1958 Gubernatorial Election. Again, he ran on a segregationist platform, but emphasized the \\"peace and tranquility necessary to continue our economic development program\\". In the coming years he would drastically change his political philosophy on segregation. In December 1957, he announced that he would not be a candidate for governor. He alluded to the fact that no Atlantan in forty years had won the race for governor, mostly as a result of rural Georgian apprehension towards the leaders from the \\"large, liberal cities\\". Allen wrote, \\"As a businessman I have analyzed the market and found that I am not a saleable product...No matter how clear and unequivocal I made my support of segregation, I was still from Atlanta\\". ==Mayoralty== In 1961, he ran for Mayor of Atlanta against Lester Maddox, a 45-year-old restaurant owner and staunch segregationist. Allen was carried to victory by 63,522 votes, while Maddox received 35,922 votes. Allen gained much of his support from the black community, which made up 40 percent of the city's population at the time. He took office in early 1962, replacing outgoing Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield, who was retiring after 23 years in office. In June 1962, during his first term as mayor, Allen took the solemn responsibility of flying to France to help identify and bring home the bodies of 106 of Atlanta's art and business leaders who, on an art appreciation tour, died in the Air France Flight 007 plane crash at Orly Airport in Paris. Many of the deceased had been personal friends of Allen. In his book, Allen wrote about going to Paris immediately after the crash: \\"I realized how insignificant I was, but I knew I had to assume the posture of representing these families and, indeed, the entire city of Atlanta, Georgia. I knew nothing about protocol, foreign relations, aviation, international agreements, or any of the other details I might become involved in. I was nothing but the Mayor of Atlanta and a friend and neighbor of 106 people who had been killed at this same airport only the day before...These were my lifelong friends. This was my generation. This was also the backbone of Atlanta's cultural society, the city's leading patrons of the arts. There was no precedent for this kind of agony\\". In 1965, Allen made a very private commitment to himself and to his wife Louise that he would not seek a third term in office. This was not revealed to the public until January 1969, when Allen formally announced his decision at a meeting of the Atlanta Rotary Club. That year, he refused to publicly endorse any particular candidate in the mayoral race, until just days before the runoff between Sam Massell and Rodney Cook, when reports surfaced suggesting that Allen's vice-mayor and mayoral- elect, Massell, had abused his power as vice-mayor through misuse of the Atlanta Police Department. On the Sunday before the election, Allen called for a press conference and asked Massell to immediately withdraw from consideration \\"for an office which requires intuitive integrity and instinctive withdrawal from even the suspicion and appearance of evil.\\" Despite the backlash he received, Allen wrote, \\"Had my candidate, Rodney Cook been involved in the same affair I am convinced I would have taken the same action ‚Äì except... I would have gone into greater detail to make the public fully understand the seriousness of the situation\\". Sam Massell went on to win the election and succeed Allen as the 53rd mayor of Atlanta. ===Economic development of Atlanta=== Under Mayor Allen's Forward Atlanta program, the city's population grew more than 30 percent. Atlanta ranked in the top ten in the nation in downtown construction, with more than 55 new buildings constructed and 22,000 new jobs created each year. In 1969, Atlanta's unemployment rate at one point plummeted to an astonishing 1.9 percent. Eleven of the city's twelve tallest buildings were constructed during the sixties, and the Atlanta International Airport (now Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport), acquired its first direct international air routes and saw its ranking change from the tenth-busiest airport in the nation to the third-busiest. In an attempt to manage the city's vast increase in traffic, Allen oversaw the early phases of construction of the Interstate 285 perimeter and the Downtown Connector, and presided over the creation of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), which would take over the old Atlanta Transit system and build the MARTA rail system. The $13 million Memorial Arts Center (now the Woodruff Arts Center) was established as a memorial to the victims of the 1962 Orly plane crash. The $10 Million Atlanta Civic Center and the $100 million Peachtree Center complex were all built during Allen's mayoralty. Between 1965 and 1969, convention business in Atlanta doubled, with 400,000 delegates spending $60 million. Mayor Allen also played a key role in bringing Major League Sports to Atlanta. In a politically risky move, he backed the construction of the $18 million Atlanta-Fulton Stadium, which attracted the Milwaukee Braves baseball team in 1965, the new NFL franchised Falcons football team in 1966, and the St.Louis Hawks basketball team arrived in 1968 Atlanta's Mayor is a Braves Fan: Allen Says Shift Would Be Good for Baseball, South (The New York Times, 1964)]. His building program, with its emphasis on developing downtown, was opposed by some of Atlanta's black leaders as not adequately meeting the need for low-income housing. Despite the criticisms, however, there was more low-income housing built during Allen's eight years as mayor than the entire thirty years prior to that. Allen wrote, \\"It is wonderful to be idealistic and to speak about human values, but you are not going to be able to do one thing about them if you are not economically strong. If there is any one slogan I lived by as mayor of Atlanta, that would be it\\". ===Civil rights and desegregation=== As mentioned earlier, Allen had initially been a segregationist. However, his business pragmatism led him to become an advocate for African American rights. He believed that to flourish, Atlanta must address its racial issues. Eventually, however, Allen was deeply affected by daily, firsthand dealings he faced with racial issues, as well as the profound questions African American citizens posed to him about their humanity and the cultural system that refused to recognize them. His pragmatic support of racial integration transformed rapidly into a conviction about the moral rightness of racial equality ‚Äì a belief would lead Allen to place himself at the center of a firestorm. Even before becoming mayor, Allen was involved in efforts to bring desegregation to Atlanta for the sake of Atlanta's businesses and city image. As president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, he worked closely with Judge A.T. Walden, longtime African-American leader; Opie Shelton, vice-president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce; and 25 owners and managers of Atlanta's leading department, variety, and chain stores to come to an agreement of the full desegregation of downtown stores and lunch counters. On his first day in office, he ordered all \\"white\\" and \\"colored\\" signs removed from City Hall and desegregated the cafeteria. This was the first of many steps he took to advance integration. Allen authorized black Atlanta policemen to arrest whites, hired the city's first black firefighters, and quickly put Atlanta ahead of every other city in the South as far as hiring black workers for positions \\"other than the most menial jobs\\". He painstakingly negotiated agreements for the accommodation of African Americans at 18 private and public facilities including hotels, swimming pools, and restaurants. Many Atlanta restaurants and other public facilities desegregated by mutual agreement between their owners and Mayor Allen before the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By January 1964, 14 major Atlanta hotels and motels had publicly pledged to accept reservations regardless of race. \\"I wasn't so all-fired liberal when I first moved into City Hall\\", Allen wrote. \\"But when I saw what the race-baiters were doing or could do to hold back the orderly growth of Atlanta, it infuriated me and eventually swung me to the extreme end opposite them\\". In 1966, a riot broke out in Summerhill, a neighborhood south of the Atlanta Stadium, when a white police officer shot a black resident. Mayor Allen rushed to the scene of the riot, climbing a police car in an attempt to talk to and calm the crowd. He toppled from the car, uninjured, when the crowd repeatedly rocked the vehicle. Afterwards, he walked the streets ‚Äì refusing to wear a riot helmet as the police did ‚Äì urging the black residents to \\"please go home.\\" \\"This is a good city\\", he shouted. \\"Help keep it that way, and go home\\".\\"Allen of Atlanta Collides With Black Power and White Racism\\" The New York Times, 1966 He had just one blemish on his racial policies as mayor, which took place during his first year in office: late in 1962, the city erected a fence to separate a black neighborhood from a white neighborhood, but it was removed in the face of legal challenges just months later. The event was known as \\"Atlanta's Berlin Wall\\" or \\"the Peyton Road Affair.\\" ===Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.=== Mayor Allen challenged members of Atlanta's prestigious Commerce Club to accept African American businessmen. When Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, Allen helped organize a 1,500-person bi-racial banquet to honor him (Atlanta was King's hometown). Furthermore, he shamed many of the white leaders in the city into supporting the event beyond pragmatic grounds. Many attended the dinner, making it a turning point in Atlanta's race relations. Upon hearing that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot in Memphis, Mayor Allen immediately rushed to the support of Dr. King's wife. Allen and his wife were with Mrs. King when it was confirmed that Dr. King was dead. Two days after Dr. King's assassination on April 4, 1968, he participated in a march across the west side of Atlanta, leading the way in a police car for the nearly four thousand black students walking in memory of Dr. King. Along with the Atlanta's police chief, Herbert Jenkins, he visited every black neighborhood in Atlanta during the traumatic days between Dr. King's death and his funeral, walking up and down the streets and reassuring the black community. Mayor Allen went through great lengths to ensure the city remained peaceful when nearly two hundred thousand people gathered to mourn Dr. King's death. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, honored Allen with the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize in 1981. ===Testimony before Congress=== \\"I was convinced now that voluntary desegregation of public facilities, worked out on a local level, had gone as far as it was going to go in the South and much of the rest of the United States....\\", Allen wrote. \\"It was obvious that the President was going to have to push through a very plain and airtight law that would, once and for all, abolish the practice of segregation. And segregation, as I intended to say in my testimony, was 'the stepchild of slavery'\\". In 1963, President John F. Kennedy made a direct request asking Ivan Allen Jr. to testify before the U.S. Congress in support of a federal law mandating public accommodations for African Americans. This law, particularly directed at those [restaurants and hotels] in the South that continued to close their doors to blacks by arguing private property rights, would force any private business, however remotely involved in interstate commerce, to open its doors to every person regardless of race. Against the counsel of even Atlanta's most prominent black leaders, Allen chose to go to Washington and deliver his testimony, knowing it would most likely ruin his political career and deeply affect his personal and business relationships. Nevertheless, with the support of his wife and very few others, Allen risked his place in society, his political future, the safety of his family, and ultimately his life to advocate the public accommodation of African Americans. On July 26, 1963, Allen spoke before the U.S. Congress and the nation in support of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was the only prominent white southern elected official to do so. As a result, there were death threats made towards the Allen family, and many white friends and constituents never spoke to him again. Just one month after Allen's testimony, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, also calling for racial equality and an end to discrimination, later proving to be a very defining moment in the Civil Rights Movement. Excerpts from Allen's testimony were published in newspapers the day after he spoke in front of Congress: \\"I am firmly convinced that the Supreme Court insists the same fundamental rights must be held by every American citizen. Therefore, any failure by Congress to pass the [Civil Rights] bill would amount to an endorsement of private business setting up an entirely new status of discrimination throughout the nation... I submit that it is not right to allow an American's citizenship to be changed merely as a matter of convenience.... I want to emphasize again that now is the time for legislative action. We cannot dodge this issue. We cannot look back over our shoulders or turn the clock back to the eighteen-sixties. We must take action now to assure a greater future for our citizens and our country.... Now the elimination of segregation, which is slavery's stepchild, is a challenge to all of us to make every American free in fact as well as in theory...\\" ATLANTA'S MAYOR BACKS RIGHTS BILL AS HELP TO CITIES; Calls Public Facility Clause Key to Averting Strife-- Senator Praises Views Asks Passage of Bill Fears Return to Turmoil ATLANTA'S MAYOR BACKS RIGHTS BILL Thurmond Poses Queries Senator Is Challenged South Carolinian Heard (New York Times, 1963)] Excerpts From the Statement by Allen; 'A Long Process' Court Rulings Cited Defiance Is Discerned Reasonable Time Asked (New York Times, 1963)] Allen described that to be the moment which made civil rights a very personal matter to him: \\"I have to be honest with myself and admit that up until the time I had to make the decision to go to Washington or not go, my liberalism on the race issue had been based to a large degree on the pragmatism: it was simply good business for Atlanta to be an open city, a fair city, a \\"City Too Busy to Hate\\", a city trying to raise the level of its poorest citizens and get them off the relief roles...I am certain that at this point I had finally crossed over and made my commitment on a very personal basis. And I think I took some of my friends with me\\". Allen continued to engage racial issues throughout his eight years in office. He worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. By the time he stepped down, Atlanta was at the forefront of progress in public accommodations, school desegregation, voting rights, housing, and employment. Black citizens occupied positions on the city board of aldermen and the board of education. ==Family== Ivan Allen Jr. married Louise Richardson Allen (1917‚Äì2008), granddaughter of the influential Atlanta businessman, Hugh T. Inman, on New Year's Day in 1936. They were married for sixty-six years before Allen's death. They had three sons, Ivan Allen III (1938‚Äì1992), Hugh Inman, and Beaumont (1951‚Äì2014). At the time of Allen Jr.'s death, he was survived by his wife, sons Hugh Inman and Beaumont, daughters-in-law Margaret (Mrs. Ivan Allen III), Tricia (Mrs. Hugh Inman Allen) and Sally (Mrs. Beaumont Allen), seven grandchildren, and four great- grandchildren. ==Georgia Institute of Technology== Ivan Allen Jr. graduated in the top five students of his class at Georgia Tech (Commerce, 1933). He was president of the Student Body and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, to which he offered lifelong support. For many years, he hosted the annual Ivan Allen Rush Party for his fraternity in the meadow behind his home. In 1990, the liberal arts college at Georgia Tech was renamed the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts The Enduring Legacy of Ivan Allen Jr.\\" (Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts)] ==The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage== Entrusted by the Allen family to carry forward Mayor Allen's legacy, Georgia Tech's Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts awarded the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service from 2001 to 2010. In 2010, Georgia Tech established the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage. Awarded for the first time in 2011, it recognizes those around the world whose life and work embody Mayor Allen's moral imperative and compassion in shaping a better future for humankind. ==Legacy== Allen family statue at Centennial Olympic Park After Allen's death on July 2, 2003, at the age of 92, he was buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta. His remains were reinterred at Oakland Cemetery alongside other family members in 2009. Ivan Allen Jr. was awarded a Doctor of Public Service degree from Georgia Tech and honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Morris Brown College, Juniata College, Clark College, Morehouse College, LaGrange College, Emory University, and Davidson College. He was also awarded the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation Award for achievement in urban affairs in 1974, the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize in 1981, the Shining Light Award in 1995, and was inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004 (cite). In 1999, The Commerce Club created the Ivan Allen Jr. Leadership Award, which is presented annually. A memorial statue of Ivan Allen Sr., Ivan Allen Jr., and Ivan Allen III was commissioned for the 1996 Olympic Games and stands in Centennial Olympic Park, adjacent to the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce headquarters. The Atlanta Braves museum and hall of fame at Turner Field is named in his honor. His commitment to urban transformation founded in social justice became a cornerstone of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts at Georgia Tech. G. P. \\"Bud\\" Peterson, president of Georgia Tech, stated, \\"He was a leader while he was a student here at Georgia Tech, and went on to be a leader in everything he did throughout his career. Now, half a century later, his life is a beacon of light for those of us following in his footsteps. It is our goal here at Georgia Tech to take the legacy of Ivan Allen Jr. and pass it on to the next generation.\\" Research, teaching, and public service in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts are grounded in Mayor Allen's values and principles. ==Books== In 1971, Ivan Allen Jr. published his first and only book, \\"Mayor: Notes on the Sixties\\", with Paul Hemphill. The inside cover of the book reads, \\"To my father, who saw it coming; and to my wife, whose advice and courage saw me through it.\\" The members of the Ivan Allen family, along with former mayor Maynard Jackson (Dobbs Family), are the subjects of the book, \\"Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn\\", published in 1996 by Gary M. Pomerantz. In 1928, Ivan Allen Sr. published his first and only book, \\"Atlanta From the Ashes\\".

This edition was published in 1593. Illustration from a copy of Compendium of Materia Medica, from 1800 The Compendium of Materia Medica (also known by the romanizations Bencao Gangmu or Pen-tsao Kang-mu) is a Chinese herbology volume written by Li Shizhen during the Ming dynasty; its first draft was completed in 1578 and printed in Nanjing in 1596. It is a work epitomizing the materia medica known at the time. The Compendium of Materia Medica is regarded as the most complete and comprehensive medical book ever written in the history of traditional Chinese medicine. It lists all the plants, animals, minerals, and other items that were believed to have medicinal properties. The text consists of 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. The British historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham calls Li Shizhen \\"the 'uncrowned king' of Chinese naturalists\\",Needham, Joseph, Ho Ping-Yu and Lu Gwei-djen (1976), Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 5 Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 3: Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Historical Survey, from Cinnabar Elixirs to Synthetic Insulin, Cambridge University Press, p. 216. and his Bencao gangmu \\"undoubtedly the greatest scientific achievement of the Ming\\".Needham, Joseph, and Wang Ling (1954), Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 1 Introductory Orientations, Cambridge University Press, p. 47. ==Name== The title, translated as \\"Materia Medica, Arranged according to Drug Descriptions and Technical Aspects\\", uses two Chinese compounds. Bencao (Pen-tsao; \\"roots and herbs; based on herbs, pharmacopeia, materia medica\\") combines ben (pen; 'root; origin, basis') and cao (tsao; 'grass, plant, herb'). Gangmu (Kang-mu; 'detailed outline; table of contents') combines gang (kang; 'main rope, hawser; main threads, essential principles') and mu ( 'eye, look; category, division'). The characters and were later used as 'class' and 'order', respectively, in biological classification. ==History== Li Shizhen completed the first draft of the text in 1578, after conducting readings of 800 other medical reference books and carrying out 30 years of field study. For this and many other achievements, Li Shizhen is compared to Shennong, a god in Chinese mythology who gave instruction on agriculture and herbal medicine. ==Content== The Compendium of Materia Medica has 53 volumes in total: #At the very beginning is the table of contents, containing a list of entries included and 1,160 hand drawn diagrams to serve as illustrations. #Volume 1 to 4 ‚Äì an index () and a comprehensive list of herbs that would treat the most common sickness (). #Volume 5 to 53 ‚Äì the main content of the text, containing 1,892 distinct herbs, of which 374 were added by Li himself. There are 11,096 side prescriptions to treat common illness (8,160 of which is compiled or collected by Li). The text is written in almost 2 million Chinese characters, classified into 16 divisions and 60 orders. For every herb there are entries on their names, a detailed description of their appearance and odor, nature, medical function, effects and side recipes etc. ==Value== With the publication of Compendium of Materia Medica, not only did it improve the classification of how traditional medicine was compiled and formatted, but it was also an important medium in improving the credibility and scientific values of biology classification of both plants and animals. The compendium corrected many mistakes and misapprehensions of the nature of herbs and diseases. Li also included many new herbs, adding his own discoveries of particular drugs and their efficacity and function, as well as more detailed descriptions of the results of experiments. It also has notes and records on general medical data and medical history. Compendium of Materia Medica is also more than a mere pharmaceutical text, for it includes a vast amount of information on topics as wide-ranging as biology, chemistry, geography, mineralogy, geology, history, and even mining and astronomy, which might appear to have little connection with herbal medicine. It has been translated into more than 20 languages and spread all over the world. Even now it is still in print and used as a reference book. ==Errors== Compendium of Materia Medica also contains information that has since been proven to be erroneous due to the contemporary limited scientific and technical knowledge. For example, it is claimed that lead is not toxic. It is also claimed that otters are \\"always male\\", and that the Moupin langur is ten feet tall, has backwards feet and can be caught when it draws its upper lip over its eyes. ==Efficacy of pangolin scales== The Compendium of Materia Medica has a brief explanation of the medical efficacy of pangolin scales: \\"Pangolins (chuan shan jia, meaning \\"mountain-penetrating scales\\") are able to penetrate mountains, accordingly they can pass through in the meridians.\\" In other words, it is able to pass through blockages in the meridians. ==Popular culture== \\"Compendium of Materia Medica\\" is the title of a song performed by the Taiwanese singer Jay Chou in his album Still Fantasy. The lyrics discuss Chinese pride and make references to aspects of Chinese herbal medicine. ==See also== *Chinese herbology *Mellified Man *Pharmacognosy *Yaoxing Lun ==References== ==Bibliography== * (Review, Edward B.

It is also the largest newspaper in the state of Wisconsin, where it is widely distributed. It is currently owned by the Gannett Company.\\"Gannett Completes Acquisition of Journal Media Group\\". USA Today, April 11, 2016. ==History== The Journal Sentinel was first printed on Sunday, April 2, 1995, following the consolidation of operations between the afternoon The Milwaukee Journal and the morning Milwaukee Sentinel, which had been owned by the same company, Journal Communications, for more than 30 years. The new Journal Sentinel then became a seven-day morning paper. In early 2003, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel began printing operations at its new printing facility in West Milwaukee. In September 2006, the Journal Sentinel announced it had \\"signed a five-year agreement to print the national edition of USA Today for distribution in the northern and western suburbs of Chicago and the eastern half of Wisconsin\\". The legacies of both papers are acknowledged on the editorial pages today, with the names of the Sentinels Solomon Juneau and the Journals Lucius Nieman and Harry J. Grant listed below their respective newspapers' flags. The merged paper's volume and edition numbers follow those of the Journal. ===Milwaukee Sentinel=== ====Founding==== The Milwaukee Sentinel was founded in response to disparaging statements made about the east side of town by Byron Kilbourn's westside partisan newspaper, the Milwaukee Advertiser, during the city's \\"bridge wars\\", a period when the two sides of town fought for dominance. The founder of Milwaukee, Solomon Juneau, provided the starting funds for editor John O'Rourke, a former office assistant at the Advertiser, to start the paper. It was first published as a four-page weekly on June 27, 1837. A deathly ill O'Rourke struggled to help the paper to find its feet before he died six months later of tuberculosis at the age of 24.\\"The Story of the Sentinel,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, December 3, 1893. ====Becoming a Whig newspaper==== On Juneau's request, O'Rourke's associate, Harrison Reed, remained to take over the Sentinels operations. He continued the struggle to keep the paper ahead of its debts, often printing pleas to his advertisers and subscribers to pay their bills any way they could. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Whig party in the territory thrust the Sentinel into partisan politics. In 1840 Reed was assaulted by individuals whom the Sentinel charged were hired by Democratic Governor Henry Dodge. Later that year the paper abandoned its independence and proclaimed itself a Whig paper with its endorsement of William Henry Harrison for president in 1840. In financial straits, Reed lost control of the paper in 1841 when Democrats foreclosed on the Sentinel's mortgaged debt and took over its editorial page. Only after the Democrats' successful election of Dodge for Congress was Reed able to regain control of the paper. The next year he sold the Sentinel to Elisha Starr, an editor who had founded a new Whig paper in response to the Sentinel's Democratic lapse. Reed later became a \\"carpetbag\\" governor of Florida during Reconstruction. Starr guarded the Sentinel's position as the sole Whig organ in Milwaukee. Heavily in debt, he secured the partnership of David M. Keeler, who paid off the paper's creditors. Keeler took on partner John S. Fillmore (nephew of U.S. president Millard Fillmore) and succeeded in ousting Starr, who kept publishing his own version of the Sentinel. Keeler and Fillmore trumped his efforts by turning their Sentinel into a daily on December 9, 1844, while still publishing a weekly edition. The paper finally began to prosper and establish itself as a major political force in the nascent state of Wisconsin. Having accomplished his goal of establishing the first daily paper in the territory, Keeler retired two months later, but not before opening a public reading room of the nation's newspapers, the origin of Milwaukee's public library system. Fillmore employed a succession of editors, including Jason Downer, later a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, and Increase A. Lapham, a Midwestern naturalist who later helped establish the National Weather Service. ====The King years==== After running through six editors in eight years, Fillmore sought a more stable editorial foundation and went east to confer with Thurlow Weed, editor of the Albany Evening Journal and powerful Whig political boss of New York. Weed recommended his associate editor and prot√©g√©, Rufus King. King was a native of New York City, a graduate of West Point, a brevet lieutenant, the son of the president of Columbia College and the grandson of U.S. Constitution signer Rufus King. In June 1845 King came to Milwaukee and became the Sentinels editor three months later.Perry C. Hill. \\"Rufus King and the Wisconsin Constitution\\". Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 32, no. 4(June 1949):416-432. King was lionized by the community. It was his suggestion that made the Sentinel the first paper in the Midwest to employ newsboys to boost street sales. Due largely to King's connections to the East, the quality of the Sentinel greatly improved. He declared the Sentinel an antislavery paper and also supported temperance legislation. King invested his own money in the paper, purchasing the first power press in the Midwest. Two years later the first telegraph message wired to Wisconsin was received in the Sentinel office. The paper provided thorough coverage of Wisconsin's constitutional convention, held in Madison in 1846. When the adopted constitution fell short of Whig expectations, the Sentinel was instrumental in encouraging its rejection by territorial voters on April 6, 1847. The Sentinel launched a German-language paper, Der Volksfreund, to bring the city's large population of German immigrants to the Whig cause. Gen. King himself was a delegate to Wisconsin's second constitutional convention. He was also appointed head of the Milwaukee militia and sat on the University of Wisconsin's board of regents, as well as being the first superintendent of Milwaukee public schools. In the wake of the Panic of 1857 King sold the paper to T.D. Jermain and H.H. Brightman, but remained editor, covering the state legislative sessions of 1859‚Äì1861 himself. ====The Civil War years==== After the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, King joined Wisconsin Freeman editor Sherman M. Booth in calling for its repeal, and in 1854 denounced the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. The Sentinel provided extended coverage of runaway slave Joshua Glover's liberation from a Milwaukee jail on March 11, 1854. After the birth of the Republican party in Ripon, Wisconsin, King helped promote and organize the state party at the founding convention held at the Madison Capitol on July 13. King's Sentinel supported William H. Seward for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860, but rallied around Abraham Lincoln when he emerged as the nominee. Circulation rose with the looming Civil War and the paper expanded to a nine-column sheet with the start of 1861. In 1862 the Sentinel bought Booth's abolitionist newspaper, the Wisconsin Free Democrat, and published it for two months before folding and sending its subscribers the Weekly Sentinel. Soon after his inauguration, President Lincoln appointed Rufus King minister to the Papal States. As he prepared to sail to Europe, the Civil War broke out. He took a leave of absence and was appointed a brigadier general. Later, he helped form and lead the Union Army's Iron Brigade. The Sentinel prospered during the Civil War, sometimes printing five editions of the paper in a day. Though much of the war news was copied from Chicago papers, the Sentinel did dispatch a war correspondent for over half a year. The war also resulted in a shortage of skilled printers, so in 1863 the Sentinel began hiring and training \\"female compositors\\" to typeset the paper, albeit in another building away from the men. This resulted in members of the Milwaukee Typographical Union leaving their jobs, but the war had already depleted their ranks to such a degree that the union later temporarily disbanded.Richard M. Current. The History of Wisconsin, Volume II: The Civil War Era 1848‚Äì1873. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1976, p. 338. Frustrated by the lack of skilled help, editor C. Latham Sholes tried building a typesetting machine, but failed. After becoming comptroller for the city a few years later, he invented the modern typewriter. After the war ended circulation fell off and the number of editions was kept to a minimum. ====Becoming a Republican organ==== In 1870 sole proprietor Horace Brightman sold the Sentinel to Alexander M. Thomson and other former owners of the Janesville Gazette. Thomson had co-edited Booth's abolitionist Free Democrat before the war and while editing the Gazette during the war he had entered politics as a Republican, rising to the position of state assembly speaker. Thomson played a key role in securing the legislature's choice of Matthew H. Carpenter as U.S. Senator. Running the Sentinel, Thomson changed the size of the paper twice while diminishing the paper's local focus in favor of telegraphed national news. He also began publishing a Sunday edition. A supporter of the Liberal Republicans, who opposed President Ulysses S. Grant, Thomson was ousted from the paper after Carpenter's former law partner Newton S. Murphey bought the Sentinel in 1874 with other pro-Grant Republicans, including Carpenter, who had failed to be re-elected.Robert C. Nesbit. The History of Wisconsin, Volume III: Urbanization and Industrialization 1873-1893. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1985. After Murphey loaned Carpenter $20,000 to also become a stakeholder in the paper, Carpenter hired A. C. Botkin as editor, formerly of the Chicago Times, to replace Thomson. The Sentinel was soon perceived as Carpenter's \\"personal mouthpiece\\" and an organ of the state Republican central committee.E. Bruce Thompson. Matthew Hale Carpenter, Webster of the West. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1954, pp. 206-207. After committee chairman Elisha W. Keyes blocked Carpenter from becoming a delegate to the national Republican convention in 1876, the paper began running fierce editorials denouncing Keyes. The Sentinel later endorsed Carpenter over Keyes as senator in the 1878 election.E. Bruce Thompson. Matthew Hale Carpenter, Webster of the West. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1954, pp. 259-261. Disappointed in the paper's weak defense of unregulated corporations, a new group of stalwart Republicans purchased the old Democratic Milwaukee News in 1880 and resurrected it as the Republican and News. Horace Rublee, a former editor of the Wisconsin State Journal and who had been the chairman of the state Republican party, was hired as editor-in-chief. Failing to put the Sentinel out of business, the Republicans bought the paper outright and issued it as the Republican-Sentinel. The next year the word Republican was dropped, but the paper remained a major force in the state's Republican party. This troubled managing editor Lucius W. Nieman, who had covered the state capitol for the Sentinel and had seen the control the powerful monied interests had over state government. When a Democrat was elected to Congress from a die-hard Republican county, the Sentinels editor refused to print the fact. This led Nieman to resign and join the fledgling Milwaukee Journal. The Journal first received acclaim when Nieman's coverage of a deadly hotel fire revealed it to be a firetrap, but the Sentinel defended the hotel's management, which included a Sentinel stockholder.Will C. Conrad, Kathleen F. Wilson and Dale Wilson. The Milwaukee Journal. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1964, pp.7-8. The Milwaukee Journal became the paper's primary competition for the next eleven decades. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner was the Sentinel's Madison correspondent for a year, beginning in April 1884, while he finished his senior year at the University of Wisconsin. He covered various aspects of life in Madison, from campus news to the state legislature. He delivered the scoop that university regent and state political boss Elisha W. Keyes wished to remove university president John Bascom for political reasons and it was Turner's reports that resulted in a backlash of support for the president. Bascom had earlier offered Turner a position teaching elocution at the university that he turned down in favor of working for the Sentinel for nine more months. He left the paper after Republicans appointed him as the transcribing clerk to Wisconsin's state senate before later going on to teach history.Fulmer Mood. \\"Frederick Jackson Turner and the Milwaukee Sentinel 1884\\". Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 34, no. 1 (Autumn 1950):21-27. In 1892‚Äì1893 the Sentinel moved temporarily from its home on Mason Street so that the old building could be torn down and a new, state-of-the-art structure could be erected in its place. ====The Pfister years==== With the dawning of the Progressive Era during the 1890s the Sentinel began to moderate its views, often echoing calls for political reform. After the Panic of 1893 a private utility monopoly run by stalwart Republican party bosses Charles F. Pfister and Henry C. Payne, The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company (TMER&L;), revoked commuter passes and raised utility rates during the depression. The Sentinel joined in the chorus of indignation that resounded from Milwaukee and beyond, particularly during 1899 when Pfister and Payne succeeded, by means of bribery, to push through a 35-year contract with the city. On December 29 Pfister and Payne sued the Sentinel for libel, to which the paper replied that it had fallen prey to \\"probably the most formidable and influential combination of selfish interests ever found in the city of Milwaukee.\\"David P. Thelen. The New Citizenship. University of Missouri Press, 1972, pp. 278-280. Charles F. Pfister was heir to a fortune built from his father's tannery company and he directed many valuable holdings, including banks, railroads, insurance companies, heavy industries, pinelands and mines, plus the lavish Pfister Hotel. He developed funds as well as strategy for the state's stalwart Republican machine, having made governors and senators. Rather than going to trial and having his business practices revealed, Pfister bought the Sentinel outright on February 18, 1901, paying an immense sum to buy up a majority of its stock. After the death of his publisher, Lansing Warren, that summer Pfister assumed publishing duties, immersing himself in the paper's operations and directing political coverage. Owning the Sentinel expanded his conservative influence from the convention backrooms to the pages of the largest daily paper in Wisconsin. The Sentinel immediately opposed the newly elected Governor La Follette. During La Follete's successful re-election campaign in 1902, Pfister's political power was diminished after it had been revealed that he had secretly purchased the editorial pages of some 300 of the state's newspapers.Herbert F. Margulies. The Decline of the Progressive Movement in Wisconsin. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1968, p. 62. The Sentinel continued to denounce La Follette for over twenty years, whether it be for his reforms or his stand against U.S. participation in World War I. In 1905 Pfister was indicted in a rendering company bribery scandal by Milwaukee district attorney (and future Wisconsin governor) Francis McGovern, but was acquitted for lack of testimony. Pfister sold the paper to the William Randolph Hearst's newspaper syndicate on June 1, 1924. ====The Hearst years==== A majority stake was purchased by the Hearst Corporation in 1924. Operations of the Sentinel were joined to Hearst's papers, the afternoon Wisconsin News and the morning Milwaukee Telegram; the latter being merged with the Sentinel as the Milwaukee Sentinel & Telegram. The Wisconsin News entered into a lease arrangement with the School of Engineering for radio station WSOE on November 15, 1927. The lease was for a minimum of three years. To reflect the new arrangement, the Wisconsin News changed the call letters of WSOE to WISN on January 23, 1928. The station was sold to the Wisconsin News in November 1930.This is based upon the fact that the initial lease was for three years, as well as that according to Frost, S.E., Jr., PhD, Education's Own Stations: The History of Broadcast Licenses Issued to Educational Institutions. The University of Chicago Press, 1937, p. 213, in its license application of December 30, 1930 WISN stated that the newspaper was the owner. Hearst's associate Paul Block acquired Pfister's remaining stake of the Sentinel in 1929. The News closed in 1939, being consolidated with the Sentinel as a single morning paper. In 1955 Hearst purchased television station WTVW and changed the call letters to WISN-TV. Hearst operated the Sentinel until 1962 when, following a long and costly strike, it abruptly announced the closing of the paper. Although Hearst claimed that the paper had lost money for years, television was directly affecting Hearst's evening papers in New York City and Chicago, forcing the company to drive income from the Sentinel to finance the other papers. The Journal Company, concerned about the loss of an important voice (and facing questions about its own dominance of the Milwaukee media market), agreed to buy the Sentinel name, subscription lists, and any \\"good will\\" associated with the name. The News-Sentinel building at Plankinton and Michigan was torn down; the presses were shipped to Hearst's San Francisco papers, and Sentinel operations moved to Journal Square, with Hearst retaining WISN radio and television (WISN-TV remains part of Hearst, while WISN Radio is owned by iHeartMedia). Following the paper's sale to The Journal Company, the Sunday edition of the Sentinel was absorbed by the Journal. ===The Milwaukee Journal=== The Journal was started in 1882, in competition with four other English-language, four German- and two Polish- language dailies. Its first editor was Lucius Nieman, who wanted to steer the paper away from the political biases and yellow journalism common at the time. Nieman was an innovative and crusading editor. The Pulitzer Prize for Public Service was awarded to The Milwaukee Journal in 1919 \\"for its strong campaign for Americanism in a constituency where foreign elements made such a policy hazardous from a business point of view\\". The Journal followed the Sentinel into broadcasting. The Journal purchased radio station WKAF in 1927, changing its call letters to WTMJ. It later launched an FM station, W9XAO, in 1940; it was later called W55M, WMFM, WTMJ-FM, WKTI-FM, WLWK-FM, and, now, WKTI. WTMJ- TV, Milwaukee's first television station, went on the air in 1947. Nieman's successor, Harry J. Grant, introduced an employee stock purchase plan in 1937 and, as a result, 98% of Journal stock was held by its employees. A small bloc of Journal stock was given to Harvard College, and funded the Nieman Fellowship program for promising journalists. Competing with two raucous Hearst papers filled with gossip, features and comic strips, Harry Grant took a more sober approach to news presentation, emphasizing local news. During his years as editor and publisher, the Journal received several Pulitzers and other awards from its peers; it was under Grant that the Journal gained a reputation as a leading voice of moderate midwestern liberalism. During the 1950s, the Journal was outspoken in its opposition to Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy and his search for communist influence in government, which perhaps inflated the Journals reputation for liberalism. At its circulation peak in the early 1960s, the Journal sold about 400,000 copies daily and 600,000 on Sunday. The Journal was a Monday-through-Saturday afternoon broadsheet, containing its distinctive Green Sheet, also publishing Sunday mornings. Though circulation had declined from its peak, it still held a rare position for an afternoon paper, dominating its market up until 1995, when the Journal and Sentinel were consolidated. ===21st century=== Journal Communications building As of mid-2012, the Journal Sentinel had the 31st-largest circulation among all major U.S. newspapers, with circulation of 207,000 for the daily edition and just under 338,000 for the Sunday edition. On April 8, 2016, decades of local ownership for both papers ended when Journal Media Group was acquired by the Gannett Company. Gannett owns most of the daily newspapers in the central and eastern parts of Wisconsin (eleven in all), including the Green Bay Press-Gazette and Appleton's The Post-Crescent. The Journal Sentinel has been integrated into the company's \\"USA Today Network Wisconsin\\". The Journal Sentinel also collaborates with the Press-Gazette for Packers coverage, and adapted to Gannett standards, including newspaper layout, website and apps, in August 2016. In the spring of 2018, the Journal Sentinel press facility began to print all of Gannett's state papers (it already printed The Sheboygan Press and USA Today) replacing the company's Appleton facility. ==Awards== The Milwaukee Journal and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel have received eight Pulitzer Prizes: In 1919, The Milwaukee Journal won the award for public service because of its stand against Germany in World War I. In 1934, cartoonist Ross A. Lewis won for his cartoon on labor-industry violence, \\"Sure, I'll Work for Both Sides\\". In 1953, business desk reporter Austin C.

Cars of the Soviet Union (Haynes Publishing, Somerset, UK, 2008), p. 70. ==Development and production== The GAZ-69 was created by the team of chief designer Grigoriy Vasserman as a replacement for the GAZ-67B that would have lower fuel consumption than its predecessor and use the same inline four and three-speed transmission as the GAZ-M20 Pobeda. The development process started in 1946 and the first prototypes known under the name \\"Truzhenik\\" (Toiler) were built in 1947. After extensive on-road testing, the new off-road vehicle went into production on August 25, 1953. Over 600,000 GAZ-69s had been built by the end of production in the USSR in 1972. A similar vehicle based upon the GAZ-69's design was produced by ARO in Romania until 1975, first as the IMS-57, then as the IMS M59, and later modernized as the ARO M461.IMS M461, \\"Avtolegendy SSSR i Socstran\\" No. 168, DeAgostini 2015, ISSN 2071-095X , p.3-6 GAZ-69s were standard military jeeps of the Eastern Bloc and client states. ==Design== The standard GAZ-69 was able to reach ,Thompson, p. 176. but its more powered versions, with 2400 cc (derived from the basic 2100 cc) 65 h.p. engines and the same three-speed gearbox, could reach . They were known as the GAZ-69M, or GAZ-69AM for the four-door version.Ware, Pat. The World Encyclopedia of Military Vehicles (Lorenz Books, 2010), p. 177. It featured two fuel tanks, one of under the floor, one of beneath the passenger's seat. All civilian models also had to meet Army requirements, in case of wartime requisitioning. (This is also why a hardtop version was not available until 1993)Thompson, p. 176 The basic variant GAZ-69 has a pair of doors and usually has standard canvas top and upper sides; there are two seats in front and two folding benches for three passengers each on sides. The further variant GAZ-69A (UAZ-69A) has four doors, folding canvas top and two rows of seats. It was used as the basis for the rear-wheel drive van GAZ-19 that was built in 1955 but didn't pass the prototype stage. The off-road van and light truck UAZ-450 and the newer UAZ-469 also traced their origins to the GAZ-69. ==Military use== The GAZ-69 had been the basic light off-road vehicle of the Soviet Army, replacing GAZ-67s and Willys Jeeps, before the army adopted the UAZ-469. It was also used as the basis for the 2P26 tank destroyer, as well as for the GAZ 46 MAV, a light 4x4 amphibious vehicle inspired by the Ford GPA 'Seep'. ==Gallery== File:GAZ69-MoT-STL.jpgA retired GAZ-69 in the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Mo, United States File:UAZ-69.jpgA retired GAZ-69 in the in Hoek van Holland, Netherlands File:FUG_2.jpgA GAZ-69 of the Hungarian Army File:Gaz- uaz-69m-1958-20130502-l.jpgUAZ-69M, front view UAS-69 30.06.19 JM (4).jpgUAZ-69M File:GAZ-69_Armaturenbrett.jpgGAZ-69, interior File:–©–µ—Ä–±–∞–∫ –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—Ç –ü–∞—Ä–∞–¥ –ü–æ–±–µ–¥—ã –≤ –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω—ë–≤–µ, –ú–°–°–† –≤ 1965 –≥–æ–¥—É.jpgGrigory Sherbak in a GAZ-69 during a parade on Victory Square in Kishinev (1965). == References == == External links == * GAZ-69 ‚Äì Everything you want to know about the GAZ-69 * GAZ-69 on sale at the Mortar Investments website * GAZ-69 at the Soviet Armor website Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Off-road vehicles Category:GAZ Group trucks Category:Military vehicles of the Soviet Union Category:Military light utility vehicles Category:Military trucks ","title":"GAZ-69"},{"id":"1272853","text":"K. P. R. Gopalan (1906 ‚Äì 6 August 1997), popularly known as KPR was an Indian politician and militant Naxalite communist leader from Kalliasseri, Kerala. Once a member of the Kerala State Assembly, he lost his seat in the general election of 1 February 1960. He was subsequently re-elected. While a member, he led a failed attempt at armed revolt in the Cannanore area in November 1968. At one point he was sentenced to death by the colonial authorities. Gopalan was one of the founding members of the Communist Party in Kerala in 1940. He, in cooperation with the KPCC, was the main organizer of Morozha protest on 15 September 1940 against the British decision to enter World War Two. The protest became violent when police tried to suppress it. One Sub- Inspector and a Constable died in the clash with the mob, mainly constituted of farmers, agricultural labourers, and other trade union workers. The police caught all prominent leaders, including Gopalan and E. Narayanan Nayanar, the elder brother of E. K. Nayanar, former Kerala Chief Minister for 11 years. The court sentenced all of them for imprisonment and later on appeal, Madras High Court sentenced Gopalan to death. He was sent to Bellary Jail. The verdict attracted wide protest across Kerala and India. Kerala observed a day honoring K.P.R Gopalan and Mathrubhumi, the leading newspaper wrote an editorial demanding that his death sentence be commuted. Gandhiji also involved and said it is not acceptable. British communist party protested and the case even received the attention of the British Parliament. Due to this mass protest, the British Government finally reduced the punishment from hanging to life imprisonment. Later, he was released when Congress Interim Government took power in Madras state. Eminent Communist leader P. Krishna Pillai wrote an article hailing Gopalan entitled \\"The Bolshevik Hero of Kerala\\". Gopalan died of natural causes on 6 August 1997, aged 91. His niece K. P.

The album was originally released on 26 September 1997, on Independiente Records. ==Background and release== In 2000, the album was re- released, with the only differences being new album artwork and a slightly- tweaked version of \\"More Than Us\\". The album itself has a much more up-beat and 'rockier' sound than their subsequent releases, and is often regarded as one of their best. Once set up in London the band spent between nine months and a year recording new songs. The band played their first London show at the famous Dublin Castle in Camden. With around twenty good songs ready they then approached managers Colin Lester and Ian McAndrew of Wildlife Entertainment who then introduced the band to Andy MacDonald, owner of Go! Discs Records and founder of Independiente Records. The band is signed to MacDonald personally, not to the label‚Äîif MacDonald ever leaves the Sony-financed label Independiente Records, the band goes with him (commonly referred to in the industry as a \\"golden handcuffs\\" clause). ==Production== Produced by Steve Lillywhite of U2 fame, Travis' first studio album, 1997's Good Feeling, is a rockier, more upbeat record than the band's others to date. Recorded at the legendary Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, the place where Travis favourite The Band recorded, the album contained singles such as \\"All I Want to Do Is Rock\\", \\"U16 Girls\\", the Beatle'esque \\"Tied to the 90's\\", \\"Happy\\" and \\"More Than Us\\". Guest musicians include Page McConnell of Phish playing keyboards on the title track \\"Good Feeling\\". The album reached No. 9 on the British charts, but with little radio play, it slipped from the charts relatively quickly. Although it heralded Travis' arrival on the British music scene, received extremely positive reviews, and substantially broadened Travis' fan base, it sold just 40,000 copies. Following the release, Travis toured extensively, their live performances further enhancing their reputation. This included support slots in the UK for Oasis, after Noel Gallagher became an outspoken fan. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Fran Healy. ==Personnel== *Fran Healy ‚Äì vocals, guitar *Andy Dunlop ‚Äì guitar *Dougie Payne ‚Äì bass guitar *Neil Primrose ‚Äì drums *Page McConnell ‚Äì keyboards ==References== Category:Travis (band) albums Category:1997 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Lillywhite Category:Independiente Records albums ","title":"Good Feeling (Travis album)"},{"id":"1272885","text":"The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is a United States-based non- profit organization incorporated in 1988 by founders David Crawford, a professional astronomer, and Tim Hunter, a physician/amateur astronomer. The mission of the IDA is \\"to preserve and protect the night time environment and our heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting.\\"IDA Mission & Goals Light pollution is the result of outdoor lighting that is not properly shielded, allowing light shine into the eyes and night sky. Direct light that shines into the eyes is called glare, and light directed into the night sky above the horizon causes skyglow. Lighting can also cause light trespass when it enters areas where unwanted (e.g. a neighbor's yard and windows). IDA was the first organization in the dark-sky movement, and is currently the largest. ==Principal approach== IDA's principal approach is to raise awareness about the value of dark, star-filled night skies and encourage their protection and restoration through education about the problems and solutions, including outdoor lighting practices that create less light pollution. In 2011, the organization had about 5,000 members in 70 countries. ==International Dark Sky Places== To promote awareness about the issues, the IDA has an International Dark Sky Places program that

It was owned and run by the La Sainte Union des Sacr√©s Coeurs order of nuns, and this Catholic background was reflected in the student makeup. In addition to teacher training, LSU also provided first degree courses in the Humanities, particularly history (notably American and Soviet), art, English and foreign languages (B.A. Combined Studies, B.A. Modern Foreign Languages & European Studies, Theology). Although the education was provided by independent lecturers and professors the courses were overseen by the University of Southampton and degrees (both ordinary and honours) awarded by the University. Towards the end of its time LSU also started moving into medical training. In April 1997 the Teacher Training Agency decided to withdraw accreditation for the college's teacher training courses, forcing LSU to close. This followed the college's failure to pass an important academic validation inspection after which Bishop of Portsmouth Anthony Emery was quoted as saying \\"The full story cannot be told at the present time\\". At that stage the college employed 315 staff and had over 2,000 students. The teacher training and art programmes were immediately taken over by nearby education providers, including the University of Southampton, Chichester College of Higher Education and King Alfred's College, Winchester. The college campus was immediately taken over by the University of Southampton and became a campus of the university called New College, specialising in adult and continuing education, and art programmes. The New College campus was sold by the University in 2006, and the educational activities on the site moved to Southampton University's main campuses at Highfield, Winchester and Boldrewood. The campus is now a housing area with a mix of houses and apartments, built by Linden Homes. Most of the original buildings, and the original houses which were used as Halls of Residence in Archers Road, are gone. The two newer Halls of Residence, Gateley Halls and Romero Halls, which were built in 1994, are still being used by University of Southampton students. ==References== ==See also== * La Sainte Union Catholic School * St. Anne's Catholic School (Southampton) Category:University of Southampton Category:Teacher training colleges in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct universities and colleges in England ","title":"La Sainte Union College of Higher Education"},{"id":"1272906","text":"The Peugeot 403 is a car produced by French automobile manufacturer Peugeot between May 1955 and October 1966. A total of 1,214,121 of all types, including commercial models, were produced,Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, revised paperback edition published 1993, page 152 making it the first Peugeot to exceed the one million mark. ==History== The 403 made its debut in saloon body style on 20 April 1955 at the Trocad√©ro Palace in Paris. For several months before it was launched numerous 403s, their badges removed, were circulating on the local roads near the manufacturer's PSA Sochaux factory, becoming so familiar that the locals no longer noticed them, but still attracting from Paris motoring journalists and photographers to a town that usually was of little interest to the national media. The TN3 engine size gave the car a \\"tax horsepower\\" of 8 CV (8 hp), which placed it a class below the soon-to-be-replaced 11 CV Citro√´n Traction, but at least one class above the small cars produced by the principal competitor manufacturers. When it was first shown, and until after 1958, the leading edge of car's nose carried an angular, forward-leaning chrome lion bonnet ornament - the lion image being Peugeot's trade mark. That was removed for 1959, due to safety concerns, and the logo was incorporated into a shield- shaped grill emblem. Subsequently the semaphore-style trafficators on the C-pillars were replaced with flashing indicators within the light cluster. The front lights were modified to conform to new standards and in 1957 parallel windscreen wipers were substituted for the original \\"cross hands\\" ones featured at launch. Although the car was subject to various improvements during the production run, these were mostly very minor in nature. Improvements for 1959 included moving the nozzles for the windscreen washer from the strip of metal between the base of the windscreen and the bonnet/hood a short distance to the rear edge of the bonnet/hood itself, thus presumably improving the angles at which the washer water hit the screen. This was also the year that the semi-circular ring inside the lower half of the diameter of the steering wheel used to operate the horn was replaced by a full circular horn-ring, so that drivers accustomed to holding the upper half of the steering wheel did not need to loosen their grip in order to sound the horn. ==Design== Styled by Pinin Farina, the 403 featured ponton, three-box styling incorporating, except on the most basic models, an opening roof panel. The collaboration with Pinin Farina marked the start of a partnership which would see the Italian designer producing designs for Peugeot, including those many mainstream volume models, for more than fifty years. Regarding the 403 itself there were persistent rumours that the design was one originally intended for a replacement Fiat 1900 which had been rejected when Turin had decided to defer replacement of the Fiat for another four years. Unusual in Europe at the time, but appreciated by customers, was the way that the rear doors opened wide - to a full 90 degrees. Also unusual were the windows in the rear doors that opened fully into the door frame to the point where they disappeared, despite the intrusion into the door frame of a wheel arch which must have made the fit of the window when opened very marginal. ==Engine== The 403 came with an enlarged version of the Peugeot 203's 1290 cc petrol engine. Displacing 1468 cc, the straight-four unit employed pushrod-actuated valves and hemispherical combustion chambers and a crossflow cylinder head to produce at about 5,000 rpm and of torque at 2,500 rpm. An unusual feature at the time was the thermostatically controlled engine fan which cut out when the engine temperature fell to 75¬∞C and reengaged when the engine temperature increased to 84¬∞C. Claimed advantages included an improvement in fuel consumption of between 5% and 10% according to average speed and the avoidance, under many conditions, of fan noise. Another little noticed but ingenious feature involved a small hot water based heating device for the carburetor linked to the heater for the passenger cabin in such a manner that it operated only when the driver turned on the heater and not when the ambient temperature was high enough for the heater to be left off. A diesel powered Peugeot 403 estate was introduced in the Autumn of 1958, the first of a long line, followed by a diesel saloon a year later. Upon the 203's discontinuation in 1960, a 47 hp version of its 1290 cc powerplant became available as an option on a reduced specification version of the 403, branded initially as the \\"403 Sept\\" (\\"7\\") and soon afterwards as the \\"403 Berline Luxe\\". Car tax in France was based on engine size, and the smaller engined 403 fell within the 7CV taxation class rather than the 8CV of the bigger version. ==Transmission== The 403 came with a manual 4-speed all-synchromesh transmission driving the rear wheels. The gear change lever stuck out from the right side of the steering column. For the Paris Motor Show in October 1957 the manufacturer offered, at extra cost, an electro-magnetic Jaeger automatic clutch, activated when changing gear. ==Interior== An unusual feature was that the front seats could be reclined to the point where the seat backs were flush with the cushions of the rear seat, thus creating a \\"couchette\\", sometimes described in English language sources, humorously, as a double bed. ==Body variants== The wheelbase was lengthened by for the five door Peugeot 403 \\"Familiale\\" and \\"Commerciale\\" estate versions. The Familiale provided a third row of seats and was described as a 7/8 seater while the Commerciale offered a more conventional seat configuration for an estate car. The lengthened 403 estate had a solid rear axle fitted to an aluminum differential case. It came with a manual column change gearbox and, in its \\"Familiale\\" guise, fully reclinable front seats. Sunroof and steel belted radial tires were standard. Reliability was considered excellent for the time. A two-door cabriolet version of the car was also offered, with a luxurious interior featuring high quality leather upholstery. In 1958 the 403 cabriolet cost 80% more than the entry level \\"berline grand luxe\\" 403 sedan, and presumably for this reason the convertible 403 was produced and sold only in very modest numbers. In the spring of 1961 production of the 403 cabriolet came to an end, in anticipation of the launch later that year of the manufacturer's 404 Cabriolet. 2-door pickup and 3-door van commercial variants of the 403 were also produced. 1959 Peugeot 403 1.5 Side.jpgSaloon side 1959 Peugeot 403 1.5 Rear.jpgSaloon rear 1961 Peugeot 403 U Break (403B5), rear left.jpgFamiliale/Commerciale Peugeot 403 Cabriolet 001.jpgCabriolet File:Peugeot 403 Pickup at Schaffen-Diest.JPGPickup ==Production== Peugeot 403 production (units): ::* 1955 ..... 21,326 ::* 1956 ..... 71,551 ::* 1957 ... ::* 1958 ... 121,757 ::* 1959 ... ::* 1960 ... ::* 1961 ..... 78,296 ::* 1962 .... ::* 1963 .... ::* 1964 ..... 53,371 ::* 1965 ..... 27,296 :This data does not include 403 based light trucks Superseded by the Peugeot 404 in 1960, the 403 remained in production as a budget alternative until 1966. In addition to Argentinian and Australian production, the local Volkswagen assembler in New Zealand built 1,033 Peugeot 403s in just under four years, beginning in March 1960. ==Culture== Columbo's Peugeot 403 Cabriolet On the American television show Columbo, starring Peter Falk, the shambling hero, detective Lt. Columbo, drove a shabby-looking 403 cabriolet dating from 1959 or 1960. According to the 1991 episode \\"Columbo and the Murder of a Rock Star\\", the car's cabriolet roof had never been lowered during his years of ownership. However, in the 1972 episode \\"Lady in Waiting\\" and in the 1973 episode \\"The Most Dangerous Match\\", Columbo can be seen driving the car with a lowered roof.

Following partition of India in 1947, Kasur District was allocated to Pakistan. His father, Ustad Ali Baksh Jarnail or Ali Bakhsh Kasuri was a singer who belonged to the Patiala gharana (vocal school) of Punjab. At the age of five, Bade Ghulam began training in vocal music from his paternal uncle Kale Khan, and later from his father. He had three younger brothers namely Barkat Ali Khan, Mubarak Ali Khan and Amanat Ali Khan. ==Singing career== Bade Ghulam Ali Khan on a 2003 stamp of India Though he started his career by singing a few compositions of his late father Ali Baksh Khan and uncle Kale Khan, Bade Ghulam amalgamated the best of three traditions into his own Patiala-Kasur style: the Behram Khani elements of Dhrupad, the gyrations of Jaipur, and the behlavas (embellishments) of Gwalior. Many of his raga expositions were brief, contrary to convention and while he agreed that the beauty of classical music lay in leisurely improvisation, he believed that the audience would not appreciate long alaps, particularly considering his tendency towards singing for the masses and therefore, changed the music to what the audience wanted. He excelled at more light-hearted ragas such as Adana, Bhupali, Hameer, Jaijaiwanti and Jaunpuri. Under the pen name of Sabrang he created many new compositions. Unlike his younger son Munawar Ali Khan, who had an open-throated voice, Khan Sahib's voice was slurred. After the Partition of India in 1947, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan went to his hometown Kasur in Pakistan, but returned to India later to reside permanently there in 1957. With the help of Bombay Chief Minister, Morarji Desai he acquired Indian citizenship and moved to a bungalow at Malabar Hill in Mumbai. He lived at various times in Lahore, Bombay, Calcutta, and finally Hyderabad. For a long time, he stayed away from singing in films despite requests and persuasions from well-known producers and music directors. However he was coaxed and convinced by film producer K Asif to sing two songs based on ragas Sohni and Rageshri for the 1960 film Mughal-e-Azam with the music directed by Naushad. He demanded and received an extremely high price, reportedly to the tune of ‚Çπ25,000 per song, when the rates of popular and star playback singers such as Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi was below ‚Çπ500 per song at that time. ==Awards and recognition== *Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1962) *Sangeet Natak Akademi fellow (1967) *Padma Bhushan Award (1962)Padma Bhushan Award (1962) listed for Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Government of India website, Retrieved 19 October 2020 ==Death== He died in Bashir Bagh Palace in Hyderabad on 23 April 1968 after a prolonged illness had left him partially paralyzed in the last few years of his life.

A key figure in the reception of Western philosophy, the emergence of modern Buddhism, and the permeation of the imperial ideology during the second half of the Meiji Era. He is the founder of Toyo University and the creator of Tetsugaku-d≈ç Park Âì≤Â≠¶Â†ÇÂÖ¨Âúí (Temple Garden of Philosophy) in Tokyo. Because he studied in order to debunk superstitions, he is sometimes called and the .The article is based on the research published in Schulzer. Inoue Enryo (2019). ==Biography== ===Early Years 1858-1881=== Born in a village close to Nagaoka in today's Niigata Prefecture, he was ordained as a priest in the ≈åtani Branch Â§ßË∞∑Ê¥æ of Shin Buddhism ÁúüÂÆó at the age of 13. As the oldest son, he was brought up to inherit the ministry of his father's parish temple. His early education included the Chinese classics and Western subjects like geography and English. In 1878, his Buddhist order sent him to Tokyo in order to study at Japan's first modern university. Before entering Tokyo University in 1881 Inoue received additional secondary education in English, history, and mathematics in the university's Preparatory School. ===Establishment 1881-1888=== Registering for philosophy as single major at Tokyo University first became possible in 1881. Inoue was the first and only student in 1881 to do so. As a student, Inoue initiated Japan's first Society of Philosophy (1884). On the occasion of his graduation in 1885, he created a Philosophy Ceremony Âì≤Â≠¶Á•≠ that commemorated Buddha, Confucius, Socrates and Kant as the Four Sages of world philosophy. In 1887, he set up a Philosophy Publishing House Âì≤Â≠¶Êõ∏Èô¢, edited the first issue of the Journal of the Philosophy Society„ÄéÂì≤Â≠¶‰ºöÈõëË™å„Äèand founded the Philosophy Academy Âì≤Â≠¶È§®, the predecessor of today's Toyo University (Êù±Ê¥ãÂ§ßÂ≠¶). His early works Epitome of Philosophy„ÄéÂì≤Â≠¶Ë¶ÅÈ†ò„Äè(1886/86) and Outline of Ethics„ÄéÂÄ´ÁêÜÈÄöË´ñ„Äè(1887) are the first Japanese introductions to philosophy in East and West. Besides establishing and popularizing philosophy, Inoue dedicated himself as a lay scholar to the critique of Christianity and the reform of Buddhism. The latter project he announced in the Prolegomena to a Living Discourse on Buddhism„Äé‰ªèÊïôÊ¥ªË´ñÂ∫èË´ñ„Äè(1887), which is the introduction to a tripartite work that aimed to give Buddhism a new doctrinal foundation for the modern world. In the Prolegomena Inoue first proclaimed his lifelong slogan \\"Protection of Country and Love of Truth\\" Ë≠∑ÂõΩÊÑõÁêÜ. Inoue attempted to demonstrate Buddhism's consistency with philosophical and scientific truth and its benefit to the modern Japanese nation state. In 1886, Inoue married Yoshida Kei ÂêâÁî∞Êï¨ (1862-1951) with whom he had one son, Gen'ichi ÁéÑ‰∏Ä (1887-1972), and two daughters, Shigeno ÊªãÈáé (1890-1954) and Sumie ÊæÑÊ±ü (1899-1979). ===Leadership 1889-1902=== In 1888, Inoue departed on his first of three world tours. The nationalist spirit he observed in the Western imperial countries and the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890) after his return, gave Inoue's maxim of the Protection of Country concrete meaning. The spread of the Education Rescript as the moral foundation of the rising Japanese Empire became one of his main objectives for the rest of his life. In his lectures at the Philosophy Academy, Inoue pioneered several academic fields. Inoue's lecture records which were published as textbooks for the Academy's distance learning program cover subjects like Psychology, Pedagogy, Religious Studies, Buddhist Philosophy and the original science Inoue called Mystery Studies Â¶ñÊÄ™Â≠¶. In a large-scale project, he recorded, categorized and rationally explained every kind of folk belief and superstition he heard about in Japan. This ambitious program made him famous among his contemporaries as Doctor Specter „ÅäÂåñ„ÅëÂçöÂ£´ or Â¶ñÊÄ™ÂçöÂ£´. Inoue managed the Philosophy Academy as an institution that promoted the revival of Eastern scholarship. Most pioneers of modern Buddhist studies were lecturing in the Academy. Inoue interpreted his role as a lobbyist for Buddhism in the capital and worked to consolidate the position of private education with the Ministry of Education. In 1896, Inoue was the first to be awarded a Doctor of Letters by submitting a thesis to the Faculty of Literature of Tokyo Imperial University. ===Crisis 1903-1906=== While Inoue was on his second world tour, the so-called Philosophy Academy Incident Âì≤Â≠¶È§®‰∫ã‰ª∂ (1903/04) took its course. Inspectors from the Education Ministry became aware that one student received a full score in the ethics examination for answering that regicide under certain circumstances could be legitimate. The ministry threatened to close down the Academy, demanded that the responsible teacher resign and withdrew the Academy's right to grant certificates for teaching in public schools. In the years after the Philosophy Academy Incident several factors played together which eventually led to Inoue's resignation from the Academy in 1905/06: (1) internal differences about the Academy's management, (2) estrangement from other Buddhist leaders, (3) health problems. During the same period, Inoue started two new projects that became seminal for his late activities: the foundation of the Morality Church ‰øÆË∫´Êïô‰ºö (1903) and the building of the Philosophy Shrine Âì≤Â≠¶Â†Ç (1904). ===Independence 1906-1919=== Starting in 1890, lecture tours were important for Inoue to raise funds for the Philosophy Academy. After 1906, the fund raising served to create the Temple Garden of Philosophy around the Philosophy Shrine in today's Nakano District in Tokyo. Inoue started his lecture tours during his late period in the name of the Morality Church initiative, which aimed at establishing Sunday schools in shrines and temples all over the country. In 1912, he renamed the organization into the Society for the Spread of Civic Morality ÂõΩÊ∞ëÈÅìÂæ≥ÊôÆÂèä‰ºö. The venue of his lectures moved away from temples into primary schools. The main objective however stayed the same, namely teaching national morals and spreading the Imperial Rescript on Education. It was Inoue's ambition to lecture literally everywhere in Japan. During his late life, he extended his radius to the new Japanese colonies in Korea, Manchuria, Hokkaid≈ç, Sakhalin, Okinawa, Taiwan, and China. Inoue died on June 6 1919 after giving a lecture in Dalian, China. ==Works== Below is a chronological list of Inoue's monographs.

His works were influential in spreading the terminology of modern East Asian humanities. Due to his prolific writing, the distance learning program of the Philosophy Academy and his lectures tours, Inoue probably had a larger audience than any other public intellectual before the First World War. He must have contributed considerably to the decline of superstition and the spread of the imperial ideology during the late Meiji period.Schulzer. Inoue Enryo (2019), chap. 14, 17, 19, 23. His prominence during his lifetime stands in stark contrast to the minimal attention paid to his work after his death. His uncritical speculative metaphysics and his ethics being based solely on imperially decreed virtues, make any future affirmative philosophical reception unlikely.Schulzer. Inoue Enryo (2019), chap. 18, 24. Japanese Buddhist studies have passed over Inoue, because his Buddhist scholarship was not yet based on Sanskrit philology. Any philosophical discussion about the doctrinal foundations of Buddhism will nonetheless have to acknowledge Inoue's pioneering work. In contemporary scholarship, a growing interest in his voluminous works on Mystery Studies is conceivable. Figal 1999; Foster 2008 and 2015.

Titus Quinctius Flamininus: Philhellenism and Realpolitik0 There were however, some Romans during the late Republic, who were distinctly anti-Greek, resenting the increasing influence of Greek culture on Roman life, an example being the Roman Censor, Cato the Elder and also Cato the Younger, who lived during the \\"Greek invasion\\" of Rome but towards the later years of his life he eventually became a philhellene after his stay in Rhodes. The lyric poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus was another philhellene. He is notable for his words, \\"Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artis intulit agresti Latio\\" (Conquered Greece took captive her savage conqueror and brought her arts into rustic Latium), meaning that after the conquest of Greece the defeated Greeks created a cultural hegemony over the Romans. Roman emperors known for their philhellenism include Nero, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius and Julian the Apostate. ==Modern times== Victor Hugo, a well known philhellene In the period of political reaction and repression after the fall of Napoleon, when the liberal-minded, educated and prosperous middle and upper classes of European societies found the romantic revolutionary ideals of 1789-92 repressed by the restoration of old regimes at home, the idea of the re-creation of a Greek state on the very territories that were sanctified by their view of Antiquity‚Äîwhich was reflected even in the furnishings of their own parlors and the contents of their bookcases‚Äîoffered an ideal, set at a romantic distance. Under these conditions, the Greek uprising constituted a source of inspiration and expectations that could never actually be fulfilled, disappointing what Paul Cartledge called \\"the Victorian self-identification with the Glory that was Greece\\".Cartledge American higher education was fundamentally transformed by the rising admiration of and identification with ancient Greece in the 1830s and afterward. Another popular subject of interest in Greek culture at the turn of the 19th century was the shadowy Scythian philosopher Anacharsis, who lived in the 6th century BCE. The new prominence of Anacharsis was sparked by Jean-Jacques Barth√©lemy's fanciful Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece (1788), a learned imaginary travel journal, one of the first historical novels, which a modern scholar has called \\"the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique\\" in the late 18th century. It had a high impact on the growth of philhellenism in France: the book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and was translated into German and other languages. It later inspired European sympathy for the Greek War of Independence and spawned sequels and imitations throughout the 19th century. In German culture the first phase of philhellenism can be traced in the careers and writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, one of the inventors of art history, Friedrich August Wolf, who inaugurated modern Homeric scholarship with his Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795) and the enlightened bureaucrat Wilhelm von Humboldt. It was also in this context that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich H√∂lderlin were to compose poetry and prose in the field of literature, elevating Hellenic themes in their works. In the German states, the private obsession with ancient Greece took public forms, institutionalizing an elite philhellene ethos through the Gymnasium, to revitalize German education at home, and providing on two occasions high- minded philhellene German princes ignorant of modern-day Greek realities, to be Greek sovereigns.The history of pedagogically conservative philhellenism in German high academic culture has been examined in Suzanne L. Marchand, Down from Olympus: Archaeology and Philhellenism in Germany, 1750-1970 (Princeton University Press, 1996); she begins with Winckelmann, Wolf and von Humboldt. During the later 19th century the new studies of archaeology and anthropology began to offer a quite separate view of ancient Greece, which had previously been experienced at second-hand only through Greek literature, Greek sculpture and architecture.S.L. Marchand, 1992. Archaeology and Cultural Politics in Germany, 1800-1965: The Decline of Philhellenism (University of Chicago). 20th century heirs of the 19th-century view of an unchanging, immortal quality of \\"Greekness\\" are typified in J.C. Lawson's Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion (1910) or R. and E. Blum's The Dangerous Hour: The lore of crisis and mystery in rural Greece (1970); according to the Classicist Paul Cartledge, they \\"represent this ideological construction of Greekness as an essence, a Classicizing essence to be sure, impervious to such historic changes as that from paganism to Orthodox Christianity, or from subsistence peasant agriculture to more or less internationally market-driven capitalist farming.\\"Cartledge 1995 The Philhellenic movement led to the introduction of Classics or Classical studies as a key element in education, introduced in the Gymnasien in Prussia. In England the main proponent of Classics in schools was Thomas Arnold, headmaster at Rugby School. The theme of Nikos Dimou's The Misfortune to be GreekŒó Œ¥œÖœÉœÑœÖœáŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒΩŒ± ŒµŒØœÉŒ±Œπ ŒàŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒ±œÇ, 1975. is the perception that the Philhellenic West's projected desire for the modern Greeks to live up to their ancestors' glorious past has always been a burden upon the Greeks themselves. In particular, Western Philhellenism focused exclusively on the heritage of Classical Greek history, in effect negating or rejecting the heritage of Byzantine history which for the Greeks themselves is at least as important. ===Philhellenism and art=== Philhellenism also created a renewed interest in the artistic movement of Neoclassicism, which idealized 5th- century Classical Greek art and architecture,It often selected for its favoured models third and second century sculptures that were actually Hellenistic in origin, and appreciated through the lens of Roman copies: see Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Antique Sculpture 1500-1900 1981. very much at second hand, through the writings of the first generation of art historians, like Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. The groundswell of the Philhellenic movement was result of two generations of intrepid artists and amateur treasure-seekers, from Stuart and Revett, who published their measured drawings as The Antiquities of Athens and culminating with the removal of sculptures from Aegina and the Parthenon (the Elgin marbles), works that ravished the British Philhellenes, many of whom, however, deplored their removal. ===Philhellenism in the Greek War of Independence and later=== Many well known philhellenes supported the Greek Independence Movement such as Shelley, Thomas Moore, Leigh Hunt, Cam Hobhouse, Walter Savage Landor and Jeremy Bentham. Some, notably Lord Byron, even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries. Many more financed the revolution or contributed through their artistic work. Throughout the 19th century, philhellenes continued to support Greece politically and militarily. For example, Ricciotti Garibaldi led a volunteer expedition (Garibaldini) in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.Gilles P√©cout, \\"Philhellenism in Italy: political friendship and the Italian volunteers in the Mediterranean in the nineteenth century\\", Journal of Modern Italian Studies 9:4:405-427 (2004) A group of Garibaldini, headed by the Greek poet Lorentzos Mavilis, fought also with the Greek side during the Balkan Wars.

The show's contents and format are similar to a television Sunday morning talk show. It is produced from the studios of CBO-FM at the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre in Ottawa, Ontario. ==History== The program debuted on October 22, 1977, soon after the rules of the House of Commons of Canada were changed to permit radio and television broadcasts of the chamber's proceedings. The program's original concept was to simply record and air House debates, although the producers soon decided to add interview and journalism segments to broaden the program's scope and appeal. In late 2001 and early 2002, during the same repositioning process that ultimately saw the network's weekday morning program This Morning replaced with The Current and Sounds Like Canada, media began to report that The House was also slated for cancellation.

William Drayton (December 30, 1776 - May 24, 1846) was an American politician, banker, and writer who grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of William Drayton, Sr., who served as justice of the Province of East Florida (1765‚Äì1780). Drayton served as a United States Representative to Congress (1825‚Äì1833). Following the Nullification Crisis, as a unionist Drayton decided to move his family to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1833. He lived there the rest of his life. He was appointed as president of the Second Bank of the United States. ==Early life and education== The son of William Drayton, Sr. and his wife, William was born in St. Augustine, Florida, where his father served from 1765 to 1780 as the chief justice for the Province of East Florida. In 1780 the judge lost his position due to accusations of sympathy with rebels in the American Revolutionary War; he returned with his family to Charleston. He had bought property and plantations in Florida, including what became called Drayton Island. The Drayton sons were sent to England to complete their educations. Afterward, with his older brother Jacob, William studied law in Charleston. Both became lawyers. ==Marriage and family== About 1804 William Drayton married Anna Gadsden (d. 1814), a cousin once removed. They had four children: *Emma Gadsden (c. 1804 ‚Äì 1840) *Thomas Fenwick (1809‚Äì1891), became a Confederate Army general *Percival (1812‚Äì1865), became a career US Naval officer *William Sidney (b. c. 1814‚Äì1860), became a US Naval officer and shipping businessman After Anna's death, in 1817 Drayton married Maria Heyward. Two of their five children survived to adulthood. Maria Heyward Drayton was also close to her young stepchildren.: *William Heyward, became a lawyer in Philadelphia. *Henry Edward, became a doctor in Philadelphia. The two younger Drayton brothers married the sisters Harriet and Sarah Coleman, respectively. Thomas Drayton, a West Point graduate, stayed in South Carolina when the family moved north and bought a plantation at Hilton Head. He resigned from the US Army to join Confederate forces after secession. He and his brother Percival \\"commanded opposing forces\\" in the battle of Port Royal, South Carolina, when Union forces captured the forts.\\"Drayton Family Papers\\", including correspondence from 1783‚Äì1896, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, accessed 1 May 2012 File:TFDrayton.jpgThomas Fenwick Drayton, General CSA File:Percival Drayton.jpgPercival Drayton,Captain USN File:Port Royal.jpegBattle of Port Royal November 7,1861 ==Career== William Drayton served in the War of 1812, where he was commissioned as a colonel (a rank he used all his life). In a November 12, 1816 letter to president-elect James Monroe, Andrew Jackson recommended, unsuccessfully, that Drayton, a Federalist who had shown loyalty to the Madison administration and the union through his military service, be appointed Secretary of War to heal the breach between the Federalist Party, now largely moribund on the national level, and the Republicans.Harry Ammon, \\"James Monroe and the Era of Good Feelings,\\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 66, no. 4 (Oct. 1958): 387-398; p. 389. Colonel Drayton was elected in 1824 to represent South Carolina's first district in the U.S. Congress, and served from 1825 to 1833 with repeated re- election. A unionist during the nullification controversy, in 1833 he moved his family to Philadelphia.biographic sketch at U.S. Congress website While a unionist, Drayton continued to support slavery. In Philadelphia he wrote and published The South Vindicated from the Treason and Fanaticism of the Abolitionists (1836), a pro-slavery tract.

He wrote for the National Review magazine and was a syndicated columnist. Pat Buchanan called Sobran \\"perhaps the finest columnist of our generation\\". == Life and career == Sobran was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan into a devoutly Roman Catholic family. He graduated in 1969 from Eastern Michigan University in his native Ypsilanti with a Bachelor of Arts in English. He studied for a graduate degree in English, with a concentration on Shakespearean studies following his graduation. In the late 1960s, Sobran lectured on Shakespeare and English on a fellowship with the university. In 1972, Sobran began working at National Review. During the 1970s, he frequently used the byline M. J. Sobran. He stayed for twenty-one years, eighteen as senior editor, before he was removed from the publication amidst controversial charges of antisemitism. Aside from his work at National Review, Sobran spent twenty-one years as a commentator on the CBS Radio Spectrum program series. He was a syndicated columnist, first with the Los Angeles Times and later with the Universal Press Syndicate. In 2007, he discontinued circulation of his newsletter by mail. From 1988 to 2007, Sobran wrote the column \\"Washington Watch\\" for the Catholic weekly The Wanderer. He had a monthly column that appears in Catholic Family News. He wrote the \\"Bare Bodkin\\" column for the paleoconservative Chronicles magazine. Additionally, his essays have appeared in The Human Life Review, Celebrate Life! and The Free Market. Sobran was a media fellow of the Mises Institute. == Departure from National Review == In 1993, Sobran was fired from National Review for a series of columns that the then-publisher William F. Buckley Jr., considered \\"contextually anti-Semitic\\". Norman Podhoretz wrote that \\"Joe Sobran's columns [...] [are] anti-Semitic in themselves, and not merely 'contextually and Buckley disagreed with Podhoretz's accusation, instead \\"deem[ing] Joe Sobran's six columns contextually anti-Semitic. By this I mean that if he had been talking, let us say, about the lobbying interests of the Arabs or of the Chinese, he would not have raised eyebrows as an anti-Arab or an anti-Chinese\\".William F. Buckley Jr.\\"In search of anti-Semitism: what Christians provoke what Jews? Why? By doing what? ‚Äì And vice versa \\", National Review, December 30, 1991. One such comment was that The New York Times \\"really ought to change its name to Holocaust Update\\".Jim Naureckas, \\"The Philadelphia Inquirer's New Spectrum: From Centrism to Anti-Semitism\\", FAIR, November/December 1995. Sobran claimed that Buckley told him to \\"stop antagonizing the Zionist crowd\\" and Buckley accused him of libel and moral incapacitation.Ralph Z. Hallow, \\"War of words raging at National Review,\\" The Washington Times, October 7, 1993. Sobran also complained of \\"a more or less official national obsession with a tiny, faraway socialist ethnocracy\\", meaning Israel.\\"In Pursuit of Anti-Semitism,\\" National Review, 16 March 1992. In his syndicated column for The Wanderer in August 1993, Sobran had defended Pat Buchanan against charges of antisemitism and concluded that comparisons of anti-Zionism to antisemitism is a non sequitur. Sobran was named the Constitution Party's vice presidential nominee in 2000, but he withdrew in April 2000 because of scheduling conflicts with his journalistic commitments. In 2001 and 2003, Sobran spoke at conferences organized by David Irving and shared the podium with Paul Fromm, Charles D. Provan and Mark Weber, director of the Institute for Historical Review, a leading Holocaust-denying group. In 2002, he spoke at the Institute for Historical Review's annual conference. In his speech which he also reprinted in his newsletter, Sobran addressed the subject of Holocaust denial: > I am not, heaven forbid, a \\"Holocaust denier.\\" I lack the scholarly > competence to be one. [...] Why on earth is it 'anti-Jewish' to conclude > from the evidence that the standard numbers of Jews murdered are inaccurate, > or that the Hitler regime, bad as it was in many ways, was not, in fact, > intent on racial extermination? Surely these are controversial conclusions; > but if so, let the controversy rage. Referring to his appearance at the Institute for Historical Review conferences, historian Deborah Lipstadt wrote: \\"Mr. Sobran may not have been an unequivocal [Holocaust] denier, but he gave support and comfort to the worst of them\\".Deborah Lipstadt \\"'Skeptical' on the Holocaust?\\", The New York Times, October 5, 2010. Writing in National Review, Matthew Scully said: \\"His appearance before that sorry outfit a few years ago [...] remains impossible to explain, at least if you're trying to absolve him\\".Matthew Scully, \\"Bard of the Right\\", National Review Online, October 16, 2010. Sobran also wrote: > What, exactly, is \\"anti-Semitism?\\" One standard dictionary definition is > \\"hostility toward or discrimination against Jews as a religious or racial > group.\\" How this applies to me has never been explained. Ann Coulter quoted Sobran's critique of Buckley's book In Search of Anti- Semitism: > Its real message is not that we should like or respect Jews; only that we > should try not to hate them. But this implies that anti-Semitism is the > natural reaction to them: If it's a universal sin, after all, it must be a > universal temptation. [...] When he defends Jews, I sometimes feel like > saying: \\"Bill! Bill! It's all right! They're not that bad!\\" After his removal from National Review, Sobran penned columns for paleoconservative journals such as Chronicles. In 2001, Pat Buchanan offered Sobran a column in Buchanan's new magazine The American Conservative. Editor Scott McConnell withdrew the offer when Sobran refused to cancel his appearance before the Institute for Historical Review.Timothy Stanley, The Crusader: The Life and Tumultuous Times of Pat Buchanan (New York City: St. Martin's Press, 2012), p. 359; == Political philosophy == Throughout much of his career, Sobran identified as a paleoconservative like his colleagues Samuel T. Francis, Pat Buchanan and Peter Gemma. He supported strict interpretation of the United States Constitution. In 2002, Sobran announced his philosophical and political shift to libertarianism (paleolibertarian anarcho-capitalism) and cited inspiration by theorists Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe. He referred to himself as a \\"theo-anarchist\\". In the 2008 presidential election, Sobran endorsed Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin. Sobran said Catholic teachings are consistent with his opposition to abortion and the Iraq War. He argued that the 9/11 attacks were a result of the United States government's policies in the Middle East. He claimed those policies are formed by the \\"Jewish lobby\\". Sobran considered communism to be at least in part a Jewish phenomenon, writing: > Christians knew that Communism ‚Äì often called \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\" ‚Äì would > bring awful persecution with the ultimate goal of the annihilation of > Christianity. While the atheistic Soviet regime made war on Christians, > murdering tens of thousands of Orthodox priests, it also showed its true > colors by making anti-Semitism a capital crime. Countless Jews around the > world remained pro-Communist even after Stalin had purged most Jews from > positions of power in the Soviet Union. == Shakespeare authorship theory == In a book entitled Alias Shakespeare: Solving the Greatest Literary Mystery of All Time (1997), Sobran espoused the Oxfordian theory that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford was the true author of the plays attributed to William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon. == Personal life == Sobran was twice married and divorced. He had four children and was survived by ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He died in a nursing home in Fairfax, Virginia on September 30, 2010 as the result of kidney failure spurred by diabetes. == Books and other publications == At the time of his death, Sobran was working on two books, namely one concerning Abraham Lincoln's presidency and the United States Constitution and another about de Vere's poetry. Sobran is also the author of the following books: * Single Issues: Essays on the Crucial Social Questions ‚Äì Human Life Press ‚Äì 1983 * Alias Shakespeare: Solving the Greatest Literary Mystery of All Time ‚Äì Free Press 1997 * Hustler: The Clinton Legacy ‚Äì Griffin Communications 2000 Sobran has produced a number of published articles and speeches, including the following: * Anything Called a Program is Unconstitutional ‚Äì Griffin Communications ‚Äì 2001 * The Church Today: Less Catholic Than the Pope? ‚Äì National Committee of Catholic Laymen ‚Äì 1979 * How Tyranny Came to America, Sobran's, n.d. * Pensees: Notes for the reactionary of tomorrow National Review, December 31, 1985.

It follows the anti-hero Juno and her friends, outcasts from society forced to band together to survive in mob society New Orleans. It is set in New Orleans in the near future. Juno and her friends have each been granted different elemental powers and are outcasts from society. They discovered their powers shortly after the Betaverse attack on planet Earth, an event which only they seem to remember. The story deals in depth with aspects of predestination and fate, with Juno being fated to save a world she hates. The art style of Star Cross'd Destiny is an unusual blend of Japanese manga and anime, traditional American comic book art, and atmospheric photo-manipulations. The story comes from a lengthy novel that Blair penned in 1999, revised in 2001, and later decided would be better realized in graphic novel form. On the web most illustrations are in full color, but the first volume print version is in grayscale. Star Cross'd Destiny was released for distribution in color in late 2009 starting with a reprint of Volume 1, The Fated. The second volume, \\"Death of Balance\\" was released in full color print in 2014. In 2005, the comic won the award for 'Outstanding Dramatic Comic' in the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards.The 2005 Cartoonists' Choice Awards On November 20, 2009 the comic went on hiatus, with the author writing that she would instead focus on her band, Absinthe Junk. The comic returned to regular updates in January 2013. ==The Cast== ===Alphaverse Controllers=== Juno Mijunkuro: Juno is the main character in Star Cross'd Destiny, yielding the primary power of air and the secondary power of metaphysical darkness. Outcast since the awakening of her power when she was fourteen, Juno is vengeful, independent, and much older than her nineteen years make her appear. Shortly before her power's awakening her parents were brutally murdered by two controllers of the Betaverse, a parasitic verse, and that is about the only thing she remembers about them. Juno has many outstanding debts with the Cajun Mafia and is wanted by the police. Shades McKerrean: Shades is the beholder of Light and his secondary power is Regeneration. Shades is the light behind Juno's eyes. Meeting shortly after the first attack, Shades took in Juno and they shortly became best friends. Shades gained his nickname by Juno who at first couldn't pronounce his Irish name through her thick Japanese accent. On the streets since he was kicked out by his family due to his strange power over light he has become tough and menacing to those that didn't know him. His eyes, however, always gave him away. He talks way too much and usually drives Juno crazy, making them the comic relief of the book. Samantha Vasquez: Sam yields the power of fire the secondary power of time. Sam is best known throughout the story for her wit and psychism. Controlling the flame, she has a fighting and persistent spirit. She is very stubborn but not nearly as stubborn as her usual target of accusation Juno. Sam and Juno met shortly after the first attack and they quickly became best friends though it's hard to tell if they're really more enemies than friends. Sam is constantly in Juno's business, trying to make her realize the obvious trials she's putting herself through. She is a very strong character despite her losses. She lives in the Marigny district close to Pike and cares for her mother. Pike Piri: Pike is the beholder of water and secondary beholder of ice or more accurately the ability to alternate temperature in her aura. Pike is probably the most level-headed of the group. The perfect definition of a human super-soaker, Pike, beholder of water, has been Juno's friend more years than Juno even knows. Pike's sister died to save her when the Betaverse broke through, her father died shortly thereafter from complications from the attack, and Pike's mother committed suicide shortly thereafter after losing her sanity, leaving Pike with a burning vengeance that dwells deep within her soul (something only few people know about). Unlike Juno Pike remembers everything about the attack. She inherited her house which rests quietly in the Marigny District. Carefree and happy, Pike is Juno's mother-figure, accepting her need for solitude but also her need for help. Sara Heath: Sara is the behold of Energy or Ether. Sara is a minor character but is among the main group. A constant whiner and quite cowardly, she was the dubbed early on as group airhead and completely ignorant to it. Not usually the type to hang out with Juno and her friends, Sara ran with the more popular types, her powers only known by the four others she trusted. ===Other Characters=== Rheanna: Rheanna is one of Juno's non-powered friends and one of her partners in crime. Juno often runs away from the group to seek refuge with Rheanna and Ben (another non-powered) away from all the stress. Rheanna, Ben, Juno, and Shades usually find themselves in trouble when they're together. Ben: Ben is a waiter at Deril's Diner, the French Quarter hangout Juno frequents. Unlike Juno's friend Rheanna, Ben has no idea of Juno's powers or any of her friends. Ben is usually a fellow instigator in Juno's grand schemes along with Rheanna but is usually the one who doesn't get caught. Ben does not have powers. == References == ==External links == *Official website for Star Cross'd Destiny *Star Cross'd Destiny on Myspace *SCD Original Soundtrack Category:2000s webcomics Category:Fantasy webcomics Category:Web Cartoonists' Choice Award winners Category:2003 webcomic debuts ","title":"Star Cross'd Destiny"},{"id":"1272961","text":"Paskevich is a surname of: * Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich (1782‚Äì1856), field marshal in the Russian, Prussian, and Austrian armies * Nicolay Paskevich (1907‚Äì2003), painter Category:Russian-language surnames Category:Surnames of Ukrainian origin Category:Polish-language surnames Category:Surnames of Polish origin ","title":"Paskevich"},{"id":"1272968","text":"Nesselrode is the name of an ancient German noble family originating in the Duchy of Berg. Over the centuries, the family expanded their possessions through marriage with the most powerful families of the region. There were several branches of the family: Nesselrode-Reichenstein, Nesselrode-Ehreshoven and Nesselrode-Landscron and Nesselrode-Hugenpoƒìt. They were sovereign Counts and as such belonged to the High Nobility. == Nesselrode-Reichenstein line == The Reichenstein line were made Imperial barons in 1653 and Imperial Counts in 1702. In 1698, Baron Franz von Nesselrode-Reichenstein (1635-1707), from 1702 Imperial Count, who served as Imperial Chancellor in the Principality of M√ºnster, bought the immediate Lordship of Reichenstein from the Counts von Wied for 6000 thaler. He was followed by his son, Count Franz Wilhelm Anton von Nesselrode-Reichenstein (1701-1776). With his death, this line of the family became extinct. The County of Reichenstein was inherited by his cousin, Count Johann Wilhelm Maximilian von Nesselrode-Landscron (1726-1800), who became the reigning Count von Nesselrode-Reichenstein. He was followed by his son, Johann Franz Joseph von Nesselrode-Reichenstein (1755-1824). Due to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, their immediate possessions were mediatized to Nassau, in 1806. This mediatized branch of the family became extinct in 1824. Their possessions were inherited by the Counts Droste zu Vischering, who incorporated the Nesselrode coat of arms into their own, as the heir of the last reigning Count, Johann Franz Joseph, was his eldest surviving daughter, Countess Maria Karoline Theresia Josepha von Nesselrode- Reichenstein, who became Countess Droste zu Vischering (1779-1858). ==Nesselrode-Landscron line== The Nesselrode-Landscron line were made Imperial barons in 1652 and Imperial Counts in 1710. Baron Johann Salentin Wilhelm von Nesselrode und Rhade (died in 1715), who served as Imperial Oberstleutnant, was made Imperial Count von Nesselrode-Landscron by Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1710. His son, Count Johann Franz von Nesselrode-Landscron (1671-1751), served as Imperial Generalfeldzeugmeister. His son, Count Johann Wilhelm Maximilian von Nesselrode-Landscron und Grimberg (1726-1800), married to Countess Maria Theresia von Auersperg (1729-1803), inherited the Lordship of Reichenstein and became the reigning Count. ==Nesselrode-Ehreshoven line== The Nesselrode-Ehreshoven line were made Imperial barons in 1653 and Imperial Counts in 1710. Some members of the Nesselrode-Ehreshoven branch settled in Russian Empire, in the 18th century, where they held prominent positions and became incorporated into the Russian nobility. Count Wilhelm Karl von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven (1724-1810) served as the Ambassador of Catherine the Great to Portugal. His son, Count Karl Robert von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven (1780‚Äì1862), served as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1814-1856, while his son, Count Dimitri von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven (1816-1906), served in the Russian State Duma and held the position of Oberhofmeister at Imperial Court of Russia. ==Nesselrode-Hugenpoƒìt line== Carl-Theodor, Baron von Nesselrode-Hugenpoƒìt, served as a Major in Bavarian army. His brother, Baron Maximilian von Nesselrode-Hugenpoƒìt, who later became a Generalmajor, was confirmed as a Baron on 22 August 1814, in the Kingdom of Bavaria. The title of Baron in Bavaria was also confirmed in 1822 to Baron Carl Anselm Franz von Nesselrode-Hugenpoƒìt, who served as Bavarian Hauptmann. ==Former properties of the Counts of Nesselrode== File:Leichlingen_Schloss_Nesselrath.jpgCastle Nesselrath File:Ehreshoven.jpgEhreshoven Castle File:Winterscheid,_Burg_Herrnstein.jpgCastle Herrnstein File:Germany_Herten_Castle_(1).jpgCastle Herten File:Hugenpoet03.jpgCastle Hugenpoƒìt File:HausLuettinghofKernburg03.jpgCastle L√ºttinghof Burg_Reichenstein_3.jpgBurg Reichenstein Notable persons with that name include: :* Karl von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven (1780‚Äì1862), Russian foreign minister :* Maria von Nesselrode (1822‚Äì1874), Polish pianist == See also == * Mount Nesselrode Category:German-language surnames ","title":"Nesselrode"},{"id":"1272976","text":"Karma is a concept of Hinduism which explains through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul's (Atman's) reincarnated lives forming a cycle of rebirth. The causality is said to be applicable not only to the material world but also to our thoughts, words, actions and actions that others do under our instructions.Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, The hidden power in humans, Ibera Verlag, page 23., for example if you do a good thing, something good happens to you, and the same applies if you do a bad thing. ==Origins== The earliest appearance of the word karma is found in the Rigveda. The term karma also appears significantly in the Veda. According to Brahmanas, \\"as his wife man is born to the world he has made\\" and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one's good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is 'constituted' by his desires, he is born in the other world with reference to these.Radhakrishnan, S. History of Philosophy - Eastern and Western. P. 50 Scholars have generally agreed that the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the Brhadaranyaka, which is the earliest of the Upanishads. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death.Tull, Herman W. The Vedic Origins of karma : Cosmos as Man in Ancient Indian Myth and Ritual. SUNY Series in Hindu Studies. P. 28 The doctrine of transmigration of the soul, with respect to fateful retribution for acts committed, does not appear in the Rig Veda.Michaels, p. 156. The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the BrƒÅhma·πáas, where words like punar-mrtyu (re-death), punar-asu (coming to life again) and punarajati (rebirth) are used to denote it.Radhakrishnan, S. History of Philosophy - Eastern and Western, P. 50 Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain punar-mrtyu verses of Rigveda to be discussing \\"repeated deaths\\"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in \\"come home once again\\". The concept of karma first appears strongly in the Bhagavad Gita.[The Bhagavad Gita, Indian Sacred Text], By Swami Nikhilananda, Chapter 3, Ramakrishna -Vivekananda Centre Press, 2004 The topic of karma is mentioned in the Puranas. ==Definitions== The word ‚Äòkarma‚Äô has originated from the Sanskrit root ‚Äòkri‚Äô which means ‚Äòto do‚Äô or ‚Äòto ‚Äòact and react‚ÄôYogananda, Paramhansa, Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 26: The Science of Kriya Yoga, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195Bangala Bhasar Abhidhaan ( Dictioanary of the Bengali Language) Shishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt Ltd. 32A, APC Road, Kolakata ‚Äì 700009, Volume 1, p.151. (ed. 1994) \\"Karma\\" literally means \\"action,\\" and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness.Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, lexicon section of his book, Dancing with Siva Karma is not fate, for we act with what can be described as a conditioned free will creating our own destinies. Karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determine our future. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction. Not all karmas rebound immediately. Some accumulate and return unexpectedly in this or other lifetimes. Human beings are said to produce karma in four ways:Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, The hidden power in humans, Ibera Verlag, page 22., * through thoughts * through right attitude words * through actions that we perform ourselves * through actions others perform under our instructions Everything that we have ever thought, spoken, done or caused is karma, as is also that which we think, speak or do this very moment. Hindu scriptures divide karma into three kinds: * Sanchita is the accumulated karma. It would be impossible to experience and endure all karmas in one lifetime. From this stock of sanchita karma, a handful is taken out to serve one lifetime and this handful of actions, which have begun to bear fruit and which will be exhausted only on their fruit being enjoyed and not otherwise, is known as prarabdha karma. * Prarabdha Fruit-bearing karma is the portion of accumulated karma that has \\"ripened\\" and appears as a particular problem in the present life. * Kriyamana is everything that we produce in the current life. All kriyamana karmas flow in to sanchita karma and consequently shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in another human body. Some believe that only human beings who can distinguish right from wrong can do (kriyamana) karma. Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal, Dialogues with the Guru. Tulsidas, a Hindu saint, said: \\"Our destiny was shaped long before the body came into being.\\" As long as the stock of sanchita karma lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as prarabdha karma for being enjoyed in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A Jiva cannot attain moksha (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death, until the accumulated sanchita karmas are completely exhausted.Goyandaka J, The Secret of Karmayoga, Gita Press, Gorakhpur Unkindness yields spoiled fruits, called pƒÅpa, and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called punya. As one acts, so does one become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.Subramuniyaswami, Satguru Sivaya. Dancing with Siva. ==The role of divine forces== Several different views exist in Hinduism, some extant today and some historical, regarding the role of divine beings in controlling the effects of karma or the lack thereof. ===Vedanta view=== In the theistic side of Vedanta, the creator Ishvara rules over the world through the law of karma. ====Sankara (Advaita)==== In non- dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedanta, the creator is not the ultimate reality, \\"I am God\\" is the supreme truth, the pursuit of self-knowledge is spirituality, and it shares the general concepts of karma-rebirth-samsara ideas found in Buddhism with some important differences. In a commentary to Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, Adi Sankara, an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non- intelligent qualities like adrsta‚Äîan unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result‚Äîby themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara). A human's karmic acts result in merits and demerits. Since unconscious things generally do not move except when caused by an agent (for example, the ax moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues there must be a conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons have earned by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause [a \\"judge and police-force\\" working for \\"the law\\"] in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits. Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences. Since a data-system (or computer) is needed to discern different \\"just\\" consequences for actions, there is suggested to be a sentient theistic administrator or supervisor for karma (Ishvara). ;Advaita according to Sivananda Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.Sivananda, Swami. Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8, Sutras 38-41. There is a passage from Swami Sivananda's translation of the Svetasvatara Upanishad (4:6) illustrating this concept: :Two birds of beautiful plumage ‚Äî inseparable friends ‚Äî live on the same tree. Of these two one eats the sweet fruit while the other looks on without eating. In his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents Brahman or God. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten. Swami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal suffering in the world. According to the Brahma Sutras, individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls. In his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.Sivananda, Swami. Adhikarana XII, Sutras 34-36. ====Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)==== Ramanuja of the Vishishtadvaita school, another sub- school of Vedanta, addresses the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of jivas (souls in bondage to a corporeal form) and maintains that God is \\"amala,\\" or without any stain of evil.Tapasyananda, Swami. Bhakti Schools of Vedanta. In Sri Bhasya, Ramanuja's interpretation of the Brahma sutras from a Vaishnavite theistic view, Brahman, whom he conceives as Vishnu, arranges the diversity of creation in accordance with the different karma of individual souls. Ramanuja reiterates that inequality and diversity in the world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma.Tapasyananda, Swami. Bhakti Schools of Vedanta p 44. Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., Abrahamic religions, which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‚Äònothing,‚Äô Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it. Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of Jivas (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessary to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits. Although souls alone have the freedom and responsibility for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (Anumanta) and the Overseer (Upadrasta).Tapasyananda, Swami. Bhakti Schools of Vedanta p 57. According to Ramanuja, all jivas are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification. According to the foregoing concept, God is \\"compared to light which may be used for forging or for reading scriptures,\\" but the merits or demerit \\"devolves entirely on the persons concerned and not on the darkness.\\" Furthermore, Ramanuja believes that Vishnu wishing to do a favor to those who are resolved on acting so as fully to please Her, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the attainment of God.Dasgupta, Surendranatah, A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume III, Philosophy of the Ramanuja School of Thought, p. 304 ====Madhva (Dvaita)==== Madhva, the founder of the Dvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil.Tapasyananda, Swami. Bhakti Schools of Vedanta pgs. 178-179. Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas (souls) are not God's creation as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with Vishnu, although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo. According to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature.Tapasyananda, Swami. Bhakti Schools of Vedantapgs. 178-179. Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like Shankara's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone. Swami Tapasyananda further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (jivas) move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions. Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation (Mukti-yogyas), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hell or Andhatamas (Tamo- yogyas).Tapasyananda, Swami. Bhakti Schools of Vedanta pg. 177. ==Views of the theistic Hindu traditions believing in a supreme God== Sivananda concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings. ===Shaivism=== ====Thirugnana Sambandar==== action philosophy and value theory: if we sow goodness, we will reap goodness. Sambandar of the Shaiva Siddhanta school, in the 7th century C.E., writes about karma in his outline of Shaivism. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require the existence of an external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition.Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy, pg. 34, by Vraj Kumar Pandey, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers. However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity. Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent Supreme Being with perfect wisdom and power (Shiva, for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual. In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant. ====Appayya Dikshita==== Appayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma.Dasgupta, Surendranath, A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume V, The Southern Schools of Saivism, p. 87 Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone. ====Srikantha==== Srikantha, another Saivite theologian and proponent of Siva Advaita, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds.Dasgupta, Surendranath. A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume V: The Southern Schools of Saivism, pp. 87-89. Srikantha further believes that Siva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action. Regarding the view that karma produce their own effects directly, Srikantha holds that karma being without any intelligence cannot be expected to produce manifold effects through various births and various bodies; rather fruits of one's karma can be performed only by the will of God operating in consonance with man's free will, or as determined in later stages by man's own karma so the prints of all karma are distributed in the proper order by the grace of God Shiva. In this way, God is ultimately responsible on one hand for our actions, and on the other for enjoyment and suffering in accordance with our karmas, without any prejudice to humans' moral responsibility as expressed through free will or as determined later by our own deeds. A good summary of his view is that \\"man is responsible, free to act as he wills to, for Siva only fulfills needs according to the soul's karma.\\" ===Vaishnavism=== ====Sacred Texts==== Bhagavata Purana In Chapter 1 of 10th book of the Bhagavata Purana, Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, exhorts Kamsa to refrain from killing his wife, Devaki, the mother of Krishna, by stating that death is certain for those who are born and when the body returns to the five elements, the soul leaves the body and helplessly obtains another form in accordance with the laws of karma, citing passages from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV:4:3.Krishna, the Beautiful Legend of God, pgs 11-12, and commentary pgs. 423-424, by Edwin Bryant Moreover, he adds and states that the soul materializes into an appropriate body whatever the state of the mind one remembers at the time of death; i.e., at the time of the death, the soul and its subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego, is projected into the womb of a creature, human or non-human that can provide a gross body that is most suitable for the dominant state of the mind of the particular person at the time of death; note that this passage is similar in meaning as Bhagavad Gita, VIII, verse 6 Edwin Bryant, Associate Professor of religion at Rutgers University, New Jersey provided the foregoing commentaries on the discussion of Vasudeva in the Bhagavata Purana. Vishnu Sahasranama Many names in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in the Advaita philosopher Sankara's interpretation means, \\"One who directly sees the merits (Dharma) and demerits (Adharma), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them.\\" Tapasyananda, Swami. Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 62. Other names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name.Tapasyananda, Swami. Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pgs. 48, 49, 87, 96 and 123. Bhavanah, according to Sankara's interpretation, means \\"One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all Jivas (souls) for them to enjoy.\\"Tapasyananda, Swami. Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 48. The Brahma Sutra (3.2.28) \\"Phalmatah upapatteh\\" speaks of the Lord's function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the jivas. ====Vaishnavite Vedanta schools of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Madhva's Dvaita==== See above discussion of karma under the Vedanta sections of Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita) and Madhva (Dvaita) for treatment of karma under the two Vaishnavite teachers. ====Gaudiya Vaishnavism view==== \\"According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krishna. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\\"C.C.Madhya 19-151-164 ====Other Vaishnavite thoughts==== Kulashekhara Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his \\"Mukundamala Stotra\\": 'yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagavan purva-karma-anurupam'. And purva- karma or bhaagya or daiva is unseen adrsta by us, and is known only to God as Vidhaataa.\\"Mukundamala Stotra\\". Author: Kulashekhara Alwar. Verse: 5. Publisher: Lakshmi Venkateshwara Press, Kalyan, Mumbai. Year: Samvat 1980 God created the law of karma, and God will not violate it. God does, however, give courage and strength if asked. ===Nyaya=== The Nyaya school, one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, states that one of the proofs of the existence of God is karma; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God. This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is the same as that of Vedanta and Vai≈õe·π£ika S≈´tra.Sanyal, Jagadiswar, Guide To Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata ‚Äì 700 009 (ed. 1996)p.11 Thus the Nyaya school provides the moral argument for the existence of God.Sanyal, Jagadiswar, Guide To Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, (ed. 1996), p. 165 ==Dharma≈õƒÅstras== In Hinduism, more particularly the Dharma≈õƒÅstras, Karma is a principle in which \\"cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds\\".Kane, P.V., History of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras, Vol. 4, p. 38 Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go away, one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states, \\"According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. And as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap\\".IV. 4. 5 The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kathaaka-grhya-sutra, Chandogya Upanishad, Markandeya Purana and many others.Kane, P.V. History of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras Vol. 4 p.39 The shastras written about karma go into some detail about possible consequences of karma. There is often talk about coming back as a variety of different objects when it comes to reincarnation and pasts lives. In this case, it holds true, or at least insofar as the texts state. The Kathaaka- grhya-sutra states, \\"some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge\\".5.7 More extensively discussed is the consequences of karma in relation to sin. \\"Karmavipaka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasutra II. 3, i.e., jati (birth as a worm or animal), ayuh (life i.e. living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell\\".Kane, P.V. History of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras Vol. 4 p. 176 ==Mitigation of bad karma== According to a theistic view, the effects of one's bad karma may be mitigated. Examples of how bad karma can be mitigated include following, or living virtuously; performing good deeds, such as helping others; yoga, or worshiping God in order to receive grace; and conducting pilgrimages to sacred places, such as or to get grace of God. Editors of Hinduism Today Magazine, What is Hinduism? In another example, Ganesha can unweave his devotees from their karma, simplifying and purifying their lives, but this only happens after they have established a personal relationship with Him. Examples of getting God's grace are further illustrated below. ===Upanishads=== Shvetashvatara Upanishad 7 and 12 aver that the doer of the deeds wanders about and obtains rebirth according to his deeds but postulates an omnipotent creator, i.e., Isvara and the doctrine of grace. Isvara is the great refuge of all and a person attains immortality when blessed by Isvara or at Isvara's pleasure. A person can be free from sorrow through the grace of Isvara. Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad postulates a supreme Being whose grace to devotees provides a way of escape from the law of karma. As Adi Sankara stated in his commentary on Shvetashvatara Upanishad VI:4, \\"If we dedicate all our works to Ishvara, we will not be subject to the law of karma.\\" ==Relation between birth in a particular body to karma== Theistic schools believe in cycles of creations where souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a worm, insect, fish, bird, lion, boar, snake or a human, is determined by a person's deeds and knowledge. Chandogya Upanishad 5.10.7 distinguishes between good birth such as birth in a spiritual family, i.e., (brahmin caste) or an evil birth, such as birth as a dog or hog.) Thus, the doctrine of karma comes to explain why different life forms manifest, into widely various levels of biological development such as characterization into different species from plants to various types of animals, and to even differences between members of the same species, such as humans. Swami Nikilananda comments: As the rivers, following their different courses, ultimately merge in the ocean and give up their names and forms, so the devotees, losing their names and forms, become one with the Supreme Reality.[The Bhagavad Gita, Indian Sacred Text], By Swami Nikhilananda, Chapter 4,9, 18, Ramakrishna -Vivekananda Centre Press, 2004 ==Relation between astrology and karma== Charles Keyes, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and E. Valentine Daniel, professor of anthropology at Columbia University state that many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the \\"fruit of karma.\\" The Navagraha, planetary deities, including Shani (Saturn), are considered subordinate to Ishvara (i.e., the Supreme Being) and are believed by many to assist in the administration of justice. Thus, these planets can influence earthly life. Such planetary influences are believed by many to be measurable using astrological methods including Jyoti·π£a, the Hindu system of astrology. ==Other uses in Hinduism== Besides narrow meaning of karma as the reaction or suffering being due to karma of their past lives and that one would have to transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction. Thus, karma in Hinduism may mean an activity, an action or a materialistic activity. Often with the specific combination it takes specific meanings, such as karma-yoga or karma-kanda means \\"yoga or actions\\" and \\"path of materialistic activity\\" respectively. Yet another example is Nitya karma, which describes rituals which have to be performed daily by Hindus, such as the Sandhyavandanam which involves chanting of the Gayatri Mantra. Other uses include such expressions such as \\"ugra- karma\\", meaning bitter, unwholesome labor. It has also been argued that Karma has a role in Hindu society as a whole. When one abides by their caste duty good Karma is earned and vice versa; and the Karma one collects is reflected in the next life as movement within the Caste system. The promise of upward mobility appealed to people, and was made plausible through Karma. This effectively \\"tamed\\" the lower castes into passive acceptance of the status quo. Thus, the Karma doctrine discouraged actual social mobility.Kent, Eliza. \\"What's Written on the Forehead Will Never Fail\\": Karma, Fate, and Headwriting in Indian Folktales.\\" Asian Ethnology. 68.1 (2009): 1-26. ==See also== * Karma in Buddhism * Hindu answers to the problem of evil ** Problem of evil * Reincarnation and Hinduism * Just-world fallacy * Wyrd * Fate ==References== ==Further reading== * * (English translation of Der Hinduismus: Geschichte und Gegenwart, Verlag C.

Symptoms include pain, bruising, and rapid-onset swelling. The wrist may be deformed. The ulna bone may also be broken. In younger people, these fractures typically occur during sports or a motor vehicle collision. In older people, the most common cause is falling on an outstretched hand. Specific types include Colles, Smith, Barton, and Chauffeur's fractures. The diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with X-rays. Treatment is with casting for six weeks or surgery. Surgery is generally indicated if the joint surface is broken and does not line up, the radius is overly short, or the joint surface of the radius is tilted more than 10% backwards. Among those who are cast, repeated X-rays are recommended within three weeks to verify that a good position is maintained. Distal radius fractures are common. They represent between 25% and 50% of all broken bones. They occur most commonly in young males and older females. A year or two may be required for healing to occur. ==Signs and symptoms== People usually present with a history of falling on an outstretched hand and complaint of pain and swelling around the wrist, sometimes with deformity around the wrist. Any numbness should be asked to exclude median and ulnar nerve injuries. Any pain in the limb of the same side should also be investigated to exclude associated injuries to the same limb. Swelling, deformity, tenderness, and loss of wrist motion are normal features on examination of a person with a distal radius fracture. \\"Dinner fork\\" deformity of the wrist is caused by dorsal displacement of the carpal bones (Colle's fracture). Reverse deformity is seen in volar angulation (Smith's fracture). The wrist may be radially deviated due to shortening of the radius bone. Examination should also rule out a skin wound which might suggest an open fracture, usually at the side. Tenderness at an area with no obvious deformity may still point to underlying fractures. Decreased sensation especially at the tips of the radial three and one half digits ( thumb, index finger, middle finger and radial portion of the ring finger ) can be due to median nerve injury. Swelling and displacement can cause compression on the median nerve which results in acute carpal tunnel syndrome and requires prompt treatment. Very rarely, pressure on the muscle components of the hand or forearm is sufficient to create a compartment syndrome which can manifest as severe pain and sensory deficits in the hand. === Complications === Nonunion is rare; almost all of these fractures heal. Malunion, however, is not uncommon, and can lead to residual pain, grip weakness, reduced range of motion (especially rotation), and persistent deformity. Symptomatic malunion may require additional surgery. If the joint surface is damaged and heals with more than 1‚Äì2 mm of unevenness, the wrist joint will be prone to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Half of nonosteoporotic patients will develop post-traumatic arthritis, specifically limited radial deviation and wrist flexion. This arthritis can worsen over time. Displaced fractures of the ulnar styloid base associated with a distal radius fracture result in instability of the DRUJ and resulting loss of forearm rotation. Nerve injury, especially of the median nerve and presenting as carpal tunnel syndrome, is commonly reported following distal radius fractures. Tendon injury can occur in people treated both nonoperatively and operatively, most commonly to the extensor pollicis longus tendon. This can be due to the tendon coming in contact with protruding bone or with hardware placed following surgical procedures. Complex regional pain syndrome is also associated with distal radius fractures, and can present with pain, swelling, changes in color and temperature, and/or joint contracture. The cause for this condition is unknown. ==Cause== Arthroscopic image of a central triangular fibrocartilage complex tear The most common cause of this type of fracture is a fall on an outstretched hand from standing height, although some fractures will be due to high-energy injury. People who fall on the outstretched hand are usually fitter and have better reflexes when compared to those with elbow or humerus fractures. The characteristics of distal radius fractures are influenced by the position of the hand at the time of impact, the type of surface at point of contact, the speed of the impact, and the strength of the bone. Distal radius fractures typically occur with the wrist bent back from 60 to 90 degrees. Radial styloid fracture would occur if the wrist is ulnar deviated and vice versa. If the wrist is bent back less, then proximal forearm fracture would occur, but if the bending back is more, then the carpal bones fracture would occur. With increased bending back, more force is required to produce a fracture. More force is required to produce a fracture in males than females. Risk of injury increases in those with osteoporosis. Common injuries associated with distal radius fractures are interosseous intercarpal ligaments injuries, especially scapholunate (4.7% to 46% of cases) and lunotriquetral ligaments (12% to 34% of cases) injuries. There is an increased risk of interosseous intercarpal injury if the ulnar variance (the difference in height between the distal end of the ulna and the distal end of the radius) is more than 2mm and there is fracture into the wrist joint. Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury occurs in 39% to 82% of cases. Ulnar styloid process fracture increases the risk of TFCC injury by a factor of 5:1. However, it is unclear whether intercarpal ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage injuries are associated with long term pain and disability for those who are affected. ==Diagnosis== X-ray of a displaced intra-articular distal radius fracture in an external fixator: The articular surface is widely displaced and irregular. Diagnosis may be evident clinically when the distal radius is deformed, but should be confirmed by X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes scaphoid fractures and wrist dislocations, which can also co-exist with a distal radius fracture. Occasionally, fractures may not be seen on X-rays immediately after the injury. Delayed X-rays, X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can confirm the diagnosis. ===Medical imaging=== Fracture with a dorsal tilt: Dorsal is left, and volar is right in the image. X-ray of the affected wrist is required if a fracture is suspected. Posteroanterior, lateral, and oblique views can be used together to describe the fracture. X-ray of the uninjured wrist should also be taken to determine if any normal anatomic variations exist before surgery. A CT scan is often performed to further investigate the articular anatomy of the fracture, especially for fracture and displacement within the distal radio-ulnar joint. Various kinds of information can be obtained from X-rays of the wrist: Lateral view * Carpal malalignment - A line is drawn along the long axis of the capitate bone and another line is drawn along the long axis of the radius. If the carpal bones are aligned, both lines will intersect within the carpal bones. If the carpal bones are not aligned, both lines will intersect outside the carpal bones. Carpal malignment is frequently associated with dorsal or volar tilt of the radius and will have poor grip strength and poor forearm rotation. * Tear drop angle - It is the angle between the line that pass through the central axis of the volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius and the line that pass through the long axis of the radius. Tear drop angle less than 45 degrees indicates displacement of lunate facet. * Antero-posterior distance (AP distance) - Seen on lateral X-ray, it is the distance between the dorsal and volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius. The usual distance is 19 mm. Increased AP distance indicates the lunate facet fracture. * Volar or dorsal tilt - A line is drawn joining the most distal ends of the volar and dorsal side of the radius. Another line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius is drawn. The angle between the two lines is the angle of volar or dorsal tilt of the wrist. Measurement of volar or dorsal tilt should be made in true lateral view of the wrist because pronation of the forearm reduces the volar tilt and supination increases it. When dorsal tilt is more than 11 degrees, it is associated with loss of grip strength and loss of wrist flexion. Posteroanterior view * Radial inclination - It is the angle between a line drawn from the radial styloid to the medial end of the articular surface of the radius and a line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the radius. Loss of radial inclination is associated with loss of grip strength. * Radial length - It is the vertical distance in millimetres between a line tangential to the articular surface of the ulna and a tangential line drawn at the most distal point of radius (radial styloid). Shortening of radial length more than 4mm is associated with wrist pain. * Ulnar variance - It is the vertical distance between a horizontal line parallel to the articular surface of the radius and another horizontal line drawn parallel to the articular surface of the ulnar head. Positive ulnar variance (ulna appears longer than radius) disturbs the integrity of triangular fibrocartilage complex and is associated with loss of grip strength and wrist pain. Oblique view * Pronated oblique view of the distal radius helps to show the degree of comminution of the distal end radius, depression of the radial styloid, and confirming the position the screws at the radial side of the distal end radius. Meanwhile, a supinated oblique view of shows the ulnar side of the distal radius, accessing the depression of dorsal rim of the lunate facet, and the position of the screws on the ulnar side of the distal end radius. ===Classification=== There are many classification systems for distal radius fracture. AO/OTA classification is adopted by Orthopaedic Trauma Association and is the most commonly used classification system. There are three major groups: A‚Äîextra-articular, B‚Äîpartial articular, and C‚Äîcomplete articular which can further subdivided into nine main groups and 27 subgroups depending on the degree of communication and direction of displacement. However, none of the classification systems demonstrate good liability. A qualification modifier (Q) is used for associated ulnar fracture. == Treatment == Posttraumatic arthritis of the wrist, degeneration of the articular surface before and after resection X-rays of a wrist fusion X-rays of pins across a distal radius fracture: Notice the ulnar styloid base fracture, which has not been fixed. This patient has instability of the DRUJ because the TFCC is not in continuity with the ulna. Correction should be undertaken if the wrist radiology falls outside the acceptable limits: * 2-3mm positive ulnar variance * There should be no carpus malalignment * If carpus is aligned, then the dorsal tilt should be less than 10 degrees * If carpus is aligned, there are no limits for palmar tilt * If carpus is malaligned, wrist tilt should be neutral * Gap or step deformity is less than 2mm Treatment options for distal radius fractures include nonoperative management, external fixation, and internal fixation. Indications for each depend on a variety of factors such as the patient's age, initial fracture displacement, and metaphyseal and articular alignment, with the ultimate goal to maximize strength and function in the affected upper extremity. Surgeons use these factors combined with radiologic imaging to predict fracture instability, and functional outcome to help decide which approach would be most appropriate. Treatment is often directed to restore normal anatomy to avoid the possibility of malunion, which may cause decreased strength in the hand and wrist. The decision to pursue a specific type of management varies greatly by geography, physician specialty (hand surgeons vs. orthopedic surgeons), and advancements in new technology such as the volar locking plating system. Distal radius fractures are often associated with distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends that postreduction lateral wrist X-rays should be obtained in all patients with distal radius fractures in order to preclude DRUJ injuries or dislocations. === Nonoperative === The majority of distal radius fractures are treated with conservative nonoperative management, which involves immobilization through application of plaster or splint with or without closed reduction. The prevalence of nonoperative approach to distal radius fractures is around 70%. Nonoperative management is indicated for fractures that are undisplaced, or for displaced fractures that are stable following reduction. Variations in immobilization techniques involve the type of cast, position of immobilization, and the length of time required in the cast. ====Undisplaced fractures==== For those with low demand, cast and splint can be applied for two weeks. In those who are young and active, if the fracture is not displaced, the patient can be followed up in one week. If the fracture is still undisplaced, cast and splint can be applied for three weeks. If the fracture is displaced, then manipulative reduction or surgical stabilisation is required. Shorter immobilization is associated with better recovery when compared to prolonged immobilization. 10% of the minimally displaced fractures will become unstable in the first two weeks and cause malunion. Therefore, follow up within the first week of fracture is important. 22% of the minimally displaced fractures will malunite after two weeks. Subsequent follow ups at two to three weeks are therefore also important. Where the fracture is undisplaced and stable, nonoperative treatment involves immobilization. Initially, a backslab or a sugar tong splint is applied to allow swelling to expand and subsequently a cast is applied. Depending on the nature of the fracture, the cast may be placed above the elbow to control forearm rotation. However, an above-elbow cast may cause long-term rotational contracture. For torus fractures, a splint may be sufficient and casting may be avoided. The position of the wrist in cast is usually slight flexion and ulnar deviation. However, neutral and dorsiflex position may not affect the stability of the fracture. ====Displaced fractures==== In displaced distal radius fracture, in those with low demands, the hand can be cast until the person feels comfortable. If the fracture affects the median nerve, only then is a reduction indicated. If the instability risk is less than 70%, the hand can be manipulated under regional block or general anaesthesia to achieve reduction. If the post reduction radiology of the wrist is acceptable, then the person can come for follow up at one, two, or three weeks to look for any displacement of fractures during this period. If the reduction is maintained, then the cast should continue for 4 to 6 weeks. If the fracture is displaced, surgical management is the proper treatment. If the instability risk of the wrist is more than 70%, then surgical management is required. 43% of displaced fractures will be unstable within the first two weeks and 47% of the remaining unstable fractures will become unstable after two weeks. Therefore, periodic reviews are important to prevent malunion of the displaced fractures. Closed reduction of a distal radius fracture involves first anesthetizing the affected area with a hematoma block, intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier's block), sedation or a general anesthesia. Manipulation generally includes first placing the arm under traction and unlocking the fragments. The deformity is then reduced with appropriate closed manipulative (depending on the type of deformity) reduction, after which a splint or cast is placed and an X-ray is taken to ensure that the reduction was successful. The cast is usually maintained for about 6 weeks. ====Outcome of nonoperative treatment==== Failure of nonoperative treatment leading to functional impairment and anatomic deformity is the largest risk associated with conservative management. Prior studies have shown that the fracture often redisplaces to its original position even in a cast. Only 27-32% of fractures are in acceptable alignment 5 weeks after closed reduction. For those less than 60 years in age, there will be a dorsal angulation of 13 degrees, while for those older than 60, the dorsal angulation can reach as high as 18 degrees. In people over 60, functional impairment can last for more than 10 years. Despite these risks with nonoperative treatment, more recent systematic reviews suggest that when indicated, nonsurgical management in the elderly population may lead to similar functional outcomes as surgical approaches. In these studies, no significant differences in pain scores, grip strength, and range of motion in patients' wrists occurred when comparing conservative nonsurgical approaches with surgical management. Although the nonsurgical group exhibited greater anatomic misalignment such as radial deviation, and ulnar variance, these changes did not seem to have significant impact on overall pain and quality of life. === Surgery === Surgery is generally indicated for displaced or unstable fractures. , Ilyas A, Richey B. Distal Radius Open Reduction and Internal Fixation. J Med Ins. 2020;2020(301). doi:https://jomi.com/article/301. The techniques of surgical management include open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), external fixation, percutaneous pinning, or some combination of the above. The choice of operative treatment is often determined by the type of fracture, which can be categorized broadly into three groups: partial articular fractures, displaced articular fractures, and metaphyseal unstable extra- or minimal articular fractures. Significant advances have been made in ORIF treatments. Two newer treatment are fragment-specific fixation and fixed-angle volar plating. These attempt fixation rigid enough to allow almost immediate mobility, in an effort to minimize stiffness and improve ultimate function; no improved final outcome from early mobilization (prior to 6 weeks after surgical fixation) has been shown. Although restoration of radiocarpal alignment is thought to be of obvious importance, the exact amount of angulation, shortening, intra- articular gap/step which impact final function are not exactly known. The alignment of the DRUJ is also important, as this can be a source of a pain and loss of rotation after final healing and maximum recovery. An arthroscope can be used at the time of fixation to evaluate for soft-tissue injury and the congruity of the joint surface and may increase the accuracy of joint surface alignment Edwards CC 2nd, Haraszti CJ, McGillivary GR, Gutow AP. Intra- articular distal radius fractures: arthroscopic assessment of radiographically assisted reduction. J Hand Surg Am. 2001;26(6):1036-1041. doi:10.1053/jhsu.2001.28760 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11721247/ Structures at risk include the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the scapholunate ligament. Scapholunate injuries in radial styloid fractures where the fracture line exits distally at the scapholunate interval should be considered. TFCC injuries causing obvious DRUJ instability can be addressed at the time of fixation. Prognosis varies depending on dozens of variables. If the anatomy (bony alignment) is not properly restored, function may remain poor even after healing. Restoration of bony alignment is not a guarantee of success, as soft tissue contributes significantly to the healing process. ==== Little joint involvement ==== These fractures are the most common of the three groups mentioned above that require surgical management. A minimal articular fracture involves the joint, but does not require reduction of the joint. Manipulative reduction and immobilization were thought to be appropriate for metaphyseal unstable fractures. However, several studies suggest this approach is largely ineffective in patients with high functional demand, and in this case, more stable fixation techniques should be used. Surgical options have been shown to be successful in patients with unstable extra-articular or minimal articular distal radius fractures. These options include percutaneous pinning, external fixation, and ORIF using plating. Patients with low functional demand of their wrists can be treated successfully with nonsurgical management; however, in more active and fit patients with fractures that are reducible by closed means, nonbridging external fixation is preferred, as it has less serious complications when compared to other surgical options. The most common complication associated with nonbridging external fixation is pin tract infection, which can be managed with antibiotics and frequent dressing changes, and rarely results in reoperation. The external fixator is placed for 5 to 6 weeks and can be removed in an outpatient setting. If the fractures are unlikely to be reduced by closed means, open reduction with internal plate fixation is preferred. Although major complications (i.e. tendon injury, fracture collapse, or malunion) result in higher reoperation rates (36.5%) compared to external fixation (6%), ORIF is preferred, as this provides better stability and restoration of the volar tilt. Following the operation, a removable splint is placed for 2 weeks, during which time patients should mobilize the wrist as tolerated. ==== Displaced intra-articular fractures ==== These fractures, although less common, often require surgery in active, healthy patients to address displacement of both the joint and the metaphysis. The two mainstays of treatment are bridging external fixation or ORIF. If reduction can be achieved by closed/percutaneous reduction, then open reduction can generally be avoided. Percutaneous pinning is preferred to plating due to similar clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as lower costs, when compared to plating, despite increased risk of superficial infections. Level of joint restoration, as opposed to surgical technique, has been found to be a better indicator of functional outcomes. ==Outcome== World Health Organization (WHO) divides outcomes into three categories: impairment, disabilities, and handicaps. Impairment is the abnormal physical function, such as lack of forearm rotation. It is measured clinically. Disability is the lack of ability to perform physical daily activities. It is measured by Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs). Examples of scoring system based on clinical assessment are: Mayo Wrist Score (for perilunate fracture dislocation), Green and O‚ÄôBrien Score (carpal dislocation and pain), and Gartland and Werley Score (evaluating distal radius fractures). These scores includes assessment of range of motion, grip strength, ability to perform activities of daily living, and radiological picture. However, none of the three scoring system demonstrated good reliability. There are also two scoring systems for Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs): the Disabilities of Hand, Arm and Shoulder (DASH) Score and the Patient-Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Score. These scoring systems measures the ability of a person to perform a task, pain score, presence of tingling and numbness, the effect on activities of daily living, and self-image. Both scoring systems show good reliability and validity. === Age factor === In children, the outcome of distal radius fracture is usually very good with healing and return to normal function expected. Some residual deformity is common, but this often remodels as the child grows. In young patients, the injury requires greater force and results in more displacement, particularly to the articular surface. Unless an accurate reduction of the joint surface is obtained, these patients are very likely to have long-term symptoms of pain, arthritis, and stiffness. In the elderly, distal radius fractures heal and may result in adequate function following nonoperative treatment. A large proportion of these fractures occur in elderly people who may have less requirement for strenuous use of their wrists. Some of these patients tolerate severe deformities and minor loss of wrist motion very well, even without reduction of the fracture. There is no difference in functional outcomes between operative and non-operative management in the elderly age group, despite better anatomical results in the operative group. ==Epidemiology== Distal radius fractures are the most common fractures seen in adults, accounting for 17.5% of all adult fractures with an approximate rate of 23.6 to 25.8 per 100,000 per year. Incidences in females outnumber incidences in males by a factor of three to two. Average age of occurrence is between 57 and 66 years. Men who sustain distal radius fractures are usually younger, generally in their 40s (vs. 60s in females). Low energy injury (usually fall from standing height) is the usual cause of distal end radius fracture (66 to 77% of cases). High energy injuries accounts for 10% of wrist fractures. About 57% to 66% of the fractures are extra-articular fractures, 9% to 16% are partial-articular fractures, and 25% to 35% are complete articular fractures. Unstable metaphyseal fractures are ten times more common than severe articular fractures. Older people with osteoporosis who are still active are at an increased risk of getting distal radius fractures. ==History== Before the 18th century, distal radius fracture was believed to be due to dislocation of the carpal bones or the displacement of the distal radioulnar articulation. In the 18th century, Petit first suggested that these types of injuries might be due to fractures rather than dislocations. Another author, Pouteau, suggested the common mechanism of injury which leads to this type of fractures - injury to the wrist when a person falls on an outstretched hand with dorsal displacement of the wrist. However, he also suggested that volar displacement of the wrist was due to the ulnar fracture. His work was met with skepticism from colleagues and little recognition, since the article was published after he died. In 1814, Abraham Colles described the characteristics of distal end radius fracture. In 1841, Guilaume Dupuytren acknowledged the contributions by Petit and Pouteau, agreeing that the distal end radius fracture is indeed a fracture, not a dislocation. In 1847, Malgaigne described the mechanism of injury for distal end radius fractures which can be caused by falling on the outstretched hand or on the back of the hand, and also the consequences if the hand fracture is not treated adequately. After that, Robert William Smith, professor of surgery in Dublin, Ireland, first described the characteristics of volar displacement of distal radius fractures. In 1895, with the advent of X-rays, the visualisation of the distal radius fracture become more apparent. Lucas- Champonni√®re first described the management of fractures using massage and early mobilization techniques. Anaesthesia, aseptic technique, immbolization, and external fixation all have contributed to the management of fixation of distal radius fracture. Ombredanne, a Parisian surgeon in 1929, first reported the use of nonbridging external fixation in the management of distal radius fractures. Bridging external fixation was first introduced by Roger Anderson and Gordon O‚ÄôNeill from Seattle in 1944 due to poor results in conservative management (using orthopaedic cast) of distal end radius fractures. Raoul Hoffman of Geneva designed orthopaedic clamps which allow adjustments of the external fixator to reduce the fractures by closed reduction. In 1907, percutaneous pinning was first used. This was followed by the use of plating in 1965. ==References== ==External links== * Orthopaedic Trauma Association Fracture Classification Radius and Ulna * Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics Fractures of the Radius Category:Bone fractures Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Distal radius fracture"},{"id":"1272985","text":"Jovan Cvijiƒá (, ; 12 October 1865 ‚Äì 16 January 1927) was a Serbian geographer and ethnologist, president of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences and rector of the University of Belgrade. Cvijiƒá is considered the founder of geography in Serbia. He began his scientific career as a geographer and geologist, and continued his activity as a human geographer and sociologist. == Early life and family == Cvijiƒá was born on 1865 in Loznica in the westernmost part of Principality of Serbia. His family was part of the Spasojeviƒá branch of the Piva tribe (Pivljani) in Old Herzegovina (currently Montenegro). Cvijiƒá's father, Todor, was a merchant; his grandfather, ≈Ωivko, was head of Loznica and a supporter of the House of Obrenoviƒá in Maƒçva.\\"–ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞\\", –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1927. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ ≈Ωivko fought in the 1844 Katana Uprising against the Defenders of the Constitution, and died after torture. Cvijiƒá's great-grandfather, Cvijo Spasojeviƒá, patriarch of the Cvijiƒá family, was a well-known hajduk leader in Old Herzegovina and fought the Ottoman Empire in the First Serbian Uprising. After its failure in 1813 he moved to Loznica, built a house and opened a store. His father, Todor (d. 1900) was a trader before accepting a clerkship in the municipality. Cvijiƒá's mother, Marija (born Avramoviƒá), was from a family in the village of Koremita in the Jadar region (near Trono≈°a and Tr≈°iƒá, the birthplace of Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá). Todor and Marija had two sons, ≈Ωivko and Jovan, and three daughters. Cvijiƒá often said that in his childhood his spiritual education was primarily influenced by his mother and her family; he said less about his father and his father's family. However, in his works on ethnic psychology Cvijiƒá praised the Dinaric race of his father. == Education == Cvijiƒá as a young man After completing elementary school Cvijiƒá attended grammar school in Loznica for two years, in ≈†abac for his third and fourth years, and graduated from the First Belgrade Gymnasium's department of natural sciences and mathematics in 1884. After graduation, he wanted to study medicine, but Loznica could not provide him a scholarship to study abroad. A grammar-school teacher suggested that he attend geography classes at the Velika skola in Belgrade (now the University of Belgrade). Cvijiƒá took his advice, enrolling in the natural sciences department and graduating in 1889. Cvijiƒá studied in several languages; in grammar school, he studied English, German and French, which was helpful at university (which had little work translated into Serbian), and wrote his scientific and other papers in those three languages. During the 1888‚Äì89 school year Cvijiƒá was a geography teacher at the Second Male Grammar School in Belgrade, and in 1889 enrolled to study physical geography and geology at Vienna University. At that time geomorphology was taught by Albrecht Penck, geotectonics by Professor Sis (president of the Austrian Academy) and climatology by Julius von Hann. House of Jovan Cvijiƒá in Belgrade, street view Cvijiƒá received his PhD from Vienna University in 1893. His thesis was Das Karstph√§nomen, introducing him to the scientific world, and was later translated into several languages (into Serbian as Karst in 1895). == Marriage == In 1911, Cvijiƒá married Ljubica Nikoliƒá, a widow from Belgrade, n√©e Krstiƒá (1879‚Äì1941). == Research == Cvijiƒá did his first (and most important) field research in eastern Serbia, observing the structure of the Kuƒçaj mountains and Prekonoska Cave in his PhD thesis (accepted in Vienna on 22 January 1893). Ethnographic map of the Balkans, co- authored by Cvijiƒá He was interested in geology and geomorphology. Cvijiƒá's monograph on lime karst was well received in European scientific circles, and an introductory academic lecture established him as the first South Slavic tectonicist. The Serbian lime fields had been studied only peripherally by Otto von Pirch (1830), Ami Bou√© (1840), Felix Philipp Kanitz, Milan Miliƒáeviƒá, Jovan ≈Ωujoviƒá and Vladimir Kariƒá before him. Cvijiƒá studied Mid≈æor and Rila in the Balkan Mountains, recognizing the glacial origin of 102 mountain lakes. It was previously unknown that the region was influenced by the last glacial period, and Cvijiƒá's discovery was a turning point in the study of regional dispersion. Cvijiƒá conducted a pioneering human-geographical survey in \\"Balkan Peninsula 1918\\", 1922‚ÄìI, 1931‚ÄìII, based on his research of Balkan personality types. He researched for 38 years, leading expeditions in the Balkans, the southern Carpathian Mountains and Anatolia which produced a number of research papers. Cvijiƒá's two-volume Geomorphology is an important starting point for research into the Balkan peninsula. === Karst geomorphology === When studying under Albrecht Penck's tutelage he was encouraged to focus on the study of karst phenomena in the northern Dinaric Alps which was a region Penck was already acknowledged with. His first major work was Das Karstph√§nomen published in 1893. This work was a publication of the key points of his doctoral thesis. Das Karstph√§nomen was published as a slightly modified translation in Serbo-Croat in 1895. This work describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes. In a 1918 publication, Cvijiƒá proposed a cyclical model for karstic landscape development. The results of this work written in French were made accessible to English-language scientists in 1921 when it was commented by E.M. Sanders. Differences in climate and geology were used by Cvijiƒá to explain various shapes and types of karst landforms, sometimes incorrectly. Nevertheless, his views on the role of climate on the development of karst were more accurate than those of various climatic geomorphologists that succeeded him and who greatly exaggerated the role of climate. It has been attributed to Cvijiƒá that the term karst prevailed over Edouard Martel's proposed term \\"Le Causse\\". Another terminology usage indebted to Cvijiƒá is that of doline, a term he introduced, and that overlaps with that of sinkhole. Eventually, Cvijiƒá emerged as the \\"father of karst geomorphology\\". === Human geography === Milan Jovanoviƒá (1911) In his human-geographical research, Cvijiƒá studied migrations, village and town habitat, types of housing and the culture of populations in regions influenced by a variety of civilizations, psychological types, folklore and dress. He traveled during difficult social and political times, exposing himself to unpleasant and life-threatening situations (especially in countries under Ottoman and Austrian rule before World War I). During these trips Cvijiƒá became acquainted with the living conditions of the Balkan population, leading to his interest in ethnographic and psycho-social issues; he noted how little he had known about the difficulty of life in Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia until 1896‚Äì1898. Until then, he later said, he had little of the interest in folklore, ethnology and national politics he later developed. Cvijiƒá organized a number of research expeditions to dangerous, unexplored regions. In 1896 Cvijiƒá published \\"Instructions for studying villages in Serbia and other Serbian lands\\", which was later revised to apply to other Balkan regions. In Serbia, interest developed in folkloric research; this encouraged the first systematically-gathered data in ethnology. The research was conducted by Cvijiƒá's students and colleagues and interested laypeople (primarily village teachers and priests), constituting a large, unified scientific effort. Cvijiƒá's thesis on the effects of climate and geography on human life is the basis of his approach to human geography, where he emphasizes that humankind is ecologically sensitive. When classifying anthropological types Cvijiƒá considered social structure (work, endogamy, exogamy and migration) the primary factor, stressing the effects of the physical environment on a population's psyche. His basic concepts are presented in the 1902 Balkan- peninsula paper, \\"Human-geography problems\\". Influenced by Cvijiƒá's paper, Milorad Dragiƒá (a former student) elaborated on psychological anthropological research in his 1911 paper \\"Instructions for studying settlements and psychological characteristics\\" (after which Cvijiƒá expanded his thesis on \\"The Balkan peninsula and South Slavic lands\\" in Serbian). Cvijiƒá introduced the term 'metanastasic movements', which referred to slow, gradual, a place-to- place human movement. He and his students took wide exploration of this phenomenon, eventually establishing the Serbian ethnological-historic school which gathered ethnological material from all around the Balkan peninsula and encompassed exploration of written sources. The sparking of interest in human- geographical and ethnographical research was one of the greatest achievements of Cvijiƒá's scientific career. His efforts and research helped him gather crucial data, which he used during negotiations on the state borders of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I. ==== Influence on Yugoslav state borders ==== After World War I Cvijiƒá helped determine the state borders of the new Yugoslav state, using his research in demography and human geography in the negotiations; his data was used in determining the ethnic expansion of the South Slavs. French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache invited Cvijiƒá to Paris on behalf of the University of Paris twice (in 1917 and at the beginning of 1919), where he lectured on Balkan physical and political geography. At the end of 1918, the Serbian government named him their chief expert on ethnographic borders; in 1919, he was elected president of a unit dealing with territorial issues as part of the state delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. Here, with Mihajlo Pupin (another influential scientist), Cvijiƒá's efforts in creating ethnographic charts of the Yugoslav countries in 1918‚Äì1919 helped determine the borders of a new country: the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was agreed that the new country should incorporate Banat, Baƒçka, Baranya and Carniola as well as the Bled triangle (Bled, Bohinj and Triglav). == Teaching == After Cvijiƒá's return from Vienna in March 1893 he became a professor in the Faculty of Philosophy of the Velika Skola in Belgrade, teaching geography, physical geography and ethnography. Traveling as a student and a professor throughout the Balkans later in life, he developed an interest in folklore and culture and organized ethnographical research in the department of geography. After the Velika Skola became the University of Belgrade on 12 October 1905, Cvijiƒá was one of eight tenured professors; the others were Jovan ≈Ωujoviƒá, Sima Lozaniƒá, Mihailo Petroviƒá Alas, Andra Stevanoviƒá, Dragoljub Pavloviƒá, Miliƒá Radovanoviƒá and Ljubomir Jovanoviƒá, and they chose other colleagues for tenured positions. Cvijiƒá played an active role in reforming the school, helping found an ethnography department whose first professor was his oldest student and assistant, Jovan Erdeljanoviƒá (followed by Tihomir ƒêorƒëeviƒá); Cvijiƒá remained in the geography department. He was influential in establishing five new faculties: medicine, agriculture and theology in Belgrade, philosophy in Skopje and the Subotica Law School. ==Views== === Critique of education === Cvijiƒá thought that the grammar-school education of that era should last seven years, instead of eight, and felt that young men should be included early in adult life and independent work. He published detailed instructions for conducting field research into populations and habitats to help his colleagues, including the 1907 article \\"On scientific research and our University\\". === Territorial expansion === Cvijiƒá' s scientific impartiality has been criticized for his support of Serbia's political advancement; his geographic work was used to scientifically justify politics of territorial expansion and further territorial claims.Jovan Cvijic, Selected statements According to Cvijiƒá, Bulgarians were \\"different from the other South Slavs in their ethnic composition\\". He described as Slav three ethnographic groups previously considered Bulgarians: the Macedonian Slavs, the Shopi and the Torlaks. Cvijiƒá excluded the region around Sofia (Bulgaria's capital) from the Bulgarian group, maintained that the aforementioned groups were Slavic (and therefore Serbian).\\"The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics\\", Ivo Banac, pp. 307‚Äì328, Cornell University Press, 1984. He believed that Serbia could govern a much larger area than the territory it held.Cvijic, \\"O nacionalnom radu\\", commemorative speech 1907, reprinted in Govori i Clanci, I, Beograd 1921 pp. 51‚Äì76 == Legacy == With a group of geographers and biologists, Cvijiƒá founded the Serbian Geographic Society in Belgrade in 1910 and was its president until his death. In 1912 he began a magazine, the Serbian Geographic Society Herald, which is still published. Cvijiƒá conducted weekly seminars for science students, which were also attended by teachers from Belgrade grammar schools. He founded the Faculty of Philosophy's Geographical Institute in 1923 (the first such organization in the Balkans), managing it until his death. Statue of Cvijiƒá in Belgrade Cvijiƒá's grave In 1947, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts founded the Jovan Cvijiƒá Geographical Institute in Belgrade to advance the science of geography. On 21‚Äì22 November 2002, the Academy hosted a meeting on \\"the socio-political work of Jovan Cvijiƒá\\". The Jovan Cvijiƒá's house is housed in his family's house in Belgrade at 5 Jelena ƒÜetkoviƒá Street. Since 1996, the house (built in 1905) has been declared a cultural monument by the state and was decorated by Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak; Cvijiƒá favored a decorative style based on Balkan folklore. The museum features manuscripts, letters, notes, books, paintings, geographical charts, atlases and personal items, and occasional lectures are presented. In Serbia, a number of schools and streets are named after Cvijiƒá and he is still considered the most important Serbian geographer. His work has been continued by his students, six of whom later became members of the Serbian Academy (including Pavle Vujeviƒá, Borivoje Z. Milojeviƒá and Milisav Lutovac). The scientist's life and work were researched by geographer Milorad Vasoviƒá for his 454-page book, Jovan Cvijiƒá: Scientist, Public Worker, Statesman (1994). == Academic honors == Internation medals awarded to Cvijiƒá Cvijiƒá received a number of awards.

The Camry Solara is mechanically based on the Toyota Camry and effectively replaced the discontinued Camry Coup√© (XV10); however, in contrast with its predecessor's conservative design, the Camry Solara was designed with a greater emphasis on sportiness, with more rakish styling, and uprated suspension and engine tuning intended to provide a sportier feel. The coupe was launched in late 1998 for model year 1999. In 2000, the convertible was introduced, effectively replacing the Celica convertible in Toyota's North American lineup. The second-generation Camry Solara debuted in 2003 for model year 2004, initially offered as a coupe; the second-generation convertible was introduced in the spring of 2004 as a 2005 model. Coupe production ended in mid-2008. Despite official statements that the convertible might be sold until 2010 if demand was sufficient, production was suspended in December 2008 and never resumed. __TOC__ == First generation (XV20; 1998‚Äì2003) == Created to appeal to a demographic of more sport-minded drivers than those who prefer the Toyota Camry sedan, the Camry Solara aspired to blend \\"sporty\\" looks and style with spacious practicality. Prior to the production of the Camry Solara, the 2-door version of the Toyota Camry was simply known as the Camry Coupe. It was added to the third generation Camry lineup in 1993 for model year 1994 to compete with the Honda Accord and other cars in its class. However, due to it never being nearly as popular as the 4-door sedan of the Camry, the Camry Coupe was dropped in 1996 when the sedan was redesigned for model year 1997. A distinct successor went into development in the mid-1990s, resulting a winning design entry in 1995 from Warren J. Crain of Calty Design and Research. After design approval, production development ran from 1995 to the first half of 1998. Patents were filed at the Japan Patent Office on January 18, 1996 under 1020408 and November 14, 1996 at the United States Patent Office USPTO under D407350. The first generation Camry Solara went on sale in the third quarter of 1998 as a 1999 model to replace the Camry Coupe. It was based on the mechanical platform of the previous generation Toyota Camry and was built at the TMMC facilities in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. This model featured a 4-cylinder 5S-FE 2.2 L engine with 135 net HP (101 kW), and of torque at 4400 rpm, and a V6 1MZ-FE 3.0 L engine with 200 net HP at 5,200 rpm (149 kW), and of torque at 4,400 rpm with a 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.1 seconds, both of which are identical engines to the 4th generation Camry, but slightly revamped to have a small gain in power (2 hp and , respectively). * 2.2L 5S-FE engine with 135 hp (101 kW), and of torque at 4400 rpm (SXV20) * 3.0L 1MZ-FE V6 engine with 200 hp at 5,200 rpm (149 kW), and of torque at 4,400 rpm with a 0 to 60 mph of 7.1 seconds (MCV20) The Toyota Camry Solara is also the first vehicle in the Toyota lineup, after their 1997 partnership agreement to feature a JBL premium stereo option, which all models came with a single-slot in-dash CD player and cassette deck. The SE models come standard with 15-inch steel wheels and hubcaps, upgradable to 15-inch alloy wheels. The Sports Package also adds a retuned suspension, perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel, perforated eight-way power-adjustable leather seats, an upgrade to 16-inch alloy wheels, retuned steering, minor trim changes and a rear lip spoiler. In 2000, the SE and SLE convertibles were added to the lineup; these cars were built as semi- finished coupes, shipped to an American Sunroof Company (ASC) facility where the roofs were removed and convertible tops installed, and were then shipped back to Toyota for painting and final assembly. Claiming that the car's basic structure was designed for this treatment, Toyota made no suspension or structural changes from the coupe. === Minor model update (2001‚Äì2003) === 2002‚Äì2003 Toyota Solara SLE coupe The Camry Solara was facelifted in September 2001 for the 2002 model year, receiving changes to the grille pattern, taillights, headlights that now featured a 4-bulb system instead of 2, a chrome logo on the steering wheel (instead of an embossed pattern), and smaller fog lights. The trunk was now openable by remote and the wood trim changed from Oxford Burlwood to Mustard Wood. New packages and options were also offered and include heated leather seats, an Appearance Package that featured a 3-spoke steering wheel, leather-wrapped shift knob, black pearl emblems, and a different center cap on the wheels. Mechanically, the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine was replaced with the same 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine offered on the redesigned 2002 Camry, the 2AZ-FE. This new engine was chosen because it featured the same gas mileage as the previous engine, except it offered more power and the addition of VVT-i, a technology that improved performance and reduced emissions. This new engine featured net at 5,600 rpm, and of torque at 4,000 rpm, up from the previous model. == Second generation (XV30; 2003‚Äì2008) == Toyota Camry Solara convertible The second generation of the Camry Solara was completely redesigned (design approval in 2001; JPO patent number 1218292) and introduced to the public in August 2003 for the 2004 model year and featured a curvier body, with the option of adding XM radio and/or a navigation system. Based on the platform of the 2002 Camry sedan, the Gen 2 body is heavier than the Gen 1.5 body. The four-cylinder engine was carried over from the previous generation, while the optional V6 was a new 3.3 L unit rated at 225 net hp at 5,600 rpm (168 kW) and of torque at 3,600 rpm. The four-cylinder engine could be coupled to a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was offered only with a five-speed U151E automatic transmission. Both engines featured Toyota's VVT-i technology. The Solara moved to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky for the second generation model. Production started in July 2003 for the coupe and February 2004 for the convertible. The convertible was offered only with the 3.3 liter V-6 and the 5-speed MMT automatic transmission. Rather than being adapted from the coupe like the first-generation car‚Äîwhich had been criticized for poor structural rigidity‚ÄîToyota claimed that the second-generation convertible was specifically designed and built as such, with a more rigid body structure for decreased levels of noise and vibration. In late 2005 for model year 2006, the five-speed MMT automatic transmission replaced the four- speed automatic on four-cylinder models, and minor changes were made to the optional power driver's seat. 2007 Toyota Solara SE coupe In June 2006 a restyled 2007 Solara was introduced, with new LED taillights, a revised rear bumper, and a redesigned front fascia. Interior changes include Optitron gauges, blue backlighting in the rest of the car's controls, a new steering wheel design that is somewhat similar to the recently revised Camry SE's steering wheel, revised shifter, MP3 and WMA CD playback capability, external audio device (e.g. iPod, Zen, cassette) auxiliary port connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice-activated navigation on the SLE V6 models. Powertrains were unchanged, although new SAE-Certified testing methods resulted in the 4-cylinder model being rated at with of torque, while the V6 was now rated at and of torque. The second-generation Solara sold below expectations, as it inherited the unexciting handling from its Camry parent. Despite the structural redesign, the convertible was still criticized for soft handling that did not feel sporty, and for significant body shake. From model year 2005 to 2008, sales fell from roughly 50,000 units annually to just over 20,000. After the 2008 model year, the coupe was discontinued due to faltering sales, but the convertible, which accounted for the majority of units sold, continued to be produced. Despite statements that the convertible might be sold until at least 2010, production was quietly suspended in December 2008, with sales continuing from inventory to gauge demand. In June 2009, Toyota announced that sales had not met expectations, and that production would not resume. == Use of model name == The name Solara was previously used on a motor vehicle by Peugeot, with their Talbot Solara, a notchback variant of the Chrysler Alpine hatchback developed by Chrysler Europe before their takeover by Peugeot in 1978. The rights to use the Solara name on a motor vehicle within Europe remain with Peugeot. From time to time, such names from the past appear on limited edition models. Mitsubishi Australia also used this name on the mid- spec versions of its Mitsubishi Magna sedan and station wagon. == References == == External links == * Camry Solara Category:Coup√©s Category:Front-wheel- drive vehicles Category:Mid-size cars Category:Convertibles Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States Category:Cars introduced in 1998 Category:2000s cars ","title":"Toyota Camry Solara"},{"id":"1272993","text":"==Events== === January events === January 22 - The Overseas Railroad opens in Florida * January 1 - The classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways that formed South African Railways in 1910 is implemented.Classification of S.A.R.

In a rhyming dictionary, words are categorized into equivalence classes that consist of words that rhyme with one another. They also typically support several different kinds of rhymes and possibly also alliteration as well. Because rhyming dictionaries are based on pronunciation, they are difficult to compile. Words and rhyming patterns change their pronunciation over time and between dialects. Rhyming dictionaries for Old English, Elizabethan poetry, or Standard English would have quite different content. Rhyming dictionaries are invaluable for historical linguistics; as they record pronunciation, they can be used to reconstruct pronunciation differences and similarities that are not reflected in spelling. A simple reverse dictionary, which collates words starting from the end, provides a rough rhyming dictionary to the extent that spelling follows pronunciation. However, a precise rhyming dictionary reflects pronunciation, not spelling.

The Kremlin Wall is a defensive wall that surrounds the Moscow Kremlin, recognizable by the characteristic notches and its towers. The original walls were likely a simple wooden fence with guard towers built in 1156. The Kremlin is flanked by 19 towers with a 20th, the Kutafya Tower, not part of its walls. == Borovitskaya == Borovitskaya Tower The Borovitskaya Tower () is a corner tower with a through-passage on the west side of the Kremlin. It is named after Borovitsky Hill, one of the seven hills Moscow is standing on. The tower was constructed in 1490 on the spot of an old Kremlin gate by Swiss-Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari (Petr Fryazin, from fryaz or fryag as Italians were called at that time) by order of Vasili III of Russia. In 1658 by orders of tzar Aleksey I of Russia the tower was renamed to Predtechenskaya (from the Russian word –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Ç–µ—á–∞ -- predtecha, the forerunner) after the Church of John the Forerunner, which was later destroyed during the construction of the Kremlin Armoury (Oruzheynaya Palata). The new name, however, never became popular. In 1812, the tower was damaged by an explosion staged by the retreating French army. In 1817-19, the tower was restored by architect Osip Bove. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the tower. Following the closure of the Spassky Gate in Red Square to all traffic at the end of the 1990s, the Borovitsky Gate became the main vehicle passageway. Together with the star, its height is . Geographical coordinates: . == Vodovzvodnaya == Vodovzvodnaya Tower The Vodovzvodnaya Tower () is a corner tower on the southwestern side of Kremlin, overlooking the Moskva River. It was built in 1488 by a Swiss-Italian architect Antonio Gilardi (also known as Anton Fryazin). Initially, the tower was called the Sviblova Tower (–°–≤–∏–±–ª–æ–≤–∞ –±–∞—à–Ω—è) after the Sviblov boyar family, who had lived in a house adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin's side. The tower was renamed to Vodovzvodnaya in 1633 after the installation of a water-supplying machine inside the tower (\\"vodovzvodnaya\\" may be translated as \\"water-lifting\\"). In 1805, the Vodovzvodnaya Tower was dismantled due to its dilapidation and built once again. In 1812, the retreating French army blew it up. The tower was restored in 1817-1819 by architect Osip Bove. Its height is . Geographical coordinates: . == Blagoveschenskaya == The Blagoveschenskaya Tower (), known in English as the Annunciation Tower, was erected in 1487-1488. At its foundation are slabs of white limestone that have survived since the time of the white stone Kremlin of the 14th century. During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the tower was used as a prison. The name of the tower comes from the miracle-working Icon of the Annunciation, which was once kept here, and is also associated with the Cathedral of the Annunciation added to the tower in the early 18th century and demolished in 1932. In the 17th century, the Portomoyniye Gates were built nearby so that palace laundresses could go to the Portomoiny raft on the Moscow River to rinse porty, or underclothes. These gates were bricked up in 1813. The height of the tower is ( together with the weather vane that replaced the original cross in 1932). Geographical coordinates: . == Taynitskaya == The Taynitskaya Tower (; it was also called –í–æ–¥—è–Ω–∞—è –±–∞—à–Ω—è, or the Water Tower) is a middle tower on the south side of the Moscow Kremlin. It was built in 1485 by Antonio Gilardi on the spot of the gates to Dmitry Donskoy's whitestone Kremlin. The Taynitskaya Tower had a secret well and a tunnel leading to the Moscow River (hence, the name \\"Taynitskaya\\", or \\"secret\\"). In 1770, the tower was dismantled due to the construction of the Kremlin Palace by Vasili Bazhenov. It was rebuilt in the 1770s. In 1930-1933, the Soviets bricked up the gateway and filled up the well. The Taynitskaya Tower is in height. Geographical coordinates: . == First Unnamed == The First Unnamed Tower () was built next to the Taynitskaya Tower in the 1480s. It performed strictly defensive functions. In 1547, the tower was destroyed by fire after the gunpowder stored there exploded, and was rebuilt in the 17th century. In 1770, the tower was taken apart to clear the site for the Kremlin Palace. After the construction of the palace ended, the tower was rebuilt in 1783, closer to the Taynitskaya Tower. In 1812, the tower was blown up by Napoleon‚Äôs retreating troops, but it was soon restored to its original form by architect Osip Beauvais. Its height is . Geographical coordinates: . == Second Unnamed == The Second Unnamed Tower () was built in the middle of the 15th century. It had purely defensive functions. In 1680, a quadrangular structure and a tall pyramidal tent roof with a watchtower were added to the top of the tower. It is crowned with an eight-sided hipped cupola with a weather vane. Geographical coordinates: . == Petrovskaya == The Petrovskaya Tower () is named after the Church of Metropolitan Peter, which was part of the mission of the Ugreshi Monastery located near the tower in the Kremlin. The Petrovskaya Tower was destroyed by cannon fire during the Polish invasion in 1612 and then restored. In 1771, it was pulled down to construct the Kremlin Palace, but was rebuilt in 1783. In 1812, the tower was blown up by Napoleon‚Äôs retreating troops. In 1818, it was rebuilt by the architect Osip Bove. The Petrovskaya Tower was used as a service building by the Kremlin's gardeners. Its height is . Geographical coordinates: . == Beklemishevskaya == The Beklemishevskaya Tower (, also known as –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–∞—è –±–∞—à–Ω—è, or Moskvoretskaya Tower) is a corner tower on the southeastern side of the Moscow Kremlin on the Moscow River. The tower was built in 1487-1488 by an Italian architect Marco Ruffo (known as Mark Fryazin in Russia). It was named after a boyar Ivan Bersen-Beklemishev, whose house had been adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin side. The Beklemishevskaya Tower was constructed for protecting the ford and the crossing over the Moscow River. There was the so-called \\"listening\\" vault underneath the tower, which was used for preventing the enemy from tunneling his way to the Kremlin. The Beklemishevskaya Tower is in height. During the October Revolution of 1917, the top of the tower was damaged by a shell. It was restored a year later by an architect I.V. Rylsky. Geographical coordinates: . == Konstantino-Eleninskaya == Konstantino- Eleninskaya Tower The Konstantino-Eleninskaya Tower () is a tower on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, overlooking the so-called Basil Descent (–í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ø—É—Å–∫), which begins at the Red Square and ends at the Moscow River. The tower was built in 1490 by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari on the spot of gates to the whitestone Kremlin. It was named after the Church of Constantine and Helene in the Kremlin (second half of the 17th century), which would be demolished by the Soviets in 1928. The Konstantino- Eleninskaya Tower had its own gates and a lift bridge, protected by guards at all times. In the late 18th century - early 19th century the gates were bricked up and the bridge was dismantled. The tower's height is . Geographical coordinates: . == Nabatnaya == The Nabatnaya Tower () is a tower in the southeastern section of the Kremlin wall, built in 1495. It is in height. Traditionally, there has always been a bell on top of the Nabatnaya Tower, used for notifying citizens of fires and other misfortunes in the Kremlin or on the Red Square (hence, the name Nabatnaya, which derives from the old Russian word –Ω–∞–±–∞—Ç - nabat, meaning \\"alarm\\" or \\"tocsin\\"). In 1680, a bellmaker Feodor Dmitriev cast the so-called Nabatny bell (alarm bell) weighing 150 poods (2.45 metric tons) and installed it on the tower. The bell subsequently broke and was re-cast by Ivan Motorin on 30 July 1714. The sound from this bell served as a signal for the spontaneous uprising of the Muscovites during the plague outbreak in 1771, which would later be called the Plague Riot (–ß—É–º–Ω–æ–π –±—É–Ω—Ç). By the order of Catherine the Great, the tongue of the bell was removed after this incident. The tongueless bell remained on top of the tower for 30 more years. In the early 19th century, it was removed and transferred to the Arsenal. In 1821, the bell was moved to the Armoury, where it remains to this day in the vestibule. Geographical coordinates: . == Tsarskaya == The Tsarskaya Tower (, translated as \\"Tsar's tower\\") is the youngest and smallest tower of all, built in 1680. It is not a tower per se, it is rather a stone terem, a tent-shaped chamber placed directly on top of the wall. Previously, there was a small wooden turret, from which, according to legend, tsar Ivan IV liked to observe what was happening on the Red Square. Hence the name, the Tsar's Tower. The white stone bands around the posts, tall corner pyramids with gilt flags and tent roof topped with an elegant gilt weather vane make the tower look like some structure from a fairy tale. Geographical coordinates: . == Spasskaya == Clock of the Spasskaya Tower == Senatskaya == The Senatskaya Tower () was built in 1491 by an architect Pietro Antonio Solari and was purely defensive in nature: it guarded the Kremlin on the Red Square side. For a long time it remained nameless. It was only in 1787, after architect Matvei Kazakov constructed the Kremlin Senate on the Kremlin‚Äôs territory, that it was given its present name. The dome of the Senate can be seen from Red Square. Inside the central part of the tower there are three tiers of vaulted chambers. In 1860, the flat tower was topped with a stone tent roof crowned, in turn, with a gilt weather vane. The tower contains a through-passage that allows VIPs to travel from the kremlin to Red Square. Its height is . Geographical coordinates: . == Nikolskaya == The Nikolskaya Tower () is a tower with a through-passage on the eastern wall of the Moscow Kremlin, which overlooks the Red Square not far from the State Historical Museum. The Nikolskaya Tower was built in 1491 by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari. It was named after Nikolaevsky (Nikolsky) Greek Monastery, which is no longer there. In 1806, the tower was rebuilt in the neo-Gothic style by an architect Luigi Rusca. In 1812, the top of the tower was blown up by the retreating French army. It was restored in 1816 by an architect Osip Bove. The Nikolskaya Tower was once again severely damaged by the artillery fire in October 1917 and was later restored by an architect Nikolai Markovnikov. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the tower. Its current height with the star is . The original icon of Saint Nicholas of Mozhaysk, placed above the entrance on Red Square had been plastered over by Soviet authorities and was uncovered and restored in 2010 - similar to what took place on the Spasskaya Tower. Geographical coordinates: == Corner Arsenalnaya == The Corner Arsenalnaya Tower (, i.e. \\"Corner Arsenal tower\\") is a tower of the Moscow Kremlin. It was built in 1492 by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari. The construction of this tower completed the Kremlin's line of defence from the side of the Red Square. It was called the Sobakin Tower until the early 18th century (named so after a boyar Sobakin, whose house had been adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin side). The Corner Arsenalnaya Tower received its current name after the construction of the Arsenal. The tower still has a secret well. In 1707, due to a threat of Swedish invasion, the gun slots of the Corner Arsenalnaya Tower were enlarged to fit heavy cannons. In 1812, the tower was damaged by an explosion, set up by the retreating French army. It was restored in 1816-1819 by architect Osip Bove. The tower's current height is over . Geographical coordinates: . == Middle Arsenalnaya == The Middle Arsenalnaya Tower (, i.e. \\"Middle Arsenal tower\\") is a Kremlin tower, built in 1495. It is located on the northwestern side of the Kremlin wall and overlooks the Alexander Garden. It is situated on the spot of a corner tower dating from the reign of Dmitry Donskoi. It was given its present name, the Middle Arsenal Tower, after the Arsenal was completed in the mid-18th century. Originally, it was called the Faceted Tower because of the shape of its fa√ßade. In 1680, an open lookout with a small pyramid-shaped top was added to the tower. In 1821, when the Alexander Garden was laid out, an ancient-style grotto was built at the foot of the tower, designed by Osip Bove. Geographical coordinates: . == Troitskaya == == Komendantskaya == The Komendantskaya Tower () was completed in 1495. It used to be called Kolymazhnaya after the Kremlin‚Äôs coach yard, where carriages and coaches had been kept. It was given its present name, the Commandant‚Äôs Tower, in the 19th century when the commandant of Moscow took up residence in the Kremlin‚Äôs Poteshny ‚Äì or Amusement ‚Äì Palace. Like all Kremlin towers, it was supplemented with a tent roof and watchtower in 1676-1686. The height of the tower on the side of the Alexander Garden is . Geographical coordinates: . == Oruzheynaya == Oruzheynaya Tower The Oruzheynaya Tower (, translated as Armory Tower) was built in 1495. It was given its present name in the 19th century after the construction of the Armory. Before then, it was known as the Konyushennaya Tower, a reference to the royal stables that stood behind it. Geographical coordinates: . == Kutafya == The Kutafya Tower ( formerly Predmostnaya tower) is an outlying barbican tower of the Moscow Kremlin. Built in 1516 under the leadership of the Milanese architect Aloisio da Milano, in order to protect one end of the Neglinnaya River bridge that comes out of the West side of the Kremlin wall under the Troitskaya Tower. Initially, the Kutafya was surrounded by a moat and was the only access to the city through its lift bridge, nowadays the moat around the bridge has transformed into Alexander Garden. Kutafya is one of the lower height Kremlin towers which had two combat tiers and no spire, with the open-top upper landing equipped with arrowslits and machicolations, which made it a formidable obstacle to the besieging of the Kremlin fortress. Marking today the main public entrance to the Kremlin, the Kutafya tower was modified several times through the centuries: * in the 16th and 17th centuries, a system of dikes was built to raise the water level of the Neglinnaya river and create a moat that surrounded the tower from all sides, making its drawbridge the only entry point from the city; * In 1668 a causeway leading through the tower to the Troitskaya Bridge was built; * a delicate ornamental crown in the Muscovite baroque style was built in 1685; * the divider between the two tiers was destroyed in 1780; * in 1867, a through-passage to the Manezhnaya Street was built as well as the arched apertures on the sides and a guard house on the south side; * the guard house was dismantled during the restoration works of carried out in 1974-77. The Kutafya Tower is currently 13.5 m high; it used to be 18 m but the lower part of the tower was \\"submerged\\" by successive constructions that heightened the street-level ground.

Dressed in white uniform and mounted on a white horse, and always in the thickest of the fray, he was known and adored by his soldiers as the \\"White General\\" (and by the Turks as the \\"White Pasha\\"). During a campaign in Khiva, his Turkmen opponents called him goz ganly or \\"Bloody Eyes\\". British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery wrote that Skobelev was the world's \\"ablest single commander\\" between 1870 and 1914 and called him a \\"skilful and inspiring\\" leader.See also ==Early life and Conquest of Khiva== Skobelev was born in Saint Petersburg on 29 September 1843. His mother was Russian philanthropist Olga Skobeleva, and his father was Russian general Dmitry Ivanovich Skobelev. After graduating from the General Staff Academy as a staff officer, he was sent to Turkestan in 1868 and, with the exception of an interval of two years, during which he was on the staff of the grand duke Michael in the Caucasus, remained in Central Asia until 1877. During the Khivan campaign of 1873 he commanded the advanced guard of General Lomakin's column from Kinderly Bay, in the Caspian Sea, to join General Verevkin, from Orenburg, in the expedition to the Khanate of Khiva, and, after great suffering on the desert march, took a prominent part in the capture of the Khivan capital. Later, dressed as a Turkoman, he intrepidly explored in a hostile country the route from Khiva to Igdy on the old riverbed of the Oxus. In 1875, he was given an important command in the expedition against the Khanate of Kokand under General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman, showing great capacity in the action of Makram, where he outmanoeuvered a greatly superior force and captured 58 guns, and in a brilliant night attack during the retreat from Andijan, when he routed a large force with a handful of cavalry. ==Later life, the Battle of Pleven, Geok Tepe and Death== Skobelev in the battle of Shipka, Vasili Vereshchagin, 1883 He was promoted to major- general, decorated with the Order of St George, and appointed the first governor of the Ferghana Oblast. In the Turkish War of 1877 he seized the bridge over the Siret at Barbo≈üi (nowadays a neighborhood of Gala≈£i, where the Siret flows into the Danube) in April; in June they crossed the Danube with the 8th corps. Skobelev commanded the Caucasian Cossack Brigade in the attack of the Green Hills at the second battle of Pleven. An infantry division under Skobelev's command assailed the Grivitsa redoubt to the north. Schakofsky managed to take two redoubts, but by the end of the day the Ottoman forces succeeded in repulsing all the attacks and retaking lost ground. Russian losses amounted to 7,300, and the Ottomans' to 2,000. At the captured Lovetch on 3 September, the general distinguished himself again in desperate fighting on the Green Hills during the third battle of Pleven in which Skobelev took two southern redoubts. The Romanian 4th division led by General George Manu took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults, personally assisted by Prince Carol. The next day the Turks retook the southern redoubts, but could not dislodge the Romanians, who repelled three counterattacks. From the beginning of September, Russian losses had amounted to roughly 20,000, while the Ottomans lost 5,000. Skobelev Monument in Moscow Promoted to be a lieutenant-general, and given the command of the 16th Division, he took part in the investment of Pleven and also in the fight of 9 December, when Osman Pasha surrendered, with his army. In January 1878 he crossed the Balkans in a severe snowstorm defeating the Turks at Sheynovo, near Shipka capturing 36,000 men and 90 guns. Skobelev returned to Turkestan after the war, and in 1880 and 1881 further distinguished himself by retrieving the disasters inflicted by the Tekke Turkomans: following the Siege of Geoktepe, it was stormed, the general captured the fort. Around 8,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians, including women and children were slaughtered in a bloodbath in their flight, along with an additional 6,500 who died inside the fortress. The Russians massacre included all Turkmen males in the fortress who had not escaped, but they spared some 5,000 women and children and freed 600 Persian slaves. The defeat at Geok Tepe and the following slaughter broke the Turkmen resistance and decided the fate of Transcaspia, which was annexed to the Russian Empire. The great slaughter proved too much to stomach reducing the Akhal-Tekke country to submission.Lansdell, Henry (1885) Russian Central Asia: Including Kuldja, Bokhara, Khiva and Merv S. Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington, London, pp. 464‚Äì465The legal historian Sir Henry Maine discussed the incident in his last lectures. Skobelev was removed from his command because of the massacre. He was advancing on Ashkhabad and Kalat i-Nadiri when he was disavowed and recalled to Moscow. He was given the command at Minsk. The official reason for his transfer to Europe was to appease European public opinion over the slaughter at Geok Tepe. Some have suggested that he was suffering from delusions of grandeur and showing signs of political ambition.Peter Hopkirk, \\"The Great Game\\", 1994, page 408,In Letter VII of the Willy-Nicky correspondence,written from the Neues Palais, Potsdam, on 25 October, 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II took a more sinister view of Skobelev. In cautioning Tsar Nicholas II to not let his generals become too friendly with French generals, Wilhelm II posed an awkwardly-worded question in English: \\"Dont [sic] forget Skobelew and his plan for carrying off the Imperial family at a dinner once?\\" Wilhelm II here used the German spelling of Skobelev's surname. \\"The Willy- Nicky Letters\\" http://www/gwpda.org/wwi-www/willnick/wilnickb.htm In the last years of his life, Skobelev engaged actively in politics, supporting the ideas of Russian nationalism and militant Pan-Slavism.Astrid S. Tuminez (2000), Russian Nationalism Since 1856: Ideology and the Making of Foreign Policy, p. 77. Rowman & Littlefield, He has also been credited as one of the earliest promoters of the concept \\"Russia for Russians\\". –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ê. ¬´–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è –¥–ª—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö¬ª: pro et contra // –¢—Ä–∏–±—É–Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –º—ã—Å–ª–∏. –†–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω–æ-—Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–ø—É–±–ª–∏—Ü–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª. 2007. ‚Ññ 7. –°–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—å. –°. 92. At the beginning of 1882, he made speeches in Paris and in Moscow, predicting a desperate strife between Slavs and Germans.Novikova, Ol«µa Alekseevna and Skobelev, Mikhail Dmitrievich (1883) Skobeleff and the Slavonic cause, by O.K. Longmans, Greene & Co., London, He was at once recalled to St Petersburg. He was staying at the H√¥tel Dusseaux in Moscow and on his way to his estate in the country when he died suddenly of a heart attack on 7 July 1882.In his memoirs, Frank Harris described how a Russian officer told him that Skobelev died in a brothel, not a hotel: see My Life and Loves (NY: Grove Press, 1963), 232‚Äì33. This scenario is also alluded to in Aleksander Kuprin's short story Temptation (See )–ë—ã–≤—à–∞—è –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ \\"–î—é—Å—Å–æ\\" In Russia he was a very popular man at the time of his death, and not surprisingly, his death aroused suspicion among many. After all, he was a relatively young (38) and vigorous man. Skobelev's early death deprived Russia of a great military leader.Alexander III wrote: \\"His loss to the Russian army is one it is hard to replace, and it must be deeply lamented by all true soldiers. It is sad, very sad, to lose men so useful and so devoted to their mission.\\" Novikova, Ol«µa Alekseevna and Skobelev, Mikhail Dmitrievich (1883) Skobeleff and the Slavonic cause, by O.K. Longmans, Greene & Co., London, p. 387 This became especially evident during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì05. The Russian generals commanding in that war were men of Skobelev's generation, but none of them had his military genius or charisma. == Skobelev In Memoriam == After Skobelev's death, in Moscow a monument was raised in his honour on a major square on Tverskaya Street (across from the city hall, where today stands the statue of Yuri Dolgorukiy, the founder of Moscow), which was given his name, and the town of Fergana in Uzbekistan was renamed Skobelev. Today, his name still lives, even beyond the Russian Federation: shortly after the end of the Turkish War of 1877, the Bulgarians constructed a park in Pleven, Skobelev Park, on one of the hills where the major battles for the city took place. The park is also a location of the Panorama Pleven's Epopee 1877 memorial, where in one of the scenes of the gigantic 360 degree panoramic painting the White General is displayed charging with his horse and bare sword, leading the infantry Russian attack on the Turkish positions. A central boulevard in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria, also bears Mikhail Dmitriyevich Skobelev's name. Shortly after the entrance of the park, the bust of the famous general can be seen, watching over the city. The park contains memorials with the names of the Russian and Romanian soldiers that died for the liberation of Pleven, and is decorated with non- functional arms donated by Russia: cannons, cannonballs, gatling guns, rifles, and bayonets. ==Honours and awards== Nikolai Dmitriev-Orenburgsky.

Best known in the late 1960s and early 1970s for his topical comedy songs performed on British television, his work ranged from satirical to bawdy to sentimental to pastoral, with a strong emphasis on storytelling, making him difficult to categorise. Thackray sang in a lugubrious baritone voice, accompanying himself on a nylon-strung guitar in a style that was part classical, part jazz. His witty lyrics and clipped delivery, combined with his strong Yorkshire accent and the northern setting of many of his songs, led to him being described as the \\"North Country No√´l Coward\\", a comparison Thackray resisted, although he acknowledged his lyrics were in the English tradition of Coward and Flanders and Swann, \\"who are wordy, funny writers\\". However, his tunes derived from the French chansonnier tradition: he claimed Georges Brassens as his greatest inspiration and he was also influenced by Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. He also admired Randy Newman. He was admired by, and influenced, many performers including Jarvis Cocker, Mike Harding, Momus, Ralph McTell, Morrissey, Alex Turner, and Jasper Carrott.Jasper Carrott, , accessed 7 September 2011. ==Early life== John Philip Thackray was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Ernest Thackray, a policeman, and Ivy May Thackray, n√©e Armitage. He was educated at the Jesuit St. Michael's College in Leeds and a Jesuit boarding school in Dolgellau, north-west Wales, and considered joining the priesthood, but instead chose to study Modern Languages at Durham University. After graduation he spent four years teaching English, mainly in France ‚Äì in Lille, Brittany and the Pyrenees ‚Äì but also including six months in Algeria at the height of the war for independence in 1961‚Äì1962. During his time in France he had some of his poetry published and discovered the chansonnier tradition and in particular the work of Georges Brassens. \\"I missed out on rock and all my influences were French,\\" he would later say. In 1966, he had two brief columns ‚Äì What is a Prof? and What is a Student? published in the BBC's The Listener magazine. ==Musical career== In 1964 Thackray returned to his native Yorkshire, teaching at Intake School in Bramley, Leeds. Teaching himself to play the guitar, he found that one way to get unruly pupils to take an interest in their studies was through his songs. This and performing in folk clubs led to appearances on local BBC radio programmes, which brought him to the attention of producer Norman Newell. Thackray recorded thirty songs with Newell, eleven of which were released as his debut album, The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray, in 1967. Its title track exhorted his friends to mark his death with a party, and then forget him. The album also included \\"Lah-Di-Dah\\", in which a prospective bridegroom assures his bride he loves her so much that he will try to be nice to her dreadful family. This in turn led to a BBC television slot, composing a weekly topical song for Bernard Braden's consumer magazine programme Braden's Week. He was not immediately popular ‚Äì his first appearance in late 1968 provoked letters demanding his dismissal ‚Äì but he eventually won over the audience. After Braden's Week was cancelled in 1972, Thackray took up the same role on its successor show, That's Life!. In nearly thirty years of performing he would make over a thousand radio and TV appearances, including slots on The David Frost Show and Frost Over America, and his own show, Jake's Scene, on ITV. In 1968 he married Sheila Marian Clarke-Irons, a 21-year-old student. His second album, Jake's Progress, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios while the Beatles put the finishing touches to their Abbey Road album next door. Released in 1969, it abandoned the orchestral arrangements of its predecessor for a small acoustic band. It included the song \\"The Blacksmith and the Toffee Maker\\", which Thackray adapted from a story in Laurie Lee's Cider with Rosie. He began recording a new album in 1970, but these recordings were scrapped. In 1971 he released Live Performance, a live recording of 14 songs from his 1970 performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London (an expanded, 29-song double CD of the same performance would be released in 2006). A third studio album, Bantam Cock, followed in 1972. Its title track became a folk standard and was covered by folk singer Fred Wedlock, folk group the Corries and comedian Jasper Carrott among others. Other songs included \\"Isabel Makes Love upon National Monuments\\", \\"Sister Josephine\\", and \\"Brother Gorilla\\", an English adaptation of Georges Brassens' \\"Le gorille\\". In 1973 he opened for Brassens when he performed at the inauguration of the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff, which he would describe as the high spot of his career. After Bantam Cock Thackray's television appearances continued, but his recording career stalled. A compilation album, The Very Best of Jake Thackray, was released in 1975. His final studio album, On Again! On Again!, appeared in 1977. Its title track, a long-winded tirade about women who talk too much, would see Thackray accused of misogyny, but the album also included \\"The Hair of the Widow of Bridlington\\", a song of female self-determination in the face of social disapproval. It also featured two more Brassens adaptations, \\"Isabella\\" (based on Brassens' \\"Marinette\\") and \\"Over to Isobel\\" (based on \\"Je rejoindrai ma belle\\"). The same year he published a book of lyrics, Jake's Progress, illustrated by Bill Tidy. From the late 1970s he had made most of his living on the live circuit, touring in Europe, North America and the Far East, but in 1981 he returned to television with Jake Thackray and Songs, a six-part series on BBC2 featuring Thackray and guests, including Richard and Linda Thompson and Ralph McTell, performing in a variety of venues. An album of the same name, recorded live at the Stables Theatre, Wavendon, Milton Keynes, as part of the recordings for the TV show, followed in 1983. A BBC-licensed DVD of Jake Thackray and Songs was released in 2014. Thackray's last release during his life was a compilation, Lah-Di-Dah, released in 1991. Although he gave up teaching for show business, Thackray did not really like being what he called \\"a performing dick\\". He was uncomfortable with big audiences, and favoured pubs and community halls as performance venues in preference to grander ones such as the London Palladium (although he appeared there in a Royal Variety Performance). He became disillusioned with stage life ‚Äì he is recorded as saying \\"I'd never liked the stage much and I was turning into a performing man, a real Archie Rice [the hack music hall comic in John Osborne's The Entertainer], so I cancelled gigs and pulled out\\" ‚Äì and he was plagued by a self-doubt and a breakdown in confidence that Ralph McTell describes as \\"catastrophic\\". His style of work was also falling out of fashion: his literate, witty lyrics and tales of rural Yorkshire had little resonance in the punk and Thatcher years, folk audiences had lost interest in contemporary song and, in the days of alternative comedy, his bawdy humour was deemed sexist and outdated. He ultimately gave up performing in the early 1990s and turned to journalism ‚Äì for four years he wrote a weekly column for the Yorkshire Post. ==Retirement and death== In the 1990s Thackray withdrew to his home in Monmouth, South Wales ‚Äì where he had settled with his family in the late 1960s ‚Äì beset by health and financial problems: he had become an alcoholic, and was declared bankrupt in 2000. He had always been an observant Roman Catholic, and became increasingly religious in his later years, limiting his musical activities to performing the Angelus at his local church. He died of heart failure on 24 December 2002 at the age of 64, leaving his widow, Sheila, from whom he was separated, and three sons, Bill, Sam and Tom. ==Revival in interest== In May 2002 a group of fans formed the Jake Thackray Project with the intention of making more of Thackray's work available to the public. With Thackray's cooperation, the project team, led by record producer David Harris, received permission from EMI to produce a double CD of 42 songs not on any then-available release, limited to 200 copies, which was released in November 2002 with cover art by Bill Tidy. After Thackray's death the following month EMI consented to a further edition of 100 copies. This revival of interest led to the release of two mass market CDs the following year: The Very Best of Jake Thackray on EMI, and The Jake Thackray Collection on HMV. The Jake Thackray Project went on to release a remastered live recording (the CD Live in Germany), and two DVDs: the privately recorded Live at the Unicorn (2009) and the BBC-licensed Jake Thackray and Songs (2014). A musical written by Barnsley-born poet Ian McMillan based on Thackray's songs and their characters, Sister Josephine Kicks the Habit, premiered in 2005 and toured the north of England. A rewrite by Alan Plater was due to tour the UK in 2007, but was put on hold following the death of executive producer Ian Watson., 2006 saw a major retrospective. EMI released an expanded, 29-song double CD edition of Live Performance, and Jake in a Box, a 4-CD box set containing Thackray's four studio albums and six singles in their entirety, plus 25 unused tracks recorded in the Last Will and Testament sessions in 1967, eleven songs recorded for the abandoned album in 1970 and a handful of other rarities. Comedian and writer Victor Lewis-Smith produced a television documentary, Jake on the Box, for the BBC. In 2014, The Jake Thackray Project released a DVD of Jake Thackray and Songs, by arrangement with BBC music, featuring all of Thackray's performances from the television series, along with songs by three of the guest artists, Alex Glasgow, Pete Scott and Ralph McTell. In 2020 attempts to create a one man show celebrating his life and work ‚Äì accompanied by excerpts of his performances ‚Äì formed a subplot in the mockumentary \\"Meet the Richardsons\\"; where Jon Richardson expressed his admiration for Thackray's life and works. == Discography == ===Studio albums=== *The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray ‚Äî EMI ‚Äî 1967 *Jake's Progress ‚Äî EMI ‚Äì 1969 *Bantam Cock ‚Äî EMI ‚Äì 1972 *On Again!

In addition to his important contributions to Lithuanian literature, he was noted as a political activist and diplomat. Himself one of the foremost exponents of iconology, he was the father of art historian and critic Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis Jr.. ==Writer== Baltru≈°aitis was born to a family of farmers in Paantvardys village near Jurbarkas, which was then under Imperial Russian rule. In 1885, he entered Kaunas gymnasium, and graduated in 1893; he then entered the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Moscow University. At the same time, he attended lectures in the Faculty of History and Philology, and studied foreign languages; Baltru≈°aitis learned 15 foreign languages during his life. From 1895 onwards, Baltru≈°aitis began to take part in editing Moscow-based literary magazines, and he began his own creative work in Russian. He joined the Symbolist movement, and, in association with Sergei Polyakov, set up the publishing house Scorpio, which published the chief Russian Symbolist magazines such as Vesy and Severnyie Tzvety as well as collections of the greatest Russian Symbolist poets. A member of the city's cultural elite, Baltru≈°aitis was a close friend and colleague of such famous Russian writers and artists as Anton Chekhov, Konstantin Bal'mont, Valery Bryusov, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Maksim Gorky, Konstantin Stanislavsky, Mikhail Vrubel and Aleksandr Scriabin; Boris Pasternak was the private home tutor of Baltru≈°aitis's children. Baltru≈°aitis published three collections of poetry in Russian, and another three in Lithuanian. He authored many Russian translations of modern literature, including ones from Henrik Ibsen, Oscar Wilde, August Strindberg, Knut Hamsun and Gabriele D'Annunzio. His translation of Hunger by Hamsun is considered a classical rendering of this work into Russian, and has been continuously republished right up to contemporary times. ==Politician== Between 1900 and 1914, Baltru≈°aitis lived in Italy and Norway and spent much time traveling in other countries in Western Europe. During World War I and the subsequent Russian Revolution he was in Russia, where he actively participated in the Lithuanian political struggle for independence. In 1919 he was elected President of the Russian Union of Writers, and was known for his efforts to help and rescue many writers and intellectuals during the first years of the Bolshevik regime. After Lithuania regained independence in 1918, Baltru≈°aitis was appointed Lithuania's ambassador to Russia in 1920 and held this position until 1939. In 1932 he was honored with a doctorate by Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas. In 1939, Baltru≈°aitis was appointed a counselor of the Lithuanian embassy in Paris. Following the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, his son, Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis Jr., an art and art critic, served as a diplomat for the Lithuanian diplomatic service which continued to represent Lithuanian interests in some Western countries. Baltru≈°aitis Sr. died in Paris in January 1944; he is buried at Montrouge Cemetery. ==References== ::In-line: ::General: * Casimir Norkeliunas: the archival site of the works and scholarship, dedicated to Jurgis Kazimieras Baltru≈°aitis * * ==External links== * Translated poetry of Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis * Exhibition of Jurgis Baltrusaitis' furniture at the Lithuanian Art Museum; includes biography ==See also== *Three hares Category:1873 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Jurbarkas District Municipality Category:People from Rossiyensky Uyezd Category:Ambassadors of Lithuania to Russia Category:Lithuanian art critics Category:Lithuanian diplomats Category:Lithuanian poets Category:Symbolist poets Category:Lithuanian male writers Category:Male poets Category:Lithuanian translators Category:Translators to Russian Category:19th-century poets Category:19th- century translators Category:19th-century male writers Category:20th-century poets Category:20th-century translators Category:20th-century Russian poets Category:20th-century male writers Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Imperial Moscow University alumni ","title":"Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis"},{"id":"1273076","text":"Asan Information & Technology Polytechnic College is located in Sinchang- myeon, Asan city, South Chungcheong province, not far from Soonchunhyang University.

It established a precedent for the signing of approximately 3,000 other such agreements between countries. The Agreement was replaced by the Bermuda II Agreement, which was signed in 1977 and effective in 1978. ==Background== Boeing 314 flying boat During World War II, transatlantic air service between Britain and America was limited to Boeing 314 flying boat service between Baltimore and Foynes, which Pan American World Airways had begun in July 1939. British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) also flew the route using three Boeing 314s purchased from Pan Am. The Bermuda Agreement arose in the wake of the Chicago Conference of 1944, where the United States and United Kingdom disagreed about economic control of international air transport. The US and UK had generally agreed on the first two freedoms of the air (overflight and landings for repair/refueling) but the UK and several other countries refused to accept the US position on the third, fourth and fifth freedoms regarding the handling of passenger and cargo traffic. Specifically, the US sought the freedom for its carriers to determine capacity and frequencies on international routes, while the UK sought predetermined routes and an equal division of capacity between the two nations' carriers on those routes. Britain had lost much of its air fleet in the course of World War II and was reluctant to place itself in full competition with the stronger American air fleet. Prior to the Bermuda Agreement, the United States signed bilateral aviation agreements with several other European countries (Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark), and had signed a multilateral Transport Agreement with several European and Latin American countries, but service to and from the United Kingdom had to be negotiated with the British government on an ad hoc basis. As of late 1945, the UK had limited transatlantic traffic by the US to 14 services per week, 500 seats per week and a minimum fare of $375. In July 1945, the US government granted Pan Am, Trans World Airlines (TWA) and American Export Airlines (shortly thereafter acquired by American Airlines and renamed American Overseas Airlines) the right to operate transatlantic service. American began its Douglas DC-4 service between New York and Bournemouth that October. Pan Am announced its own DC-4 service in October 1945 at prices less than 50% of the previous flying boat fares, which led the British government to pressure both Pan Am and the US government to back away from what Britain described as a \\"wholly uneconomic proposition.\\" The US and UK governments agreed in late 1945 to meet and discuss the terms of a bilateral aviation agreement. Bermuda was chosen to host the meeting due to its location between the two countries and isolation from their respective governments. In a sign of the rapidly advancing technology of the time, the British delegation arrived in January by Boeing 314 flying boats, and departed in February by Lockheed 049 Constellation pressurized landplanes. ==Key terms== Unlike the existing bilateral and multilateral aviation agreements, the Bermuda Agreement defined specific routes on which each countries' carriers could fly, with the right to pick up or discharge international traffic (but no cabotage rights) at any point along the routes: * British carriers: ** London ‚Äì New York ‚Äì San Francisco ‚Äì Honolulu / Midway / Wake / Guam / Manila ‚Äì Singapore / Hong Kong ** London ‚Äì New York ‚Äì New Orleans ‚Äì Mexico ** London ‚Äì New York ‚Äì Cuba ‚Äì Jamaica / Panama ‚Äì Colombia / Ecuador / Peru / Chile * United States carriers: ** US points ‚Äì London ‚Äì Netherlands / Germany / Scandinavia / Russia ** US points ‚Äì London ‚Äì Belgium ‚Äì Central Europe ‚Äì Near East ‚Äì India ** Honolulu ‚Äì Hong Kong ‚Äì China / India ** Honolulu ‚Äì Hong Kong ‚Äì Singapore ‚Äì Netherlands East Indies The inclusion of many fifth freedom routes (beyond the United States and British Isles) reflected the fact that many territories such as Hong Kong, Singapore and India were still British colonies at the time the agreement was signed, and that many third countries were eager for air service and willing to provide rights to British and American carriers without restrictions. As a compromise on the capacity issue, the Bermuda Agreement provided for equitable principles that \\"there shall be a fair and equal opportunity for the carriers of the two nations to operate on any route between their respective territories (as defined in the Agreement) covered by the Agreement and its Annex\\" and that \\"in the operation by the air carriers of either Government of the trunk services described in the Annex to the Agreement, the interest of the air carriers of the other Government shall be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides.\\" Fares were made subject to regulatory approval by authorities in each country or by the International Air Transport Association, effectively giving the IATA immunity from US antitrust law, which immunity remained in effect on North Atlantic routes until 1979. ==Operations under the agreement== ===1940s=== Pan Am Lockheed Constellation at Heathrow Airport, London Pan Am took delivery of the Lockheed 749 Constellation in June 1947 and began its \\"round-the-world\\" route with eastbound stops in New York, Gander, Shannon, London, Istanbul, Dhahran, Karachi, Calcutta, Bangkok, Manila, Shanghai, Tokyo, Guam, Wake, Midway, Honolulu and San Francisco, taking advantage of Bermuda Agreement fifth freedom rights. Newfoundland, an essential refueling stop on any transatlantic air route in the 1940s, was part of Britain at the time the Bermuda Agreement was signed. In 1949, following its accession as a Canadian province, the United States signed an agreement with Canada to provide for fifth freedom rights to and from Gander. ===1950s=== BOAC de Havilland Comet jet Pan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines in 1950, concentrating the US-UK air travel market to three carriers: Pan Am, TWA and BOAC. BOAC, still Britain's sole transatlantic carrier, sought to compete with Pan Am's \\"round the world\\" service by offering an \\"all-red\\" route from Britain to Australia via Canada, but bilateral agreements between the UK and these countries stalled in the early 1950s. BOAC proceeded to open a London-Chicago route in May 1954, with the intention to extend the service to San Francisco and Tokyo. The San Francisco extension was not realized until 1957, and US government approval for the Tokyo service did not come until 1959 due to objections by Northwest Airlines. BOAC introduced de Havilland Comet jet service on the London-New York route in 1958. TWA began jet service on the New York-London-Frankfurt route in 1959. ===1960s=== The United States began to exercise an even more dominant position in the transatlantic market during the 1960s. One key issue was that Pan Am and TWA began to use the hub and spoke system to feed passengers from many US destinations through a transatlantic \\"gateway\\" and on to Europe, giving the US carriers an advantage in serving secondary markets. Partly as a result of this competitive pressure, the market share of BOAC on transatlantic routes fell from 37.8% in 1961‚Äì62 to 30.9% by 1966‚Äì67. ===1970s=== The British government added a privately owned carrier, British Caledonian, to the transatlantic market in 1973, with flights from London's Gatwick Airport to New York and Los Angeles. BCal was forced to exit the market in 1976 after the British government determined that competition was not improving Britain's overall market share. ==Termination== In 1976, the British government announced its intention to renounce the agreement, beginning the negotiation of the Bermuda II Agreement which became effective in 1978. Although the UK initially sought an equal division of capacity between UK and US carriers, the final Bermuda II agreement largely preserved the liberal capacity provisions of Bermuda I. The Bermuda agreements were replaced in two stages on 30 March 2008, and 24 June 2010, by the EU‚ÄìUS Open Skies Agreement between the European Union (representing 25 European countries) and the United States, providing for an Open Skies regime even more liberal than Bermuda I. ==Effect on other aviation agreements== Both the United States and the United Kingdom made the Bermuda Agreement their model for bilateral agreements with other countries until Bermuda II. The only major exception during this era was the 1966 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which designated Pan Am and Aeroflot as the operating carriers from each country and left commercial details of service to the airlines' prior agreement. Although most other agreements during this era followed the Bermuda I model, they tended to include fewer and fewer fifth and sixth freedom rights (traffic rights to and from third countries) as time went on, as the increased range of aircraft made such rights less necessary. The general principles of the Bermuda Agreement were also followed by other countries, such as Canada in its various bilateral agreements. ==References== Category:Aviation agreements Category:1946 in aviation Category:1946 in the United Kingdom Category:1946 in the United States Category:History of Heathrow Airport Category:Treaties concluded in 1946 Category:United Kingdom‚ÄìUnited States treaties ","title":"Bermuda Agreement"},{"id":"1273080","text":"thumb Laura Jean Libbey, from a 1908 publication. Laura Jean Libbey (March 22, 1862 ‚Äì October 25, 1924), was an American writer. ==Biography== Libbey lived most of her life in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents were Thomas and Elizabeth Libbey. She began writing around age 20. Over the course of her career, she completed 82 novels. Some of Libbey's stories first appeared as serialized stories in papers such as The New York Family Story Paper, The Fireside Companion, and the New York Ledger. During the 1880s her stories were popular enough for Libbey to negotiate high paying exclusive contracts with specific papers. These serialized stories were later reprinted in dime novel format by publishers of cheap fiction such as George Munro, Arthur Westbrook, and John Lovell. Over fifteen million copies of her books were published. According to The American Bookseller, Libbey's 1889 The Pretty Young Girl was \\"the hit of the season\\" in selling 60,000 copies in thirty days. At one point, Libbey reported she was earning $60,000 a year, but this number may have been exaggerated. Three of Libbey's stories were made into films: When Love Grows Cold (1926), A Poor Girl's Romance (1927), and In a Moment of Temptation (1928). Libbey also wrote 120 plays, many based on her previously published stories. Known as the \\"working-girl\\" novelist, Libbey's stories were romances about employed young women without family support. Her earliest stories (published in the 1880s) were moralistic and focused on the difficulties of factory work. The stories published in the 1890s and 1900s focused more on the process of finding an appropriate romantic partner. According to Joyce Shaw Peterson, Libbey's heroines show signs of being proto-feminists. They work for a living, they are spirited, they are proud, they have integrity. When abducted they often manage to run away on their own. However, their permanent safety always depends upon male protection. There is no female solidarity in Libbey's stories, other women are jealous rivals for the attentions of men. Employment is an opportunity to find a wonderful husband, not a chance to find freedom and self-definition. Overall, Libbey's stories were outside the feminist stream of the time which focused on economic independence. Libbey also worked as an editor. From 1891 to 1894 she edited George Munro‚Äôs Fashion Bazaar. Her financial records indicate that she received $10,400 a year for her editorial work. Supposedly Libbey's mother forbade her from marrying. Two years after Libbey's mother passed away in 1896 she married a Brooklyn lawyer by the name of Van Mater Stilwell. Libbey was 36 years old when she married. Libbey died in 1924 after complications from cancer surgery. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Libbey's papers are held by Rutgers University. == References == ==External links== * ** * *American Women's Dime Novel Project biography Category:1862 births Category:1924 deaths Category:19th-century American novelists Category:20th- century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery Category:20th-century American women writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:Dime novelists ","title":"Laura Jean Libbey"},{"id":"1273087","text":"A Marion Power Shovel Company steam shovel excavating the Panama Canal in 1908.

The first machines were known as 'partial-swing', since the boom could not rotate through 360 degrees. They were built on a railway chassis, on which the boiler and movement engines were mounted. The shovel arm and driving engines were mounted at one end of the chassis, which accounts for the limited swing. Bogies with flanged wheels were fitted, and power was taken to the wheels by a chain drive to the axles. Temporary rail tracks were laid by workers where the shovel was expected to work, and repositioned as required. Steam shovels became more popular in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Originally configured with chain hoists, the advent of steel cable in the 1870s allowed for easier rigging to the winches. Later machines were supplied with caterpillar tracks, obviating the need for rails. The full-swing, 360¬∞ revolving shovel was developed in England in 1884, and became the preferred format for these machines. ===Growth and uses=== A steam shovel excavating for the San Diego and Arizona Railway line, circa 1919. Expanding railway networks (in the US and the UK) fostered a demand for steam shovels. The extensive mileage of railways, and corresponding volume of material to be moved, forced the technological leap. As a result, steam shovels became commonplace. American manufacturers included the Marion Steam Shovel Company, which was founded in 1884, and Erie Shovel Company, now owned by Caterpillar. The booming cities in North America used shovels to dig foundations and basements for the early skyscrapers. One hundred and two steam shovels worked in the decade-long dig of the Panama Canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Of these, seventy-seven were built by Erie;\\"Syncrude Newsletter Article.\\" Bucyrus International. March 16, 2006 . Retrieved 23 June 2010 the remainder were Marion shovels. These machines 'moved mountains' in their labours. The shovel crews would race to see who could move the most dirt.Baker, Ray Stannard. \\"Goethals: the Man and How He Works.\\" The American Magazine. 1913. Retrieved 23 June 2010 Steam shovels assisted mining operations: the iron mines of Minnesota, the copper mines of Chile and Montana, placer mines of the Klondike ‚Äì all had earth-moving equipment. But it was with the burgeoning open-pit mines ‚Äì first in Bingham Canyon, Utah ‚Äì that shovels came into their own. The shovels systematically removed hillsides. As a result, steam shovels were used around the world from Australia to Russia to coal mines in China. Shovels were also used for construction, road and quarry work. Steam shovels came into their own in the 1920s with the publicly funded road building programs around North America. Thousands of miles of State Highways were built in this time period, together with new factories, such as Henry Ford's River Rouge Plant, and many docks, ports, buildings, and grain elevators. ===Successors=== During the 1930s steam shovels lost out to the simpler, cheaper diesel-powered excavating shovels that were the forerunners of those still in use today. Open-pit mines were electrified at this time. Only after the Second World War, with the advent of robust high-pressure hydraulic hoses, did the more versatile hydraulic excavators take pre-eminence over the cable-hoisting winch shovels. Many steam shovels remained at work on the railways of developing nations until diesel engines supplanted them. Most have since been scrapped. Large, multi-ton mining shovels still use the cable-lift shovel arrangement. In the 1950s and 1960s Marion Shovel built massive stripping shovels for coal operations in the Eastern US. Shovels of note were the Marion 360, the Marion 5900, and the largest shovel ever built, Marion 6360 The Captain - with a bucket - while Bucyrus constructed one of the most famous monsters: the Big Brutus, the largest still in existence. The GEM of Egypt (GEM standing for \\"Giant Excavating Machine\\" and Egypt referring to the Egypt Valley in Belmont County, eastern Ohio where it was first put to use), which operated from 1967 to 1988, was of comparable size; it has since been dismantled.http://stripmine.org/gem_01.htm Although these big machines are still called steam shovels, they are more correctly known as power shovels since they use electricity to wind their winches. ==Operation== 100-ton steam shovel mounted on railroad tracks, cc. 1919 A derelict steam shovel in Alaska; major components visible include the steam boiler, water tank, winch, main engine, boom, dipper stick, crowd engine, wheels, and excavator bucket. A steam shovel consists of: * a bucket, usually with a toothed edge, to dig into the earth * a \\"dipper\\" or \\"dipper stick\\" connecting the bucket to the boom * a \\"boom\\" mounted on the rotating platform, supporting the dipper and its control wires * a boiler * a water tank and coal bunker * steam engines and winches * operator's controls * a rotating platform on a truck, on which everything is mounted * wheels (or sometimes caterpillar tracks or railroad wheels) * a house (on the platform) to contain and protect 'the works' The shovel has several individual operations: it can raise or luff the boom, rotate the house, or extend the dipper stick with the boom or crowd engine, and raise or lower the dipper stick. When digging at a rock face, the operator simultaneously raises and extends the dipper stick to fill the bucket with material. When the bucket is full, the shovel is rotated to load a railway car or motor truck. The locking pin on the bucket flap is released and the load drops away. The operator lowers the dipper stick, the bucket mouth self- closes, the pin relocks automatically and the process repeats. Steam shovels usually had a three-man crew: engineer, fireman and ground man. There was much jockeying to do to move shovels: rails and timber blocks to move; cables and block purchases to attach; chains and slings to rig; and so on. On soft ground, shovels used timber mats to help steady and level the ground. The early models were not self-propelled, rather they would use the boom to manoeuvre themselves. ==Steam shovel manufacturers== Bucyrus; the boom rotates independently of the cab housing North American manufacturers: * Ball Engine Co. * Bucyrus * Erie * Marion Steam Shovel Dredge Company * Moore Speedcrane (later Manitowoc Cranes) * Northwest Shovels * Vulcan Iron Works European manufacturers: * Demag (Germany) * Fiorentini (Italy) * Lubecker * Menck * Newton & Chambers (UK) * Orenstein and Koppel GmbH (Germany) * Ruston & Hornsby (UK) ===Power shovel/dragline manufacturers=== * Bucyrus International * Insley Manufacturing Co. * Komatsu * Lima Locomotive Works * Link Belt * Marion Power Shovel * P&H; Mining Equipment * Priestman Bros (UK) * Ransomes & Rapier (UK) * Ruston-Bucyrus (UK) ==Preservation== Ruston-Bucyrus No. 4 (built 1931) Most steam shovels have been scrapped, although a few reside in industrial museums and private collections. ===The Le Roy Marion=== The world's largest steam shovel surviving intact is a Marion machine, dating from either 1906 or 1911, located in the small American town of Le Roy, New York. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. ===Ruston Proctor Steam Navvy No 306=== Dating from 1909, this machine - Ruston's called it a 'crane navvy'http://www.oldengine.org/members/ruston/Arlesey2.htm - Photo of works plate - is the oldest surviving steam navvy in the world. It was originally used at a chalk pit at Arlesey, in Bedfordshire, England. After the pit was closed, the steam navvy was simply abandoned and 'lost' as the pit became flooded with water. By the mid-1970s, the area had become a local beauty spot, known as The Blue Lagoon (from chemicals from the quarry colouring the water), and after long periods of drought, the top of the rusty navvy could be seen protruding from the water. Ruston & Hornsby expert Ray Hooley heard of its existence, and organised the difficult task of rescuing it from the water-filled pit. Hooley arranged for its complete restoration to working order by apprentices at the Ruston-Bucyrus works. Subsequently it passed into the care of the Museum of Lincolnshire Life. The museum was unable to make full use of the machine, and, not being stored under cover, its condition deteriorated. In 2011, Ray Hooley donated the machine to the Vintage Excavator Trust at Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum in Cumbria. It was moved to the quarry in 2011,http://www.oldglory.co.uk/news/steam-navvy-on-the-move and (as of 2013) full restoration is once again under way.http://www.threlkeldquarryandminingmuseum.co.uk/vintage-excavator-trust/ ===1923 Bucyrus Model 50-B=== 1923 Bucyrus Model 50-B at the Nederland Mining Museum Twenty-five Bucyrus Model 50-B steam shovels were sent to the Panama Canal to build bridges, roads, and drains and remove the huge quantities of soil and rock cut from the canal bed. All the shovels but one were scrapped at Panama. The survivor was shipped back to California and then brought to Denver. In the early 1950s it was transported to Rollinsville by Roy and Russell Durand, who operated it at the Lump Gulch Placer, six miles south of Nederland, Colorado, until 1978. This steam shovel is one of two (the other at the Western Minnesota Steam Thresher's Reunion in Rollag, MN) remaining operational Bucyrus Model 50-Bs, and is preserved at the Nederland Mining Museum. Roots of Motive Power in Willits, CA has also acquired a 50-B and operates it for the public once a year at their Steam Festival in early September. This is one of two steam shovels sitting abandoned off highway 5 in Zamora, CA, north of Sacramento. The sign on the back identifies it as having been manufactured by Northwest, and spraypainted on the top back of the cab is the name Carl J Woods.

It can be monophasic or recurrent. At least three different kinds of NMO are proposed based on the presence of autoantibodies thought to produce the disease: anti-AQP4, anti-MOG and anti-NF. All the cases are considered autoimmune diseases. Spinal cord lesions and optic nerve lesions lead to varying degrees of weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, loss of sensation (including blindness), and/or bladder and bowel dysfunction. These lesions are the results of attacks. Attacks are when the major debilitating symptoms occur. Neuromyelitis optica is commonly misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS), and used to be a variant of multiple sclerosis. NMO is its own disease after much research found that NMO is dissimilar from multiple sclerosis. ==Signs and symptoms== The main symptoms of Devic's disease are loss of vision and spinal cord function. Optic neuritis may manifest as visual impairment with decreased visual acuity, although visual field defects, or loss of color vision may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of acuity. Spinal cord dysfunction can lead to muscle weakness, reduced sensation, or loss of bladder and bowel control. The typical patient has an acute and severe spastic weakness of the legs (paraparesis) or all four limbs (quadriparesis) with sensory signs, often accompanied by loss of bladder control. Other symptoms of NMOSD include: endless vomiting or hiccuping and sharp pain or muscle twitches through the abdomen, back, or neck.Neuromyelitis Optica NMOS What You Need To Know, Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation, 2020. ==Causes== Illustration of the four different types of glial cells found in the central nervous system: ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes Devic's disease was associated in the past with many systemic diseases, based on anecdotal evidence. The discovery of NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4) has opened a new way into the research for the causes. Three principal causes are accepted: * A first subset of patients is anti-AQP4+. In them, the cause of the neuromyelitis optica (understood as the syndrome) is an autoimmune aquaporin-4 channelopathy, due to these specific autoantibodies. In these cases, astrocytes are the victims of the autoimmune attack. * A second subset of patients is anti-MOG+. In them the cause is an anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis, * In a third subset of patients, NMO is due to the presence of anti-neurofascin (anti-NF) autoantibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurons.Jun-ichi Kira, Ryo Yamasaki, Hidenori Ogata, Anti-neurofascin autoantibody and demyelination, Dec 2018, Neurochemistry International, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2018.12.011 These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in NMO.Kun Jia et al., Anti-neurofascin-155 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, Journal of Neurological Sciences, January 16, 2019, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2019.01.024 An illustration of the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is weakened in people diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica. * A fourth subset is still idiopathic Rarely, it has been reported that some courses of anti-NMDAR are consistent with NMO.M.C. Kruer, T.K. Koch, D.N. Bourdette, D. Chabas, E. Waubant, S. Mueller, M.A. Moscarello, J. Dalmau, R.L. Woltjer, G. Adamus, NMDA RECEPTOR ENCEPHALITIS MIMICKING SERONEGATIVE NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA, Neurology, May 04, 2010; 74 (18) Clinical/Scientific Notes, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181dc1a7f It is not excluded the possibility that new kinds of autoantibodies could appear in NMO. ===Anti- AQP4+ variants=== In the AQP4+ cases, these autoantibodies target the protein aquaporin 4 in the cell membranes of astrocytes which acts as a channel for the transport of water across the cell membrane. In any case, anti-AQP4 is produced mainly intrathecally. Aquaporin 4 is found in the astrocytes that surround the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB), a system responsible for preventing substances in the blood from crossing into the brain. The blood‚Äìbrain barrier is weakened in Devic's disease, but it is unknown how the cross the BBB. Some reports point to the metalloproteinase-2 and interleukin-6 as culprits for the BBB failure. There is broad consensus that AQP4/NMO-IgG initially enters the brain via BBB-deficient sites such as area postrema, where access to CSF occurs. There are \\"normal appearing areas\\" in neuromyelitis optica but compared to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), NAWM damage is less extensive. Most research into the pathology of Devic's disease has focused on the spinal cord. The damage can range from inflammatory demyelination to necrotic damage of the white and grey matters. The inflammatory lesions in Devic's disease have been classified as type II lesions (complement-mediated demyelination), but they differ from multiple sclerosis pattern II lesions in their prominent perivascular distribution. Therefore, the pattern of inflammation is often quite distinct from that seen in multiple sclerosis. About the presence of anti-AQP4 autoantibodies, some researchers have pointed out that some other cases could be paraneoplastic. It seems also clear that lupus can produce NMO-IgG autoantibodies sometimes, leading to some cases of lupus-derived NMO. The AQP4 antibody levels are not closely correlated with the onset of the disease or of the relapse, but higher levels are associated with the occurrence of optic neuritis. AQP4+ neuromyelitis optica is the most common and is considered an autoimmune astrocytopathy or autoimmune astrocytic channelopathy) in which a person's own immune system attacks the astrocytes of the optic nerves and spinal cord. In anti-AQP4 positive variants, CNS astrocytes, which are the basis for the glymphatic system are the target of the autoimmune attack. NMO-IgG-negative cases are less understood. It seems that astrocytes are spared in these IgG negative cases. ===Anti-MOG+ variants=== The second most documented autoantibody in NMO is anti-MOG autoantibody. MOG antibodies are considered mostly absent in similar diseases like multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it can be said that anti-MOG is a group contained inside AQP4-Negative neuromyelitis optica. Together with the anti- AQP4 they form the wider part of the neuromyelitis optica spectrum. They classify the neuromyelitis optica cases in four classes, according to the presence or absence of any of these two main auto-antibodies. The clinical course and the response to therapy is different for these groups, showing a better prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(‚àí)/MOG-Ab(‚àí) group, and a worse prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(+)/MOG-Ab(+) group. The MOG-related neuromyelitis optica can be radiologically identified by the conus involvement. Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody‚Äìpositive patients were more likely to have conus involvement on spinal magnetic resonance imaging. ===Anti-neurofascin variants=== NF autoantibodies can also appear in NMO cases. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in NMO. ==Diagnosis== MRI image of a patient with transverse myelitis, one of the diagnostic criteria for NMOSD. The Mayo Clinic proposed a revised set of criteria for diagnosis of Devic's disease in 2006. Those guidelines required two absolute criteria plus at least two of three supportive criteria. In 2015, a new review was published by an international panel refining the previous clinical case definition: Core clinical criteria: # Optic neuritis # Acute myelitis # Area Postrema Syndrome (prolonged episodes of hiccuping or vomiting/nausea) # Acute Brainstem Syndrome # Symptomatic narcolepsy/acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with a MRI showing lesions or a lesion on the diencephalon # Symptomatic cerebral syndrome with lesions or a lesion on the brain # NMO-IgG seropositive status (The AQP4 -IgG test checks the existence of antibodies against the aquaporin 4 antigen.) Supportive criteria: # Brain MRI not meeting criteria for multiple sclerosis at disease onset # Spinal cord MRI with continuous T2-weighted signal abnormality extending over three or more vertebral segments, indicating a relatively large lesion in the spinal cord # Optic nerve MRI, or MRI of the orbit showing either normal findings, indifferent white matter lesions, a lesion extending over half of the optic nerve length, or a lesion within the optic chiasm. # Area Postrema Syndrome: MRI showing a lesion on the area postrema # Acute Brainstem Syndrome: MRI showing a lesion on the periependymal brainstem # Ruling out other possible diagnoses Patients with NMOSD that have a seronegative AQP4 -IgG status need 2 core clinical criteria with the ruling out of any other diagnosis, or a clinical criteria and a supportive criteria (an MRI finding), along with the ruling out of any other diagnosis. Patients with NMOSD that have a seropositive AQP4-IgG status need the positive test result and 1 core clinical criteria, along with the ruling out of any other diagnosis. ==Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders== Since the discovery of AQP4 autoantibody, it has been found that it appears also in patients with NMO-like symptoms that do not fulfill the clinical requirements to be diagnosed neuromyelitis optica (recurrent and simultaneous optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation). The term NMOSD (neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders) has been designed to allow incorporation of cases associated with non-AQP4 biomarkers. Therefore, it includes all the clinical variants due to anti-AQP4 plus other non-related but clinically similar syndromes like anti- MOG associated encephalomyelitis. Some cases with MOG+ and AQP4+ antibodies have been found. The collection of these condition has been named \\"neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders\\" (NMOSD) and they are expected to respond to the same treatments as standard neuromyelitis optica. Some authors propose to use the name \\"autoimmune aquaporin-4 channelopathy\\" for these diseases, while others prefer a more generic term \\"AQP4-astrocytopathy\\" that includes also problems in AQP4 with a non-autoimmune origin. ===Variants=== After the development of the NMO-IgG test, the spectrum of disorders comprising Devic's disease was expanded. The spectrum is now believed to consist of: * Standard neuromyelitis optica, according to the diagnostic criteria described above * Limited forms of neuromyelitis optica, such as single or recurrent events of longitudinally extensive myelitis, and bilateral simultaneous or recurrent optic neuritis * Asian optic-spinal multiple sclerosis (OSMS), or AQP4+ OSMS. This variant can present brain lesions like multiple sclerosis, but it should not be confused with an AQP4-negative form of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system spectrum, sometimes called optic-spinal MS. * Longitudinally extensive myelitis or optic neuritis associated with systemic autoimmune disease * Optic neuritis or myelitis associated with lesions in specific brain areas such as the hypothalamus, periventricular nucleus, and brainstem * NMO-IgG negative NMO: AQP4 antibody-seronegative NMO poses a diagnostic challenge. Some cases could be related to anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantibodies. Devic's disease differs from multiple sclerosis in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis infrequently presents as transverse myelitis, and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in Devic's disease, but occur in over 90% of multiple sclerosis patients. Recently, AQP4 has been found to distinguish standard multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica, but as multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous condition, and some multiple sclerosis cases are reported to be Kir4.1 channelopathies (autoimmunity against the potassium channels) it is still possible to consider NMO as part of the multiple sclerosis spectrum. Besides, some NMO-AQP4(‚àí) variants are not astrocytopathic, but demyelinating. ===Overlaps=== Tumefactive demyelinating lesions in neuromyelitis optica are not usual, but they have been reported to appear in several cases mistakenly treated with interferon beta. Also an overlap with the Sj√∂gren syndrome has been reported.Alexander B. Ramos et al., A case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder presenting with undiagnosed Sjogren's syndrome and a single, atypical tumefactive lesion: A clinical conundrum, Neur. Sciences, December 15, 2017Volume 383, Pages 216‚Äì218, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2017.10.036 ===Differential diagnosis=== AQP4-Ab-negative neuromyelitis optica presents problems for diagnosis. The behavior of the oligoclonal bands can help to establish a more accurate diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands in neuromyelitis optica are rare and they tend to disappear after the attacks, while in multiple sclerosis they are nearly always present and persistent.It is important to notice for differential diagnosis that, though uncommon, it is possible to have longitudinal lesions in multiple sclerosis. Other problem for diagnosis is that AQP4-ab in MOG-ab levels can be too low to be detected. Some additional biomarkers have been proposed. ==Treatment== Chemical structure of methylprednisolone, which is used to treat attacks There is no cure for Devic's disease, but it is treatable. Some patients recover, but many are left with impairment of vision and limbs, which can be severe in some cases. ===Attacks=== Attacks are treated with short courses (3‚Äì5 days) of high dosage intravenous corticosteroids, like methylprednisolone IV (Solu-Medrol). Clinical trials for corticosteroids contain very small numbers, and most are uncontrolled, though some report high success percentage. Plasmapheresis can be an effective treatment when attacks progress after the administration of corticosteroids or do not respond to corticosteroids. This treatment involves your own blood being pumped out of your body, your own blood cells being removed from the plasma and being mixed with a solution, then the new blood mixture being pumped back into your body. ===Secondary prevention=== Treatment, in order to prevent relapses for neuromyelitis optica, is generally employed but the exact duration of prophylaxis is still debated. In 2019, Eculizumab (Soliris) became the first medication to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in adults who are AQP4 antibody positive. In June 2020, inebilizumab (Uplizna) received approval from the FDA, making it the second treatment for NMOSD available in the US. Satralizumab (Enspryng) has been approved for the treatment of anti- AQP4 seropositive NMOSD in Canada, Japan, and Switzerland. In August 2020, satralizumab received approval from the FDA, making it the third treatment for NMOSD available in the US. Immunosuppressant treatments that are used include: azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan) with prednisone; mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) with prednisone; mitoxantrone; methotrexate; intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); and cyclophosphamide. All of these medications affect the immune system in different ways. B-cell depletion has been tested with the monoclonal antibody medication, rituximab (Rituxan), indirectly reducing the antibody levels, showing good results; it is the most commonly used treatment for NMOSD today. In 2007, Devic's disease was reported to be responsive to glatiramer acetate and to low-dose corticosteroids. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be used in severe cases of neuromyelitis optica. Available data suggests that this procedure can reduce inflammatory activity in the short term, but a clear majority of the patients will relapse within 5 years. ==Prognosis== Normally, some measure of improvement appears in a few weeks, but residual signs and disability may persist severely sometimes. The disease can be monophasic, i.e. a single episode with permanent remission. However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing form of the disease with repeated attacks of transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. In patients with the monophasic form, the transverse myelitis and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other. On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form are more likely to have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial transverse myelitis event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years. It is possible that the relapsing form is related to the anti-AQP4+ seropositive status and the monophasic form related to its absence Unlike multiple sclerosis, Devic's disease rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing neurologic decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks. Approximately 20% of patients with monophasic Devic's disease have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs. Among patients with relapsing Devic's disease, 50% have paralysis or blindness within five years. In some patients (33% in one study), transverse myelitis in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. However, the spectrum of Devic's disease has widened due to improved diagnostic criteria, and the options for treatment have improved; as a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered. == Epidemiology == The prevalence and incidence of Devic's disease has not been established, partly because the disease is underrecognized and often confused with multiple sclerosis. Devic's disease is more common in women than men, with women comprising over two-thirds of patients and more than 80% of those with the relapsing form of the disease. A retrospective study found that prevalence of #Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) was 1.5% inside a random sample of neurological patients, with a multiple sclerosis (MS) MS:NMOSD ratio of 42.7. Among 13 NMOSD patients, 77% had long spinal cord lesions, 38% had severe optic neuritis, and 23% had brain or brainstem lesions. Only 56% had clinically definite NMO at follow-up. Devic's disease is more common in Asians than Caucasians. In fact, Asian optic-spinal multiple sclerosis (which constitutes 30% of the cases of multiple sclerosis in Japan) has been suggested to be identical to Devic's disease (differences between optic-spinal and classic multiple sclerosis in Japanese patients). In the indigenous populations of tropical and subtropical regions, multiple sclerosis is rare, but when it appears, it often takes the form of optic-spinal multiple sclerosis. The majority of Devic's disease patients have no affected relatives, and it is generally regarded as a nonfamilial condition. ==History== Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt First reports on an association of spinal cord and optic nerve disorders date back to the late 18th and early 19th century. However, only an 1870 report by Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt created sustained interest of neurologists and ophthalmologists in this rare syndrome. In 1894, Eug√®ne Devic and his PhD student Fernand Gault described 16 patients who had lost vision in one or both eyes and within weeks developed severe spastic weakness of the limbs, loss of sensation and often bladder control. They recognized these symptoms were the result of inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord, respectively. In 2002, Mayo Clinic researchers identified an humoral mechanism, targeting a perivascular protein, as the culprit for neuromyelitis optica and in 2004 an unknown specific autoantibody was found. In 2005 they identified the aquaporin 4 protein as the target of the disease, and developed first in-house test to aid in the diagnosis of Devic's disease by detection of an antibody, AQP4-IgG, in the blood. First quantitative ELISA kits were developed later. Later some other autoantibodies have been found in neuromyelitis optica AQP4-negative cases, like anti-MOG IgG, but some neuromyelitis optica anti-AQP4-negative cases still remain idiopathic. ==Research directions== Since the discovery of AQP4 involvement, some research studies have focused on targeted treatment aimed at anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies. The most established method for antibody removal is plasmapheresis. A number of drugs are being studied: aquaporumab (non-pathogenic antibody blocker of AQP4-IgG binding), sivelestat (neutrophil elastase inhibitor), and eculizumab (complement inhibitor). There is little research into the primary causes of the anti-AQP4 auto-antibodies. It has been noticed that some cases could be paraneoplastic. In addition, several neuromyelitis optica variants have been discovered with antibodies other than those for AQP4, turning neuromyelitis optica into a heterogeneous disease. Six different patterns of damage have been reported in neuromyelitis optica, raising the possibility of six different types of auto-antibodies. As of 2019, only three of them are known. ===Research into new autoantibodies=== An autoantibody (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) was found in 2016, in transverse myelitis (LETM) and atypical neuromyelitis optica, leading to the concept of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy.Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein Immunoglobulin G (GFAP-IgG) Related Myelitis: Characterization and Comparison with Aquaporin-4-IgG Myelitis, Elia Sechi, P. Pearse Morris, Andrew McKeon, Sean Pittock, Shannon Hinson, Brian Weinshenker, Allen J. Aksamit, Evan A. Jolliffe, Anastasia Zekeridou, Dean Wingerchuk, Eoin P. Flanagan, Neurology Apr 2018, 90 (15 Supplement) S13.006 Other autoantibody under research is flotillin. It has been found in seronegative neuromyelitis optica and some multiple sclerosis patients. Finally, other proteins under study are connexin 43 and anti-AQP1 though, as of 2015, there are only initial reports about the involvement of these proteins. The group AQP4+/MOG+ is very small and it can be considered a coincidence of two independent problems in the same person. Assuming these cases could be verified, five different kinds of neuromyelitis optica are being considered: * NMO derived from an autoimmune channelopathy (AQP4-Ab+), around 80% of the cases * NMO derived from an anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis, around 10% of the cases * Connexin-43 NMO * Aquaporin-1 associated NMO which could be related to pattern III multiple sclerosis * Idiopathic NMO, defined by the absence of all previous antibodies ===Antibody negative neuromyelitis optica=== Some cases of neuromyelitis optica are not due to autoantibodies. They constitute an overlap between neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis. Some statistical studies show that antibody negative neuromyelitis optica can be classified in three groups, and that this classification has a pathogenic meaning.Tianrong Yeo, Fay Probert, Maciej Jurynczyk, Megan Sealey, Ana Cavey, Timothy D.W.

Treynor, is a measurement of the returns earned in excess of that which could have been earned on an investment that has no diversifiable risk (e.g., Treasury bills or a completely diversified portfolio), per unit of market risk assumed. The Treynor ratio relates excess return over the risk-free rate to the additional risk taken; however, systematic risk is used instead of total risk. The higher the Treynor ratio, the better the performance of the portfolio under analysis. ==Formula== :T = \\\\frac{r_i - r_f}{\\\\beta_i} where: :T \\\\equiv Treynor ratio, :r_i \\\\equiv portfolio i's return, :r_f \\\\equiv risk free rate :\\\\beta_i \\\\equiv portfolio i's beta == Example == _Example 1_ Taking the equation detailed above, let us assume that the expected portfolio return is 20%, the risk free rate is 5%, and the beta of the portfolio is 1.5. Substituting these values, we get the following T = \\\\frac{0.2 - 0.05}{1.5} = 0.1 ==Limitations== Like the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio (T) does not quantify the value added, if any, of active portfolio management. It is a ranking criterion only. A ranking of portfolios based on the Treynor Ratio is only useful if the portfolios under consideration are sub-portfolios of a broader, fully diversified portfolio. If this is not the case, portfolios with identical systematic risk, but different total risk, will be rated the same. But the portfolio with a higher total risk is less diversified and therefore has a higher unsystematic risk which is not priced in the market. An alternative method of ranking portfolio management is Jensen's alpha, which quantifies the added return as the excess return above the security market line in the capital asset pricing model. As these two methods both determine rankings based on systematic risk alone, they will rank portfolios identically. ==See also== *Bias ratio (finance) *Hansen-Jagannathan bound *Jensen's alpha *Modern portfolio theory *Modigliani risk-adjusted performance *Omega ratio *Sharpe ratio *Sortino ratio *Upside potential ratio *V2 ratio ==References== Category:Financial ratios Category:Statistical ratios ","title":"Treynor ratio"},{"id":"1273102","text":"Harper is an American publishing house, currently the flagship imprint of global publisher HarperCollins based in New York City. ==History== ===J. & J. Harper (1817‚Äì1833)=== Eastman Johnson's portrait of Joseph Wesley Harper, 1880 in New York City James Harper and his brother John, printers by training, started their book publishing business J. & J. Harper in New York City on 1817. Their two brothers, Joseph Wesley Harper and Fletcher Harper, joined them in the mid-1820s. ===Harper & Brothers (1833‚Äì1962)=== The company changed its name to \\"Harper & Brothers\\" in 1833. The headquarters of the publishing house were located at 331 Pearl Street, facing Franklin Square in Lower Manhattan (about where the Manhattan approach to the Brooklyn Bridge lies today). Harper & Brothers began publishing Harper's New Monthly Magazine in New York City in 1850. The brothers also published Harper's Weekly (starting in New York City in June 1857), Harper's Bazar (starting in New York City in November 2, 1867), and Harper's Young People (starting in New York City in 1879). George B. M. Harvey became president of Harper's on Nov. 16, 1899. Harper's New Monthly Magazine ultimately became Harper's Magazine, which is now published by the Harper's Magazine Foundation. Harper's Weekly was absorbed by The Independent (New York; later Boston) in 1916, which in turn merged with The Outlook in 1928. Harper's Bazar was sold to William Randolph Hearst in 1913, became Harper's Bazaar, and is now simply Bazaar, published by the Hearst Corporation. In 1924, Cass Canfield joined Harper & Brothers and held a variety of executive positions until his death in 1986. In 1925, Eugene F. Saxton joined the company as an editor, and he was responsible for publishing many well-known authors, including Edna St. Vincent Millay and Thornton Wilder. In 1935, Edward Aswell moved to Harper & Brothers as an assistant editor of general books and eventually became editor-in-chief. Aswell persuaded Thomas Wolfe to leave Scribner's, and, after Wolfe's death, edited the posthumous novels The Web and the Rock, You Can't Go Home Again, and The Hills Beyond. ===Harper & Row (1962‚Äì1990)=== 1846 Harper's Illuminated Bible In 1962 Harper & Brothers merged with Row, Peterson & Company to become Harper & Row. Harper's religion publishing moved to San Francisco and became Harper San Francisco (now HarperOne) in 1977. Harper & Row acquired Thomas Y. Crowell Co. and J. B. Lippincott & Co. in the 1970s; Crowell and the trade operations of Lippincott were merged into Harper & Row in 1980. Marshall Pickering was bought by Harper & Row in 1988. Also in 1988, Harper & Row purchased the religious publisher Zondervan. ===HarperCollins (1990‚Äìpresent)=== Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (now News Corp) acquired Harper & Row in 1987, and William Collins, Sons in 1990. The names of these two national publishing houses (Harper & Row in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom) were combined (along with the Harper's torch icon and Collins' fountain icon) to create HarperCollins. The company has since expanded its international reach with further acquisitions of formerly independent publishers. The Harper imprint began being used in place of HarperCollins in 2007. ==Paperbacks== After the purchase of Harper & Row by News Corporation, HarperCollins launched a new mass market paperback line to complement its existing trade paperback Perennial imprint. It was known as Harper Paperbacks from 1990 to 2000, HarperTorch from 2000 to 2006, and Harper from 2007 to the present. ==Authors and illustrators (selected)== * Robert C.

The river flows in a northeasterly direction from its source in the Appalachian Mountains of northwestern New Brunswick to Chaleur Bay. Its meander length is approximately . The Restigouche is fed by several tributaries flowing south from Quebec's Notre Dame Mountains on the western edge of the Gasp√© Peninsula (Kedgwick River, Gounamitz River, Patap√©dia River, and Matapedia River) as well as the Upsalquitch River flowing north from New Brunswick's Chaleur Uplands. Located mostly in New Brunswick, the river forms the inter-provincial boundary between the two provinces from its confluence with the Patap√©dia River to its mouth at Dalhousie, New Brunswick and Miguasha, Quebec where it discharges into Chaleur Bay.

Van Horne Bridge crossing the Restigouche River between Campbellton, New Brunswick, and Pointe-√†-la-Croix, Quebec The name Restigouche may have been derived from the Mi'gmaq name Listuguj for the First Nations band that lives in the area around the Restigouche River.Listuguj, Mikmaq Online Home to the Mi'gmaq Nation for centuries, the Restigouche watershed is a land of many mountains and unspoiled vistas, as well as significant timber resources. French settlers established several communities on its banks during the 17th and 18th centuries but the area remained largely void of European settlement until the decades following the French and Indian War. The Battle of Restigouche was a naval action between British and French forces which was fought on the river in 1760 during the latter stages of the war. Those French vessels were to supply Quebec with supplies and ammunition following the loss of the battle of the Plains of Abraham, but since the ships never made it, the city never had a chance to be retaken. The establishment of the colony of New Brunswick for United Empire Loyalists refugees following the American Revolutionary War saw modest influx of several families to the area but the most significant impact came from Scottish settlers following the Highland Clearances. Many Scottish families found work in the infancy of the timber industry and were at the forefront of industrialization of the forests throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Restigouche River and its tributaries became a highway for log drives, bringing timber to the dozens of sawmills at Campbellton, and Dalhousie. Further industrialization saw pulp and paper mills established in those communities by the 1930s to take advantage of the Restigouche watershed's timber resources. ==Salmon fishing== The river is world-renowned for its Atlantic salmon fishing. Fly fishing/angling has become a significant source of revenue for many outfitters in the region and a of the Restigouche has been designated part of the Canadian Heritage Rivers System. According to Restigouche Lodge between 15,000 and 25,000 salmon enter the Restigouche each year, which attracts anglers from all over the world. While many Atlantic salmon are reluctant to strike, the Restigouche variety are aggressive, and once hooked, they fight hard and are highly acrobatic. The Restigouche River is known for its exclusivity, clear water and large Atlantic salmon. Fish over pounds are landed somewhere on the Restigouche every year; salmon weights in the high range are considered common. Early spring through the end of June is the best time for catching these salmon. http://www.restigouchelodge.com/our- water For more than 100 years, the world's wealthiest people have come to enjoy the river's tranquil beauty and perfect canoeing conditions to fish for salmon. Among the VIPs who have been guests at the river's fishing lodges include the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson, Hubert Humphrey, Ted Williams, Lord Beaverbrook, Bing Crosby, Louis St. Laurent, Maurice Richard, Norman Schwarzkopf, George H. W. Bush, and Brian Mulroney, to name but a few. Part of the draw for salmon fishing on rivers in New Brunswick and Quebec is its exclusivity - the provincial government's Department of Natural Resources auctions fishing leases for physical sections of the river and riverbed to the highest bidder. Many private fishing lodges have been established on the Restigouche which are owned and operated by major corporations and the wealthy. Such leases are time-limited and, for the best fishing pools, can reportedly run into the millions of dollars for fishing rights lasting for only a few years. Leaseholders must obey all provincial conservation laws by hiring their own fish wardens to patrol each leased section of the river and all persons sanctioned by a particular leaseholder to fish in a lease must hold a provincial angling license. The general public are permitted a right of navigation on the river, as per Canada's Navigable Waters Protection Act; however, they are not permitted to drop anchor in, or cause any disturbance to the river bottom, and are not permitted to fish in a particular lease area. New Brunswick's wealthy Irving family has owned a lodge for many years at one of the best fishing holes on the river ‚Äì the confluence of the Kedgwick with the Restigouche ‚Äì and the Government of New Brunswick also maintains a \\"rustic\\" lodge in nearby Larry's Gulch which has operated as an exclusive resort/get away for politicians and friends of the government in office. William Kissam Vanderbilt enjoyed fishing on the river so much that he had a private fishing lodge built, hiring the famous New York City architect Stanford White to design and oversee construction of the property called Kedgwick Lodge and fueling the love affair of corporate America with the Restigouche. The Canadian business elite outside of the Maritimes have not been nearly as enamoured with the river as Americans, although several prominent Toronto families including the Eatons did have a presence. This is largely due to the relative proximity of the river to Boston, New York and Philadelphia, which helped make the region a small summer colony. The designation of a stretch of the Upper Restigouche as a Heritage River in 1998 was not the first attempt to preserve this area. Early issues with over- fishing by new arrivals to the area led to the implementation, in 1824, of one of the earliest examples of conservation laws in North America.http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/UpperResti/UpperResti-F_e.php#4 This culminated in the implementation of the Fisheries Act in 1858 and \\"opened the door for private hunting and fishing clubs by granting them fishing leases ‚Ä¶.\\" The efforts of conservationists continue today with groups such as the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society.Protecting the Restigouche, CPAWS-NB This group claims that only 1 percent of the Restigouche watershed is protected from development.http://cpawsnb.org/campaigns/restigouche/ ===The Ristigouche=== The Ristigouche and its Salmon Fishing With a Chapter on Angling Literature is a limited-edition book about the Restigouche River, written by Dean Sage and published by David Douglas in Edinburgh in 1888. It is notable for containing a portfolio of 16 etchings and engravings and numerous page decorations, depicting various aspects of the river by notable artists of the day including Stephen Parrish, Henry Sandham, Charles A. Platt, Anna Lea Merritt, Charles Oliver Murray, and George W. Aikman.

The Gospel of Matthew was written using Mark as a source. Then the Gospel of Luke was written using both Mark and Matthew. The Farrer hypothesis (also called the L/M hypothesis, the Farrer‚ÄìGoulder hypothesis and the Farrer‚ÄìGoulder‚ÄìGoodacre hypothesis) is a possible solution to the synoptic problem. The theory is that the Gospel of Mark was written first, followed by the Gospel of Matthew and then by the Gospel of Luke. It has mainly been advocated by English biblical scholars. It is named for Austin Farrer, who wrote On Dispensing With Q in 1955,Austin M. Farrer, On Dispensing with Q, in D. E. Nineham (ed.), Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R. H. Lightfoot, Oxford: Blackwell, 1955, pp. 55-88, but it has been picked up by other scholars including Michael Goulder and Mark Goodacre. ==Overview== The Farrer theory has the advantage of simplicity, as there is no need for hypothetical sources to be created by academics. Instead, advocates of the Farrer theory argue, the Gospel of Mark was used as source material by the author of Matthew. Lastly, Luke used both of the previous gospels as sources for his Gospel.See, for example, Michael Goulder's summary of the hypothesis in \\"Is Q a Juggernaut?\\", Journal of Biblical Literature 115 (1996): 667-81, reproduced at http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/goulder.htm. Farrer set out his argument in an essay \\"On dispensing with Q\\".D. E. Nineham (ed.), Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R. H. Lightfoot (Oxford: Blackwell, 1955) He says that the two-source hypothesis, as set out by B. H. Streeter thirty years earlier,Dr B. H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins (London: Macmillan, 1924) \\"wholly depends on the incredibility [i.e., disbelief] of St Luke having read St Matthew's book\\", since otherwise the natural assumption would be that one was dependent on the other, rather than that they were both dependent on a further source. This assumption could be displaced by, for example, identifying material appearing in both Matthew and Luke that was very different from either of them, which, when extracted, appears to be a work in its own right, with a beginning, middle and end. Neither of these factors are found in Q, as reconstructed by scholars. He also says (writing before the publication of the Gospel of Thomas) that \\"we have no reason to believe that documents of the Q type were plentiful\\", which would have made the hypothesis that Matthew and Luke drew on one more likely. Nor is it obvious, Farrer says, that a book like Q was likely to be produced as a written manual of the teaching of Christ, since the reconstruction of it requires it to also have significant narrative elements interspersed with the teaching, and to have an interest in symbolism from the Old Testament. ==Arguments for and against== ===Arguments for=== In his 1955 paper On Dispensing with Q, Austin Farrer made the case that if Luke had been acquainted with the gospel of Matthew, there would be no need to postulate a lost Q gospel. Farrer's case rested on the following points:Austin M. Farrer, \\"On Dispensing with Q\\" in D. E. Nineham (ed.), Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R. H. Lightfoot (Oxford: Blackwell, 1955), pp. 55‚Äì88, reproduced at http://NTGateway.com/Q/Farrer.htm . * The Q hypothesis was formed to answer the question of where Matthew and Luke got their common material if they did not know of each other's gospels. But if Luke had read Matthew, the question that Q answers does not arise. * We have no evidence from early Christian writings that anything like Q ever existed. * When scholars have attempted to reconstruct Q from the common elements of Matthew and Luke, the result does not look like a gospel. ** Although many scholars originally thought of Q as a sayings gospel, a collection of teachings with no narrative content, all alleged reconstructions of Q from the common parts of Matthew and Luke include narrative about John the Baptist, Jesus' baptism and temptation in the wilderness, and his healing of a centurion's servant. ** However, they don't include an account of Jesus' death and resurrection. ** But from the earliest Christian writings, we see a strong emphasis on precisely the element that a putative Q omits, Jesus' death and resurrection. * Some scholars have attempted to overcome problems with Q reconstructions by claiming we cannot know the actual contents of the Q gospel. However, postulating Luke's acquaintance with the gospel of Matthew overcomes these same problems and gives the source for the common material. The most notable argument for the Farrer hypothesis is that there are many passages where the text of Matthew and Luke agree in making small changes to that of Mark (what is called the double tradition). This would follow naturally if Luke was using Matthew and Mark, but is hard to explain if he is using Mark and Q. Streeter divides these into six groups and finds separate hypotheses for each. Farrer comments that \\"[h]is argument finds its strength in the fewness of the instances for which any one hypothesis needs to be invoked; but the opposing counsel will unkindly point out that the diminution of the instances for each hypothesis is in exact proportion to the multiplication of the hypotheses themselves. One cannot say that Dr. Streeter's plea is incapable of being sustained, but one must concede that it is a plea against apparent evidence\\". Goodacre puts forth an additional argument from fatigue, meaning cases where a derivative passage begins to make changes to its source but fails to sustain them and lapses back into the original version. For example, the parable of the talents is more coherent in Matthew, but less so in Luke, who attempted to increase the number of servants from three to ten. The several instances where this is observed point to Luke using Matthew rather than contrariwise.Mark Goodacre, \\"Fatigue in the Synoptics\\", New Testament Studies 44 (1998), pp. 45-58, reproduced at http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/fatigue.htm.Mark Goodacre, The Case Against Q: Studies in Markan Priority and the Synoptic Problem (2002), pp. 40-43. ===Streeter's five arguments against=== Five arguments are given by Streeter for the impossibility of Luke relying on Matthew. #The first is that he would not have omitted some of the Matthean texts that he did because they are so striking. Farrer replies that they were omitted because they do not conform to the 'edifice' that Luke is building. #The second is that Luke sometimes preserves a more primitive version of a text that is also in Matthew. Farrer replies that this depends on being able to identify the more primitive text; for example, \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit\\" suits Matthew's theology, but it would be natural for Luke to drop the \\"in spirit\\" to fit his concern with the poor. #The third is that Luke follows Mark's order but does not do the same with Matthew. Farrer asks, in reply, why he should: \\"Is it surprising that he should lay his plan on Marcan foundations, and quarry St. Matthew for materials to build up his house?\\". #The fourth is that Luke uses the material less well than Matthew. Farrer replies that this may be so, but he would not be the first adapter to have produced a less skilful result, the only issue was whether it would suit Luke's message better to have the material arranged in this way. #The final argument is that Luke does not use the material within the same Marcan paragraphs as Matthew. Farrer points out that he takes them out of a Marcan context and reproduces them elsewhere. In chapters 10-18, Luke reassembles the teaching material in a way which makes the points that he wants to make, often by pairing sayings that have not been paired together before. This may have been to produce a Christian Deuteronomy, just as it was argued that Matthew's gospel was in the form of a Christian Pentateuch. == See also == * Markan priority * Wilke hypothesis * Griesbach hypothesis * Four- document hypothesis * Gospel of Marcion ==References== ==External links== *On Dispensing With Q by Austin Farrer *The Case Against Q web site by Mark Goodacre * The Synoptic Problem and the Non-existence of Q, by Evan Powell * Matthew Conflator (Wilke) Hypothesis, by Alan Garrow *Overview of proposed solutions by Stephen C.

The 2003 and 2004 model years used General Motors' 5.3 L 300 hp Vortec 5300 V8. Performance was 7.7 seconds for with a 15.9 second quarter mile run at 86.4 mph. The 2005 SSR used the LS2 V8 also found in the C6 Corvette, Trailblazer SS, and Pontiac GTO, and also offered a manual transmission option, the six-speed Tremec, for the first time. For the 2006 model year, the LS2 engine featured minor modifications that boosted its output to (automatic transmission) and (manual), respectively. Performance improved dramatically with the LS2, the 6-speed manual version had an advertised 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 5.29 seconds. In addition, GM badges were added to the vehicle. ==Design== The SSR's \\"retro\\" styled design was inspired by Chevrolet's late-1940s Advance Design trucks, in particular the 1947‚Äì1955 pickups. The vehicle rode on a GM368 platform specific to it, a version of the period's highly adaptable GMT360, and featured a steel body retractable hardtop designed by Karmann and built by ASC. The body of the truck, namely the front fenders, were made with deep draw stampings, a forming technique that had not been used in automotive stampings in decades, and required a \\"relearning\\" of the forming technique. The production model was based on the SuperSport Roadster concept car shown at the 2000 Detroit Auto Show. An early-production SSR was the pace car for the 2003 Indianapolis 500 auto race. ==Sales== Rear view The SSR was introduced as a 2004 model on New Year's Eve 2003. In spite of marketing efforts which included the SSR being used as the pace car for the 2003 Indianapolis 500, it sold below expectations with under 9,000 sales at US$42,000 each. Citing a 301-day supply of SSRs, General Motors in December of that year announced five weeks of layoffs at Lansing Craft Center, the factory that made the SSR. On November 21, 2005, GM announced that it would close the Craft Center in mid-2006, spelling the end for the SSR. The final SSR, a unique black-on- silver model (Highest VIN 1GCES14H06B126138), was built on March 17, 2006. Analysts estimate that 24,150 SSRs were produced in total. Of the total production, 24,112 were available for sale to the public. == Motorsports == SSR with the top down An attempt was made at a land speed record using a highly modified version of an SSR during the Bonneville Speed Week in August of 2011. In spite of the team's efforts, the SSR in question was deemed ineligible to race in the class that they intended to compete in due to an air dam that did not conform to the class rules. They were permitted to race the truck for \\"time only\\" but the truck proved unstable at speeds approaching 200mph. Unfortunately the truck never reached speeds anywhere near close enough to take the record. That same year a 1996 GMC Sonoma put the class record even further out of reach by running nearly 10mph faster than the previous record. ==See also== * Chevrolet HHR * Chevrolet Advance Design, the 1947-55 Chevrolet pickup ==ReferencesSSR Owners Group Website - SSRFanatic.com SSR Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Pickup trucks Category:Hardtop convertibles Category:Vehicles built in Lansing, Michigan Category:Retro-style automobiles Category:Cars introduced in 2003 Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States Category:Coup√© utilities ","title":"Chevrolet SSR"},{"id":"1273113","text":"Paul Mathias Tellier, (born 1939) is a Canadian businessman and former public servant and lawyer. ==Biography== Born in Joliette, Quebec, Tellier earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Ottawa and his law degree from the University of Oxford. He entered Canada's civil service in the 1970s and rose through the ranks of the federal bureaucracy through several high-profile deputy minister portfolios, culminating as the nation's top civil servant from August 12, 1985 to June 30, 1992, when he was appointed Clerk of the Privy Council, in the Privy Council Office of Canada, during Brian Mulroney's ministry. Mulroney reduced Tellier's role as Clerk between 1986 and 1989, when he appointed Dalton Camp as his personal Deputy Minister. In 1992, he left the civil service and was appointed by Mulroney as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Crown corporation Canadian National Railway (CN). Tellier was a driving force behind the successful privatization of the company in 1995 and was widely seen as being the principal instigator behind CN's purchase of Illinois Central, which saw the company expand its focus from an exclusively east-west orientation into a north-south one. As such it was one of the first companies to reap the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Following a failed bid to merge CN with BNSF Railway in 2000, Tellier oversaw the purchase and integration of Wisconsin Central. He also was responsible for hiring a management team that focused on making CN a \\"scheduled\\" freight railway, largely by promoting former Illinois Central president Hunter Harrison to a vice-president position at CN. In January 2003, Tellier stepped down from CN, (Harrison assumed the presidency of the company) to take a three-year posting as the President and CEO of Bombardier. This was largely seen in the Canadian business community as an attempt by Bombardier to turn itself around following several lacklustre years of growth in the aerospace and passenger rail vehicle markets. Tellier oversaw Bombardier and sold its recreational vehicle production to the Beaudoin family, Bombardier's majority shareholders. Tellier also made several major cuts in the workforce and attempted to adjust and refocus the company on its core business activities. On December 13, 2004, it was announced that Tellier was leaving Bombardier, after he told the company that he did not want to stay for the full three years of his contract. Tellier also serves as an executive on the board of directors of Bell Canada and Rio Tinto Alcan. In 1992, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2004, the second St. Clair Tunnel was named in his honor. Since November 2006, Paul Tellier has served as joint chairman on the Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on the Public Service of Canada. This committee gives advice to the Prime Minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council on the renewal of the Public Service, with the objective of shaping it into an institution geared to excellence, distinguished by highly engaged and highly skilled people performing critical tasks with professionalism and efficiency. In October 2007, he was appointed by Prime Minister Harper to a panel responsible for reviewing Canada's military mission in the War in Afghanistan. Paul Tellier is the son of Maurice Tellier, and the grandson of Sir Joseph-Mathias Tellier, who was the brother of Louis Tellier. He is also a third cousin of Luc-Normand Tellier.Jean H√©tu, \\"La famille Tellier: une grande famille de juristes\\", Droit Montr√©al, automne 2014, no 19, p. 22-23. == See also == * Canadian National Railway * Bombardier ==Notes== == External links == * Order of Canada Citation Category:1939 births Category:People of Bell Canada Category:Canadian National Railway executives Category:Companions of the Order of Canada Category:Lawyers in Quebec Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Living people Category:Clerks of the Privy Council (Canada) Category:People from Joliette Category:Alumni of Linacre College, Oxford Category:Universit√© Laval alumni ","title":"Paul Tellier"},{"id":"1273117","text":"The Isle of Demons is a phantom island once associated with Quirpon Island, Newfoundland, in Canada. It was generally shown as two islands. It began appearing on maps in the beginning of the 16th century and disappeared in the mid-17th century. It could also simply be a translation from First Nations people who often avoided areas where a person had died believing it was haunted by spirits. This results in many Islands with the same reference. It was believed that the island was populated by demons and wild beasts which would torment and attack any ships that passed or anyone that was foolish enough to wander onto the island. A French noblewoman, Marguerite de La Rocque, was marooned on an island in the mid-16th century, allegedly because of an affair with a young man on her ship. This island is a possible site of their abandonment, and residents and visitors have claimed to see the couple. Across the centuries, many historians, novelists, poets and singers have retold the story of Marguerite abandoned on the island. It is believed now that the Island of the Marooning is most likely Harrington Harbour, Quebec. The Isle of Demons first appears in the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch. It may simply be a relocated version of the older legendary island of Satanazes (\\"Devils\\" in Portuguese) that was normally depicted in 15th century maps in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean just north of Antillia. With the Atlantic better mapped with the trans-oceanic voyages of the 1490s, Ruysch may simply have transplanted old Satanazes to a more suitable location. The \\"Isola de Demoni\\", in the 1556 printed map of Giacomo Gastaldi The Isle of Demons continues to appear as late as the 1556 map of \\"La Nueva Francia\\" by Giacomo Gastaldi - that is, after Jacques Cartier's expeditions (1534, 1535, 1541) had explored much of Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The advantages of reducing light pollution include an increased number of stars visible at night, reducing the effects of electric lighting on the environment, improving the well-being, health and safety of both people and wildlife, and cutting down on energy usage. Earth Hour and National Dark-Sky Week are two examples of such efforts. The movement started with professional and amateur astronomers alarmed that nocturnal skyglow from urban areas was blotting out the sight of stars. For example, the world-famous Palomar Observatory in California is threatened by sky-glow from the nearby city of Escondido and local businesses.Caltech Astronomy Department For similar reasons, astronomers in Arizona helped push the governor there to veto a bill in 2012 which would have lifted a ban on illuminated billboards.AZ Daily Sun: \\"Astronomers celebrate veto of billboard bill\\" Nocturnal animals can be harmed by light pollution because they are biologically evolved to be dependent on an environment with a certain number of hours of uninterrupted daytime and nighttime. The over-illumination of the night sky is affecting these organisms (especially birds). This biological study of darkness is called scotobiology.http://isebindia.com/05_08/05-01-3.html International society of environmental botanists: \\"Scotobiology ‚Äì The biology of darkness\\" Light pollution has also been found to affect human circadian rhythms.http://www.darksky.org/about-ida International Dark Sky Association: About the IDA The dark-sky movement encourages the use of full-cutoff fixtures that cast little or no light upward in public areas and generally to encourage communities to adopt lighting regulations. A 2011 project is to establish \\"dark sky oasis\\" in suburban areas.Universe Today IDA Suburban Outreach Sites == Dark-sky lighting == Dark-sky lighting is a concept very important to the dark-sky movement, as it greatly minimizes light pollution. The concept was started in the 1950s by the city of Flagstaff, Arizona. Flagstaff is a city of over 70,000, but because of their lighting, their skies are dark enough to see the Milky Way. Lights should be shielded on the top and sides so light doesn't go up to the sky and only used when needed (use motion detectors and only the wattage necessary). The International Dark-Sky Association certifies fixtures as dark sky friendly, and these will have the IDA Fixture Seal of Approval. Opinions vary on what color the light should be, but most agree on the description of \\"warm\\", which is considered more yellow or orange/amber than white. == Skyglow == Mexico City at night, showing skyglow bright enough to read a book outside Skyglow is the illumination of the night sky or parts of it, resembling an orange \\"smog\\". It occurs from both natural and human-made sources.http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightpollution/skyGlow.asp Lighting Resource Centre: \\"What is sky glow?\\". Artificial skyglow is caused by the over-illumination of the sky from large city centres, shopping centres, or stadiums. It consists of light that is either emitted directly upward or reflected from the ground that is then scattered by dust and gas molecules in the atmosphere, producing a luminous background or light dome. These artificial skyglows cause the sky to be 5‚Äì10 times brighter in urban areas than a naturally dark sky that is unaffected by artificial light. Natural skyglow can come from natural light sources, such as the Sun, the Moon, the stars, or auroras. Some communities are becoming aware of this problem and are putting forth efforts to minimize the hazy, orange skyglow. A community in particular is the city of Merritt, British Columbia. An article published July 8, 2010 states that they are making minor changes to lighting in and around Merritt, such as the installment of down-cast lighting to commercial buildings, as part of their light pollution abatement program.http://www.merrittnews.net/article/20100708/MERRITT0101/100709954/-1/MERRITT/sky- glow-burning-out Merritt News: \\"Sky glow burning out?\\" author: Kaleena Loehr The benefits of this technological change include \\"saving energy through better focused lights, preserving the environment by reducing excess light that may affect flora and fauna, reducing crime and increasing safety by more adequately illuminating areas, and reducing health risks.\\" == Scotobiology == Scotobiology is the study of the role darkness plays in living organisms and shows that interrupting darkness by light pollution creates drastic effects for most organisms; changing their food gathering and feeding habits, their mating and reproduction behavior, migration behaviour (birds and insects) and social behavior.http://www.sampaa.org/publications/conference- proceedings-1991-2000/sampaa-6-proceedings/light-pollution/Bidwell%202010.pdf Approximately 30% of vertebrates and 60% of invertebrates are nocturnal, meaning that they depend on darkness.

Human health is also adversely affected by the effects of light pollution. Light during night time hours has been linked to human cancers and psychological disorders. == Dark-sky preserves == Dark-sky preserves are the main contributors to the dark-sky movement. They are protected areas found mostly in national parks that have a zero light pollution policy set in by the government and controlled by the National Dark Sky Association. As of February 6, 2012, there were 35 formally recognized dark-sky preserves in the world with Canada in the lead containing 15 preserves. These preserves are located in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. Other countries that have dark-sky preserves are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

He was the son of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt and Ellen \\"Elsie\\" French. Vanderbilt's father was a great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the family fortune in railroads and shipping. William Vanderbilt's parents divorced in 1908, and through his father's second marriage he had two half-brothers, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr., and George Washington Vanderbilt III. In 1915, his father perished in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. ===Education=== Vanderbilt was educated at St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island (Class of 1919) and the Evans School in Mesa, Arizona, he attended Princeton University but dropped out during his first year. In 1940, Vanderbilt received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College. ===Inheritance=== When he turned 21, the then legal age of majority, in 1922, Vanderbilt inherited a $5 million trust fund plus the 450 acre (1.8 km¬≤) Oakland Farm in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, one of his father's estates that included a number of thoroughbred horses. He made the farm his permanent home until the end of the Second World War. ==Career== ===First World War=== Shortly before the United States declared war on Germany during the First World War, Vanderbilt dropped out of St. George's School upon his appointment as a midshipman in the U.S. Naval Coast Defense Reserve to rank from March 20, 1917.United States Navy Register, 1918. pg. 349. As he was only 15 at the time, he was one of the youngest Americans to have served in the war. (It is unclear how he was able to join the service at such a young age but, probably, his family connections were a factor. Another curiosity is that he was the only person to hold the rank of midshipman in the Naval Reserve.) During his service in the Navy, Vanderbilt served on the torpedo test ship from April 17 to May 31, 1917, the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport from June 1, 1917 to March 7, 1918, aide for information Second Naval District from March 7 to July 15, 1918, in Norfolk, Virginia from July 23 to September 16, 1918, New London, Connecticut from September 19 to November 14, 1918 and as a plank owner of the newly commissioned destroyer from November 11, 1918 to August 30, 1919.St. George's School in the War, pg. 151. While serving on the Evans, Vanderbilt went on a cruise to Europe from June to August 1919. He was discharged from the Navy shortly after the end of the cruise. ===The Short Line=== In 1925, Vanderbilt started a coach bus company, called The Short Line, carrying passengers between Newport and Providence. Within a few years he expanded the business to serve points throughout New England and New York. The Short Line was purchased by George Sage in 1955 and, in 1970, was renamed Bonanza Bus Lines. Bonanza eventually merged with the Coach USA bus line in 1998 and was sold to Peter Pan Bus Lines in 2003. The Short Line's original terminal building in Newport still stands and is located near the intersection of Spring and Touro streets. As a state senator and successful business leader, Vanderbilt was also a champion of the Mount Hope Bridge which connects Aquidneck Island with the mainland on the road north to Providence, Rhode Island from Newport. He was named the Chairman of the Mount Hope Bridge Commission and gave the opening address at the bridge's dedication on October 24, 1929.Rhode Island Historical Society ===Political career=== Vanderbilt was a member of the Republican Party. In 1928 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Rhode Island and that year was elected to the Rhode Island State Senate. Vanderbilt served in the State Senate for six years (1929‚Äì1935) and then took time off to be with his ailing wife, Anne Gordon Colby. On her recovery, he re-entered political life and successfully ran for Governor of Rhode Island in 1938. He served one two year term from January 1939 to January 1941. His refusal to dole out patronage to fellow Republicans, however, weakened his power base and a scandal over wire-tapping by a private detective firm he had hired to investigate election fraud, cost him re- election in 1940. ===Navy service during World War II=== In May 1941 Vanderbilt, an officer in the Naval Reserve, was called to active duty in June 1941 with the rank of lieutenant commander and initially assigned to the Panama Canal Zone.New York Times. June 7, 1941. He was promoted to commander on August 15, 1942.Naval Reserve Register. 1944. In 1942 Vanderbilt was assigned as executive officer of the Special Operations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) under General William J. Donovan. In May 1944 he was assigned to the staff of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.New York Times. May 28, 1944. He was promoted to the rank of captain prior to the end of the war.New York Times, May 6, 1941. ; U.S. Navy Reserve Register, 1943 ===Later life=== After his discharge from the Navy at the end of the war, Vanderbilt left Rhode Island and retired to a farm in South Williamstown, Massachusetts. Oakland Farm and its 150 acres in Portsmouth, Rhode Island was sold and divided into housing lots by the end of the 1940s.http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/survey_pdfs/portsmouth.pdf Vanderbilt died of cancer on April 14, 1981, at the age of 79. He was buried in the Southlawn Cemetery in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He is one of the few descendants of William Henry Vanderbilt not to be buried in the family tomb on Staten Island. ==Personal life== Vanderbilt in 1940 Vanderbilt married Emily O'Neill Davies (1903‚Äì1935), granddaughter of Daniel O'Neill, owner of the Pittsburgh Dispatch newspaper, and daughter of Frederick Martin Davies on November 1, 1923 at Grace Church, New York. Emily was the grandniece of Frederick Townsend Martin, a prominent writer of the 1920s. The couple gave birth to a daughter: * Emily \\"Paddy\\" Vanderbilt (b. 1925), who married Jeptha Wade, both graduates of MIT. The couple's marriage was troubled and Emily sued for divorce in Paris in the summer of 1926, but reconciled. She again sued for divorce in Newport, Rhode Island which was granted in June 1928. She later married Sigourney Thayer (1896‚Äì1944), for less than a year, and then Raoul Whitfield (1896‚Äì1945), shortly before her death in 1935. On December 27, 1929, Vanderbilt married for the second time to Anne Gordon Colby (1909‚Äì1974) of West Orange, New Jersey. Together, they had three children: * Anne Vanderbilt (d. 2014), who was married Samuel Adams Hartwell, Sr. * Elsie Vanderbilt, who married Andre Walter George Newburg (1928‚Äì2018) in 1954 and M. Bernard Aidinoff (1929‚Äì2016) in 1996. * William H. Vanderbilt Jr. (b. 1945) This marriage also ended in divorce in 1969 after 40 years of marriage, and Vanderbilt promptly re-married the following year to Helen Cummings Cook (d. 1997), who was previously married to John R.

The Scuola della Carit√†, the Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi and the church of Santa Maria della Carit√† thus became the home of the Accademia. The Scuola della Carit√† was the oldest of the six Scuole Grandi and the building dates back to 1343, though the scuola was formed in 1260. The Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi was started in 1561 by Andrea Palladio, though it was never fully completed. The facade of Santa Maria della Carit√† was completed in 1441 by Bartolomeo Bon. ==Collection== Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, the most famous work of the Gallery, is not displayed for visitors, except on very rare occasions. The Gallerie dell‚ÄôAccademia contains masterpieces of Venetian painting up to the 18th century, generally arranged chronologically though some thematic displays are evident. Artists represented include: Antonello da Messina, Lazzaro Bastiani, Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, Bernardo Bellotto, Pacino di Bonaguida,Pacino di Bonaguida , J. Paul Getty Museum, USA. Canaletto, Vittore Carpaccio, Giulio Carpioni, Rosalba Carriera, Cima da Conegliano, Domenico Fetti, Pietro Gaspari, Michele Giambono, Luca Giordano, Francesco Guardi, Giorgione, Johann Liss, Charles Le Brun, Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro Longhi, Lorenzo Lotto, Andrea Mantegna, Rocco Marconi, Michele Marieschi, Giambattista Piazzetta, Giambattista Pittoni, Mattia Preti, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Tintoretto, Titian, Paolo Veronese Giorgio Vasari, Alvise Vivarini, and Giuseppe Zais. The collection includes Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of the Vitruvian Man, which is displayed only rarely as the work, being on paper, is fragile and sensitive to light. In 2019, the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris requested the loan of the drawing for its exhibition of works by Leonardo. The request was refused by a cultural heritage group. A court tribunal in Venice, however, decided that the work would suffer no ill effects if shipped with great care and displayed under controlled conditions. The work was, therefore, part of the Louvre's exhibition from 24 October 2019 to 24 February 2020. === Highlights === Hieronymus Bosch - Hermit Saints Triptych.jpgHieronymus Bosch The Hermit Saints, 86 √ó 120 cm.

He built a 250-room mansion, the largest privately owned home in the United States, which he named Biltmore Estate. ==Biography== George Washington Vanderbilt, John Singer Sargent, 1890 George W. Vanderbilt was the youngest child of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa Kissam. Though there is no evidence to suggest that he referred to himself using a numerical suffix during his life, various sources have called him both George Washington Vanderbilt II and III throughout time. Today, Biltmore recognizes him as George W. Vanderbilt III, as he had two uncles by that name, the first of whom died at the age of four. As the youngest of William's children, George was said to be his father's favorite and his constant companion. Relatives described him as slender, dark-haired, and pale-complexioned. Shy and introverted, his interests ran to philosophy, books, and the collection of paintings in his father's large art gallery. He acquired a private library of more than twenty thousand volumes. In addition to frequent visits to Paris, France, where several Vanderbilts kept a home, George Vanderbilt traveled extensively, becoming fluent in several foreign languages. His father owned elegant mansions in New York City and Newport and an country estate on Long Island. When William died in 1885 of a stroke, he left a fortune of approximately $200 million, the bulk of which was split between his two older sons, Cornelius Vanderbilt II and William K. Vanderbilt. George W. Vanderbilt inherited $2 million from his grandfather and received another million on his 21st birthday from his father. Upon his father's death, he inherited $5 million more, as well as the income from a $5 million trust fund. He ran the family farm at New Dorp and Woodland Beach, now the neighborhood of Midland Beach on Staten Island, New York where he was born, then lived with his mother in Manhattan until his own townhouse at 9 West 53rd Street was completed in 1887. The Vanderbilt family business was operated by his older brothers. This left George to spend his time in intellectual pursuits. In 1891 he joined the New York Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. ==Biltmore== Living in one or another of his family residences well into adulthood, Vanderbilt decided to construct his own country mansion and estate in 1888. For this purpose he acquired 125,000 acres of woodland in North Carolina, employing the architect Richard Morris Hunt to design a limestone house modeled on the Chateau de Blois among other chateaux of the Loire Valley. With up to four acres of floor space this is believed to be the largest domestic dwelling ever constructed in the United States. At Biltmore, Vanderbilt led the life of a country gentleman. Having a great interest in horticulture and agriscience, he oversaw experiments in scientific farming, animal bloodline breeding, and silviculture (forestry). His goal was to run Biltmore as a self-sustaining estate. In 1892, Frederick Law Olmsted suggested that Vanderbilt hire Gifford Pinchot to manage the forests on the estate. According to Pinchot, who went on to be the first Chief of the United States Forest Service, Biltmore was the first professionally managed forest in the U.S; it was also the site of the Biltmore School of Forestry, the first such school in North America, established in 1898 by Dr. Carl A. Schenck. Vanderbilt was known for his generosity toward his employees at Biltmore. Every year, he held a Christmas celebration for their children, complete with decorated tree and presents for each child, even those who could not make it to the party. He also paid all the expenses of the Cathedral of All Souls, an Episcopal cathedral he'd built and was a parishioner of, located directly across from the Biltmore Estate's main gate in Biltmore Village (the model village he had built for those who had worked to build the Estate or were employed on the Estate), so that the church's weekly collection could go directly to charity and outreach. The Biltmore Estate in 2006 ==Family== On June 1, 1898, Vanderbilt married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser (January 17, 1873 ‚Äì December 21, 1958) at the American Cathedral in Paris, France. Edith, a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, was the daughter of Maj. George Warren Dresser. She was also the grand-niece of Hamilton Fish. George and Edith had one daughter together, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt (August 22, 1900 - February 7, 1976). In 1912, George and Edith booked passage on the Titanic, but changed their plans at the last minute, instead sailing on her sister ship, the Olympic. The Olympic left port before Titanic and the Vanderbilts arrived in New York before the sinking. Edith, in a letter to her friend, Emily Ford Skeel (sister of Paul Leicester Ford), explained: \\"For no reason whatsoever we decided to sail on the Olympic and had only 18 hours to get ready in. We were homesick, and simply felt we must get home, and changed our ship, as I say, at the Eleventh hour!\\" However, a servant to the Vanderbilts, Frederick Wheeler, perished aboard Titanic in second class as, due to the close timing of their switch, the Vanderbilts were forced to leave most of their luggage aboard Titanic and Wheeler retained his ticket to travel with it. ==Death== He died due to complications following an appendectomy in Washington, D.C. on March 6, 1914. He was interred in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum at the Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp in Staten Island, New York. ==Legacy== After his death, Vanderbilt's widow sold approximately of the Biltmore property to the United States Forest Service at $5 an acre, fulfilling her husband's wishes to create the core of Pisgah National Forest. She sold additional land as finances demanded; today, about remain. Edith Dresser Vanderbilt later married Peter Goelet Gerry (1879‚Äì1957), a United States Senator from Rhode Island. The Vanderbilts' only child, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, married British aristocrat, the Hon. John Francis Amherst Cecil (a descendant of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley) in 1924. Their sons, George and William, eventually inherited the property. George Cecil, the older of the two sons, chose to inherit the majority of the estate's land and the Biltmore Farms Company, which was more profitable than the house at the time. The younger son, William Cecil was thus left with Biltmore House, and is credited with preserving the chateau which (though still privately owned) is open to the public. ==References== ==Further reading== *Vanderbilt, Arthur T.

This genus, like other loricariids is characterized by rows of armour plating covering the body, as well as the underslung suckermouth. They are generally small in size; O. tapirape is the smallest of the species (2.4 cm), while O. flexilis is the biggest (5.5 cm). These species have adaptations that allow them to breathe air. A duct forms at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach and expands into an enlarged, ring-like diverticulum, diagnostic of this genus, which allows air-breathing.Armbruster, J.W. (1998): Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes. Copeia, 1998 (3): 663‚Äì675. Otocinclus are popular aquarium fish. They are often purchased as algae eaters. It is difficult to breed them in captivity, and only wild caught Otocinclus are available to hobbyists. This genus is widely distributed east of the Andes of South America, throughout the lowlands from northern Venezuela to northern Argentina, but are generally absent from the Amazon and the Orinoco lowlands. ==Etymology== The Otocinclus name is derived from the Greek oto, meaning ear and the Latin cinclus, meaning a latticework, an allusion to the holes in the head in the region of the ear. ==Taxonomy== Otocinclus is the most basal genus of the tribe Hypoptopomatini of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae. However, phylogenetic relationships are currently under study and this genus may eventually be relocated. Its monophyly is supported by seven derived features. O. batmani, O. bororo, O cocama, O. huaorani, O. mariae and O. mura form a monophyletic group within this genus. A monophyletic group is also formed by O. flexilis, O. mimulus and O. xakriaba, which all share mimicry as a synapomorphy. ==Species== There are currently 19 recognized species in this genus: * Otocinclus arnoldi Regan, 1909 * Otocinclus batmani Lehmann A., 2006 Lehmann, A., P.

Moreira, 2002 * Otocinclus vestitus Cope, 1872 * Otocinclus vittatus Regan, 1904 * Otocinclus xakriaba Schaefer, 1997 ==Ecology== Species of this genus are diurnal and generally are found in small streams or along the margins of larger rivers, clinging to substrates using the mouth as a sucker and feeding on algae or aufwuchs on roots, stones, macrophytes and broad-leaved grasses. They inhabit well-oxygenated, moderate- to slow-flowing environments, often near river banks. They are found near the surface of the water, but are often associated with vegetation or other structures. They lay adhesive eggs and do not guard them; this is in contrast to many other loricariids where the male builds a nest and guards the eggs. These fish live in shoals or schools. Otocinclus are able to breathe air. Prior to surfacing, they will release air through their gills and mouth. Upon returning to the bottom, the fish do not need to pump their buccal cavities, indicating they are absorbing oxygen from the swallowed air. O. flexilis, O. mimulus and O. xakriaba are considered to be Batesian mimics of certain Corydoras species (C. diphyes, C. garbei, C. nattereri and C. paleatus, respectively). These Corydoras species have bony plates of armor and strong spines as defenses, making them less palatable; by mimicking these species in size and coloration, Otocinclus spp. avoid predation.Axenrot, T.E. & Kullander, S.O.

The tradition began in 1932 with a radio broadcast by King George V on the British Broadcasting Corporation's Empire Service. Since 1952, the message has been read by Elizabeth II; today, it is broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet via various providers. ==History== George V giving the 1934 Royal Christmas Message The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the British Empire was first proposed by the \\"founding father\\" of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), John Reith, in 1922 when he approached King George V about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment. Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932, as a way to inaugurate the Empire Service (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by Queen Mary and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. That year, George V read the first Royal Christmas Message; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of radio, but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at Sandringham House. The broadcast was introduced from Ilmington Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa and the United Kingdom. While his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated just before his first Christmas as king, George VI continued his father's Christmas broadcasts; it was in his 1939 reading delivered in the opening stages of the Second World War that he uttered the famous lines: \\"I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year.\\" For many years, the King's speech came at the end of an hour- long broadcast of greeting from various parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth which typically included interviews with ordinary people of many occupations such as an innkeeper in an English village, a minder in South Africa, and a lifeguard in Australia with the King's speech serving as a bond tying the Commonwealth together. George's daughter and successor, Elizabeth II, gave her first Christmas message to the Commonwealth of Nations from her study at Sandringham House, at 3:07 PM on 25 December 1952, some 11 months after her father's death. Five years later, the tradition was first broadcast on television and, from then until 1996, was produced by the BBC; only in 1969 was no message given because a special documentary film, Royal Family, had been made during the summer in connection with the investiture of the Prince of Wales. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but the Queen issued a written message instead. The Queen ended this monopoly, however, announcing that the message would, from 1997, be produced and broadcast alternately by the BBC and its main rival, Independent Television News (ITN), with a biennial rotation. It was reported by The Daily Telegraph that this decision was made after the BBC decided to screen an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, on its current affairs programme Panorama. This was denied by Buckingham Palace which said the new arrangements \\"reflect the composition of the television and radio industries today\\". Beginning in 2011, Sky News was added to the rotation. Sky News recorded the Queen's Christmas message for Christmas 2012, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, and for the first time it has been recorded in 3D. Buckingham Palace are reported to have explained: \\"We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do.\\" The themes and direction of the speech are decided by the Queen and the text is largely written by the Queen herself, sometimes with assistance from Prince Philip and her staff. In recent years, the speech has become more personal and religious in tone. ==Broadcast== The message typically combines a chronicle of that year's major events, with specific focus on the British Empire originally and later the Commonwealth of Nations, with the sovereign's own personal milestones and feelings on Christmas. It is one of the few instances when the sovereign speaks publicly without advice from any ministers of the Crown in any of the monarch's realms. Planning for each year's address begins months earlier, when the monarch establishes a theme and appropriate archival footage is collected and assembled; the actual speech is recorded a few days prior to Christmas. In the United Kingdom and on the Internet, broadcast of the Queen's Christmas message is embargoed until 15:00 GMT on 25 December.

She also spoke of the importance of teamwork and of what she had learned when presenting the new Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for Voluntary Service in the Community.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  BBC -  2004  Opening with footage of the Queen handing out presents to her own family, and interlaced with coverage of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales attending various multicultural meetings, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visiting a Sikh gurudwara and the Prince of Wales visiting a Muslim school in east London, the theme of the message was cultural and religious diversity and the benefits of tolerance. The message was warmly received by leaders of Britain's Muslim and Sikh communities. In a break from tradition, the Queen also sent a separate radio Christmas message to UK troops, which was broadcast by the British Forces Broadcasting Service. -  2005  The Queen reflected on such tragedies as the Indian Ocean tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the earthquake in Kashmir, and the bombings in London; she praised as \\"quite remarkable\\" the humanitarian responses from people of all faiths.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ITN -  2006  The speech, available for the first time for download as a podcast, was about the relationship between the generations and how young and old could come together to strengthen their communities, with strong references to the inclusion of Muslims and other faiths into mainstream society. -  2007  The 2007 message began with the introductory remarks from the 1957 Christmas message shown on a television and the Queen standing beside it. The theme centred on the family, including Jesus' birth into a family under unfavourable circumstances, and the Queen spoke about the common duty to care for the vulnerable in society. Footage of the Royal Marines in the war in Afghanistan, as well as a military memorial, were shown, accompanied by commentary about the work of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The message ended with a black and white clip of \\"God Save the Queen\\" from the original 1957 broadcast and an image of the British royal standard.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  BBC -  2008  The Queen acknowledged that concerns about the 2008 economic downturn as well as violence around the world have made that year's Christmas \\"a more sombre occasion for many\\" and called on people to show courage and not accept defeat and instead struggle for a better future. She also reflected on the 60th birthday of the Prince of Wales and his charitable works and paid tribute to those who lead charitable lives in the service of others. This was the first message broadcast in high-definition. -  2009  The Queen reflected on the role of Commonwealth armed forces serving in Afghanistan.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  ITN } ====2010s==== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:99%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:5%;\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:88%;\\"  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:6%;\\"  Broadcast partner -  2010  The Queen focused on the importance of the King James Bible (400 years old in 2011) as a unifying force and of sport in building communities and creating harmony. The Christmas message included footage of Prince William and Prince Harry playing football with orphans in Lesotho. Rather than being recorded at Buckingham Palace as is normally the case, for the first time the Christmas message was filmed in Hampton Court Palace.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  ITN -  2011  Unity and hope in the face of adversity and the importance of family were the themes of this year's broadcast with royal tours, the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding of Zara Phillips and the differences between the two, and the Commonwealth also being touched upon in those two contexts, respectively. The message was recorded prior to the hospitalisation of the Duke of Edinburgh for emergency heart surgery. This was the first Christmas message produced by Sky News.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Sky -  2012  Broadcast for the first time in 3D.

She recalled the Christmas truce of 1914, the Northern Ireland peace process and the Scottish independence referendum as she spoke of reconciliation and forgiveness. She also spoke of \\"the selflessness of aid workers and medical volunteers who have gone abroad to help victims of conflict or of diseases like Ebola, often at great personal risk\\". There was greater than usual anticipation surrounding the speech due to rumours that the Queen would be announcing her abdication; however, she made no such announcement. -  2015  Addressing a year marked by disasters, terrorist attacks, and a refugee crisis, the Queen encouraged her audience to find hope in \\"moments of darkness\\" and quoted the Gospel of John in saying 'The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.' She also said that Christmas is a \\"time to remember all that we have to be thankful for\\" and give thanks to \\"the people who bring love and happiness into our own lives\\". The Queen also noted that 2015 was the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and thanked those who served in the conflict. The Queen also noted the tradition of decorating the Christmas tree, and how her great-great grandfather, Prince Albert, brought the tradition of a Christmas tree with him from Germany to Britain. The Queen then noted the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, and that she would be the newest addition of her family to help her decorate the Christmas tree. The Queen spoke about the Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square, and acknowledged how Norway gives London the tree as a gift for helping them in World War II. The message was recorded in Buckingham Palace's 18th Century Room.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ITN -  2016  The theme of the speech was inspiration. The Queen praised the achievements of British Olympian and Paralympian athletes at the Rio Olympic Games and reflected on the 60th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards and the 40th anniversary of The Prince's Trust and spoke of the inspiration provided by ordinary people who do small but great things, saying that: \\"On our own, we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice, but the cumulative impact of thousands of small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine.\\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/queen-elizabeth-christmas- speech-1.3912328 -  2017  The theme of the speech was the home. The Queen paid tribute to the survivors of the London and Manchester terrorist attacks and gave her thoughts and prayers to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and those who lost so much in the disaster. She reflected on milestones in her own life, including her 70th wedding anniversary and the Duke of Edinburgh's decision to step aside from public duties. She said she looked forward to welcoming new members into the Royal Family next year, a reference to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting their third child, and to Prince Harry's engagement to his girlfriend, Meghan Markle.  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Sky -  2018  The Queen noted the centenary of the Royal Air Force and the centenary of the Armistice, and spoke of her father's participation at the Battle of Jutland. She also referenced the birth of Prince Louis of Cambridge, the weddings of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, as well as the seventieth birthday celebrations for the Prince of Wales. She said that faith, family, and friendship have been a source of continuous comfort and reassurance for her. She recalled the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London and the 2018 Commonwealth Games and spoke of the goals of the Commonwealth and its principles of mutual respect and cooperation. The Queen said that peace and goodwill need to be heeded now as much as ever, and people should respect each other even when they harbour deeply held differences. -  2019  Speaking in Windsor Castle's Green Drawing Room, the Queen introduced her message by saying how it is \\"small steps, not the giant leaps\\" that bring lasting change in the world, referencing the fiftieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission and Neil Armstrong's words upon setting foot on the Moon. She then spoke of the commemoration that year of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in which former foes set aside their past differences to commemorate the event together. While the Queen did not directly refer to the divisions in 2019 concerning debates around Brexit culminating in the general election, her description of the year as \\"quite bumpy\\" was widely interpreted in the media as being an indirect reference and her speaking of the importance of reconciliation, saying, \\"small steps... can overcome long-held differences and deep-seated divisions to bring harmony and understanding\\" was seen as urging the British people to heal divisions among them. The Queen also noted the birth of her great-grandson, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, and spoke of how she has \\"been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.\\"  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  BBC } ==Similar messages elsewhere== In 1931, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands delivered her first Christmas message on the airwaves, which was also broadcast to the Dutch East Indies, Suriname and the other Dutch West Indies via shortwave radio station PCJJ. During the reign of her daughter Juliana, the Royal Christmas Message was to become an annual tradition. The Pope delivers a Christmas message to the world and heads of state of other countries have adopted the tradition of a message at Christmas, including the King of Sweden, the King of the Belgians, the President of Germany, and the King of Spain. Others have modified the practice by issuing a statement to coincide with the New Year; this is done by the Governors-General of Canada and New Zealand, the Queen of Denmark, the King of Norway, the King of Thailand, the Presidents of China, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Philippines, Poland, and the Russian Federation, as well as the Chancellor of Germany. The Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, also gives a New Year's Day speech. The British Prime Minister issues a short Christmas message and the Prime Minister's New Year Message which extensively reflects on the last year and the governments intentions in the new year. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia makes speeches on his official birthday in June and on National Heroes Day in July, while the Prime Minister of Malaysia also makes speeches not only on New Year's Day but also on the night of Eid ul-Fitr and on the eve of Independence Day. The Prime Minister of Singapore gives his speech on this occasion and on the National Day of Singapore. In the past, the Governor of Hong Kong, as the representative of the British monarch, played this role; the tradition was carried on by the Chief Executive upon the territory's handover to China in 1997. The President of the United States also gives out Christmas messages as part of the President's Weekly Address. Some of these messages come out within a few days before Christmas or on Christmas Day. The President may also give out Christmas message to soldiers serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. The opposition party may also give out their Christmas messages as part of their response to the President's weekly address. In addition, beginning in 1986, US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev exchanged televised New Year's Day addresses to the other's respective nations. This exchange continued between President George H. W. Bush and Gorbachev until the demise of the Soviet Union. ==See also== * Alternative Christmas message * Christmas Eve National Speech * List of addresses to the nation by the British monarch * Prime Minister's New Year Message ==References*The Royal Family Channel on YouTube *Transcript of The Queen's Christmas Broadcast for 2013 Category:British monarchy Category:Monarchy in Canada Category:Speeches by heads of state Category:1932 radio programme debuts Category:Canadian traditions Category:Annual television shows Category:Christmas in the United Kingdom Category:Annual events in the United Kingdom Category:Christmas in Canada ","title":"Royal Christmas Message"},{"id":"1273186","text":"Firgas is a town and a municipality in the northern part of the island of Gran Canaria, in the Province of Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands.

They were a widespread genus that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period; they have a possible fossil record during the Paleocene (as recent as c.61 Ma) in the Southern United States and Turkmenistan. ==Morphology== Scaphites generally have a chambered, boat-shaped shell. The initial part (juvenile stage) of the shell is generally more or less involute (tightly- coiled) and compressed, giving no hint of the heteromorphic shell form yet to come. The terminal part (adult stage) is much shorter, erect, and bends over the older shell like a hook. They have transverse, branching ribs with tubercles (small bumps) along the venter. Suture pattern of ScaphitesReconstructions of the body within the shell can be made to portray Scaphites as either a benthic (bottom-dwelling) or planktonic animal, depending on where the center of gravity is located. Since useful fossils of the soft-body parts of cephalopods are highly rare, little is known about how this animal actually fit into its shell and lived its life. ==Age== Because Scaphites and its relatives in Superfamily Scaphitoidea are restricted to certain ages of the Cretaceous (ca. 144 to 66.4 million years ago), they are useful in some areas as an index fossil. A notable example is the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway in North America, in which several endemic lineages of scaphite species evolved and now serve as the basis for a highly resolved regional biostratigraphy. == Species == * Scaphites binneyi ‚Ä† Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites carlilensis ‚Ä† Morrow, 1935 * Scaphites depressus ‚Ä† Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites ferronensis ‚Ä† Cobban, 1951 * Scaphites frontierensis ‚Ä† Cobban, 1951 * Scaphites hippocrepis ‚Ä† DeKay, 1827 * Scaphites impendicostatus ‚Ä† Cobban, 1951 * Scaphites leei ‚Ä† Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites nanus ‚Ä† Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites nodosus ‚Ä† * Scaphites obliquus ‚Ä† J.

To family and friends he was known as \\"Mike\\". His siblings were William Kissam Vanderbilt II and Consuelo Vanderbilt. As the great- grandson of the shipping and railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, he was born to great wealth and privilege: as a child he was raised in Vanderbilt mansions, travelled frequently to Europe, and sailed the world on yachts owned by his father. His nephew, Barclay Harding Warburton III, founded the American Sail Training Association. Vanderbilt was educated by tutors and at private schools in Massachusetts, including St. Mark's School, Harvard College (AB 1907), and Harvard Law School, where he attended from 1907 to 1910. ==Career== After Harvard Law, he joined the New York Central Railroad, the centerpiece of his family's vast railway empire, of which his father was president. On his father's death in 1920, Harold inherited a fortune that included the Idle Hour country estate at Oakdale, New York (on Long Island) and equity in several railway companies, including Detroit, Toledo & Milwaukee Railroad, the Genesee Falls Railway, the Kanawha and Michigan Railway, the Kanawha and West Virginia Railroad, the New Jersey Junction Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the New York and Harlem Railroad, and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Following the death of his brother William in 1944, he remained the only active representative of the Vanderbilt family involved with the New York Central Railroad. He served as a director and member of the executive committee until 1954, when the New York Central was subjected to a hostile takeover by business tycoon Robert R. Young. Young committed suicide four years later. ===World War I=== St. David's Battery, Bermuda. Vanderbilt nearly lost his yacht, the Vagrant, on Britain's entry into the First World War. The British competitor for the 1914 America's Cup, Shamrock IV, was crossing the Atlantic with the steam yacht Erin, destined for Bermuda, when Britain declared war on Germany on August 5, 1914. The British crews received word of the declaration of war by radio. As the Commodore of the New York Yacht Club, Vanderbilt sent the Vagrant from Rhode Island to Bermuda to meet the Shamrock IV and Erin, and to escort them to the US. Meanwhile, among the first things done in Bermuda on the declaration was to remove all maritime navigational aids. The Vagrant arrived on the 8th. Having no radio, the crew were unaware of the declaration of war and finding all of the buoys and other navigational markers missing, they attempted to pick their own way in through the Narrows, the channel that threads through the barrier reef. This took them directly to the fore of St. David's Battery, where the gunners were on a war footing and opened fire. This was just a warning shot, which had the desired effect. The Shamrock IV and Erin arrived the next day. The America's Cup was cancelled for that year. In March 1917, Vanderbilt was commissioned a lieutenant (junior grade) in the United States Naval Reserve. When the United States entered World War I, he was called to active duty on April 9, 1917 and assigned as commanding officer of the scout patrol boat USS Patrol No. 8 (SP-56), which operated out of Newport, Rhode Island. He was reassigned on July 20 to command the Block Island, Rhode Island, anti-submarine sector and on November 17 the New London, Connecticut sector. Upon his reassignment the officers and men of the Block Island sector presented him with an engraved naval officer's sword as a token of their esteem. The sword is now displayed at the Marble House in Newport. On July 17, 1918, he was reassigned to the US Navy forces in Europe and reported to Submarine Chaser Detachment 3 at Queenstown, Ireland in August. He served with Detachment 3 until the unit was disbanded on November 25, 1918 - shortly after the Armistice was signed. He was placed on inactive duty December 30, 1918 and was promoted to lieutenant on February 26, 1919, retroactive to September 21, 1918. He was discharged from the Naval Reserve on March 26, 1921. ===Sailing career=== As a boy, Harold Vanderbilt spent part of his summers at the Vanderbilt mansions‚Äîthe Idle Hour estate in Long Island, New York on the banks of the Connetquot River; Marble House at Newport, Rhode Island; and later at Belcourt, the Newport mansion of his stepfather, Oliver Belmont. As an adult, he pursued his interest in yachting, winning six \\"King's Cups\\" and five Astor Cups at regattas between 1922 and 1938. He served as commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1922 to 1924. In 1925, he built his own luxurious vacation home at Palm Beach, Florida that he called \\"El Solano.\\" (John Lennon, formerly of The Beatles, purchased it shortly before his 1980 murder.) Vanderbilt achieved the pinnacle of yacht racing in 1930 by defending the America's Cup in the J-class yacht Enterprise. His victory put him on the cover of the September 15, 1930, issue of TIME magazine (see image). In 1934 Harold faced a dangerous challenger from the United Kingdom, Endeavour, owned by the aviation pioneer and industrialist Thomas Sopwith. Endeavour won the first two races but Vanderbilt's Rainbow then won four races in a row and successfully defended the Cup. In 1937 he won again in Ranger, the last of the J-class yachts to defend the Cup. He was posthumously elected to the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 1993. In the fall of 1935, Harold began a study of the yacht racing rules with three friends: Philip J. Roosevelt, President of the North American Yacht Racing Union (predecessor to US SAILING); Van Merle- Smith, President of the Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound; and Henry H. Anderson. \\"The four men began by attempting to take the right-of-way rules as they were and amending them. After about six weeks of intensive effort, they finally concluded that they were getting exactly nowhere. It was the basic principles, not the details, that were causing the problems. They would have to start from scratch.\\"MacArthur, Robert C. Room at the Mark. (Boston, 1991). In 1936, Vanderbilt, with assistance from the other three had developed an alternative set of rules, printed them, and mailed a copy to every yachtsman that Harold knew personally or by name in both the United States and England. These were virtually ignored, but a second edition in 1938 was improved, as were following versions. Vanderbilt continued to work with the various committees of the North American Yacht Racing Union until finally in 1960 the International Yacht Racing Union (predecessor to the International Sailing Federation or ISAF) adopted the rules that Vanderbilt and the Americans had developed over the previous quarter century. ===Bridge=== Vanderbilt was also a card game enthusiast. In 1925, while on board SS Finland, he originated changes to the scoring system through which the game of contract bridge supplanted auction bridge in popularity. Three years later he endowed the Vanderbilt Cup awarded to the winners of the North American championship (now the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams, or simply \\"the Vanderbilt\\", one of the North American Bridge Championships marquee events). In 1932 and again in 1940 he was part of a team that won his own trophy; it remains one of the most prized in the game. Vanderbilt also donated the World Bridge Federation Vanderbilt Trophy, awarded from 1960 to 2004 to the winner of the Open category at the quadrennial World Team Olympiad, and since 2008 to the winner of the corresponding event at the World Mind Sports Games.\\"World Team Olympiad\\". World Bridge Federation (WBF). Retrieved 2014-05-31. With image of the Vanderbilt Trophy.\\"World Bridge Games\\". WBF. Retrieved 2014-05-31. Vanderbilt invented the first , which he called the \\"Club Convention\\" but which has since become more usually known as the Vanderbilt Club.Harold S. Vanderbilt, Contract Bridge, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York & London, 1929The Bridge Players' Encyclopaedia, International Edition, Paul Hamlyn, London, 1967, p. 564 The strong club, or forcing club, family of has performed exceptionally well in world championship play.The Nottingham Club, Neapolitan Club, Blue Club, Precision Club, and other strong forcing club systems are an outgrowth of the Vanderbilt Club. Polish Club, Unassuming Club and other weak club systems are an outgrowth from the Vienna System (Stern Austrian System, 1938). He wrote four books on the subject. Vanderbilt, Ely Culbertson, and Charles Goren were the three people named when The Bridge World inaugurated a bridge \\"hall of fame\\" in 1964 and they were made founding members of the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1995. In 1969, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) made Vanderbilt its first honorary member. In 1969, he became a WBF Honorary Member, and was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1964.\\"Induction by Year\\". Hall of Fame. ACBL. Retrieved 2014-12-22.\\"Vanderbilt, Harold\\" . Hall of Fame. ACBL. Retrieved 2014-12-30.In 1941, he was made ACBL Honorary Member of the Year and won the Wetzlar Trophy in 1940. He won the North American Bridge Championships twice and the Vanderbilt twice, the first in 1932 and the last in 1940. He was a runner-up at the North American Bridge Championships and during the Vanderbilt in 1937. ===Later life=== In 1930, after a property dispute with the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, Vanderbilt moved several miles south to an undeveloped area called Manalapan, where he purchased 500 feet of oceanfront property and built a mansion called Eastover. In 1931, he filed papers to incorporate the Town of Manalapan and became the Town's first mayor, serving from 1952 until 1966. He was a town councilman for 32 years and was called \\"mayor emeritus\\" when he retired from public service. In 1934, his sister, Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan, built her own mansion on Hypoluxo Island, across the water from Eastover. In addition to sailing, Vanderbilt was a licensed pilot, and in 1938 he acquired a Sikorsky S-43 \\"Flying Boat\\". At the outbreak of the Second World War, Vanderbilt's yachts Vagrant and Vara, which was under construction, were seized by the United States Navy. The Vagrant was designated as YP-258 and later as PYc-30. Navy official Edmond J. Moran met with Vanderbilt in New York, to present him with a check for $300,000 as compensation for the Vagrant. Upon receiving the check, Vanderbilt signed it over to the USO, so the money could be used to benefit servicemen. The Vara was completed, renamed as the USS Valiant, and designated as PC-509 (later as PYc-51). ==Personal life== Vanderbilt married Gertrude Lewis Conaway, of Philadelphia, in 1933. They did not have any children. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt died on July 4, 1970. Ironically, this was only two weeks after the Penn Central Railroad, successor to the New York Central Railroad, had declared bankruptcy (on June 21, 1970). He and his wife are interred at Saint Mary's Episcopal Cemetery in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, their graves marked with only a simple flat stone. It is uncertain why he chose to be buried in Rhode Island rather than in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum on Staten Island. It is noteworthy, however, that he is buried in the same cemetery as his business rival Robert R. Young. ==Legacy== Marble House, owned and operated by the Preservation Society Harold Vanderbilt had a keen interest in the success of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, founded in 1873 through the financial sponsorship of his great-grandfather. A longtime member of the university's Board of Trust, he served as its president between 1955 and 1968. He helped guide the institution through a time in history when racial integration of the student body was a divisive and explosive issue. In 1962, Vanderbilt attended one of the first meetings of the Vanderbilt Sailing Club and provided funding for the club to purchase its first fleet of dinghies, Penguins. The university annually offers several scholarships named in his honor, and on the grounds in front of Buttrick Hall, a statue designed by Joseph Kiselewski was erected in his honor. In 1947, Vanderbilt was invested as an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by King George VI. The letters patent conferring the honor on him (signed by Queen Mary in her capacity as Grand Master of the Order) and the insignia of the order are on display in the Trophy Room at the Marble House summer estate in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1963, Vanderbilt assisted the Preservation Society of Newport County in acquiring Marble House in Newport, Rhode Island, which his mother had sold more than 30 years earlier. Their bid was successful, and the property was converted into a museum that has been open to the public since the mid-1960s and holds documents and artifacts related to his life. A sailing drink, Stirling Punch, was named in Vanderbilt's honor. Vanderbilt's private railroad car, New York Central 3, was renovated and operates luxury charter trips at the rear of regularly scheduled Amtrak and Via Rail Canada trains. Vanderbilt was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011. He was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Publications== * Contract Bridge: bidding and the club convention (New York and London, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1929), 251 pp. : With \\"Laws of Contract Bridge, 1927, reprinted by permission of ... the Whist club: pp. 207‚Äì36.\\"\\"Contract bridge; bidding and the club convention\\".

David Almas owned the land on the east side of the road, while John Porter owned the land in the west end. The building of the Canada Southern Railroad in 1870, and of the Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway three years later helped to make Hagersville a prosperous village in 1879. Close by the rail crossing was The Junction Hotel, later becoming The Lawson Hotel after a change in ownership. Perhaps it was best known as Murph's Place when retired NHL player Ron Murphy took ownership. It was also known as the Hagersville Inn, but today it is known as The Old Lawson House. In 1852, Charles Hager built a frame hotel at the corner of the Plank Road and Indian Line. Hagersville's first post office was in this hotel and Joseph Seymour suggested the community be called Hagersville to honour the Hager brothers. As of 2020, the Lawson property offered rooms as affordable housing for many residents. During World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force built and operated No. 16 Service Flying Training School as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan at 274 Concession 11 Walpole southwest of Hagersville. No. 16 SFTS opened on 8 August 1941 and closed on 30 March 1945. After the RCAF finished with the site it was used by the Canadian Army for various purposes and was known as Camp Hagersville. The camp was closed in 1964. Between the 1960s and 1990s, the camp was used as a residence for youth and then a flea market. As of 2013 the site was an industrial park. Some of the military homes are still there, and the housing area is known as \\"White Oaks Village\\". A good view of the site and the old hangars is had from Concession 10 Walpole. The base was located at . In 1990, a large uncontrolled tire fire emitted fumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere for seventeen days. The fire itself occurred in Townsend, a neighbouring community, but media credited it to Hagersville due to Townsend's relatively unknown status in the area.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . In his 15-year MLB career, Bell was a .281 hitter with 1,823 hits, 311 doubles, 66 triples, 206 home runs and 942 runs batted in in 1,741 games played. Defensively, he recorded a career .985 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions. He was nicknamed \\"Gus\\" as a youngster because he was a fan of longtime MLB player Gus Mancuso.Spink, J. G. Taylor, ed., 1951 Official Baseball Register. St. Louis, Missouri: The Sporting News, 1951. Page 27. ==Family== A native of Louisville, Kentucky, and graduate of Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget High School, Bell was the oldest member of a rare three- generation major league family. His son, Buddy, has been a third baseman, coach, manager and front-office executive in the majors, and his grandsons, David and Mike, are both former infielders who have remained in baseball after their playing careers as coaches, managers or player development officials. Gus Bell wore uniform #25 during his nine years with the Cincinnati Reds (known as the \\"Redlegs\\" from 1953‚Äì58); Buddy Bell wore 25 in tribute to his father during much of his playing and managing career, including his tenure with the Reds. David, named manager of the Reds in , carried on the tradition when he took Cincinnati uniform #25 as well. ==Career== ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== Bell played for the Pirates from through . On June 4, 1951, he hit for the cycle against the Philadelphia Phillies. In 2004, his grandson David hit for the cycle; Gus Bell and David Bell are the only grandfather-grandson duo in major league history to hit for the cycle. ===Cincinnati Redlegs/Reds=== With Cincinnati from through , Bell was a four-time National League All-Star selection (1953‚Äì54, 1956‚Äì57). He enjoyed his best seasons in 1953, when he hit .300 with 30 home runs and 105 RBI, and , batting .308 with 27 home runs and 104 RBI. Four times, he recorded more than 100 RBI in a season and hit 103 home runs from 1953 to . Bell hit home runs in three consecutive at-bats on May 29, 1956. During the 1956 season, Bell, Ted Kluszewski and Bob Thurman became the second trio of teammates each to have three-home run games in the same season. The feat had been accomplished by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1950 (Duke Snider, Roy Campanella and Tommy Brown) and subsequently was equally by the Cleveland Indians in 1987 (Cory Snyder, Joe Carter and Brook Jacoby). In , Bell and six of his teammates ‚Äì Ed Bailey, Johnny Temple, Roy McMillan, Don Hoak, Wally Post and Frank Robinson ‚Äî were voted to the National League All-Star starting lineup, the result of a ballot stuffing campaign by Cincinnati fans. Bell remained on the team as a reserve, but Post was taken off altogether due to injury. Bell and Post were replaced as starters by Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Bell entered the game as a pinch hitter for Robinson in the seventh and drove in both Mays and Bailey with a double against Early Wynn. Bell's last season as a regular outfielder was , when he started 122 of the Reds' 154 games. In 1961, his final year with Cincinnati, he was a part-time player (starting 54 games) on the Reds' first pennant-winning team in 21 years. In the 1961 World Series, Bell was called on to pinch hit in Games 3, 4 and 5 and went hitless in three at bats. One day after the conclusion of the Fall Classic, won by the New York Yankees four games to one, Bell was the eighth overall selection in the primary phase of the National League expansion draft by the New York Mets. ===New York Mets=== Bell started the season with the Mets, and on April 11, 1962, he was the starting right fielder in the Mets' inaugural game. He became the first base runner in Met history after hitting a single in the second inning of an 11‚Äì4 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. But he collected only 15 hits in 101 at bats (.149) in 30 games with the expansion club. ===Milwaukee Braves=== On May 21, 1962, Bell was sent to Milwaukee to complete a November 1961 transaction in which the Mets acquired veteran slugger Frank Thomas. He batted .285 in 79 games (with 53 games started as an outfielder) to raise his 1962 season average to .241. But he had only six more MLB at bats as a Brave in 1963‚Äì64 until he was released on May 12, 1964, during the roster cutdown then in effect in the major leagues. ==Post-playing career== Bell was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1964. After his playing career, he worked for an auto dealership, ran a temporary employment agency, and was a scout for the Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers. Bell died in May 1995, at Bethesda North Hospital near Cincinnati; he had recently had a heart attack. He was survived by seven children and 36 grandchildren. On what would have been Bell's 83rd birthday ‚Äì November 15, 2011 ‚Äì he was inducted into the Louisville Catholic Sports Hall of Fame, with a speech by his grandson David. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of second-generation Major League Baseball players ==References== ==External links== *Gus Bell at The Deadball Era * : Category:1928 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Albany Senators players Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Baseball players from Kentucky Category:Cincinnati Redlegs players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Cleveland Indians scouts Category:Hollywood Stars players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Keokuk Pirates players Category:Leesburg Pirates players Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:National League All-Stars Category:New York Mets players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Sportspeople from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Texas Rangers scouts ","title":"Gus Bell"},{"id":"1273220","text":"Killer Instinct 2 is a fighting video game developed by Rare and manufactured by Midway for arcades in 1996 as a sequel to Killer Instinct (1994). A modified version of Killer Instinct 2, licensed by Nintendo, was published for the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold that same year. A Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Killer Instinct 2 was developed and completed, but never released.Retro Gamer magazine Issue 84: 25 Years of Rare. A digital port of the game for Xbox One is bundled with the second season of Killer Instinct (2013) under the title Killer Instinct 2 Classic. ==Gameplay== As with most fighting games and indeed its predecessor, two characters square off with the goal of depleting the opponent's life bar. As with the original Killer Instinct, when a player's original life bar is fully depleted, he or she will fall to the ground, and immediately begin on his or her second lifebar. As with the first game, Killer Instinct 2 relies on an automatic combo subsystem in its matches. The matches, as with Killer Instinct, revolve around a three strength system (Quick, Medium and Fierce). However, normal moves have lost a lot of their priority and range, as well as gaining extra recovery time. Throws have been added into the game to deal with blocking characters (as opposed to the top attack in Killer Instinct). Additionally, characters can be knocked down much easier with normal moves than in the first game, ending the possibility of opening with a 'glitch' combo and also weakening the effectiveness of normal moves. Normal special moves no longer are judged on priority, but instead follow a three tiered 'rock, paper, scissors' system, in which a certain special move will always break another certain special move (similar to the three tiered system in Soulcalibur). Additionally, a Super bar has been added to the game (similar to Street Fighter Alpha or The King of Fighters series). This super bar fills as a fighter takes damage or executes an attack that is blocked by the opponent. After the bar reaches a certain point, the player can use a multi-hit Super Move which is usually an extended version of a normal special move. The combo system has its roots in the original Killer Instinct. By pressing a certain strength button after an opener move, a player will launch an auto-double and initiate the combo system of the game. However, unlike the first game, players can now open up combos with new and much less risky moves than before (most notable a close Fierce punch or close Fierce kick). Additionally, Super Moves can be placed into combos, greatly increasing their damage and potency as well as being unbreakable. Additionally combos can be extended using throws, super linkers, manual-doubles, and super end specials. As a result of the weakened normal moves and other changes to the system, combos have now become more devastating in Killer Instinct 2. In an apparent effort to help ease this dominance, combo breakers are now easier to perform. Unlike combo breakers in the first game, which also required a three tiered 'rock, paper, scissors' system based on strength to break, combos are now broken depending on the type of attack. Punches break kick doubles, and kicks will break punch doubles. Parry, an advanced new addition, allow an open counter-attack after a successful parry block. A player can assume a standing defensive position and cause the attacker to temporarily freeze if the parry is successful, and from there either perform a special stunning technique or a 3-hit variant of a Special Move. The finishing moves have also been reworked. Now each character can only execute these attacks when the opponent's second life bar flashes red (unlike the first Killer Instinct the opponents falls when he or she loses all of his or her energy bars). Each characters has two Ultimate combo moves (one of them can be executed without executing a combo), the Humiliation sequences were dropped, and the Ultra combo feature is still intact. Unlike the Mortal Kombat Fatalities, however, the Killer Instinct 2s finishing moves do not feature brutality or dismemberment. ==Plot== Killer Instinct 2 follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Black Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos (Eyedol's opponent) to escape from Limbo. Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game have corresponding backstories, while new characters in this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like returning fighter T.J. Combo, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance. ===Characters=== The game features a total roster of 11 characters. Black Orchid, Fulgore, Glacius, Jago, Sabrewulf, Spinal and T.J. Combo return from the previous title. Eyedol, Chief Thunder, Cinder and Riptor were omitted from the roster; in their place, Gargos, Kim Wu, Maya and Tusk were introduced. Each character in the game has two or four different endings. Which ending the player gets depends whether or not the player kills (by using a finishing move instead of simply depleting their health) one or more certain character(s) during the course of the game. For example, Jago's endings both involve Fulgore and B. Orchid (if Fulgore does not kill Jago and B. Orchid, they team up and destroy him). Thus, killing or not killing them over the course of the game alters the outcomes of his endings: * If he kills both of them, he relishes his victory over Fulgore, but feels an inexplicable emptiness in his heart. * If he kills Orchid but doesn't destroy Fulgore, the cyborg will eventually make a lethal attack on him after he wins the tournament, and fulfills Ultratech's original purposes by seizing control of the world. * If he kills Fulgore but spares Orchid, his enjoyment of his enemy's demises is only sweetened by the discovery that Orchid is his older sister. * If he spares both their lives, he makes that discovery when Orchid saves him from Fulgore's attack. ==Development and release== According to designer Ken Lobb, eliminating excessive defense play \\"was the absolute highest priority. I felt that this was not a problem for experts, but it hurt beginners. We now reward the aggressor big time.\\" ===Killer Instinct Gold=== Killer Instinct Gold is an upgraded version of Killer Instinct 2 that was released for the Nintendo 64 shortly after the launch of the console. The game suffered some graphical downgrades and the endings for each character do not change (as they would in the Arcade version) due to the memory limitations of the Nintendo 64 cartridge. Other than that, Killer Instinct Gold remains faithful to the original Killer Instinct 2. The new features include: *Team Battles, in which one can fight with up to 11 characters. *Team Elimination Battles, in which one has to finish his or her opponents off with Finishing Moves (finishing moves similar to Mortal Kombat's Fatalities, which can be executed immediately) instead of simply depleting their life bar with normal moves, or they will simply return later on in the match (however as the computer player will sometimes use Gargos as the last opponent, victims can be removed from play anyway as he lacks a finishing move). *Training and Advanced Training, in which the player can learn the moves of the character they have chosen as well as the correct execution of combos, doubles, auto-doubles link moves, etc. *Options menu, which allows the player to modify certain data, such as the speed of the game, the color of the blood, button configuration, sound and manage Controller Pak data. *Unlockable content, such as alternate colors for characters and scenarios, and faster degrees of speed for the game. *The game's final boss Gargos is playable with a code. Killer Instinct Gold is compatible with the Nintendo 64's Controller Pak to save options and high scores, though the cartridge also includes battery save. Due to cartridge size limitations, several frames of character animation and the FMVs were removed, the later being replaced with 2d animations. Each character's multiple endings were also reduced to one ending a character; these new endings sometimes combining elements from more than one of a character's arcade endings. The stages were recreated in full 3D, as opposed to the scaling and distorting FMVs used for the stage backgrounds in the arcade version, allowing more dynamic camera takes at the beginning of the battle, while using less memory consumption. Killer Instinct Gold was later included as part of the Rare Replay compilation. ===Killer Instinct 2 Classic=== A digital port of the game's arcade version, titled Killer Instinct 2 Classic, was released as part of the \\"Season 2 Ultra Edition\\" of Killer Instinct for the Xbox One. The digital version of the game was developed by Code Mystics and supports online multiplayer via Xbox Live. ==Soundtrack== Killer Instinct Gold also released its original soundtrack, as the first Killer Instinct under Rare Label, titled Killer Instinct Gold Cuts. It is a 16-track-audio-CD, which includes original tracks from the Arcade versions plus two remixes and the Training Mode track. The soundtrack, along with several unreleased KI2 demo tracks, was included as part of the Killer Instinct Season 2 double-album set released on August 4, 2015.https://www.amazon.com/Killer-Instinct-Original-Soundtrack- Season/dp/B012VAJRHS ==Reception== A reviewer for Next Generation commented that while the game includes new fighting elements such as a super bar, the essence of the original game is essentially recycled. He also criticized that while the characters are larger and more detailed, this is at the cost of slower game speed and a choppier frame rate. Summarizing that \\"if you like the style of fighting that relies more on memorizing combos than hand-eye coordination and, in a way, skill, Killer Instinct II is full of that same fighting style\\", he scored it 3 out of 5 stars. In 2013, Rich Knight and Gus Turner of Complex included it on their list of 25 best 2D fighting games of all time, stating that \\"not quite as good as the first, Killer Instinct 2s greatest strength and weakness were one and the same: it played too much like Killer Instinct. ... A solid game, but not enough so to overshadow its predecessor.\\" ==References== ==External links== *Killer Instinct 2 at the Killer List of Videogames Category:1996 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Cancelled Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Killer Instinct games Category:Mortal Kombat clones Category:Rare (company) games Category:Video games about size change Category:Video games about time travel Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Grant Kirkhope Category:Video games scored by Robin Beanland Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Video games with pre-rendered 3D graphics Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Killer Instinct 2"},{"id":"1273223","text":"Reu or REU may refer to: == Places == *Reu, the local name of Retalhuleu, a city in Guatemala *reu, The ISO 3166-1 country code for R√©union *REU, The IATA code for Reus Airport in Catalonia, Spain * Mount Reu, in Antarctica ==People== * Reu, a Biblical figure * Papa Reu, a performer * Bishweshwar Nath Reu, a historian * Johann Michael Reu, a theologian ==Other uses== *RAM Expansion Unit, the Commodore 1700/1750/1764 series of memory expansion cartridges for Commodore 64/128 home computers *Plekhanov Russian Economic University, a university in Moscow, Russia *Research Experiences for Undergraduates, a U.S. National Science Foundation program for students to take part in active research *Restricted Enforcement Unit, a UK government committee which controls exports of illegal military material from the United Kingdom ","title":"Reu (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1273234","text":"Friday's Child may refer to: == Music == * Friday's Child (band), an acoustic rock band * Friday's Child (album), a 2003 album by Will Young ** \\"Friday's Child\\" (Will Young song), a 2004 single from the album * \\"Friday's Child\\", a 1965 song written by Van Morrison and recorded by Them * \\"Friday's Child\\" (1965 song), written by Lee Hazlewood and performed by Nancy Sinatra on the 1967 TV special Movin' With Nancy * \\"Friday's Child\\", a song by Bradley Joseph from the 1994 album Hear the Masses == Other == * Friday's Child (novel), a 1944 novel by Georgette Heyer * \\"Friday's Child\\" (poem), a 1958 poem by W.

Designed by the architect V√°clav Aulick√Ω and the structural engineer Ji≈ô√≠ Koz√°k, it stands high above the city's traditional skyline from its position on top of a hill in the district of ≈Ωi≈ækov, from which it takes its name. The tower is an example of high-tech architecture. ==Characteristics== The tower close up TV Tower in ≈Ωi≈ækov The technical solution itself was unique in its time and brought several innovations and even patents. About twenty different proposals have been made. Finally won in 1984 the variant of futuristic, subtle but stable, three column structure. The structure of the tower is unconventional, based on a triangle whose corners go up in steel columns, consisting of three tubes with a double steel wall, filled with concrete. They support nine 'pods' and three decks for transmitting equipment. One of the three pillars extends considerably higher than the others, and this provides both the necessary height for some antennas, along with the structure's rocket and gantry appearance. In its time it was a unique technology, which authors have patented. The tower stands 216 metres (709 feet) high, altitude of the observatory is 93 m, the hotel room altitude is 70 m, restaurants altitude is 66 m, with a capacity of 180 people. Three elevators transport passengers at a speed of 4 m/s. Three of the pods, positioned directly beneath the decks at the top of the tower, are used for equipment related to the tower's primary function and are inaccessible to the public. The remaining six pods are open to visitors, providing a panoramic view of Prague and the surrounding area. The lower three, approximately half- way up the length of the pillars at 63 metres (207 feet), house a recently refurbished restaurant and caf√© bar. Construction of the tower cost $19 million. It weighs 11,800 tons and is also used as a meteorological observatory. It is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. ==Reputation== Like many examples of communist-era architecture in Central and Eastern Europe, the TV tower used to be generally resented by the local inhabitants. It also received a spate of nicknames, mostly alluding to its rocket-like shape, like \\"Baikonur\\", after the Soviet cosmodrome or some more political, like \\"Jake≈°'s finger\\" (\\"Jake≈°≈Øv prst\\"), after the Secretary General of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. In 2009, Australian website Virtualtourist.com called ≈Ωi≈ækov TV Tower the second ugliest building in the world, behind the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre in Baltimore. On the other hand, the crawling Babies (together with the statue Piss by the same author) were published by The Guardian in 2007 as the greatest attraction of Prague. Recently, the tower's reputation among Czechs has improved. Today the tower attracts visitors with its technological innovations and view over the city skyline. Although official criticism during the time of its construction was impossible, the tower was lambasted unofficially for its 'megalomania', its 'jarring' effect on the Prague skyline and for destroying part of a centuries- old Old Jewish cemetery in ≈Ωi≈ækov situated at the tower's foundations. Burials in the cemetery ended up in 1890. In 1960 the place was converted to Mahler's park. One quarter of the cemetery was preserved, but three quarters of the cemetery tombstones were tumbled and covered with a thick layer of soil. However, the tower's foundation was simply dug up through the layer of the cemetery, tombstones were crushed by heavy equipment and the bones were carried away to landfill. ==Last changes== Detail of \\"Babies\\" on the tower The tower at night ===David ƒåern√Ω sculptures=== In 2000, ten fiberglass sculptures by Czech artist David ƒåern√Ω called \\"Miminka\\" (Babies), crawling up and down were temporarily attached to the tower's pillars. The sculptures were admired by many and were returned in 2001 as a permanent installation. Another three Babies, made from bronze, can be found in Prague's Kampa Park. For cleaning and structural checks, these Babies were removed from the tower in the fall of 2017. After examination of the condition of the sculptures was made a decision to replace them with identical duplicates. In March 2019 were installed the duplicates of the \\"Babies\\" on their original positions. The original Babies were returned to David ƒåern√Ω.Zdroj: https://www.idnes.cz/praha/zpravy/zizkovsky-vysilac-miminka-se-vraci-po- ociste-david-cerny.A190322_083008_praha-zpravy_rsr title=Horolezci instaluj√≠ na ≈æi≈ækovskou vƒõ≈æ miminka, vrac√≠ je tam po dvou letech ===Restaurant=== The restaurant 'Oblaca' features a range of international and regional cuisine.

Known as Willie K., he was a brother to Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and Consuelo Vanderbilt. Born to a life of luxury, he was raised in Vanderbilt mansions, traveled to Europe frequently, and sailed the globe on yachts owned by his father. Willie was educated by tutors and at St. Mark's School. He attended Harvard University but dropped out after two years. ==Career== While a great part of his life was filled with travel and leisure activities, Willie's father put him to work at the family's New York Central Railroad offices at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. As such, in 1905 he joined other Vanderbilts on Fifth Avenue, building a townhouse at number 666. Already extremely wealthy from a trust fund and from his income as president of the New York Central Railroad Company, on his father's death in 1920 Willie inherited a multimillion-dollar fortune. ===Military service=== On May 9, 1917, Vanderbilt went into active service in the Navy as a lieutenant (junior grade) in command of USS Tarantula (SP-124) at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Tarantula was a yacht owned by Vanderbilt which he has leased to the Navy for the duration of the war. He was assigned to patrol duty in the waters of the 3rd Naval District and performed convoy escorts in the waters off New York and New Jersey. On October 1, 1917, he was released from active duty and given a temporary leave of absence to resume his duties of vice-president of the New York Central Railroad. A few months later, he was elected president of the New York Central Railroad and acted in this capacity for the remainder of the war.Harvard's Military Record in the World War. pg. 983. After the war, Vanderbilt was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve on May 17, 1921.Register of Commissioned Officers of the U.S. Naval Reserve. July 1, 1939. pg. 3. He remained in the Naval Reserve until he was transferred to the Honorary Retired List on January 1, 1941, for physical disability.Register of Commissioned Officers of the U.S. Naval Reserve. July 1, 1941. pg. 488. ===Life as an heir=== Although he developed an interest in horse racing and yachting, he was particularly fascinated with automobiles. At age 10, during a stay in the south of France he had ridden in a steam-powered tricycle from Beaulieu-sur-Mer the 7 kilometers to Monte Carlo and as a twenty-year-old, in 1898 he ordered a French De Dion-Bouton motor tricycle and had it shipped to New York. Soon, he acquired other motorized vehicles and before long began to infuriate citizens and officials alike as he sped through the towns and villages of Long Island, New York, en route to Idle Hour, his parents' summer estate at Oakdale. A skilled sailor, he participated in yacht racing, winning the Sir Thomas Lipton Cup in 1900 with his new yacht he had named Virginia in honor of his new bride. In 1902, Vanderbilt began construction on his own country place at Lake Success on Long Island that he named \\"Deepdale.\\" However, sailing would take second place to his enthusiasm for fast cars. In 1904, Willie set a new land speed record of in a Mercedes at the Daytona Beach Road Course at Ormond Beach, Florida. That same year, he launched the Vanderbilt Cup, the first major trophy in American auto racing. An international event, designed to spur American manufacturers into racing, the race's large cash prize drew the top drivers and their vehicles from across the Atlantic Ocean who had competed in Europe's Gordon Bennett Cup. Held at a course set out in Nassau County on Long Island, New York, the race drew large crowds hoping to see an American car defeat the mighty European vehicles. However, a French Panhard vehicle won the race and fans would have to wait until 1908 when 23-year-old George Robertson of Garden City, New York, became the first American to win the Vanderbilt Cup. Vanderbilt and his powerful Mercedes at Daytona (1904). Courtesy Florida Photographic Collection The Vanderbilt Cup auto races repeatedly had crowd control problems and at the 1906 race a spectator was killed. Seeing the potential to solve the safety issue as well as improve attendance to his race, Willie formed a corporation to build the Long Island Motor Parkway, one of the country's first modern paved parkways that could not only be used for the race but would open up Long Island for easy access and economic development. Construction began in 1907 of the multimillion-dollar toll highway that was to run from the Kissena Corridor in Queens County over numerous bridges and overpasses to Lake Ronkonkoma, a distance of . However, the toll road was never able to generate sustainable profits and in 1938 it was formally ceded to the county governments in lieu of the $80,000 due in back taxes. His new high-speed road complemented a train service that allowed a rapid exit from Manhattan. Becoming the first suburban automobile commuter, in 1910 Willie began work on the much more elaborate and costly \\"Eagle's Nest\\" estate at Centerport, Long Island. An avid collector of natural history and marine specimens as well as other anthropological objects, he traveled extensively aboard his yacht as well as overland to numerous destinations around the globe. He acquired a vast array of artifacts for his collection during his well-documented travels and after service with the United States Navy during World War I, he published a book titled \\"A Trip Through Sicily, Tunisia, Algeria, and Southern France.\\" A few years later, he engaged William Belanske, an artist from the American Museum of Natural History to participate with him in a scientific voyage to the Galapagos Islands. By 1922, Vanderbilt had commissioned the construction of a single- story building on his Long Island estate to serve as a public museum, and less than a decade later a second story was added on to accommodate the growing collection.https://www.vanderbiltmuseum.org/about-us/history/ William Belanske, who had accompanied Vanderbilt on his Galapagos voyage, was employed as the full-time curator of this museum.https://www.vanderbiltmuseum.org/exhibit-opens-artist-curator-william- belanske/ ===Residences=== In 1925, he traded the luxury yacht Eagle for ownership of Fisher Island, Florida, a place he used as a winter residence.Fisher, Lionel L. Fisher Island. Fisher Island, FL: Island Developers, 1994. p. 18. He built a mansion complete with docking facilities for his yacht, a seaplane hangar, tennis courts, swimming pool, and an eleven- hole golf course. This home was called Alva Base and the architect was Maurice Fatio.Mockler, Kim. Maurice Fatio: Palm Beach Architect. New York: Acanthus Press, 2010. . p. 196. In addition to this property, and his Long Island estate, Vanderbilt also owned a farm in Tennessee and Kedgwick Lodge, a hunting lodge designed for his father by architect Stanford White, on the Restigouche River in New Brunswick, Canada. ==Personal life== In 1899, Vanderbilt married Virginia Graham Fair (1875‚Äì1935), a wealthy heiress whose father, James Graham Fair, had made a fortune in mining the famous Comstock Lode. They spent their honeymoon at the Idle Hour estate but disaster struck when fire broke out and the mansion burned to the ground. Before their separation and divorce, Vanderbilt and his wife had a son and two daughters, the younger of whom was named for his sister: * Muriel Vanderbilt (1900‚Äì1972), who married three times, the first in 1925 to Frederic Cameron Church, Jr. She later married Henry Delafield Phelps and John Payson Adams. * Consuelo Vanderbilt (1903‚Äì2011), who married Noble Clarkson Earl (1900‚Äì1969) * William Kissam Vanderbilt III (1907‚Äì1933), who inherited his father's love of fast cars and exotic travel, was killed in an automobile accident in South Carolina while driving home to New York City from his father's Florida estate. The Vanderbilts separated after ten years of marriage but did not formally divorce until 1927 when he wanted to remarry. Divorce proceedings were handled by his New York lawyers while he and Rosamund Lancaster Warburton (1897‚Äì1947), a former wife of Barclay Harding Warburton II, an heir to the John Wanamaker department store fortune, waited discreetly away from the media at a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy, France. When the divorce was final, the couple were married at the Hotel de Ville (city hall) in Paris on September 5, 1927. Vanderbilt became a legal stepfather to Barclay Harding Warburton III once they wed. Vanderbilt died on January 8, 1944 of a heart ailment. He was interred in the family mausoleum at the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island, New York. ===Legacy=== In 1931, Vanderbilt had the Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel, Germany, build for him the 264-foot diesel yacht Alva. The Alva was donated by Vanderbilt to the U.S. Navy on November 4, 1941. The Alva was converted to a gunboat and commissioned as the USS Plymouth (PG-57) on December 29, 1941. The Plymouth was primarily employed as a convoy escort on the East Coast and in the Caribbean and was sunk by a torpedo from a German U-boat on August 5, 1943 at 21.39 with the loss of 95. By the 1940s, Vanderbilt had organized his will so that, upon his death, the Eagle's Nest property along with a $2 million upkeep fund would be given to Suffolk County, New York to serve as a public museum. Since 1950, the site has operated as the Suffolk County Vanderbilt Museum.https://www.vanderbiltmuseum.org/about- us/history/ ==References== == External links == * William K.

Designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a self-taught designer, and Jens Sch√∂nfeld from Individual Computers, who manufactured the boards themselves, the C-One has been re-engineered to allow cloning of other 8-bit computers. ==Design== The machine uses a combination of configurable Altera field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips and modular CPU expansion cards to create compatibility modes that duplicate the function of many older home computers. The default CPU is the W65C816S (by Western Design Center) which is used in Commodore 64 compatibility mode as well as the C-One's native operating mode. The C-One is not merely a software emulator, it loads various core files from a card to configure the FPGA hardware to recreate the operation of the core logic chipsets found in vintage computers. This provides for a very accurate and customizable hardware emulation platform. The C-One is not limited to recreating historical computers: its programmable core logic can be used to create entirely new custom computer designs. In 2004, the platform was expanded to include an Amstrad CPC core made by Tobias Gubener. In 2006, Peter Wendrich ported his FPGA-64 project (originally intended for a Xilinx FPGA) and enhanced it for the C-One. This core supported both PAL and NTSC machine emulation, and aimed to be cycle-exact and emulate many of the bugs and quirks of the original hardware. In 2008, after development of an \\"Extender\\" card which added a third FPGA, Tobias Gubener added Amiga 500 compatibility by porting Dennis van Weeren's Minimig code to the board. This core replaced the physical 68000 CPU and the PIC chip from the original with his own TG68 CPU core on the FPGA. developments to this core include features not possible with the original Minimig board. In 2009, Peter Wendrich released a \\"preview\\" of a next-generation C64 core called \\"Chameleon 64\\", with a greatly expanded specification compared to his earlier core. A new version of the CPC core was also released in mid-2009, featuring an embedded SymbOS core for control of device emulation, and a clock unlocked mode for CPU speeds of up to 80 MHz.

Ousterhout is a retired craniofacial surgeon who practiced in San Francisco, CA, United States. His specialty was facial feminization surgery for trans women, and he was widely considered the foremost facial feminization surgeon in the United States. Ousterhout also pioneered facial masculinization surgery for people undergoing female-to-male gender reassignment. Ousterhout received MD and DDS degrees from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. He is a voluntary clinical professor of surgery in the School of Medicine and an adjunct professor of dentistry in the Dental School at University of California, San Francisco. Facial feminization surgery (FFS) began in 1982 when Darrell Pratt, a plastic surgeon who performed sex reassignment surgeries, approached Ousterhout with a request from a trans woman, a patient of Pratt's who wanted plastic surgery to make her face appear more feminine, since people still reacted to her as though she were a man. Ousterhout's prior practice had involved reconstructing faces and skulls of people who had suffered birth defects, accidents or other trauma. Ousterhout was interested in helping but knew that he didn't know what a \\"female face\\" was, so he investigated by first reading the physical anthropology from the early 20th century to identify what features were \\"female\\", then by deriving measurements defining those features from a series of cephalograms taken in the 1970s, and then by working with a set of several hundred skulls to see if he could reliably differentiate which were females and which were males using those measurements. Ousterhout then began working out what surgical techniques and materials he already used that he could apply in order to transform a male face into a female face; he pioneered most of the procedures involved in FFS and was involved in their subsequent improvements as well. FFS generally involves advancing the hairline, making the forehead smaller and rounder, reducing the brow ridge, shortening and narrowing the nose, shortening the upper lip, shortening the chin, narrowing the jaw, and reducing the laryngeal prominence. As of 2006 there were only about twelve surgeons in the world performing FFS. Notable Ousterhout patients who have written about their surgery include Lynn Conway, Andrea James, and Nicole Hamilton. == Wine == Ousterhout and wife Nancy also own and manage Ousterhout Wine and Vineyards. Wine & Spirits website featured their 2012 Zinfandel as part of National Zinfandel Day in 2015 and their 2011 Zinfandel as part of the 2014 California Wine Month celebration. == Personal life == Ousterhout lived in the Mrs. Doubtfire home, which he bought in 1997. The title character in the movie, played by Robin Williams, is a divorced man who pretends to be an older female nanny so he can be around his children. Ousterhout briefly knew Williams and liked the connection, explaining, \\"I turn boys' faces into girls' faces. It seemed only natural.\\" In 2015, a disgruntled former patient tried to set the front door on fire. ==See also== *Jordan Deschamps-Braly == Publications == * == References == == External links == Category:Living people Category:American plastic surgeons Category:Surgeons specializing in transgender medicine Category:University of Michigan Medical School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Douglas Ousterhout"},{"id":"1273260","text":"Chapter II is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Ashanti. It was released by Murder Inc. and Island Def Jam on July 1, 2003 in the United States. Ashanti reteamed with Murder Inc. head Irv Gotti and producer Chink Santana to work on the album. Chapter II features a guest appearance by rapper Ja Rule, Chink Santana, and Gunnz. Critical reception towards the album was generally mixed, with critics commending the album's autobiographical lyrics, and its fun yet light nature, while other critics felt Chapter II lacked creativity and personality and relied too heavily on the formula of her debut album (2002). Upon its release, the album debut at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 326,000 units. It also reached the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Chapter II was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 2003 and gained gold status in Japan and the United Kingdom. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, it earned Ashanti three nominations for Best Contemporary R&B; Album, Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance, and Best R&B; Song. Chapter II spawned three singles, including the Billboard Hot 100 number two song \\"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\\", the R&B; ballad \\"Rain on Me\\" and \\"Breakup 2 Makeup (Remix)\\". == Promotion == Murder Inc. selected \\"Rock wit U (Awww Baby),\\" which they considered a continuation from her debut single \\"Foolish\\" (2002), to be released as the album's first single from Chapter 2. Issued on May 13, 2003, the song became a commercial success stateside and Ashanti's third solo top ten hit. It peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching number four on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, it was a moderate success, reaching the top five in Canada and Japan, the top ten in the United Kingdom, top twenty in Australia, and the top forty in Ireland, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The album's second single \\"Rain on Me\\", was released on August 19, 2003. It peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Elsewhere, it reached the top twenty in Belgium and the United Kingdom. In 2004, \\"Rain on Me\\" earned Ashanti a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance. On January 16, 2004, a remix version of \\"Breakup 2 Makeup\\" featuring labelmate Black Child was released as a single. It served as the lead single from Ashanti's remix compilation album Collectables by Ashanti, released in 2005, reaching number 76 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. == Critical reception == Chapter II received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 51, based on 11 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh remarked that Chapter II \\"isn't perfect, but once you edit out the skits (which are, without exception, excruciating), you're left with an album that's graceful, beguiling and above all, light, in the best sense of the word.\\" People magazine noted that \\"the singer's sophomore CD, though, proves wrong those who thought she would be a one-hit-album wonder. Chapter II, which continues the same hip-hop soul theme as her self-titled debut, is the equivalent of a good beach read: It's easy, breezy listening that doesn't require much brainpower.\\" Billboard wrote that Chapter II \\"doesn't stray too far from its predecessor\\" and complimented the autobiographical songs on the album. Ernest Hardy from Rolling Stone found that the \\"album is filled with the same beat-driven, slickly produced midtempo tracks and ballads that made up her debut [and] the disc's best moments have a decidedly old-school feel to them [...] Still, dullard schoolgirl insights into love and heartache dominate the album; add some boring between-song skits about 'haters,' and Chapter II wears thin long before its halfway mark.\\" While he complimented Ashanti for her writing credits on the album, Entertainment Weekly journalist Tom Sinclair felt that \\"Chapter II is too mired in tired R&B; conventions to achieve true magnificence.\\" Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that \\"the songs have about as much personality as Ashanti's voice, but that actually is a point in its favor, since it keeps everything on an even keel and makes Gotti and Santana's stylish production the star. They are the secret ingredients that make Chapter II good romantic mood music for the summer.\\" Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine wrote that \\"the album's got some great tunes, but they‚Äôd be better suited for someone like Mary J. Blige, whom Shany & Co. bite off.\\" Robert Christgau gave Chapter II a \\"C\\" rating in his review for The Village Voice, calling it a \\"pathologically modest follow-up.\\" PopMatters from Maurice Bottomley assured that \\"Chapter 2 is not going to feature as any scribe's R&B; album of the year.\\" == Commercial performance == In the United States, Chapter II debuted at number one the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 units sold. In addition, it reached the top position on Billboards Top R&B;/Hip Hop Albums chart. While it became Ashanti's second chart topper on both charts, it was a considerable decline from her previous effort Ashanti, which had opened to sales of 502,000 units in 2002. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on August 14, 2003, and remained on the Billboard 200 for 30 consecutive weeks. Chapter II has sold 1.5 million copies in the United States alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Billboard ranked the album 54th on its Billboard 200 and 27th on its Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums year end listings in 2003, respectively. Elsewhere, Chapter II reached the top five of the Canadian and UK Singles Chart. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), indicating sales in excess of 100,000 copies, and also went gold in Japan. In Switzerland, it reached the top ten, debuting and peaking at number nine on the Swiss Albums Chart, making it Ashanti's highest-charting album to date. Chapter II also entered the top 20 in Australia and Germany.

(stylised as W.i.t.c.h.) is an Italian fantasy comics series written by Elisabetta Gnone, Alessandro Barbucci, and Barbara Canepa. The series was first published by Disney Italy in April 2001 before the series was released in other countries. As of January 2005, W.I.T.C.H. has been released in over 65 countries. The final issue of W.I.T.C.H. was released in October 2012, concluding the series' 139 issue run. It is about a group of girls who find out they are the new guardians of the elements of Water, Fire, Earth, Air and Energy. The comics are drawn in line with manga conventions. They were subsequently adapted into an animated series, itself taking visual cues from anime. The series tells the story of five teenage girls who are chosen to be the new Guardians of Kandrakar,Alternate spellings have been used in various regions, as well as for the TV series; see that page for further information on these changes. protectors of the center of the universe from people and creatures who wish to cause harm to it. For this purpose, magical powers over the five classical elements have been given to them. The new guardians are Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin, whose initials form the title acronym \\"W.I.T.C.H.\\". In 2004, series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to W.I.T.C.H. after issues with management at the publishing company. As a result, Canepa founded her own comics company. ==Background and production== Upon seeing the success of PKNA - Paperinik New Adventures with young male audiences, some of the same writers began thinking of a concept that would work for young female audiences. Elisabetta Gnone, Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa came up with the original concepts and designs. Gnone co-wrote the first issue of the series with Francesco Artibani. Gnone and Artibani originally created a concept that would last nine issues, but upon seeing the impressive sales numbers, a further three issues were ordered, rounding out the 12-issue first saga. In 2004, tensions arose between the W.I.T.C.H. artists and Disney's publishing (Buena Vista). Series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to W.I.T.C.H., and Francesco Artibani was a witness in support of the two artists in court. After the lawsuit failed, Artibani and other artists decided to end their working relationships with Disney due to the \\"difficult management and company.\\"https://antoniogenna.com/2013/03/25/disney-in-edicola-14-speciale-la- chiusura-di-w-i-t-c-h-con-interviste-a-francesco-artibani-e-teresa-radice/ Around the same time, Disney filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit against Rainbow SpA, the studio behind Winx Club (a series cited as the main competition for W.I.T.C.H.). In its April 2004 suit, the corporation claimed the Winx Club concept copied that of W.I.T.C.H.; all of their claims were rejected in August, and Rainbow SpA won the case against Disney as they provided proof that the Winx Club production began before the W.I.T.C.H. comic was available. After breaking off with Buena Vista and in the middle of her trial against them, Barbara Canepa created her own comic book company, Sky Doll. She described it as a way to become \\"more sincere and uncensored\\" with her comics. Sky Doll was unable to secure the rights to W.I.T.C.H. from Disney so instead focused on original projects.https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult- announcements/article/14783-french-publisher-soleil-finds-success-at- marvel.html Canepa stated that she intends to keep all the rights to her comics; she said, \\"After my experience with Disney, it's important for me to protect myself.\\" ==Comics== === Part I: The Twelve Portals === The first saga introduced a world called Metamoor, ruled by a tyrannical ruler named Prince Phobos. Years ago, Prince Phobos caused the disappearances of his parents and took over the capital city, Meridian. To prevent his spreading tyranny, the Oracle lowered a veil over the planet, separating Metamoor from the rest of the worlds under Kandrakar's protection. However, twelve portals opened between Meridian and Earth, creating a series of passageways for the desperate refugees and monsters of Meridian to infiltrate Earth. The portals also weaken the veil and in order to prevent this, generations of Guardians were sent to protect it from collapsing. In the present day, five girls are chosen to become the new Guardians: Will Vandom, the Guardian of Energy and the Keeper of the Heart, making her the leader; Irma Lair, the new Guardian of Water; Taranee Cook, the Guardian of Fire; Cornelia Hale, the Guardian of Earth; and Hay Lin, the Guardian of Air. Together, they must prevent the collapse of the veil and promote justice throughout the universe under the guidance of the Oracle of Kandrakar. The first saga also introduced Elyon Brown, a childhood friend of Cornelia. The Guardians' first mission was to close the twelve portals, but as they found out for themselves, Elyon had betrayed them. It is revealed that Elyon is Prince Phobos's younger sister who had disappeared from Meridian more than a decade ago. After Prince Phobos's right-hand man, Lord Cedric, revealed Elyon of her true alien heritage, he manipulated her into thinking that the Guardians were her enemies. The Guardians had to find a way to defeat Prince Phobos and bring Elyon back home. In Meridian, however, there is a rebellion taking place led by Caleb, whom Cornelia had seen in her dreams for years. They sought to overthrow Prince Phobos and put Elyon on the throne, as she is the legitimate ruler. The Guardians later worked together with the rebels and eventually, Elyon realized her mistake for trusting Lord Cedric. Prince Phobos had planned to absorb his sister's powers for himself during her coronation, but with the Guardians' help Elyon escaped and later battled against him for the crown. The final battle was successful, but not without some losses. Prince Phobos transformed Caleb back into a crystal flower, his most primitive form as a Murmurer. This devastated Cornelia greatly to the point where it would haunt her in the next series. As Elyon is crowned Queen and the Light of Meridian, the world of Metamoor is finally liberated. The Oracle lifted the veil off of Metamoor and light shines on the world once again. Both Prince Phobos and Cedric are imprisoned in the Tower of Mist. === Part II: Nerissa's Revenge === The Guardians must face an old enemy of Kandrakar ‚Äì Nerissa, the corrupted ex-Guardian and the previous Keeper of the Heart. When the Oracle realized how the immense power of the Heart was corrupting Nerissa, he took it away from her and gave it to Cassidy, the former Guardian of Water. Obsessed with her lost power and blinded by jealousy, Nerissa tricked Cassidy and killed her. As punishment, Nerissa was stripped of her magic and sentenced to sleep, alone and friendless, in Mount Thanos for an eternity, only until all five elements-Water, Fire, Earth, Air and Pure/Absolute Energy- united into one single being. When Cornelia accidentally, and unknowingly, absorbed all five elements into herself, the seal on Nerissa's tomb broke, setting her free. When Caleb is kidnapped, the Guardians must face Nerissa along with her four Knights of Vengeance. While successful in their rescue mission, they end up losing Luba who sacrificed herself to save them. Hoping to steal the Heart she craved for so long, Nerissa later attacked the girls through their dreams in order to weaken them but failed. She was later successful in stealing the Heart back by tricking Will into giving it to her. With the very symbol and essence of Kandrakar itself now entirely corrupted by Nerissa's hatred and vengeance, the former Guardian leader and her Knights of Vengeance attacked the sacred Temple of Kandrakar itself. Will later acquired the Star of Cassidy, a copy of the mystical Heart from the spirit/ghost of Cassidy, the late and original Guardian of Water. With it, Will and her fellow Guardians faced Nerissa in Kandrakar. In the final battle, Nerissa was ultimately destroyed by the combined strength of the second generation of Guardians. Despite their victory, Cornelia is deeply heartbroken when Caleb left her due to their complicated relationship. === Part III: A Crisis on Both Worlds === Crisis after crisis threatens to break up the girls once and for all. Will's father, Thomas Vandom, returns into her life after years of absence, and his intentions are anything but loving and trustful. Later, Taranee went on strike because she felt that the Oracle is using them to carry out his missions and sentences. A new character, Orube, joins the remaining Guardians on their new mission to defeat a new enemy; Ari, the powerful lord of Arkhanta and they must prevent him from rising and destroying the Oracle. Ari's son, Maqi, suffered from a strange disorder since birth and the Oracle had refused to help Ari cure his son. Angered and blinded by rage, Ari captured a banshee, named Yua, and tried to use her wish-granting power to oppose the Oracle and Kandrakar (but it could not be done). The longer Yua was held prisoner and serving as Ari's slave, the more powerful Ari becomes, and soon, he would have enough power to overthrow the Oracle. Taranee later rejoined the quintet and together, they were able to defeat Ari and set Yua free. Liberated, Yua kidnapped Maqi because she wanted Ari to suffer for holding her imprisoned for many years against her will. Ari and the Guardians followed her into the swamp where she and her banshee sisters live and fought them to bring Maqi back. However, Maqi was nearly killed during the confusion of the battle. He was later saved and cured when the Guardians and Orube offered their magical, elemental gifts from the nymph Xin Jing herself to him. Although their missions on the world Arkhanta was successful, the girls have a whole bunch of new problems on Earth that needs their attention: Interpol discovers the secret of the five Guardians' and wants to capture them and use their astounding abilities as Guardians of Kandrakar for their dark intentions. As if that was not enough, the girls' Astral Drops decide to rebel after months of being taken advantage of by the Guardians. The Astral Drops started to cause numerous problems between the Guardians' families, teachers, and individual boyfriends' and eventually they ran away to another city. The Guardians later recaptured the Astral Drops and decided to liberate them from slavery by sending to another city entirely. === Part IV: Trial of the Oracle === The members of the Congregation are questioning the Oracle's recent actions, and he shocked everyone by putting himself on trial. The Guardians are called in to recall his recent unsatisfactory deeds and he was later found guilty by Endarno and was banished back into his home world, Basil√≠ade. Back home in Heatherfield, Will confronted Orube and Matt, while Principal Knickerbocker goes to drastic measures to raise the girls' grades at Sheffield. In Kandrakar, the Council has elected Endarno the new Oracle. After Endarno has been chosen, he makes the life of the Guardians difficult by trying to prove to the Congregation that they are too young and immature. He also convinced the Congregation that Elyon, the queen and the Light of Meridian, is dangerous and unfit to rule over Metamoor. Many times he tried to get the Guardians to arrest their old friend and bring him the Crown of Light. But W.I.T.C.H. managed to hide Elyon from Endarno by smuggling her back to Earth and had Orube protect her. Moreover, Endarno is someone else than he appears to be...an old enemy coming back for revenge and an even bigger thirst for more power. Elyon and Yan Lin discovered that \\"Endarno\\" is actually the consciousness and evil will of Prince Phobos, who has been using the physical self of the true Endarno, in his new quest for power and revenge. Queen Elyon then wields her vital life energy to Yan Lin, who then gives it to Will to hide within the Heart of Kandrakar for safeguarding. The Guardians were able locate the old Oracle, now called Himerish, upon the discovery of his old identity before leaving for Kandrakar, with the help of Orube. Together, they tried to free Elyon from her prison and put a stop to Cedric and Phobos before Endarno (Phobos) is formally instated as the Oracle. In the end, Himerish was able to locate the real Endarno and he, in turn, revealed to the Council that the Endarno that they knew was, in actuality, the malicious Prince Phobos' mind and spirit in his body. Elyon returned to power on her world of Meridian, Cedric was back in the Tower of Mist, and Prince Phobos, rather than being locked up in prison again, threw himself into the endless void of Kandrakar. === Part V: The Book of Elements=== The five classical elements themselves have something in store for the Guardians who utilize and represent them. Each Guardian has discovered new and much stronger abilities, yet their elemental abilities are going out of control. Even the Triumvirate of Kandrakar does not have full understanding about it. At the same time, Cedric is disposed of his magical strength and power and gets a second chance from Oracle Himerish. He returns to \\"Ye Olde Book Shop\\" to live a decent life, under supervision from the Guardians. Nevertheless, he searches for a useful resource to regain his powers in hopes of getting revenge on the Guardians. He finds his luck in the Book of Elements, written by Jonathan Ludmoore (which the Guardians later found out). About a century before, Jonathan Ludmoore was an alchemist who came from Metamoor and it was Prince Phobos who had sent him to Heatherfield in order to open the Twelve Portals. After completing his mission, Ludmoore discovered that the city is a place where all five elements‚ÄîWater, Fire, Earth, Air, Quintessence‚Äîmet and stayed. He experimented on the elements but it trapped Ludmoore in his own book and released all five elemental stones throughout the city. After Matt was swallowed by the Book of Elements (thanks to Cedric), the Guardians must cooperate with Cedric in order to save Matt. The book gives them riddles as clues and the Guardians must used these riddles to look for the scattered elemental stones. Endarno warned the Guardians that in order to capture these stones, they must face the Elemental Guards that stand and protect them. One by one, the girls were able to find the stones, and back in the bookstore, Cedric and Orube slowly fell deeply in love. However, the Guardians, Cedric, and Orube were sucked into the world of the book when Will refuses to surrender the Heart of Kandrakar. Cedric was later killed by Ludmoore and dissolved into ink when he tried to protect Orube from Ludmoore's deadly gaze. The Guardians later found Matt and managed to defeat Ludmoore once and for all (with Matt's help). While Orube mourns for Cedric's death Will's mother, Susan Vandom, married her history teacher, Dean Collins. Orube left and a magical portal in the shape of the Heart of Kandrakar later appeared in the basement of the \\"Ye Olde Book Shop\\". === Part VI: Ragorlang === When Hay Lin stayed over at the Lyndons' home, she meets Karl and Tecla Ibsen, an elderly couple who appeared to have a connection with Eric's new school. Karl tells Hay Lin about the Ragorlang, a monster that absorbs the thoughts, the voices, and the sounds of its victims. Coincidentally, a few students at Eric's school are getting inactive as if they had lost their youthful strength. The same evening, Hay Lin gets attacked by a Ragorlang and was saved just in time by the other Guardians. Soon they discover who's behind the new threat: Tecla Ibsen. She wanted to be young and beautiful again and used her magical ability to conjure up and control the Ragorlangs, ordering them to steal the youthful strength of the teenagers by absorbing their thoughts and voices. The Guardians managed to defeat her and her Ragorlang. Unfortunately, Tecla returns, but as a frail, older woman, who can't summon a fully grown Ragorlang. Tecla brainwashed a magical girl named Erin, making her believe that the Guardians are the Ragorlangs and that it was their fault that her brother, Kader, went missing. At first, Erin uses her magic to make the girls hate each other while posing as an exchange student. The Guardians eventually helped her find her brother despite their hate for her. This saga also introduced a strange optometrist, named Folkner, who stationed himself in Sheffield to monitor the students' health. The Guardians found out that he's a Ragorlang hunter who wishes to hunt down Tecla Ibsen. She later regain full power due to leaked magics from Kandrakar and attacked the Guardians with a new pact of Ragorlangs. Despite being able to use the Shadow Heart against the Guardians, she was defeated when the last of her Ragorlangs was absorbed into a box created by Folkner. Obsessed with the dark power, Folkner unleashed the powers and became a supreme Ragorlang himself. He was later killed by the Guardians and was sucked into his own Ragorlang box at the end of the saga, and Karl and Tecla were both accepted into the Congregation of Kandrakar after admitting their mistakes. === Part VII: New Power === The Guardians must face another, more ancient enemy: Dark Mother! She was once Queen Meter of Spring and made flowers bloom beneath her feet. But when she became corrupted, she transformed into \\"the Dark Mother\\" and attacked Kandrakar with a vengeance. She was ultimately defeated by the combined strength of the elemental Queens of Water, Fire and Air and was cast into the dark void where she continued to wait patiently in chains until she could be released. In silence, Dark Mother sent a seed and planted it deep within kandrakar, where it would serve as her infiltrator against the Fortress of Light. The five Guardians of Kandrakar each receive further developed and considerably stronger Guardian powers over the five elements upon undergoing a vision-quest to unlock the very roots of their abilities as well as their highest potential. Matt now serves as their new trainer and mentor after being recruited by the Oracle to prepare them for their upcoming battle against Dark Mother. One by one, the Guardians found the root of their elements and obtained full control over their new and much stronger abilities. Meanwhile, Dark Mother escaped (thanks to Will) and set off to take over Kandrakar. Thanks to her tree, which she had planted beforehand, Dark Mother enslaved the minds of Kandrakar, except for Yan Lin. The Guardians later faced her in one last battle and Dark Mother was sealed in a stone tomb. Oracle Himerish relinquished his place to the original Guardian of Air, Yan Lin, who foresaw the incoming threat and departed without even saying goodbye. In the side story, Susan became pregnant to Dean's child. Issue #80 focuses on the birth of Will's step-brother, William Vandom-Collins. === Part VIII: Teach 2b Witch === The Guardians must find and teach the magical people of Heatherfield how to fully control their new abilities. Oracle Yan Lin assisted them by giving them new weapons to help greatly strengthen and magnify their powers and abilities as well as the key to the W.I.T.C.H. Van, a special on-the-road-school which houses five magical laboratories connected to each Guardians' elements, personalities, and skills. Kandor, a member of the Congregation is sent to be their new bus driver and care-taker. Meanwhile, a new enemy is watching their every move: Foreman Takeda the CEO and scientist of Takeshita Inc. Takeda vowed to destroy all magic because he believed that it is responsible for his daughter's illness. Mariko, his eldest daughter, discovered the Fast World and her mind now trapped there. Takeda enlisted the help of Liam, a mysterious boy that Mariko met in the Fast World and they fell in love, to spy on the Guardians and ordered him to kidnap Will's little brother. Using Liam and William as bait, Takeda lured the Guardians into his lair and used his cold technologies to trap the Guardians into the 'Fast World forever'. However, his plan was thwarted by his youngest daughter, Shinobu, who saw her father's cruelty and had him frozen by his own robotic minions. While looking for Liam and William in the Fast World, the Guardians encounter the malicious ruler Arkaam, the White Queen, who wished to rule all of the Fast World under her tyranny and possessed a deep desire to kill the Black Queen. It is revealed that the identity of the Black Queen is Mariko's conscious and Shinobu's sister. In the confusing of their escape, Liam was killed by the White Queen after she stabbed him with her sword. Although successful in bringing William back, Will and her friends are horrified that the White Queen and her army had followed them to their world. In their last battle, invading White Queen and her army were dissipated by the Guardians' powerful sound frequency. After hearing Mariko's accusation and Shinobu's forgiveness, Takeda forgot his vendetta and rejoined his family. * Beginning from issue #97 onward, most W.I.T.C.H. comic issue is its own story. === Part IX: 100% Witch === Starting from issue #97 of the previous saga, each issue has its own story. The Guardians now face their daily problems from families, friends, and school. The stories ranged from facing their first day of returning to Sheffield Institute to finding out more about both of their parents' pasts and abilities. At the same time, they must face several new enemies who wanted to destroy them. Many of these villains included the Runics, a group of five evil wizards who control the dark powers of the elements; and Nihila, the Queen of Darkness who desire to weave and control everyone's destinies with her magical Loom. The series also introduced new missions where the Guardians must assist the beings of the natural worlds; from listening to the voice of the Earth to helping Mareeve, the Saarineen, avoid marrying the King of the Sharks, Orristurr. Later on, the stories ranged from the girls delivering a letter to the North Pole, Dean's parents visiting to the girls and their mothers having lunch together. === Part X: Ladies vs. W.I.T.C.H. === From issue number 118 the concept of arcs is dropped. All stories are one of themselves, while Issue 120, 123, and 126 are connected to each other, as The Guardians deals with siblings Lady Giga, Lady Crash and Lady Kimikal, who wanted to stole their energies. Issues 128 and 129 are also connected as it focuses on Will and Matt's fight. === Part XI: Magical Sovereigns === From issue 130 through issue 139, the saga has been named the \\"Magical Sovereigns\\", with individual stories. Elyon the Queen of Meridian returns to Kandakar in this saga, giving away missions to the Guardians in order for them to become Magical Sovereigns. Oracle Himerish also returns at Issue 139. === Special issues === Aside from the original series, the Walt Disney Company Italia had published several special issues depicting the lives of the Guardians and their friends taking places on the side lines from the original canon issues.

The Aurameres grant the same powers to each of their guardians; for instance, powers held by Irma would also have been possessed by Cassidy. When the Guardians transform, they change form and grow wings. The wings don't allow them to fly, except after they get the New Powers. Teleportation (renamed to Teletransportation in the animated show's second season) can be performed from one spot to another on Earth as well as teletransporting from world to world via long-distance. * Irma and Cassidy control and manipulate the element of Water * Taranee and Halinor control and manipulate the element of Fire * Cornelia and Kadma control and manipulate the element of Earth * Hay Lin and Yan Lin control and manipulate the element of Air * Will and Nerissa control and manipulate the element of Energy (replaced by Aether/Quintessence in TV show) == Setting == === Heatherfield === Located on Earth, this city is the home of the five Guardians. ===Kandrakar=== A sacred, ethereal, spiritual world in the very center of the entire universe itself, where time and space do not exist.

The fifth and last Guardian is rightful Keeper of the mystical Heart of Candracar, an ancient and immensely powerful crystal orbicular pendant which gives the girls' their ability to transform into their taller, stronger and more elaborate Guardian costumes. Hay Lin's paternal grandmother lives here with the Oracle when she \\"dies\\" unexpectedly on Earth. === Metamoor === Metamoor is a world ruled by the Escanor, who originates from Earth. For a long time Metamoor, and its capital Meridian, was isolated from the rest of the universe because it was ruled by the evil prince Phobos. With help of the Guardians and the Meridian people the rightful heiress to the throne, Elyon, could reign again. Elyon is the last of the Escanor. === Arkhanta === Arkhanta is an Earth-like world ruled by Ari. Ari accused the Oracle for not wanting to cure his son. Even the banshee Yua was unable to help him. With trickery, Ari could keep Yua in his scarlet citadel forever. Despite all this, Ari brought prosperity to his people. Knowing they had received everything thanks to the powers of Yua, the people are both happy and disturbed. Fortunately, after the Guardians released Yua and healed Ari's son Maqui, any threat of Yua's anger was over. On his turn Ari ended his hostility against Kandrakar. ===Basil√≠ade=== Basiliade is the home world of the Oracle (Himerish), Endarno, and Orube.

He received the first quarter of his inheritance at 21, then 25, 30, and the last at 35. His mother, Margaret, remarried two more times, first to Raymond T. Baker, with whom she had a daughter, Gloria Baker (1920‚Äì1975), and second, to Charles Minot Amory. He was a grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt II and Alice Claypoole Gwynne and was named in honor of his great-great-uncle George Washington Vanderbilt and his great-uncle George Washington Vanderbilt II. Vanderbilt's maternal grandfather, Isaac Edward Emerson, was a very wealthy businessman who made a fortune in a variety of business ventures including patent medicines, the most notable of which was Bromo-Seltzer. A sailing enthusiast, Emerson instilled a love for the sport in young George from an early age and as an adult, he used his sailing skills and wealth for scientific research. He attended the St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire and the Adirondack- Florida School studying at the Saranac branch in New York as well as in Miami. ==Career== In 1936 and 1937, George Vanderbilt sponsored a renewal of auto races for the Vanderbilt Cup, founded by his uncle, William Kissam Vanderbilt II, in 1904. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy like his two brothers. He was promoted to lieutenant on May 1, 1943, and received the Legion of Merit award. ===Scientific research=== Vanderbilt did not attend college, but by the time he turned 21, he had already led two expeditions to Panama and Africa, with some lasting up to 10 months, bringing back various snakes, fish, insects and birds. In 1937, he went on a six month with the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences to the South Seas, bringing back 20,000 species of birds, fish and reptiles. He owned several yachts and used them to conduct scientific expeditions all over the globe. His voyages conducted important research in expeditions to Africa in 1934 and aboard the schooner Cressida, he made an ocean journey in 1937 to the South Pacific (visiting many islands with a wide geographic range) that carried out a systematic study of more than 10,000 fish specimens (434 species in 210 genera). His fifth major expedition was on the schooner Pioneer in 1941 to the Bahamas, Caribbean Sea, Panama, Galapagos Archipelago and Mexican Pacific Islands. He established the George Vanderbilt Foundation, of which he was president, for scientific research around marine biology. However, outside of academic circles, his important work has mostly been overshadowed by the lavish lifestyles and the Vanderbilt mansions of some of the other members of the Vanderbilt family. ==Personal life== Arcadia Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina George Vanderbilt was married four times throughout his life. His first marriage was in 1935, when he married Louise \\"Lulu\\" Miriam Parsons (1912‚Äì2013). Lulu was born in Montclair, New Jersey and her father, J. Lester Parsons, founded the international re-insurance firm of Crum & Forster in 1896. Together, George and Louise had: *Lucille Margaret Vanderbilt (1938 - 2018), who was married to Philip Brady, Jr from 1958 until their divorce 1962. Later in 1962, she married Robert Mathews Balding, divorcing in 1970. Her third and final marriage was to Wallace Fennel Pate (1933-1993). In 1946, the Vanderbilts divorced and in 1950, Louise married Ronald Bush Balcom (d. 1994), a champion skier who had previous attained celebrity when he became the third husband of Standard Oil heiress Millicent Rogers. Also in 1950, George Vanderbilt married Anita C. Zabala Howard at his home in South Carolina. She was a descendant of one of California's first Spanish families and the former wife of California sportsman Lindsay C. Howard. They divorced in 1958 after nearly 8 years of marriage. In 1958, he married for the third time to Joyce \\"Josh\\" Branning, (1926‚Äì2016) daughter of Enid and Ralph Branning. They later divorced and, in 1963, she married Edward L. Doheny III (d. 1999), grandson of Edward L. Doheny. On March 23, 1961, he married Louise Mitchell Paine in Scottsdale, Arizona. She was a member of the Board of Directors of the Children‚Äôs Cancer Fund of America and was the daughter of Harold E. Mitchell and had previously been married to Edward Bragg Paine (d. 1951). Edward's widow later married Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton. They were only married for three months as Vanderbilt died in June 1961. ===Residences=== In 1935, he purchased the 32 acre Charles W. Sloane estate on Middle Neck Road in Sands Point on the Long Island Sound, shortly after his first marriage. In 1937, he had commissioned a home by society architects Treanor & Fatio on the property. He sold the home to Henry Lustig, founder of the Longchamps chain of restaurants, in 1945. In 1946, he purchased 1,500 acres in Siskiyou County near Lake Shastina and the Shasta‚ÄìTrinity National Forest in Northern California. In 1949, he built a large ranch house, known as \\"Shadow Valley Ranch\\" along with a guest cottage, carriage house, tennis court, riding trails, waterfalls and several barns. The home was host to many important people of the times, including overnight guests Harry Truman, John Wayne, Audrey Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Alan Ladd and Ginger Rogers. The house was sold by his widow in 1990 and burned down in 2012. He also lived in Honolulu, Hawaii for 25 years and owned the Arcadia Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, which had been purchased by his grandfather, Dr. Emerson, in 1906. His former yacht, the Pioneer, is now the Yankee Clipper, which sails with passengers in the Caribbean for Windjammer Barefoot Cruises. ===Death=== On June 24, 1961, George Washington Vanderbilt apparently committed suicide by leaping from his 10th floor suite at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco, California. His wife said he was despondent over unspecified business setbacks. Investigators found large amounts of alcohol in his blood stream. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * Curiosity served: Biltmore opens servants' quarters, Tim Whitmire, Associated Press via The San Diego Union- Tribune, December 25, 2005. * Antiques of the Biltmore Estate at go-star.com ==External links== * Category:1914 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Alcohol-related deaths in California Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:Explorers who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:Scientists who committed suicide Category:Sportspeople who committed suicide Category:Suicides by defenestration Category:Suicides by jumping in California Category:St. Paul's School (New Hampshire) alumni George Washington III ","title":"George Washington Vanderbilt III"},{"id":"1273299","text":"Koup√©la is a city in Burkina Faso, lying east of Ouagadougou () and west of Fada-Ngourma () in an area settled by the Mossi people.

It was Morgan's first car with four wheels, the name indicating that the model has four wheels and four cylinders (earlier Morgans had been three-wheelers, typically with V-twin engines). Early publicity and advertising material variously referred to the model as \\"4/4\\", \\"4-4\\", \\"Four Four\\" and similar names, but from the outset the factory designation was always \\"4/4\\". Apart from a break during World War II (and the period March 1951 to September 1955) the 4/4 has been in continuous production from its debut right up to the present day. Engine capacity has increased from the 1,122 cc Coventry Climax engine in 1936 to a 1.8-litre Ford engine in 2004, although it is currently back down to 1,595 cc. ==4/4 Two-Seater== The original open two-seater 4/4 was introduced in 1936 and became the most popular of the three body options available. 663 were built by 1939 and 249 more from 1946 to 1950, representing 53% of the overall production. For the first years the car had a 1,122 cc Coventry Climax engine with , superseded from 1939 by a Standard Special 1,267 cc overhead valve engine with . A four- speed Meadows gearbox was used until 1938, then a Moss gearbox. ===4/4 Four- Seater=== The four-seat version was introduced in 1937 and 99 were built by 1939 and a further 140 from 1946 to 1950. 1939 Morgan 4/4 Rear view of 1939 Drophead Coup√© ===4/4 Drophead Coup√©=== The Drophead Coup√© was introduced in 1938 with 58 built by 1939 and another 106 from 1946 to 1950. This has a better folding roof and permanent window frames, along with certain other creature comforts. ==4/4 Series II== The Series II was introduced in 1955 with 386 built by October 1960. Although very similar in appearance to the model it replaced, it was virtually a new car with a chassis based on the one used in the Morgan Plus 4. The traditional independent front suspension using sliding pillars and coil springs was fitted with a rigid axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Disc wheels were fitted as standard items. A side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was used with a Ford three-speed gearbox. The engine produced 36 bhp. Hydraulic brakes with drums were fitted. It was also available in 'Competition' form with Aquaplane head conversion, twin S.U. carburettors, and an improved gearshift linkage. Inside there was a bench seat back and individual squabs covered in PVC, with leather as an option, and rubber floor covering. A heater was available as an option as was a rev counter and more surprisingly, direction indicators. In 1956 The Motor magazine tested a Series II and recorded a top speed of , acceleration from 0- in 26.9 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost ¬£713 including taxes. ==4/4 Series III== The short-lived Series III was introduced in October 1960 and 58 were built by November 1961 when the Series IV arrived. The chassis was essentially the same as that used on the Series II but the track was increased by 2 inches (50 mm). Hydraulic shock absorbers replaced the old Hartford friction type. A overhead valve 997 cc Ford Anglia 105E engine and Ford four-speed gearbox were used. ==4/4 Series IV== The Series IV introduced October 1961 with 114 built by March 1963 had a 62 bhp, 1340 cc, Ford Classic 109E engine and Ford four-speed gearbox. Front disc brakes were now fitted. The Motor magazine tested a Series IV in 1962 and found it had a top speed of , acceleration from 0- in 18.6 seconds and a touring fuel consumption of . The test car cost ¬£729 including taxes on the home market. ==4/4 Series V== The Series V was introduced in February 1963 with 639 built by March 1968. A 65 bhp, 1498 cc, Ford Cortina 116E engine and Ford four-speed gearbox were used. ==4/4 1600== The car was further updated in 1968 to become the 1600 with two- and four-seat open bodies available. ===Ford Kent Crossflow engine=== The 4/4 1600 was introduced in February 1968 fitted with a variety of Ford 1599 cc Kent engines of type 2737E (70 bhp), type 2737GT (95.5 bhp) and type 2265E (95.5 bhp) from 1971 and a Ford four-speed gearbox.

From 1986 steering was changed from the original cam and peg to a Gemmer recirculating ball system. 1652 were built by November 1991. ===Ford CVH EFI engine=== From November 1991 a Ford 1597 cc CVH engine with electronic fuel injection was used. 187 were built by January 1993, when the 1800 version was introduced. ==4/4 1800== ===Ford Zetec engine=== Starting in April 1993 the Morgan 4/4 used a Ford 1,796 cc 16-valve Zetec R engine. ====Runabout==== In 2003 Morgan launched a new entry level model named the Runabout based on the 4/4. It was available in three standard colours only with a standard no-option specification. The Runabout could be recognised by the reduced number of bonnet louvres. ===Ford Duratec engine=== From 2006 to 2009 the 4/4 sported a Ford Duratec 1,798 cc 16-valve all-alloy engine. On these models the exhaust is on the right side. In January 2006 a \\"70th Anniversary Special edition\\" was presented, celebrating 70 years having passed since the introduction of the 4/4. This received black paint and special wheels, similar to those used on the original \\"flat-rad\\" Morgan. 142 were planned to be made. In spite of seventy years of production, the accumulated figure had not yet reached 10,000 in 2006. ==4/4 1.6 Litre (2009‚Äì2018)== From 2009 to 2018 the Ford Sigma engine used is 1,595 cc and produces , enough for a top speed. The engine drives the rear wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox. Initially a Ford gearbox was used, then from 2012 a Mazda unit was fitted. In 2018 the model was discontinued for European and North American markets as the engine does not pass the latest emission regulations. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== *Morgan Workshop Manual 4 Category:Cars introduced in 1936 Category:1940s cars Category:1950s cars Category:1960s cars Category:1970s cars Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:2000s cars Category:2010s cars ","title":"Morgan 4/4"},{"id":"1273311","text":"Congolese Civil War or Congo War may refer to any of a number of armed conflicts in present-day countries of Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Western Africa: *In the historic Kingdom of Kongo: **Kongo Civil War (1665‚Äì1709) *In the Republic of the Congo (formerly known as Congo-Brazzaville): **Republic of the Congo Civil War (1993‚Äì1994) **Republic of the Congo Civil War (1997‚Äì1999) *In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly known as Congo-L√©opoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, or Zaire): **Congo Crisis (1960‚Äì1965), dating from the country's independence from Belgium to the rise of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko ***Simba rebellion (1964), subconflict of the Congo Crisis **First Congo War (1996‚Äì1997), which led to the overthrow of Mobutu by Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila and his rebels **Second Congo War (1998‚Äì2003), involved nine nations and led to ongoing low-level warfare despite an official peace treaty and the first democratic elections in 2006 ***Ituri conflict (1999‚Äì2007), a subconflict of the Second Congo War ***Effacer le tableau (2002-2003), a genocide of Mbuti and other Pygmy tribes by the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo in North Kivu **Kivu conflict (2004‚Äìpresent) ***M23 rebellion (2012‚Äì2013) == See also == * Dongo conflict (2009) ","title":"Congolese Civil War"},{"id":"1273314","text":"Tichit or Tichitt (, ) is a partly abandoned village at the foot of the Tagant Plateau in central southern Mauritania that is known for its vernacular architecture.

Released on April 2, 2002, via Murder Inc. and Island Def Jam, the album was recorded in New York City and Los Angeles between 2001 and 2002, during the period of time where Ashanti was writing for other artists. Its music has the sound of R&B; and hip hop soul. The album features guest vocals from Gotti, Ja Rule, and the late The Notorious B.I.G.. Contributions to the album's production came from a wide range of producers, including Irv Gotti, 7 Aurelius, Chink Santana, Jared Thomas and Reggie Wright. Ashanti debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart with first-week sales of 503,000 units, the biggest first-week sales for a debut female artist up to then. The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of three million copies on December 17, 2002. It earned Ashanti three Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist, Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance and Best Contemporary R&B; Album, winning in the latter category. Billboard magazine ranked Ashanti at number 100 on its Top 200 Albums of the Decade. The album has sold ten million copies worldwide. The album was promoted by four singles. \\"Foolish\\" was released as the lead single from the project and peaked atop the record charts of 15 nations, including the US Billboard Hot 100.

Furthermore, Ashanti later opened for the North American leg for Mariah Carey's worldwide concert tour Charmbracelet World Tour. ==Background== When Ashanti was 14, she was discovered by P. Diddy's Bad Boy Records. Initially, she went to Bad Boy Records and sang one of Mary J. Blige's songs in front of P. Diddy and Biggie Smalls. After being impressed by her singing ability, Diddy later signed her to a development deal, but, due to a bad contract, Ashanti did not sign with Diddy. This ultimately led to a record deal with Jive Records in 1994. This relationship soured when Jive tried to make Ashanti into a pop singer.Daniels, Mark. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" . Amazon.com. Retrieved April 12, 2007. Ashanti subsequently involved herself in schoolwork, cheerleading, and running on her school's track team. She was an honor student in English and belonged to the English club where she began writing poetry. She was also in the Drama club and performed in a few plays. She put college pursuits aside when Epic Records approached her with a contract in 1998. However, the label's management changes quickly made Ashanti a low priority. She continued to perform at local New York clubs and began hanging out at the Murder Inc. recording studio, hoping for another big break.OnTV Shows  myLifetime.com Ashanti was first noticed by Irv Gotti because of her vocal skills. Ashanti initially asked him to produce a few demo songs for her to record so she could say she had some strong tracks by the big time producer but Gotti had a different idea. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song \\"How We Roll\\". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles \\"Pov City Anthem\\" and \\"Just Like a Thug\\". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on rapper Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's \\"Justify My Love\\" and on the solo track \\"When a Man Does Wrong\\". She appeared as a background vocalist on \\"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\\", a collaboration by labelmate Ja Rule and Jennifer Lopez (she also appeared in the music video for \\"Aint It Funny (Murder Remix)\\", the second duet between Lopez and Rule, for which she wrote and also sang background vocals on), and was featured on Fat Joe's \\"What's Luv?\\" and Ja Rule's \\"Always on Time\\". \\"What's Luv?\\" and \\"Always on Time\\" were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female artist to occupy the top two positions on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously when \\"Always on Time\\" and \\"What's Luv?\\" were at numbers one and two, respectively. ==Promotion== The album's lead single, titled \\"Foolish\\" was released on January 29, 2002. The song became Ashanti's biggest solo successes to date, spending ten consecutive weeks on top of the US Billboard Hot 100, and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks charts. It was eventually first ranked on the US Billboard Hot 100, and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles 2002 year-end charts for eleven straight weeks (Tying with Nelly's single \\"Dilemma\\", but not for eleven straights weeks). It was a breakthrough hit internationally entering the top five in the United Kingdom, the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and Japan, and the top twenty in Switzerland and the Netherlands. \\"Foolish\\" was later officially remixed, titled \\"Unfoolish\\", with guest appearances from a decease rapper The Notorious B.I.G., was released only just for radio ads. The album's second single, \\"Happy\\" was released on May 21, 2002. The song peaked at number 8 on US Billboard Hot 100, and number 6 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs charts.

The single became Ashanti's third top-twenty hit as a solo artist in her career. \\"Dreams\\" was released as a promotional single, with a live-performance music video with clips from Ashanti's career. ==Critical reception== Ashanti earned generally mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it a three-out-of-five-star rating and praised the \\"modern, post-hip-hop soul\\" sound, stating the album has \\"fairly fresh beats and lightly insistent hooks, and is just naughty enough\\". However, he felt it lacked distinctive material: \\"It's not bad by any means, and it has its moments, but at 17 tracks, including skits, it all becomes a blur. A pleasing blur, one that shows promise, but a blur all the same.\\" Entertainment Weekly commended the album's \\"coy hooks\\" and \\"jagged-edged rappers\\", continuing to say \\"her voice is supple and pretty but rarely rises above a whisper, making it a background instrument even when it's Ashanti's turn to shine\\". The Los Angeles Times had a mixed view of the album, writing \\"Ashanti's breathy, cooing vocals are well suited to the mellow mood of this collection\\", however was unimpressed because it was not \\"substantial\\". In another mixed review, Slant critic Sal Cinqueman found that \\"the songs are infectious and fine-tuned and most of the album is underscored with bristling live instrumentation [...] But tracks like the flute-infused \\"Happy\\" are admittedly ‚Äî and perhaps too obviously ‚Äî influenced by other R&B; divas like Mary J. Blige and rarely give way to anything fresh or new. Ultimately, Ashanti fails to carve a unique niche for the budding singer.\\" Rolling Stones Kris Ex complimented the album's overall production with its \\"bass-heavy, slow-burning R&B; grooves that sound like everything else on R&B; radio\\" and noted that Ashanti's \\"voice is the perfect radio-ready R&B; instrument: strong enough to ride over street-savvy beats but unassuming enough to be open to interpretation; better than Britney but less distinctive than Mary J. Blige.\\" Alluding to her previous collaborations, People magazine wrote that \\"it‚Äôs one thing to sing a hook on someone else‚Äôs record, quite another to carry your own album, as Ashanti fails to do on this desultory debut [...] Ashanti, with her sweet but slight soprano, doesn‚Äôt have the grit and power of [other] divas. It doesn‚Äôt help that, despite sporadic sampling [...] lack memorable melodies.\\" ==Legacy== Her debut album earned Ashanti three Grammy nominations for Best New Artist, Best Contemporary R&B; Album and Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards. The same year, she also received two additional Grammy nominations for other projects, both in the category of Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Ashanti took home a record 8 billboard awards, winning all the categories she was nominated for. Billboard magazine ranked Ashanti at number 100 on magazine's Top 200 Albums of the Decade. In April 2002, Ashanti sold 503,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States, becoming a record-breaking feat. It was the highest first week sales for a female artist's debut ever. The album stayed atop the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks. In the same week, she became the first female performer to simultaneously hold the top two places on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with \\"Foolish\\" and \\"What's Luv\\" (with Fat Joe). She broke records again by having three top ten songs (Foolish, What's Luv, and Always on Time (with Ja Rule)) on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the same week. Otherwise, only The Beatles have achieved this up to that point. In 2009, Billboard.com reported that Ashanti has had the most top 10 songs (16 to date) on the R&B;/Hip-hop charts by a female for that respective decade. The album's lead single was named the 19th most successful song of the 2000s (decade) on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.Hot 100 Decade Songs As of June 2012, it is the third best selling physical single of the 21st century. ==Commercial performance== On April 20, 2002, Ashanti debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and Billboards Top R&B;/Hip Hop Albums chart at number one with first-week sales of 503,000 copies in the United States. On December 17, 2002, the album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 55 weeks. Ashanti had sold 3.6 million copies in the United States as of October 2008, according to Nielsen SoundScan.http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043619/ask-billboard- ashanti-nelly-chate-moore-donna-summer-aretha-franklin-blackgirl In Canada, it peaked at number 15 on the chart and was certified two times platinum for shipments of 200,000 copies.

It was Rushdie's fifth novel, following The Satanic Verses. It is a phantasmagorical story that begins in a city so old and ruinous that it has forgotten its name. Haroun and the Sea of Stories is an allegory for several problems existing in society today, especially in the Indian subcontinent. It looks at these problems from the viewpoint of the young protagonist Haroun. Rushdie dedicated this book to his son, from whom he was separated for some time. Many elements of the story deal with the problems of censorship: an issue particularly pertinent to Rushdie because of the fatwa against him backed by Ayatollah Khomeini.The Satanic Verses controversy The book is highly allusive and puns in multiple languages. Many of the major characters' names allude to some aspect of speech or silence. It was made into an audiobook read by Rushdie himself. ==Plot summary== At the beginning of the story, protagonist Haroun Khalifa lives with his father Rashid, a famous storyteller and doctor, and his mother Soraya, until the latter is seduced by their neighbor 'Mr. Sengupta' to leave home. Thereafter Rashid is hired to speak on behalf of local politicians but fails his initial assignment. The two are thence conveyed to the 'Valley of K' by courier 'Mr. Butt', to speak for 'Snooty Buttoo', another politician. Attempting to sleep aboard Buttoo's yacht, Haroun discovers 'Iff the Water Genie', assigned to detach Rashid's imagination, and demands conversation against this decision with Iff's supervisor, the Walrus. They are then carried to the eponymous 'Sea of Stories' by an artificial intelligence in the form of a hoopoe, nicknamed 'Butt' after the courier. Of the Sea of Stories, Haroun learns it is endangered by antagonist 'Khattam-Shud,' who represents \\"the end\\". In the Kingdom of Gup, King Chattergy, Prince Bolo, General Kitab, and the Walrus announce their plans for war against the neighbouring kingdom of Chup, to recapture Bolo's betrothed Princess Batcheat. Rashid joins them here, having witnessed Batcheat's kidnapping. Thereafter Haroun and his companions join the Guppee army of 'Pages' toward Chup, where they befriend Mudra, Khattam-Shud's former second-in-command. Haroun, Iff, Butt the Hoopoe, and Mali the stories' gardener, investigating the Sea's 'Old Zone', are captured by Khattam-Shud's animated shadow, who plans to plug the Story Source at the bottom of the Sea. Before he can do so, Mali destroys the machines used by him to poison the Sea, and Haroun restores the Sea's long-annulled alternation of night and day‚Äì thus destroying the antagonist's shadow and those assisting him, and diverting the giant 'Plug' meant to seal the Source. In Chup, the Guppee army destroy the Chupwalas' army and release Princess Batcheat; whereupon Khattam-Shud himself is crushed beneath a collapsing statue commissioned by himself. Thereafter the Walrus promises Haroun a happy ending of his own story. On return to the human world, Rashid reveals Haroun's adventures to local citizens, who expel Snooty Buttoo. When Rashid and Haroun return home, the people of their city have become joyous to replace their customary misery, and Soraya has returned to her son and husband. The novel concludes with an appendix explaining the meaning of each major character's name. ==Places== * A work of magic realism, the story begins and takes place partly in \\"a sad city, the saddest of cities, a city so ruinously sad it had forgotten its name\\", which is located beside \\"a mournful sea full of glumfish, which were so miserable to eat that they made people belch with melancholy\\". This city is thickly populated by people, of whom only the lead character Haroun and his parents are ever happy, while in the north of the city are factories wherein sadness is allegedly manufactured and exported. The factories produce air pollution that is only relieved during rain which also heralds the arrival of pomfret into the nearby waters. At the end of the city with no name is revealed to be named Kahani. * Most of the Earthly locations present in the book are located in the fictional nation of Alifbay, which is a combination of first two letters of the Arabic script based Urdu alphabet, Alif and Bay and therefore contains many places named after letters, such as the \\"Valley of K\\" and the \\"Tunnel of I (which was also known as J)\\". * In the center of the Valley of K is the Dull Lake, which is said in the novel's appendix to be named after the Dal Lake in Kashmir. This implies that Kashmir is the place on which K is based. The Dull Lake itself is the location of the Moody Land, a landscape whose weather changes to reflect the emotions of the people currently present in it. It is the place where the lead characters go at the behest of a corrupt politician, and where their adventures begin. * The larger part of the plot occurs on a fictional moon of earth, named Kahani, whose orbit is controlled by a \\"Process Too Complicated To Explain\\" also referred to in the book as the \\"P2C2E\\". These processes enable it to fly over every single point on Earth like a satellite. Kahani consists of a massive Ocean which is composed of an infinite number of stories, each story taking the form of a current or stream of a unique color. The colours encompass the whole visible spectrum and extend beyond into spectra that are not known to exist. Various islands and a continent are also shown on the moon. The name \\"Kahani\\" itself means \\"Story\\" in Urdu and Hindi, and is ultimately revealed to be the name of the sad city; a revelation that removes the sadness from the city's people. * The Moon Kahani is, throughout most of the plot, divided into two sections equal in size, one of which is kept in perpetual daylight and the other in perpetual darkness. The two are separated by a narrow strip of twilight, which is marked by a force field named Chattergy's Wall. The daylight side is called Gup, a Hindi and Urdu word (meaning \\"gossip\\", \\"nonsense\\", or \\"fib\\" in English) and the night-darkened side is called Chup (meaning \\"quiet\\"). Inhabitants of Gup value speech and are called \\"Guppees\\", meaning \\"talkative people\\", while inhabitants of Chup are stated to have historically valued silence and are called \\"Chupwalas\\", meaning \\"quiet fellows\\". The \\"u\\" in \\"Gup\\" rhymes with the \\"u\\" in \\"cup\\", the \\"u\\" in \\"Chup\\" is pronounced similarly to the \\"oo\\" in \\"good\\", and the \\"w\\" in \\"Chupwala\\" resembles a sound lying midway between the English letters \\"w\\" and \\"v\\". At the South Pole of Kahani is a spring known as the Source of Stories, from which (according to the premise of the plot) originated all stories ever communicated. The prevention of this spring's blockage therefore forms the climax of the novel's plot. ==Characters in the book== Haroun: The main character/central consciousness of the story. A young, curious, courageous, outspoken child. He struggles throughout most of the story with a form of attention-deficit disorder caused by his mother running away with Mr. Sengupta at exactly eleven o'clock, and under its influence he is unable to concentrate for a longer period of time (not more than eleven minutes). But he eventually overcomes his disorder at the climax, never to suffer from it again. He and his father are both named after the \\"legendary Caliph of Baghdad, Haroun al- Rashid, who features in many Arabian Nights tales. Their surname Khalifa actually means Caliph\\" Rashid: Haroun's father, known as the Shah of Blah and the Ocean of Notions for his ability to devise stories impromptu, Rashid is a professional storyteller sometimes hired by corrupt politicians to persuade constituents in their favour. His attachment to his wife and to his practice of storytelling, is probably his greatest psychological weaknesses; when either of them is lost, he becomes depressed and tends to lose the other. In the story, to recover the latter, he travels to Kahani by means known as 'Rapture', through which he is able to travel inside his dreams and wake up in the world, his dream has created. Having reached Kahani, he alerts the Guppees about the location of their Princess Batcheat and later joins their army to rescue her from the Chupwalas. Soraya: Rashid's wife, who is tired of his imagination and leaves him for the dull and dreary Mr. Sengupta, a neighbour. That she is becoming alienated from Rashid is implied early in the story, where she is said to have abandoned her daily songs. At the end, she returns to Rashid, and revives her affection for her husband and son. Upon her return, the depression overwhelming Rashid and the syndrome manifested by Haroun do not reappear. Her name is probably Persian in origin. Mr. Sengupta: Haroun's neighbour, who elopes with Soraya. As a rule, Mr. Sengupta despises imagination and stories, which sets the stage for his later appearance on Kahani as antagonist Khattam-Shud. Khattam-Shud's defeat seems to correspond with Soraya's desertion of Mr. Sengupta, who does not appear again in person. His name is a legitimate Bengali surname. Miss Oneeta: Mr. Sengupta's obese, talkative, self-important, overwhelmingly emotional, generous wife, disappointed in her husband after he has eloped with Soraya. In her dismay, she disowns him and her married name. It is she who reveals that Soraya has deserted her family and that her act has given Haroun his disorder, and also announces her return. Mr. Butt: The mail courier, a reckless driver who, when requested to provide transport for Haroun and Rashid (who is expected to speak at an election of public officers), ignores all other demands to take them to their destination before dusk. He is implied equivalent of the Hoopoe, who also serves as Haroun's transportation. Snooty Buttoo: A corrupt politician who hires Rashid to convince constituents that he (Buttoo) should be re- elected. Buttoo is a class-conscious, pompous, arrogant, self-assured person whose chief hold over his constituents is that he has been re-elected before. To persuade Rashid to sympathise with him, he offers both Rashid and Haroun a stay on a luxurious houseboat called 'The Arabian Nights Plus One'. Ultimately driven from his district by popular demand. Butt the Hoopoe: A mechanical Hoopoe who becomes Haroun's steed in Kahani, capable of almost all known mental feats, including telepathy (the latter producing a recurrent joke that he \\"spoke without moving [his] beak\\"). He is also capable of flying at impossible speeds, between Earth and Kahani. Because he shares with Mr. Butt the idiosyncrasy of saying \\"but but but\\" at the beginning of sentences, in addition to some superficial details of appearance, he is called by the same name. At his introduction, he is described as \\"the bird that leads all other birds through many dangerous places to their ultimate goal\\". Iff: A \\"water genie\\" from Kahani who accompanies Haroun in Kahani. Iff's task is to control Rashid's imagination, in the form of waters transmitted to Rashid via an invisible faucet by means called a \\"Process Too Complicated To Explain\\". Iff himself is a benevolent character having a blue mustache and beard; an effusive, somewhat cantankerous personality; and a habit of speaking in lists of synonyms. Prince Bolo:Actually meaning \\"speak!\\", since bolo is the imperative form of Hindi bolna \\"to speak\\". A possible parody of the archetypal awe-inspiring hero or Prince Charming, Bolo is a reckless, slightly stupid, melodramatic figure, nominally the leader of the charge to rescue Princess Batcheat from Chup, but holding little authority; prone to becoming excited at the least provocation; obsessed with rescuing Batcheat, so that all other things appear to him of little significance. He frequently draws his sword when it is unwise to fight; once extends diplomatic immunity to an assassin bent on killing him; and often gives the impression to readers of being somewhat out of harmony with the realities of his situations. Princess Batcheat: A damsel in distress. Batcheat is the daughter of King Chattergy, ruler of Gup, and the fianc√©e of Prince Bolo. She is somewhat foolish; sentimental; reckless; and completely infatuated with Bolo, who is the only person to think her beautiful; all other characters have low opinions of her nose, teeth, and singing voice. Most references (including, in one passage, those of the narration) to any of these, conclude \\"... there's no need to go into that\\", and no exact description is given of Batcheat's face at all. Her name is pronounced \\"Baat-cheat\\", is translated as \\"conversation\\". When Princess Batcheat is captured by Chupwalas during an excursion to the border between Gup and Chup,This being a pun once again, meaning 'gossip'. S.v. 'gap', McGregor, R.S. (ed.): Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary. Delhi: Oxford UP, 2002. they plot to sew her mouth shut and rename her Khamosh, meaning \\"silent\\", but never carry this out. General Kitab: Literally \\"General Book\\", General Kitab is the commander of the Guppee Army, called the \\"Library\\". It consists of a multitude of Pages. The General participates in every debate regarding the worth of the cause on which the army has embarked, and frequently foments such debates on purpose to resolve all conflict of interest or opinion. The whole army, therefore, takes part in every campaign of Rogerian argument, whose sole aim is to produce conciliation and eventual unity among the Pages. Because Guppee laws permit an unlimited freedom of speech, these debates are unrestrained to an extent that would (as Haroun remarks) be considered insubordination in the reader's world. General Kitab himself is often flustered and embarrassed by Prince Bolo's impetuosity. King Chattergy: Princess Batcheat's father and Prince Bolo's father-in-law, who forms the nominal head of Gup's government but has little real power. He is given very little role in most of the story. The Wall dividing Gup from Chup is named after him. His name is a legitimate name in India, though usually spelled 'Chatterjee'. Blabbermouth: A female Page of the Library of Gup. Blabbermouth is a talkative, ill-tempered, contemptuous, stubborn, unscrupulous, quarrelsome girl who despises Princess Batcheat, disguises herself as a boy, and is skilled at the art of juggling. Blabbermouth joins the army of Gup to march on Chup, but is later exposed as a girl and expelled from the army by Bolo. She then becomes aide to Mudra, an ally of the Guppees, with whom she is implied to be infatuated. Mudra: Second-in-command to Khattam-Shud, who becomes disgruntled with his master's policies and defects to the Guppee side. His shadow, like the shadows of each and every person in Chup, can behave independently of himself and is therefore his sidekick. Mudra himself is an able warrior skilled in the art of hand-to-hand combat. He is described as having green paint and exaggerated features covering his face; as being clad in bulky armour that increases his appearance of size; and as having eyes white at the pupil, grey at the iris, and black at the sclera. Such eyes are common to all Chupwalas, and are entirely blind in bright light. Mudra is nearly mute, being able only to communicate his own name and that he \\"speaks\\" by Abhinaya, the sign language used in classical Indian dance. His own name is said in the appendix to be the generic term for all signs used in this language. After the climax, Mudra becomes President of Chup. Whether he reciprocates Blabbermouth's infatuation is never stated. Khattam-Shud: The villain of the story, whose name means \\"completely finished\\". As a character, he is the \\"Prince of Silence and the Foe of Speech\\" feared by most Guppees. He is the ruler of Chup, the Kahanian counterpart of Mr. Sengupta, and the founder of a religion whose supreme commandment is abstinence from speech. During the sack of Chup's capital, he is crushed by his own symbol of power, the statue 'Bezaban'. The Eggheads: Here, the technicians of Kahani: white- coated, completely bald, enthusiastic, cheerful, and intelligent. The Eggheads of Gup City are said to be the inventors of all \\"Processes Too Complicated To Explain\\", by which impossible feats such as Kahani's bizarre orbit, the creation of artificial happy endings for stories, and the transmission of \\"story water\\" to Earthly storytellers are easily accomplished. They are in awe of their superintendent, the Walrus, for his possession of a mustache. Walrus: The superintendent of the Eggheads, distinguished from them by his possession of a small mustache which gives him his name. Plentimaw Fish: Angelfish the size of giant sharks. The name is derived from their multiplicity of mouths, through which they constantly ingest the stories conveyed by the waters. Inside their bodies, the stories combine to form new stories. Plentimaw Fish mate for life and always travel in pairs, which then speak in rhyme. The name is also used to assonate with Buttoo's statement that \\"there are plenty more fish in the sea\\", whereas the angelfish-like physique of the two recalls Rashid's reply that \\"[one] must go a long, long way to find an Angel Fish\\". Mali: A 'Floating Gardener' composed of interwoven flowering vines and water plants that behave as a single organism. He is one of many, whose task is to prevent stories from becoming irretrievably convoluted and to cut away weeds on the Ocean's surface. Floating Gardeners are divided into a hierarchy of classes, of which Mali belongs to the First Class; presumably the highest. Mali, and presumably other Floating Gardeners, is virtually invulnerable, being able to withstand any and all attacks made against him by the Chupwalas. Though normally taciturn by human standards, he is shown singing rhymes when defying the attacks. ==Allusions/references to other works== \\"Sea of the Rivers of Story\\" is the English equivalent of KathƒÅsaritsƒÅgara, the title of an 11th-century collection of Indian legends. Elements of the story are indicated to have been drawn from Baum's The Wizard of Oz, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as having been compared to the popular children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth. Another obvious reference is to the stories of One Thousand and One Nights. Haroun, the son of Rashid Khalifa refers to Harun al-Rashid, a caliph who ruled from 786 to 809 and who features frequently in Thousand and One Nights stories. \\"Iff the Water Genie\\" is a reference to the genie in \\"Aladdin's Magic Lamp\\". Haroun steals Iff's magic wrench, and as a result, Iff is forced to do Haroun's bidding, just as the genie did when Aladdin came into possession of the magic lamp. The Walrus plays off of The Beatles song \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and Lewis Carroll's The Walrus and the Carpenter. When the character Mudra is first encountered, the noises he emits are the gurgling sound \\"Gogogol\\" and the coughing noise \\"Kafkafka\\", as references to writers Nikolai Gogol and Franz Kafka, whose names they are distorting. Rushdie makes another reference to Kafka when Iff describes the Plentimaw Fish in the sea, who swallow stories, as hunger artists. A reference is made to the folktale Rapunzel in the book's fourth chapter. Haroun encounters a warrior who is fighting his own shadow. This is possibly a reference to J.M Barrie's Peter Pan. \\"Goopy\\" and \\"Bagha\\", the names of the Plentimaws, allude to the characters Goopy and Bagha created by Bengali author Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. His grandson, the Academy Award-winning director Satyajit Ray, directed two films with Goopy and Bagha as protagonists. ==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations== *A play based on the book was adapted for the stage by Tim Supple and David Tushingham. It had its stage premiere in 1998 at the Royal National Theatre in London. *An opera, Haroun and the Sea of Stories, by Charles Wuorinen with libretto by James Fenton, written in 2001, was premiered at the New York City Opera in Fall 2004. ==References== Category:Novels by Salman Rushdie Category:1990 British novels Category:British children's novels Category:Metafictional novels Category:British magic realism novels Category:1990 children's books ","title":"Haroun and the Sea of Stories"},{"id":"1273341","text":"Trade routes of the Western Sahara desert c. 1000‚Äì1500. Goldfields are indicated by brown shading. Ouadane or WƒÅdƒÅn () is a small town in the desert region of central Mauritania, situated on the southern edge of the Adrar Plateau, 93 km northeast of Chinguetti. The town was a staging post in the trans-Saharan trade and for caravans transporting slabs of salt from the mines at Idjil. The old town, a World Heritage Site, though in ruins, is still substantially intact, while a small modern settlement lies outside its gate. Ouadane is the closest town to the Richat Structure, a massive circular landmark visible from space. ==History== The early history of Ouadane is uncertain but it is possible that the town prospered from the trans-Saharan gold trade. In the middle of the 11th century, the Arabic geographer al-Bakri described a trans-Saharan route that ran between Tamdoult near Akka in Morocco to Aoudaghost on the southern edge of the Sahara.. The ruins of Tamdoult are 13 km south-southwest of Akka, . This route was used for the transport of gold during the time of the Ghana Empire. In his account al-Bakri mentioned a series of place names but these have not been identified and historians have suggested several possible routes. In 1961 the French historian Raymond Mauny proposed a route that passed through Ouadane. Mauny suggested a route that passed through Tindouf, Bir Moghrein, Anajim, Tourine, Ouarane, Aguelt Nemadi and then Aoudaghost/Tegdaoust. but Suzanne Daveau later argued in favour of a more direct route that crossed the Adrar escarpment to the east of the town. The volume of caravan traffic would have declined from the beginning of the 13th century when the oasis town of Oualata located 360 km to the east replaced Aoudaghost as the southern terminus of the trade route. The first written reference to the town is in Portuguese by Ca' de Mosto in middle of the 15th century in a muddled account that confused the salt mines of Idjil with those of Taghaza.; ; At about the same date Gomes Eanes de Zurara described Ouadane as the most important town of the Adrar region and the only one with a surrounding wall.; Fifty years later Valentim Fernandes wrote a detailed account of the trade in slabs of salt from the Idjil mines and role of Ouadane as an entrep√¥t.; ; He described Ouadane as a 'town' with a population of 400 inhabitants.; . By contrast Duarte Pacheco Pereira in his Esmeraldo de situ orbis (written in 1505-1508) described the town as having approximately \\"300 hearths\\" which would suggest between 1,500 and 1,800 people.; The Idjil sebkha lies roughly 240 km northwest of Ouadane, to the west of the town of Fder√Æck.The sebkha of Idjil extends 80 km north to south and 10 km east to west, . See the map in . The date when salt was first extracted from the sebkha is unknown. It is usually assumed that exploitation of the Idjil mines began after the mid 11th century as al-Bakri did not mention them. Instead he described a salt mine at a place that he called 'Tatantal'. Historians have usually assumed this corresponds to Tegahza but his description could possibly also apply to the mines at Idjil. According to Pereira, in 1487 the Portuguese built an entrep√¥t in Ouadane in an attempt to gain access to the trans-Saharan gold, salt and slave trade. The entrep√¥t was probably short lived and is not mentioned in the detailed description provided by Fernandes.; ; In the 16th century the Moroccans made various attempts to take control of the trans-Saharan trade in salt and especially that in gold from the Sudan. They organised military expeditions to occupy Ouadane in 1543-44 and again in 1584. Then in 1585 they occupied Taghaza and finally in 1591 their victory in the battle of Battle of Tondibi led to the collapse of the Songhay Empire. Tegherbeyat, the upper ruined section of the town, is almost certainly the oldest. It would have originally contained a mosque but nothing has survived. The ruins of the lower section of the town include a mosque that was probably built in the 15th century when the town expanded. Some of the horseshoe arches are still standing and some walls still have the remains of clay plaster, suggesting that the mosque was abandoned sometime in the 19th century.. has a black and white photograph of the ruined mosque showing a round arch on page 223.

The garments are typically known as coveralls in North America, while overall(s) is used elsewhere; in North America \\"overall\\" is more usually understood as a bib-and- brace overall, which is a type of trousers with attached suspenders. A more tight-fitting garment that is otherwise similar to a boilersuit is usually called a jumpsuit. The \\"siren suit\\" favoured by Winston Churchill (but also worn by many others in the UK when air raids were a threat) during the Second World War was closely similar to a boilersuit. == Description == Man in boilersuit A boilersuit is a one-piece garment with full-length sleeves and legs like a jumpsuit, but usually less tight-fitting. Its main feature is that it has no gap between jacket and trousers or between lapels, and no loose jacket tails. It often has a long thin pocket down the outside of the right thigh to hold long tools. It usually has a front fastening extending the whole length of the front of the body up to the throat, with no lapels. It may be fastened with buttons, a zip, velcro, or snap fasteners. Boilersuits with an attached hood are available. The word \\"boilersuit\\" may also refer to disposable garments such as DuPont's Tyvek suits. Boilersuits are so called because they were first worn by men maintaining coal-fired boilers. To check for steam leaks or to clean accumulated soot from inside the firebox of a steam locomotive, someone had to climb inside, through the firehole (where the coal is shovelled in). A one-piece suit avoids the potential problem of loosened soot entering the lower half of one's clothing through the gap in the middle. As the firehole opening is only just large enough for a fit individual to negotiate, a one-piece suit also avoids the problem of the waistband snagging on the firehole as one bends to wriggle through, or of jacket tails snagging if one has to come out backwards. ==Usage== Coveralls are most often worn as protective clothing over \\"street\\" clothes at work, but sometimes instead of ordinary jacket and trousers. Prison coverall Coveralls are also sometimes used as prison uniforms in the U.S and other countries. Police coverall SWAT units often use boilersuits as a uniform, for instance the French police unit Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© or the Austrian units EKO Cobra and WEGA. Similar coveralls made of Nomex in olive drab (and more recently, desert tan) are also used by the crews of armoured fighting vehicles in the US Army and Marine Corps, where the men and also their suits are sometimes called \\"CVCs\\", an abbreviation of \\"Combat Vehicle Crewman\\". More form fitting coveralls with many zippered pockets, originally made of cotton treated for flame resistance, but made of Nomex since the late 1960s, have been used as flight suits since the beginning of World War II. There are two main categories for coveralls: cloth and disposable. Both cloth and disposable coveralls are manufactured with their own unique protective properties including: high-visibility, insulation to protect against cold weather, waterproof, flame resistant to protect against fire, arc resistant to protect against flash fires, and even microporous fabrics when exposed to hazardous chemicals. Japanese politicians have been known to use boiler suits to convey an image of preparedness. Coveralls called student boilersuits are used by university students in some Nordic countries as a sort of party-uniform, with insignia on the back and colour varying with programme and university. The suit is associated with the slasher subgenre, being worn by Michael Myers of the Halloween films. Pete Townshend of The Who frequently wore a white boiler suit during performances and in publicity photographs from 1969-71. The Church of Scientology has punished Sea Org members in the Rehabilitation Project Force by making them wear black boiler suits. A report in the Daily Telegraph in April 1920 said that \\"in the last few days\\" a strong movement, including formation of \\"overall clubs\\", had developed in the USA among men who normally wore office suits, to wear overalls instead, in protest against the then- current very excessive price of office-type suits. It started among press agents and theatrical editors. Many newspapers called for this direct action rather than waiting for the United States Department of Justice to prosecute profiteers. This was accompanied by state school schoolboys and schoolgirls passing resolutions to wear khaki (post-WWI widely cheaply available) instead of school uniforms, and editorials advising gingham gowns for women.Daily Telegraph April 1920, reprinted in Daily Telegraph Saturday 18 April 2020, page 28http://ultimatehistoryproject.com/overall- clubs.htmlhttps://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/features/100-75-50-and-25-years- ago-1920-the-overall-clubs-were-endorsed-as- protest/article_d5bb0660-7911-11ea-bb05-13104bf7a652.html ==See also== * Flight suit * Speedsuit * Onesie (jumpsuit) ==References== Category:Military uniforms Category:One-piece suits Category:Safety clothing ","title":"Boilersuit"},{"id":"1273360","text":"Keaton Tyndall and Kylie Tyndall (born Keaton Nicole Tyndall and Kylie Rae Tyndall on March 14, 1992 in Los Angeles, California) are identical twin actresses. ==Career== They started acting at the age of 9 months, and have had roles in several movies and TV shows.

The language was written by Clinton Parker and distributed on ROM cartridge by Optimized Systems Software (OSS) starting in 1983. It was one of the first of OSS's bank switching \\"Super Cartridges\\", with a total of 16 kB of code. Working with Henry Baker, Parker had previously developed Micro-SPL, a systems programming language for the Xerox Alto. Action! was largely a port of Micro-SPL concepts to the Atari with the necessary changes to more directly handle the underlying MOS 6502 processor and add an editor and debugger. Action! was used to develop at least two commercial products‚Äîthe HomePak productivity suite and Games Computers Play client program‚Äîand numerous programs in ANALOG Computing and Antic magazines. The editor portion was also used as the basis for the PaperClip word processor. The language was not ported to any other platforms. The 6502 assembly language source code for Action! was made available under the GNU General Public License by the author in 2015.Action! Source Code - Page 2, Alfred (Chopper Commander) Posted Mon Feb 2, 2015 1:38 PM, AtariAge Forums, This is the original Action! source as I received it from ICD. It uses the ICD cross assembler which is not included in the zip. It can be easily converted to other formats ==History== ===Micro-SPL=== While taking his postgraduate studies, Parker started working part-time at Xerox PARC working on printer drivers. He later moved to the Xerox Alto project where he wrote several games for the system. His PhD was in natural language parsing and he had worked on compiler theory during his graduate work. Henry Baker and Parker released Micro-SPL in September 1979. Micro-SPL was intended to be used as a systems programming language on the Xerox Alto workstation computer, which was normally programmed in BCPL. The Alto used a microcode system which the BCPL compiler output. Micro-SPL output the same format, allowing BCPL programs to call Micro-SPL programs. Aside from differences in syntax, the main difference between Micro-SPL and BCPL, and the reason for its existence, was that Micro- SPL produced code that was many times faster than the native BCPL compiler. In general, Micro-SPL programs were expected to run about ten times as fast as BCPL, and about half as fast as good hand-written microcode. In comparison to microcode, they claimed it would take half as long to write and 10% of the time to debug it. ===Action!=== It was during this period that Parker purchased an Atari for use at home, and was disappointed with the lack of development systems for this platform. This was the impetus for the development of Action! Parker initially considered releasing the system himself, but later decided to partner with Optimized Systems Software (OSS) for sales and distribution. OSS focused on utilities and programming languages like BASIC XL, so this was a natural fit for Action! Sales were strong enough for Parker to make a living off the royalties for several years. The IBM PC had C compilers available, and Parker decided there was no point in porting Action! to that platform. As the sales of the Atari 8-bit platforms wound down, in North America at least, OSS wound down as well. Late in its history Action! distribution moved from OSS to Electronic Arts, but they did little with the language and sales ended shortly after. In a 2015 interview, Parker expressed his surprise in the level of support the language continued to receive, suggesting there appeared to be more interest in it then than there had been in the late 1980s. ==Development environment== Action! was one of the earlier examples of the OSS SuperCartridge format. ROM cartridges on the Atari were normally limited to 8 kB, which limited its ability to support larger programs. The SuperCartridge had 16 kB organized as four 4 kB blocks, two of which were visible at any time. The lower 4 kB did not change, and system could bank switch between the other three blocks by changing the value in address $AFFF. Action! used this design by breaking the system into four sections, the editor, the compiler, a monitor for testing code and switching between the editor and compiler, and the run-time library. The run-time library is stored in the cartridge itself. To distribute standalone applications requires a separate run-time package which was sold by OSS as the Action! Toolkit. Action! constructs were designed to map cleanly to 6502 opcodes, to provide high performance without needing complex optimizations in the one-pass compiler.ACTION! in Atariki (PL) For example, local variables are assigned fixed addresses in memory, instead of being allocated on the stack of activation records. This eliminates the significant overhead associated with stack management, which is especially difficult in the case of the 6502's 256-byte stack. However, this precludes the use of recursion. Unlike the integrated Atari BASIC and Atari Assembler Editor environments, the Action! editor does not use line numbers. It features a full-screen, scrolling display capable of displaying two windows, as well as block operations and global search and replace. The monitor serves as a debugger, allowing an entire program or individual functions to be run, memory to be displayed and modified, and program execution to be traced. == Data types == Action! has three fundamental data types, all of which are numeric. === BYTE === Internally represented as an unsigned 8-bit integer. Values range from 0 to 255. The CHAR keyword can also be used to declare BYTE variables. BYTE age=[21] ; declare age and initialize it to the value 21 BYTE leftMargin=82 ; declare leftMargin at address 82 === CARDinal === Internally represented as an unsigned 16-bit integer. Values range from 0 to 65,535. CARD population=$600 ; declare population and store it at address 1536 and 1537 CARD prevYear, curYear, nextYear ; use commas to declare multiple variables === INTeger === Internally represented as a signed 16-bit integer. Values range from -32,768 to 32,767. INT veryCold = [-10] INT profitsQ1, profitsQ2, ; declaring multiple variables can profitsQ3, profitsQ4 ; span across multiple lines Action! also has ARRAYs, POINTERs and user-defined TYPEs. No floating point support is provided. An example of a user-defined TYPE: TYPE CORD=[CARD x,y] CORD point point.x=42 point.y=23 == Reserved words == A reserved word is any identifier or symbol that the Action! compiler recognizes as something special. It can be an operator, a data type name, a statement, or a compiler directive. AND FI OR UNTIL = ( ARRAY FOR POINTER WHILE <> ) BYTE FUNC PROC XOR # .

He began the review, \\"This is the best thing to happen to Atari since Nolan Bushnell figured out people would play ping-pong on a TV screen.\\" Laporte praised the editor, noting its split-screen and cut and paste capabilities and describing it as a \\"complete word processing system that's very responsive.\\" He said that Action! ran about 200 times as fast as Atari BASIC, concluding that \\"This language is like a finely tuned racing car.\\" BYTE in 1985 praised the compilation and execution speed of software written in Action! Using their Byte Sieve benchmark as a test, ten iterations of the sieve completed in 18 seconds in Action!, compared to 10 seconds for assembly and 38 minutes in BASIC. The magazine also lauded the language's editor. BYTE reported that the language resembled C closely enough to \\"routinely convert programs between the two\\", and approved of its pointer support. The magazine concluded that \\"Action! is easy to use, quick, and efficient. It can exploit the Atari's full power. Action! puts programming for the Atari in a whole new dimension.\\" Ian Chadwick wrote in Mapping the Atari that \\"Action! is probably the best language yet for the Atari; it's a bit like C and Pascal, with a dash of Forth.

The area of the region is 28,461 km2. Population: This is considered to be the 'fruit basket' of the country, as many of the oblast's agricultural production is dispersed throughout the country, with production peaking during the summer months. Important cities in the oblast include: * Kherson (capital) * Kakhovka * Nova Kakhovka ==Geography== The Kherson Oblast is bordered by Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on the north, the Black Sea and the disputed region of Crimea on the south, Mykolaiv Oblast on the west, and the Azov Sea and Zaporizhzhia Oblast on the east. The Dnieper River runs through the oblast which includes the Kakhovka Reservoir. The oblast includes (within Henichesk Raion) the northern portion of the Arabat Spit, a thin strip of land between the brackish Syvash and the Sea of Azov that is geographically part of the Crimean Peninsula.

The Adrar Region, an administrative division of Mauritania, is named after the traditional region. It is sometimes called Adrar Tamar to distinguish it from other areas called Adrar in the Sahara. ==Geography== The Adrar is an arid plateau, known for its gorges, regs (stony deserts) and sand dunes. Structurally the Adrar is a low central massif which rises to over above sea level just east of Atar near the Amojjar Pass on the track to Chinguetti, then loses elevation and becomes subsumed by dunes to the south and east. Limited cultivation is only possible in the gorges at lower elevations such like oued Seguellil where the water table is high enough to support large palm groves. Notable features include the Oued el Abiod or 'White Valley', a dune-filled fault line along which many small settlements and palm groves are found. The Guelb Aouelloul crater is 3.1 million-old impact crater which was studied by the noted Saharan scholar, Th√©odore Monod. To the east beyond Ouadane is the distinctive Richat Structure, an uplifted and then heavily eroded dome of strata approximately 40 km across and whose concentric rings resemble an impact crater when observed from space. The Adrar region is home to a small human population, centered on the town of Atar. The ancient town of Ouadane, formerly an important caravan and gold-trading centre, is located towards the eastern edge of the Adrar. Chinguetti is another important historical town in the region. ==History== The Adrar was settled in the Neolithic era as shown by cave and rock paintings found in the area such as the Agrour Amogjar. The more recent aridification has left much of the archaeology intact, most notable several stone circles, e.g. Atar Stone Circle, and the later town of Azougui. Beginning in the mid-17th century, migrants from the Adrar Plateau region moved into the Tagant Plateau and displaced the native population.James L. A.

It is the most serious nerve injury in the scheme. In this type of injury, both the nerve and the nerve sheath are disrupted. While partial recovery may occur, complete recovery is impossible. ==Symptoms== Symptoms of neurotmesis include but are not limited to pain, dysesthesias (uncomfortable sensations), and complete loss of sensory and motor function of the affected nerve. ==Anatomy== Neurotmesis occurs in the peripheral nervous system and most often in the upper-limb (arms), accounting for 73.5% of all peripheral nerve injury cases. Of these cases, the ulnar nerve was most often injured. Peripheral nerves are structured so that the axons are surrounded by most often a myelinated sheath and then an endoneurium. A perineurium surrounds that and the outermost layer is considered the epineurium. When injury occurs, ‚Äúlocal vascular trauma leads to hemorrhage and edema (swelling), which results in vigorous inflammatory response resulting in scarring of the injured segment. In most cases, due to the extreme nature of the injury, there is typically complete loss of function. ==Mechanisms == Trauma is the most frequent cause of peripheral nerve lesions. There are two classifications of trauma which include civilian trauma and military trauma. Civilian trauma is most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents but also by lacerations caused by glass, knives, fans, saw blades or fractures and occasionally sports injuries. Of the civilian injuries, stretch injuries are the most common types and are considered to be a closed injury, where the tissue is unexposed. Stretch injures are commonly the result of dislocation, such as a shoulder dislocation that stretches nerves. Opposite of civilian trauma, there is military trauma which most commonly results in open injuries from blasts often by bombs or improvised explosive devices. Other mechanisms of injury are less common but include ischemia, thermal, electric shock, radiation, adverse reactions to certain chemotherapy medications, percussion and vibration. ==Diagnosis== With Seddon's classification of nerve injuries, it is often tough to identify whether a particular nerve injury is neurotmesis, or axonotmesis, which has damage to the nerve fibres but preservation of the nerve trunk. Due to the damage involved in both of these conditions they will both show paralysis of muscles that are supplied by nerves below the site of the lesion, and will have sensory deficits in accordance with the individual nerves that are damaged. The only way to know for sure if a nerve injury is in fact neurotmesis is to allow for the normal progression of nerve regeneration to take place (nerves regenerate at a rate of approximately 2‚Äì4 mm/day proximal to the lesion), and if, after that time, there is still profound muscle paralysis and degeneration in these areas, then it is likely to have been a neurotmesis injury. Neurotmesis is diagnosed through clinical evaluation of symptoms, physical evaluation, and other diagnostic studies. Patients often undergo a series of muscle strength tests, sensory exam which includes feeling the sensation of light touch, pinprick, vibration, and others. Other tests involved with diagnosis of nerve injury are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS). These help to distinguish upper from lower motor neuron disorder as well as diagnose primary muscle disease. ===Classification=== Peripheral nerve injuries can be classified in two different ways. Neurotmesis is classified under the Seddon system which is defined by three grades of nerve injury. The mildest grade is referred to as neurapraxia and is characterized by a reduction or complete blockage of conduction across a segment of nerve while axonal continuity is maintained and nerve conduction is preserved.Sasser, Karen L. \\"Medical Student Curriculum in Neurosurgery.\\" Medical Student Curriculum in Neurosurgery. Congress of Neurological Surgeons, n.d. Web. 11 Nov. 2013. These injuries are almost always reversed and a recovery takes place within days or weeks. The second classification of the Seddon system is referred to as axonotmesis which is a more severe case of peripheral nerve injury. Axonotmesis is classified by an interruption of the axons, but a preservation of the surrounding connective tissues around the axon. These injuries can heal themselves at about 1mm/day, therefore resulting in recovery to be possible but at a slower rate than neurapraxia.Greg. \\"Nerve Injury (Neuropraxia, Axonotmesis, Neurotmesis) and Healing.\\" Current Health Articles. Health Hype, 4 Dec. 2004. Web. 11 Nov. 2013. The last and most severe case of peripheral nerve injury is known as neurotmesis, which in most cases cannot be completely recovered from even with surgical repair. The second classification of nerve injury is known as the Sunderland classification which is more complex and specific. This classification uses five different degrees of nerve injury, the first one being the least severe and the equivalent to neurapraxia and the most severe being the fifth degree and having the same classification as neurotmesis. The second through fourth degrees are dependent on the variance of axon discontinuity and are classified under Seddon‚Äôs classification of axonotmesis. ==Treatment== The first line of treatment is often to treat the patients pain with neuropathic drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants. The second lines of drugs to treat pain are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, tramadol, and opioids. Other techniques used to facilitate healing of the nerve and pain are either static or dynamic splinting that can both help protect the injured part as well as improve function. Sometimes surgery is an option, although the prognosis is still very poor of regaining function of the affected nerve. The goal of surgery is to join healthy nerve to unhealthy nerve. The most common surgical techniques include external neurolysis, end-to-end repair, nerve grafting, and nerve transfer from somewhere else in the body. ==Prognosis== People who suffer from neurotmesis often face a poor prognosis. They will more than likely never regain full functionality of the affected nerve, but surgical techniques do give people a better chance at regaining some function. Current research is focused on new ways to regenerate nerves and advance surgical techniques. ==See also== * Nerve injury * Neuroregeneration * Wallerian degeneration ==References== Category:Neurotrauma Category:Neurology ","title":"Neurotmesis"},{"id":"1273375","text":"Neurapraxia is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system in which there is a temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, usually lasting an average of six to eight weeks before full recovery. Neurapraxia is derived from the word apraxia, meaning ‚Äúloss or impairment of the ability to execute complex coordinated movements without muscular or sensory impairment‚Äù. This condition is typically caused by a blunt neural injury due to external blows or shock-like injuries to muscle fibers and skeletal nerve fibers, which leads to repeated or prolonged pressure buildup on the nerve. As a result of this pressure, ischemia occurs, a neural lesion results, and the human body naturally responds with edema extending in all directions from the source of the pressure. This lesion causes a complete or partial action potential conduction block over a segment of a nerve fiber and thus a reduction or loss of function in parts of the neural connection downstream from the lesion, leading to muscle weakness. Neurapraxia results in temporary damage to the myelin sheath but leaves the nerve intact and is an impermanent condition; thus, Wallerian degeneration does not occur in neurapraxia. In order for the condition to be considered neurapraxia, according to the Seddon classification system of peripheral nerve injury, there must be a complete and relatively rapid recovery of motor and sensory function once nerve conduction has been restored; otherwise, the injury would be classified as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Thus, neurapraxia is the mildest classification of peripheral nerve injury. Neurapraxia is very common in professional athletes, especially American football players, and is a condition that can and should be treated by a physician. ==Signs and symptoms== A variety of nerve types can be subjected to neurapraxia and therefore symptoms of the injury range in degree and intensity. Common symptoms of neurapraxia are disturbances in sensation, weakness of muscle, vasomotor and sudomotor paralysis in the region of the affected nerve or nerves, and abnormal sensitivity of the nerve at the point of injury. It has been observed that subjective sensory symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning sensations at the site of the injury. Objective sensory symptoms are generally minimal in regards to touch, pain, heat, and cold. In cases of motor neuron neurapraxia, symptoms consist of flaccid paralysis of the muscles innervated by the injured nerve or nerves. Symptoms are often transient and only last for a short period of time immediately following the injury. However, in severe cases of neurapraxia, symptoms can persist for weeks or months at a time. ==Causes== The cause of neurapraxia is a neural lesion which causes a temporary block of nerve conduction without transection of the axon. A conduction block is classified as a 40% reduction in action potential amplitude over a short distance on the nerve, or a 50% reduction for a longer distance on the nerve. In neurapraxia, stimulation to the injured nerve results in a greater reduction in the action potential amplitude on the proximal site of the injury as opposed to the distal site. ==Anatomy== Neurapraxia occurs in the peripheral nervous system typically in the ulnar, median, and radial nerves of the upper body and in the sciatic and peroneal nerves of the lower body. Peripheral nerves are myelinated, relatively large, spatially complex cells whose size and connectivity typically make them more susceptible to damage and compromise their capacity to self-repair, although this is not the case in neurapraxia. Microscopic evidence has shown that there is damage to the myelin sheath, but not to the axon. Therefore, distal nerve fibers do not degenerate and the myelin damage can be repaired. === Order of pathology === The order of pathology within the first 24 hours after injury follows a general pattern of nerve injury. The first physical manifestation of the injury is focal swelling adjacent to the site of the injury. In the cellular dimension, a fragmentation of neurotubules and neurofilaments occurs as a result of pressure exerted on the nerve. Axons swell at some sites and are compressed at others, leading to a beaded appearance. === Mechanisms of injury === There are several mechanisms of nerve injury including mechanical lesions, ischemia, immunologic attack, metabolic disorder, toxic agents, and exposure to radiation. The most common mechanism of injury is nerve compression in which external pressure causes decreased blood flow to the nerve and deformation of the nerve fibers. Repeated or prolonged compression of the nerve results in ischemia and ultimately edema above and below the source of the pressure (I). The thinning of myelin sheaths or focal demyelination are the main consequences of the injury that lead to conduction blockage. ==Diagnosis== === Seddon classification === There are three distinct classifications and degrees of nerve injury: *Neurotmesis is the most serious degree of nerve injury. It involves the disruption of the nerve and the nerve sheath. *Axonotmesis occurs when the majority of the supporting structures of the nerve are preserved, but disruption of the nerve fibers is still observed. Wallerian degeneration often occurs in the near the proximity of the injury site. *Neurapraxia is least serious form of nerve injury. There are two different forms of mechanical nerve injury involving neurapraxia. The underlying causes of transient nerve injury typically include a brief ischemic episode or any form of compression. More persistent forms of nerve injury involve demyelination and axonal constriction. In certain circumstances, diagnosing neurapraxia can be uncomfortable because of the presence of severe neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is an indication that the lesion of the nerve is still in progress. Diagnosis of neurapraxia is almost always followed by a quick and complete recovery period. ==Treatment and recovery== The entire nerve is involved in the response to traumatic injuries. The outcome of nerve repair is dependent on the degree of the nerve injury and the circumstances at the site of injury. Since neurapraxia is the least serious form of peripheral nerve injury, recovery and treatment are not extensive. Once the cause of neurapraxia is eliminated, recovery of the lesions in the nerve occurs within a short time span. === Non-operative treatment === Neurapraxia is often treated and cured by non-operative means. The primary goals of treatment are to maintain the proper nutrition of the paralyzed muscles, prevent contraction by the antagonists of the paralyzed muscles, and to consistently keep the joints mobile. A splint is often used in cases of neurapraxia because it is able to maintain a relaxed position of the paralyzed muscle. The splint prevents the paralyzed muscle from being overstretched either by the force of gravity or by other non-paralyzed antagonists. During the recovery period of neurapraxia, it is essential that the joints constantly undergo passive movement in order to preserve proper mobility. If joints are kept mobile, the limb has the best possible chance of benefit from the return of nervous function. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can also help to reduce swelling at the injury site. In addition to these non-operative remedies, it is suggested that muscles affected by neurapraxia be kept warm at all times. Circulation in the limb is stimulated with the use of heat. Once voluntary movement has returned to the muscle, recovery and treatment continues by the participation in active exercises. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy are common sources of treatment during these early stages of restoration of active movement. Almost all cases of neurapraxia can be completely treated by non-operative means. === Treating cervical cord neurapraxia on the field === According to medical professionals with the Cleveland Clinic, once an athlete suffers from an episode of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia, team physician or athletic trainer first stabilize the head and neck followed by a thorough neurologic inspection. If the injury is deemed severe, injured parties should be taken to a hospital for evaluation. Athletes that suffer from severe episodes of neurapraxia are urged to consult orthopaedic or spinal medical specialists. In mild cases of neurapraxia, the athlete is able to remove themselves from the field of play. However, the athlete is still advised to seek medical consultation. ==Prognosis== In cases of neurapraxia, the function of the nerves are temporarily impaired. However, the prognosis for recovery from neurapraxia is efficient and quick. Recovery begins within two to three weeks after the injury occurs, and it is complete within six to eight weeks. There are instances when function is not completely restored until four months after the instance of injury. The recovery period of neurapraxia is not an entirely ordered process, but the recovery is always complete and fast. ==Epidemiology== Neurapraxia is most commonly observed in athletes involved in collision sports, such as American football. Athletes participating in collision sports most often suffer from cervical cord neurapraxia, also known as transient neurapraxia. Cervical cord neurapraxia is the result of a severe collision in which a blow to the crown of the athlete's head forcefully extends or compresses the neck. Numbness, stinging, and/or weakness in the arms, legs or both, distinguish cervical cord neurapraxia. Typical episodes of transient neurapraxia only last a few seconds and symptoms dissipate entirely. Though the severity of the injury can range, transient neurapraxia does not lead to permanent paralysis of the affected muscles. Subsequent spinal cord injury after an episode of cervical cord neurapraxia has not been observed. However, athletes who experience an episode of transient cervical neurapraxia face an approximately 50% chance of a repeat episode if they continue to participate in collision sports. === American football === This tackle which occurred during an Army versus Navy game is representative of those that occur in American football. Neurapraxia is a common injury in all levels of football. Cervical cord neurapraxia among American football players is commonly observed in athletes playing positions involving high-speed collisions and open-field tackling. Cases of neurapraxia in the National Football League were first described in 1986 by Joseph S. Torg, M.D., founder of the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry (established in 1975). As a result of Dr. Torg's findings the NFL as well as other levels of American football have outlawed the act of spearing, or the lowering of the head and hitting an opponent with the crown of the helmet. The cervical spine cannot properly absorb the force of a collision when the head is even slightly lowered as is the case in spearing. In addition to outlawing acts such as spearing, prevention of neurapraxia on the football field relies on instruction and reinforcement of proper tackling technique by coaches and trainers. ==In popular culture== In M*A*S*H Season 4 Episode one, Hawkeye Pierce claims that Radar O'Reilly has neurapraxia as an excuse for driving past a military checkpoint. Hawkeye lies about the causes and treatments to keep them from getting into trouble. When questioned by Radar he asked him if it was a real disease to which he answered \\"Yes but only people that bite their nails can get it\\" which Radar was currently doing. ==See also== * Nerve injury * Peripheral nerve injury * Neuroregeneration * Seddon's classification ==References== == External links == Category:Peripheral nervous system disorders ","title":"Neurapraxia"},{"id":"1273392","text":"Surrey Hills may refer to: *Surrey Hills AONB - an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Surrey, England *Surrey Hills (TV Programme) - reality T.V programme *Surry Hills, New South Wales - a suburb of Sydney, Australia *Surrey Hills, Victoria - a suburb of Melbourne, Australia **Surrey Hills railway station ","title":"Surrey Hills"},{"id":"1273404","text":"==Events== ===February events=== * February 10 ‚Äì Launceston and Western Railway opens as the first line in Tasmania, Australia, gauge between Deloraine and Launceston. ===June events=== * June 8 ‚Äì Devon and Somerset Railway opens its line to Wiveliscombe. * June 18 ‚Äì The canton of Basel- Landschaft grants a concession for the construction of a narrow gauge railway from Liestal to Waldenburg, Switzerland and eventually further to Langenbruck. ===July events=== Toronto & Nipissing Fairlie 0-6-6-0 No. 9 Shedden built in England by Avonside of Bristol, 1871 * July 12 ‚Äì The first narrow gauge railway in North America, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, using a track gauge of , opens to Uxbridge. * July 22 ‚Äì The Canada Central Railway holds an official groundbreaking ceremony at Renfrew for the railroad's section between there and Sand Point, Ontario. ===August events=== * August 5 ‚Äì The New Haven and Derby Railroad, a predecessor of the New Haven Railroad in Connecticut, opens between New Haven and Derby Junction (Ansonia). * August 21 ‚Äì The Valley Railway in Ohio in the United States is founded. * August 24 ‚Äì Hans Gl√∏ersen publishes the first documented idea of building a railway between Norway's two largest cities, Bergen and Oslo, in the newspaper Bergensposten.

This region is one of the few areas of settled agriculture in the country. Culturally, the city is among the most diverse in Mauritania, consisting of ethnic \\"White Moors\\" (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ∂ÿßŸÜ) and \\"Black Moors\\" (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàÿØÿßŸÜ), as well as Pulaar, and Soninke communities.

The market reflects the sub-Saharan culture of neighboring Senegal somewhat more than the Moorish-Arabic culture found further north in the country. Kaedi Regional Hospital Most of the architecture consists of brown, flat-roofed buildings, undistinguished except that most are surrounded by \\"dutch brick\\" enclosures. The one exception is the unusual architecture of the Ka√©di Regional Hospital, which was constructed in 1989 and features multiple beehive-style domes. The award-winning architecture was designed by the Association for the Development of Traditional African Urbanism and Architecture (ADAUA), which aims to develop indigenous African urban architectural designs using local materials and technologies.

Some techniques can also be used with a sturdy umbrella or even a sword in its scabbard. Thicker and/or heavier blunt weapons such as clubs or the mace are outside the scope of \\"stick-fighting\\" (since they cannot be wielded with such precision, so sheer force of impact is more important), as are more formed weapons such as the taiaha used by the MƒÅori people of New Zealand, and the macuahuitl of Aztec warfare. Although many systems are defensive combat techniques intended for use if attacked while lightly armed, others such as kendo, arnis and gatka were developed as safe training methods for dangerous weapons. Whatever their history, many stick-fighting techniques lend themselves to being treated as sports. In addition to systems specifically devoted to stick-fighting, certain other disciplines include it, either in its own right, as in the Tamil martial art silambam, or merely as part of a polyvalent training including other weapons and/or bare handed fighting, as in Kerala's kalaripayattu tradition, where these wooden weapons serve as preliminary training before practice of the more dangerous metal weapons. ==Styles== An artwork depicting stick fighting Stick- fights between individuals or large gatherings between sub-tribes where men fight duels are an important part of the anthropological heritage of various cultures, especially tribes such as the Surma people of Ethiopia, where donga stick-fighting is an important cultural practice and the best means of showing off to look for a bride, nude or nearly so, and their more warlike neighbors, the Nyangatom people, who fight duels bare-chested, the aim being to inflict visible stripes on the back of the adversary, using not plain staffs but sticks with a flexible, whipping tail-end. Traditional European systems of stick-fighting included a wide variety of methods of quarterstaff combat, which were detailed in numerous manuscripts written by masters-at-arms. Many of these methods became extinct but others adapted and survived as folk-sports and self-defence systems. Examples include Portugal's jogo do pau, the related juego del palo of the Canary Islands, France's canne de combat or la canne, Poland's palcaty and Italy's scherma di bastone. Giuseppe Cerri's 1854 manual Trattato teorico e pratico della scherma di bastone is influenced by masters of the Italian school of swordsmanship, Achille Marozzo and perhaps Francesco Alfieri. The French system of la canne is still practiced as a competitive sport. A self-defense adaptation of la canne developed by Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny in the early 1900s has been revived as part of the curriculum of bartitsu. Nivkh people from Sakhalin used long sticks called z'ar t'ar for sacralized ritual fighting. In the US during the early years of the 1900s, fencer and self-defense specialist A. C. Cunningham developed a unique system of stick-fighting using a walking stick or umbrella, which he recorded in his book The Cane as a Weapon. Singlestick was developed as a method of training in the use of backswords such as the cavalry sabre and naval cutlass. It was a popular pastime in the UK from the 18th to the early 20th century, and was a fencing event at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Although interest in the art declined, a few fencing coaches continued to train with the stick and competitions in this style of stick-fighting were reintroduced into the Royal Navy in the 1980s by commander Locker Madden. The art continues to gain a small following amongst the martial art community in the UK, Australia, Canada and the US. Latin America also has its share of martial arts devoted to stick- fighting, including Venezuela's juego del garrote, Brazil's palo do Brasil and Maculel√™, Trinidad's calinda and the South Americans' Eskrima Kombat. Sticks and staves of various sizes are common weapons in Asian martial arts, in which they vary in design, size, weight, materials and methodology, and are often used interchangeably and alongside open-hand techniques. For example, eskrima or arnis of the Philippines uses sticks traditionally crafted from rattan or from butterfruit tree and may be wielded singly or as a pair. ==See also== *Angampora *Arnis *Banshay *Bataireacht *B≈çjutsu *Gatka *J≈´kend≈ç *J≈çd≈ç *Kalaripayattu *Kendo *Kenjutsu *Krabi‚Äìkrabong *Kuttu Varisai *Mardani khel *Silambam *Silambam Asia *Tahtib *Thang-ta *Varma kalai *World Silambam Association *Matrague (Algeria) ==References== br:Bazhata ","title":"Stick-fighting"},{"id":"1273444","text":"Anandyn Amar (; 1886 ‚Äì July 10, 1941) was the head of state of the Mongolian People‚Äôs Republic from 1932 to 1936 and twice served as prime minister from 1928‚Äì1930 and again from 1936‚Äì1939. A widely respected politician, Amar was known for his eloquent defense of Mongolian independence in the face of increasing Soviet domination. Despite this, he proved powerless in preventing Minister of Interior Khorloogiin Choibalsan and the Soviet NKVD from carrying out mass purges of nearly 30,000 Mongolians during his second term as prime minister between 1937 and 1939. Amar's popularity ultimately led to his purge by the pro-Soviet Choibalsan who had him charged with counterrevolution in 1939. Amar was sent to Moscow for trial and executed on July 10, 1941. ==Early life and career== Amar (literally meaning \\"peace/peaceful\\" in the Mongolian language) was born in 1886 in present-day Khangal district of Bulgan Province (then called Daichin Van Khoshuu in T√ºsheet Khan Province) in north-central Mongolia. The son of a poor nobleman, the \\"khokhi taij\\" or \\"impoverished prince\\" Anand, Amar studied Mongolian, Manchu and Classical Tibetan in the Khoshuu school. He then worked his way up from being a local official to a position in the foreign ministry of Autonomous Mongolia from 1913 to 1919. He joined the Mongolian People‚Äôs Party in 1923, and was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the MPRP Central Committee in August 1924. He also served concurrently as a member of the 1st through 7th Small Hurals. From 1923 to 1928 Amar served as deputy prime minister while also holding various other government portfolios at different times including; minister of foreign affairs, minister of internal affairs, and president of the economic council. ==Prime minister (first term)== Amar was appointed prime minister on February 21, 1928, following the death of Balingiin Tserendorj. The Soviets, already suspicious of the prestige he enjoyed in Mongolia, curtailed his authority by promptly assigning him to work in the Institute of Manuscripts. Amar's first term as prime minister ended on April 27, 1930. From 1930 to 1932 he was chairman of the science committee during which time he authored two books; The Tenth Anniversary and Scientific Production (1931) and On the Development of the Mongolian National Script (1933). From 1932 to 1936 he served as chairman of the presidium of the Small Hural (titular head of state). ==Short History of Mongolia== In 1934 he authored the Short History of Mongolia. In the prologue he wrote: > ‚ÄúIt is truly unbearably sad that the Mongol ethnicity, despite having since > ancient times and especially in the time of Genghis Khan run a glorious path > of development among the countries of Asia and Europe, should in these > latter days have been divided into many parts, with some unable to protect > and safeguard their ethnic roots, customs, land and property, revering a > powerful foreign entity while not having any power or policy to carry out > their own affairs or accomplish pertinent actions, not only subjecting > themselves to others' authority but actually striving to accomplish the > policies and interests of foreign entities. Imperialist nations such as the > Manj (Manchus) and Khyatad (Chinese), who have historically tried to convert > the Mongol nation into their trading shops and establish their own sole > hegemony while fixing prices at their own whim for exploitative purposes, > are now at this very moment fighting amongst each other to convert our own > nationally identical Inner Mongolia into their trading shop. And so it is > that the Mongol nation of animal husbandry (Inner and Outer Mongolia) has > fallen so low as to meet the fate of becoming a trading shop of other > nations.‚Äù ==Prime minister (second term)== Amar was appointed prime minister for the second time (and concurrently foreign minister) on March 22, 1936, following Peljidiin Genden's removal from both offices. Genden had resisted Soviet pressure to destroy Mongolia‚Äôs Buddhist churchesBaabar, B., History of Mongolia, 1999, . . p. 345 and had publicly scolded Joseph Stalin at a Mongolian Embassy reception. Although Amar was the new prime minister, Khorloogiin Choibalsan became Stalin‚Äôs new favorite and as head of the newly created Internal Affairs Ministry was the de facto most powerful person in Mongolia.Sanders, Alan J. K., Historical Dictionary of Mongolia, 1996, . Choibalsan increased his power in May 1936 when he had the Internal Affairs Committee rules amended to facilitate the detention high ranking politicians without first consulting political superiors. Shortly after becoming prime minister in 1936, Amar and Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, the chairman of the presidium of the Small Hural, aggravated Choibalsan and Moscow alike when they pardoned prisoners implicated in the Lkh√ºmbe affair in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of the revolution. Amar's enemies, particularly Choibalsan, used the event to connect him to the fictitious Lkh√ºmbe spy ring. Amar was increasingly accused of participating in counterrevolutionary activity causing Choibalsan to exclaim ‚ÄúWe must get rid of this feudal trouble maker Amar!\\" Baabar, p. 354 ===Stalinist repressions=== Amar was powerless to prevent the large scale purges that Choibalsan and NKVD advisers embedded within the interior ministry unleashed on the country from 1937 to 1939. At the first show trial, staged at the Central Theater from October 18 to 20, 1937, Amar openly wept as close friends were sentenced to death. ===Purged=== Because of Amar's continued popularity among Mongolians, Stalin was eager to eliminate him. He instructed Choibalsan to have party leader Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav launch a propaganda campaign against the popular prime minister.Baabar 1999, p. 367 On March 6, 1939, Luvsansharav denounced Amar at an enlarged meeting of the MPRP Central Committee saying he ‚Äúhad helped anti-government plotters, opposed their arrest, and neglected the defense of the borders. He betrayed his own country and was a traitor to the revolution.\\" Once Choibalsan seconded the condemnation, opinions within the Central Committee rapidly turned against Amar. When Amar took the floor in his own defense he said: > ‚ÄúAlthough I believe in religion, the one thing that I believe in even more > is that Mongolia should stand firmly on her feet to become an independent > country. I love my country. I have shown this with my work. I have been > among the first to devote myself to the cause of my country‚Äôs development, > and my heart is breaking to finally witness myself being called a traitor > and being subjected to castigation‚Äù Baabar, p. 367\\" Amar was found guilty at the end of the one-day trial. He was removed from the office of prime minister, expelled from the MPRP, and then arrested by Ministry of Internal Affairs. In July 1939 Amar‚Äôs case passed to the NKVD, and Amar was sent to Siberian town of Chita and then on to Moscow. With Amar‚Äôs removal, Choibalsan was named prime minister and became Mongolia‚Äôs uncontested leader, simultaneously holding the office of prime minister, minister for internal affairs, minister of war, and Commander in Chief of the Mongolian armed forces. ==Trial and execution== Memorial obelisk at the Kommunarka execution site in Moscow, Russia, commemorating the Mongolian victims, including Amar In Moscow, Amar was tortured into making a full confession to all of the accusations made against him. Ironically, while awaiting trial in Moscow Amar was jailed with Luvsansharav, the very same person who had arrested him and who had also fallen victim to Choibalsan's purges shortly thereafter. On July 10, 1941, Amar was tried by a Soviet troika and sentenced to death. Throughout the trial Amar insisted that, if the Mongolian People‚Äôs Republic were really an independent nation, he should be tried by a Mongolian court. His last recorded words were ‚Äúit is typical that when a big power colonizes a small country, its leaders are arrested and persecuted. My personal experience demonstrates this attitude of the USSR towards Mongolia‚Äù.Baabar, p. 369 He was immediately executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground near Moscow, his body is buried there. ==Rehabilitation== On December 15, 1956, after reviewing Stalin‚Äôs purges, military collegiums found no evidence of Amar‚Äôs guilt. On January 25, 1962, he was rehabilitated, and on September 26, 1989, his membership in the MPRP restored. ==References== *Baabar, B., History of Mongolia, 1999, .

In 1999, rapper Jus Allah joined the group to record their second studio album, Violent by Design. Jus left the group shortly after, but returned in late 2006 and began working on the sixth studio album, A History of Violence. In 2011 Stoupe left the group because \\"his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore\\". In 2013, Jus split from the group indefinitely, and Stoupe returned in 2015. DJ Kwestion mainly scratches choruses on the turntable. Kwestion is also a part of the group Skratch Makaniks. Kwestion, who is the tour DJ, was a replacement for JMT's previous DJ, Drew Dollars, who is no longer affiliated with the group due to creative differences. JMT has collaborations with both regional MCs and rap veterans, including GZA, Kool G Rap, 7L & Esoteric, Sean Price, Ras Kass, Canibus, Percee P, Killah Priest, Immortal Technique, Block McCloud, Virtuoso, Louis Logic, R.A. the Rugged Man, Tragedy Khadafi, Chief Kamachi, Necro, and Ill Bill. The group has sold over 250,000 albums in the United States and 450,000 albums worldwide, all of which were released independently. ==History== ===1996‚Äì97: Amber Probe EP and Psycho-Social=== Jedi Mind Tricks officially debuted with the Amber Probe EP. \\"The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological, And Electro-Magnetic Manipulation Of Human Consciousness\\" known as \\"The Psycho-Social\\" for short was released under Superregular Recordings and was JMT's first full-length LP. It featured 12 tracks and 6 bonus tracks. ===1998‚Äì2000: Five Perfect Exertions EP and Violent by Design=== Prior to the release of their first LP, Vinnie Paz had conceived the idea of forming a rotating, collaborative super-group of underground East Coast artists called the Army of the Pharaohs (AotP). 1998 saw the first result of these efforts in The Five Perfect Exertions EP. The release featured Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, Chief Kamachi and Bahamadia as well as Vinnie Paz himself. The EP was later remixed for JMT's next LP, Violent by Design (2000), albeit without Chief Kamachi's verse. The LP was originally titled \\"Polymatrix: Reincarnation of the Hologramic Christ\\". Vinnie Paz became noticeably more aggressive, abandoning his cosmic, paranoid rhyme style from The Psycho-Social CD for more violent lyrics. The LP also introduced Jus Allah, a founding member of JMT who had left for college but dropped out a short while after. A self-proclaimed five-percenter, Jus was present on every non-AotP track on Violent by Design as JMT's unofficial third member. Most of the lyrics in Violent By Design show Jus and Paz describing exaggerated ways of killing people as well as their metaphorical superhuman powers. Typically, they do this by combining themes of hardcore/gangsta rap with mythological or fantasy imagery. The list of guest artists on this album was also their longest, including Mr. Lif, Planetary of OuterSpace, Louis Logic, Diamondback, Philip King Rappah,Coffee Gangsta Child L-Fudge, B.A. Barakus, J-Treds, Killa Sha, C-Baz and Tragedy Khadafi, plus a couple of odd phone-call interludes by Mr. Len. During the course of Violent by Design's 1999‚Äì2000 recording period, Paz changed his alias to Vinnie Paz, inspired by the boxer of the same name. The reason for this has been reported to be the result of a short-lived rivalry instigated by fellow Philly underground rapper iCON the Mic King. Vinnie Paz decided to settle on his new moniker in order to prevent any further confusion. It was also around this time that he formally declared himself to be a follower of Islam, alluding to this fact several times on record. ===2001‚Äì03: Visions of Gandhi=== Mid-2003 saw the release of JMT's third LP, Visions of Gandhi. In an interview, Vinnie Paz said the title was inspired by Foxy Brown's verse in Nas's song \\"Affirmative Action\\", and expresses the need for a prominent figure of non- violent social change such as Gandhi in a post-9/11 world. Stoupe, now supplied with a professional studio in New York, also expanded his variety of production, incorporating grand orchestral samples and a stronger Latin feel. In response, some longtime fans felt let down by Vinnie Paz's lyricism and delivery, as well as the abundance of slick, upbeat loops adopted by Stoupe . Nevertheless, the album helped expand the group's audience as its popularity and commercial success continued to grow. ===2004‚Äì06: Legacy of Blood and Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell=== A little over a year later, JMT continued their creative streak with Legacy of Blood, this time intentionally keeping guest artists to a minimum. Carrying with them their lessons from Gandhi, Stoupe and Vinnie tried to strike a balance between the past two albums. Vinnie Paz also added a more personal aspect to his lyrics, most notably in the last song \\"Before the Great Collapse\\". In February, 2005, Babygrande officially announced that Jus Allah had signed on to the label after reconciling with his former partners. Babygrande released his long-awaited debut LP, All Fates Have Changed, in May of that year. However, after a dispute with label CEO Chuck Wilson soon after the album's release, Jus left Babygrande and denied any new association with JMT. In March, 2006, a reunited Army of the Pharaohs released The Torture Papers LP. The crew now consisted of Vinnie Paz, Chief Kamachi, 7L & Esoteric, Apathy, Celph Titled, Planetary & Crypt the Warchild of Outerspace, King Syze, Faez One, Reef the Lost Cauze, and new Jedi Mind Tricks hype-man Des Devious. This time, however, Virtuoso and Bahamadia were not featured and are no longer associated with the Army. The fifth Jedi Mind Tricks album, titled Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell, was released on September 19, 2006. The release coincided with the beginning of the album's supportive tour, which kicked off in New York City's Time Square. The album was widely acclaimed, unlike the group's two previous albums, which both received mixed reviews. A large part of the acclaim was due to the album's lyrical and musical diversity, both missing from their previous efforts. The album featured the single \\"Heavy Metal Kings\\" with Ill Bill, the Shara Worden-assisted \\"Razorblade Salvation\\", and the storytelling track \\"Uncommon Valor: A Vietnam Story\\" with R.A. The Rugged Man. A day after the release of the album, Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks did an interview with The Breakdown, a show on ItsHipHop.tv where he discussed the album and his thoughts on Jus Allah.https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214228/http://www.itshiphop.tv/shows/thebreakdown/3/1 In early 2006, rumors spread that the group had reunited with estranged member Jus Allah, and that he would be featured on Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell, but no collaboration appeared. However, on September 20, 2006 a newly recorded Jedi Mind Tricks/Jus Allah collaboration, produced by Brods, titled \\"The Rebuilding\\" appeared online. In a January 2007 interview Paz stated that Jus would be featured on the group's upcoming sixth album, titled A History of Violence. Jus Allah, Doap Nixon and Demoz were added to the AotP roster in 2007, and contributed verses to the group's second studio album Ritual of Battle, which was released on September 25, 2007. Also, in summer 2008, Jedi Mind Tricks' Label, Babygrande, released a JMT DVD. \\"With a 12+ year career under their belt and a continually growing rabid fan base, the history of Jedi Mind Tricks has never been officially documented‚Ä¶until summer 2008, ‚ÄúDivine Fire: The Story of Jedi Mind Tricks DVD,‚Äù promises an insightful excursion into the roots of an underground empire.\\" This is from Babygrande's Newsletter. ===2007‚Äì09: Reunion with Jus Allah and A History of Violence=== In an interview conducted in September 2007 on the Art of Rhyme website, Jus Allah announced that he has rejoined Jedi Mind Tricks.Art of Rhyme ‚Äì Jus Allah Interview In the interview he states that \\"I'm back in the group [and that] I'm focused on... putting out the next Jedi Mind Tricks album... a History of Violence.\\" A History of Violence was released on November 11, 2008. This album would be the last JMT album released on Babygrande Records. ===2010‚Äì13: Enemy Soil, Violence Begets Violence, departure of Stoupe and Jus Allah=== After a long time dispute with Babygrande Records, JMT decided to part ways and form their own record label entitled Enemy Soil. Enemy Soil features artists such as JMT, Reef the Lost Cauze, Dutch (the side group of Stoupe The Enemy Of Mankind), and Army of the Pharaohs. Vinnie Paz released his first solo album Season of the Assassin on June 22, 2010. Jus Allah is in the works of releasing his second solo album entitled MMA (Meanest Man Alive). Stoupe released the album for his group, Dutch, (which features Liz Fullerton on vocals) entitled A Bright Cold Day on June 8, 2010. Army of the Pharaohs released their third album as well entitled The Unholy Terror on March 30, 2010. It was announced that JMT would be creating a new title called Violence Begets Violence. This album marks the first album without Stoupe behind production. Vinnie Paz stated in a blog on the JMT website that Stoupe has lost the inspiration for Hip-Hop and decided to focus on other things in his career, such as his sidegroups, and that Stoupe would not be producing any of the tracks on the new JMT album. Vinnie Paz stated that there is no conflict between the two and if Stoupe wants to be part of the next album, Paz would welcome him back. JMT has since gotten numerous producers to fill in the slot and released a new single from the album entitled \\"Target Practice\\". The new album was released on October 25, 2011. In November 2013, one of the first acts on Stoupe's new production company, Bad Tape Music, Red Martina released their debut Intransit with Stoupe as the producer on all thirteen tracks. Other band members are rapper Noesis (from Philadelphia Slick), multi- instrumentalist Ish Quintero, and vocalist Hayley Cass.

From the ninth century, Arab authors mention the Ghana Empire in connection with the trans-Saharan gold trade. Al-Bakri who wrote in eleventh century described the capital of Ghana as consisting of two towns apart, one inhabited by Muslim merchants and the other by the king of Ghana. The discovery in 1913 of a 17th- century African chronicle that gave the name of the capital as Koumbi led French archaeologists to the ruins at Koumbi Saleh. Excavations at the site have revealed the ruins of a large Muslim town with houses built of stone and a congregational mosque but no inscription to unambiguously identify the site as that of capital of Ghana. Ruins of the king's town described by al-Bakri have not been found. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the site was occupied between the late 9th and 14th centuries. ==Arabic sources and the capital of the Ghana Empire== The earliest author to mention Ghana is the Persian astronomer Ibrahim al-Fazari who, writing at the end of the eighth century, refers to \\"the territory of Ghana, the land of gold\\". The Ghana Empire lay in the Sahel region to the north of the West African gold fields and was able to profit from controlling the trans-Saharan gold trade. The early history of Ghana is unknown but there is evidence that North Africa had begun importing gold from West Africa before the Arab conquest in the middle of the seventh century. In the medieval Arabic sources the word \\"Ghana\\" can refer to a royal title, the name of a capital city or a kingdom. The earliest reference to Ghana as a town is by al-Khuwarizmi who died in around 846 AD. Two centuries later a detailed description of the town is provided by al-Bakri in his Book of Routes and Realms which he completed in around 1068. Al-Bakri never visited the region but obtained his information from earlier writers and from informants that he met in his native Spain: > The city of GhƒÅna consists of two towns situated on a plain. One of these > towns, which is inhabited by Muslims, is large and possesses twelve mosques, > in one of which they assemble for Friday prayer. ... In the environs are > wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow > vegetables. The king's town is distant from this one and bears the name of > Al-GhƒÅba. Between these two towns are continuous habitations. The houses of > the inhabitants are of stone and acacia wood. The king has a palace and a > number of domed dwellings all surrounded with an enclosure like a city wall. > In the king's town, and not far from his courts of justice, is a mosque > where Muslims who arrive in his court pray. Around the king's town are domed > buildings and groves and thickets where the sorcerers of these people, men > in charge of the religious cult, live.. A translation into French is > available online: . The descriptions provided by the early Arab authors lack sufficient detail to pinpoint the exact location of the town. In fact, the sources appear contradictory with al-Idrisi placing the town on both sides of the Niger River. This has led to the suggestion that at some point the capital may have been moved south to the Niger River. The much later 17th-century African chronicle, the Tarikh al-fattash, states that the Malian Empire was preceded by the Kayamagna dynasty which had a capital at a town called Koumbi. The chronicle does not use the word Ghana. The other important 17th-century chronicle, the Tarikh al-Sudan mentions that the Malian Empire came after the dynasty of Qayamagha which had its capital at the city of Ghana. It is assumed that the \\"Kayamagna\\" or \\"Qayamagha\\" dynasty ruled the empire of Ghana mentioned in the early Arabic sources. In the French translation of the Tarikh al-fattash published in 1913, Octave Houdas and Maurice Delafosse include a footnote in which they comment that local tradition also suggested that the first capital of Kayamagna was at Koumbi and that the town was in the Ouagadougou region, northeast of Goumbou on the road leading from Goumbou to N√©ma and Oualata. The Soninke Wangara exchanged salt for Bambuk gold, though they kept the source of the gold a secret from Muslim traders, with whom they exchanged the gold for clothing and other Maghrib goods. The king received one dinar of gold for each load of Saharn salt imported from the north, and two for each load exported to the south, keeping each gold nugget for himself. Muslim secretaries were employed to keep records of the taxable trade. Yet, in the 11th and 12th centuries, the Bure goldfields were developed, so that by the end of the 12th century, Ghana no longer dominated the gold trade. The Soninke farmers and traders then settled further south and west in the early 13th century. ==Archaeological site== Trade routes of the Western Sahara desert c. 1000‚Äì1500. Goldfields are indicated by light brown shading: Bambuk, Bure, Lobi, and Akan. The extensive ruins at Koumbi Saleh were first reported by Albert Bonnel de M√©zi√®res in 1914. The site lies in the Sahel region of southern Mauritania, 30 km north of the Malian border, 57 km south-southeast of Timb√©dra and 98 km northwest of the town of Nara in Mali. The vegetation is low grass with thorny scrub and the occasional acacia tree. In the wet season (July‚ÄìSeptember) the limited rain fills a number of depressions, but for the rest of the year there is no rain and no surface water. Beginning with Bonnel de M√©zi√®res in 1914, the site has been excavated by successive teams of French archaeologists. Paul Thomassey and Raymond Mauny excavated between 1949 and 1951, Serge Robert during 1975-76 and Sophie Berthier during 1980‚Äì81. The main section of the town lay on a small hill that nowadays rises to about 15 m above the surrounding plain. The hill would have originally been lower as part of the present height is a result of the accumulated ruins. The houses were constructed from local stone (schist) using banco rather than mortar. From the quantity of debris it is likely that some of the buildings had more than one storey. The rooms were quite narrow, probably due to the absence of large trees to provide long rafters to support the ceilings. The houses were densely packed together and separated by narrow streets. In contrast a wide avenue, up to 12 m in width, ran in an east‚Äìwest direction across the town. At the western end lay an open site that was probably used as a marketplace. The main mosque was centrally placed on the avenue. It measured approximately 46 m east to west and 23 m north to south. The western end was probably open to the sky. The mihrab faced due east. The upper section of the town covered an area of 700 m by 700 m. To the southwest lay a lower area (500 m by 700 m) that would have been occupied by less permanent structures and the occasional stone building. There were two large cemeteries outside the town suggesting that the site was occupied over an extended period. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments from a house near the mosque have given dates that range between the late 9th and the 14th centuries. The French archaeologist Raymond Mauny estimated that the town would have accommodated between 15,000 and 20,000 inhabitants. Mauny himself acknowledged that this is an enormous population for a town in the Sahara with a very limited supply of water (\\"Chiffre √©norme pour une ville saharienne\\"). The archaeological evidence suggests that Koumbi Saleh was a Muslim town with a strong Maghreb connection. No inscription has been found to unambiguously link the ruins with the Muslim capital of Ghana described by al-Bakri. Moreover, the ruins of the king's town of Al-Ghaba have not been found. This has led some historian to doubt the identification of Koumbi Saleh as the capital of Ghana. == World Heritage Status == The archaeological site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on June 14, 2001 in the Cultural category.. ==Notes== ==References== *. *. *. *. *.

It is located on Provincial Trunk Highway 21 (PTH 21) midway between the Trans-Canada Highway and the Yellowhead Highway. It is located in Western Manitoba, 84 kilometers northwest of Brandon. The trading area radius of 20 kilometres has approximately 10,000 people. First known as Hamilton, for Thomas Hamilton, one of the first settlers. Changed to avoid confusion with Hamilton, Ontario. New name contracted from Hamilton with the Sioux word ota, \\"much\\". Dr. John E. Hudson, a notable resident of Hamiota ==Culture== Hamiota is known for its local sports teams, arts and culture community, and quality health care. Hamiota was the home of Dr. John E. Hudson (\\"Dr. Ed\\": 1917‚Äì2003), a member of the Order of Canada (2001) and recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Anniversary Medal (2003). Dr. Hudson led Hamiota District Health Center to become the model rural health care facility in Manitoba. A memorial statue of Dr. Hudson was erected near the hospital in 2004. MP Inky Mark was a good friend of Dr. Hudson, and was the main force behind the statue project. With local support from the former town and the former Rural Municipality of Hamiota, the project was completed. The community offers arts/cultural opportunities through the new Heritage Arts Center. Mid-West Arts Council ‚Äî formally known as the Royal Bank Building, the Heritage Arts Center was constructed as the Union Bank in 1905. Now occupied by the Mid-West Arts Council, the building provides a space for exhibiting of art, serving as the only exhibition space within the district. Hamiota Pioneer Club Museum features artifacts relating to the settlement and development of the district, including a taxidermy display, the former McConnell railway station and their most recent addition ‚Äî Oakner Church. ==Notable associated individuals== Hamiota is the birthplace of former Scottish rugby player Grahame Budge and hockey player Dallas Smith who played with the Boston Bruins. It was the birthplace of John Marks who played with the Chicago Blackhawks and coached in the ECHL league where he has been inducted into the Hall of Fame. ==Economy== The agriculture, healthcare and education sectors are the major employers within the area. Within the last four years, the region has seen growth in the agriculture sector. Over 100 new jobs have been created in Hamiota and area in the last three to four years with many of these in the expanding livestock sector. This growth can be attributed to Kim McConnell (C.M.), the founder and former CEO of AdFarm, who was also named a member of the Order of Canada. ==Education and health== Hamiota District Health Care Centre embraced the \\"community health care concept in the early 1970s. The educational system in Hamiota has remained above provincial averages in provincial exams. The Pope National Wildlife Reserve was used as a water storage area for the railway during the age of steam locomotives, these parcels of land were returned to the federal government with the advent of the diesel engine. The area was designated as a national wildlife reserve in 1972. It is one of the few federally-owned parcels of land remaining in Manitoba, and is an important water source for the wetlands and marshes located downstream. ==Biodiversity== Hamiota has one of the few known nesting sites for the Western Plains garter snake a species once thought to be extinct. A hibernaculum was built for the snakes 6.5 kilometres west of the community. ==Leisure== The Pitlockery Trail takes walkers east of Hamiota to view the marsh life and enjoy the sounds of the bird population. Spring brings warblers, blackbirds and ducks; many stay to raise their young for the summer, only to migrate south in the fall season. Chickadees keep watch over the frozen marsh during winter, awaiting the return of spring. The trail is located along the former railway line. The Chumah Trail allows outdoor enthusiasts west of Hamiota to enjoy the prairie grasslands and native vegetation. A viewing platform for birds has been constructed at the end of the trail branching off to the north. With more tree and bush cover, this trail is better situated for cross country skiing in the winter and is groomed regularly. The trail is located along the former railway line. Hamiota Municipal Park was established in 1967 as part of Canada's centennial celebrations. It is home to seven ball diamonds, an outdoor equestrian arena, horse and cattle barns, soccer pitch, beach volleyball, children's playground, 28 site serviced campground, Hamiota Municipal Museum and the Hamiota Aquatic Centre. Located next to the Hamiota & District Sports Complex and the Hamiota Golf Course, the park is the host for sports. Hamiota Golf Club is a public nine-hole grass green facility. The licensed clubhouse has a food concession, lounge area, and an outdoor patio area. Hamiota Aquatic Center has change rooms and showers. == References == == External links == *Hamiota on the web *Dr. Hudson *War memorial *Panoramio pictures of Hamiota *Pope National Wildlife Reserve *Map of Hamiota at Statcan Category:Former towns in Manitoba Category:Populated places disestablished in 2015 Category:2015 disestablishments in Manitoba ","title":"Hamiota, Manitoba"},{"id":"1273483","text":"==Events== ===February events=== * February ‚Äì The Chesterfield Railroad, the first railroad built in Virginia is chartered. === March events === * March 24 ‚Äì Pennsylvania's first state-owned railway, the Philadelphia and Columbia Railway, is authorized by the state legislature.Rivanna Chapter National Railway Historical Society, This Month in Railroad History: March.

In Luke's genealogy of Jesus, Heli is listed as the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and the son of Matthat (). Heli is not mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, the only other canonical gospel to include a genealogy; that genealogy instead identifies \\"Jacob\\" as Joseph's putative father. ==Two genealogies of Jesus== The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke.; Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.‚Å† Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph's father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.; Traditional Christian scholars (starting with Africanus and EusebiusEusebius Pamphilius, Church history, Life of Constantine ¬ßVII.) have put forward various theories that seek to explain why the lineages are so different,R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary (Eerdmans, 1985) pages 7172. such as that Matthew's account follows the lineage of Joseph, while Luke's follows the lineage of Mary. Some modern critical scholars like Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan state that both genealogies are inventions, intended to bring the Messianic claims into conformity with Jewish criteria.Marcus J. Borg, John Dominic Crossan, The First Christmas (HarperCollins, 2009) page 95. Another possibility is that since both Heli and Jacob have a similar name listed as their father (Matthan in Matthew, Matthat in Luke), a discrepancy that can easily be accounted for by error, that the names Heli and Jacob refer to the same person. Matthew relied heavily on fitting existing prophecy to the narrative; in the Old Testament, Jacob (the last of the biblical patriarchs) also had a son named Joseph.Spong, John Shelby. Jesus for the non-religious. HarperCollins. 2007. . This explanation fits for Heli/Jacob himself, but not for the earlier genealogies. ==The curse on the Solomonic line== If Matthew's genealogy is that of Mary, and Luke's of Joseph, then there is a problem with the curse on the Solomonic line, dating from the time of Jeconiah where Jeremiah pronounced that no descendant of Jeconiah would again sit on the throne of David or rule Judah.ed.

All exponentially stable systems are also asymptotically stable. In control theory, a continuous linear time-invariant system (LTI) is exponentially stable if and only if the system has eigenvalues (i.e., the poles of input-to-output systems) with strictly negative real parts. (i.e., in the left half of the complex plane).David N. Cheban (2004), Global Attractors Of Non-autonomous Dissipative Dynamical Systems. p. 47 A discrete-time input-to-output LTI system is exponentially stable if and only if the poles of its transfer function lie strictly within the unit circle centered on the origin of the complex plane. Exponential stability is a form of asymptotic stability. Systems that are not LTI are exponentially stable if their convergence is bounded by exponential decay. ==Practical consequences== An exponentially stable LTI system is one that will not \\"blow up\\" (i.e., give an unbounded output) when given a finite input or non-zero initial condition. Moreover, if the system is given a fixed, finite input (i.e., a step), then any resulting oscillations in the output will decay at an exponential rate, and the output will tend asymptotically to a new final, steady-state value. If the system is instead given a Dirac delta impulse as input, then induced oscillations will die away and the system will return to its previous value. If oscillations do not die away, or the system does not return to its original output when an impulse is applied, the system is instead marginally stable. ==Example exponentially stable LTI systems== The impulse responses of two exponentially stable systems The graph on the right shows the impulse response of two similar systems. The green curve is the response of the system with impulse response y(t) = e^{-\\\\frac{t}{5}}, while the blue represents the system y(t) = e^{-\\\\frac{t}{5}}\\\\sin(t). Although one response is oscillatory, both return to the original value of 0 over time. ===Real-world example=== Imagine putting a marble in a ladle. It will settle itself into the lowest point of the ladle and, unless disturbed, will stay there. Now imagine giving the ball a push, which is an approximation to a Dirac delta impulse. The marble will roll back and forth but eventually resettle in the bottom of the ladle. Drawing the horizontal position of the marble over time would give a gradually diminishing sinusoid rather like the blue curve in the image above. A step input in this case requires supporting the marble away from the bottom of the ladle, so that it cannot roll back. It will stay in the same position and will not, as would be the case if the system were only marginally stable or entirely unstable, continue to move away from the bottom of the ladle under this constant force equal to its weight. It is important to note that in this example the system is not stable for all inputs. Give the marble a big enough push, and it will fall out of the ladle and fall, stopping only when it reaches the floor. For some systems, therefore, it is proper to state that a system is exponentially stable over a certain range of inputs. ==See also== * Marginal stability * Control theory * State space (controls) ==References== ==External links== * Parameter estimation and asymptotic stability instochastic filtering, Anastasia Papavasiliou‚àóSeptember 28, 2004 Category:Dynamical systems Category:Stability theory fr:Stabilit√© de Lyapunov#Les stabilit√©s ","title":"Exponential stability"},{"id":"1273494","text":"The Spy in Black (US: U-Boat 29) is a 1939 British film, and the first collaboration between the British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. They were brought together by Alexander Korda to make the World War I spy thriller by Joseph Storer Clouston into a film. Powell and Pressburger eventually made over 20 films during the course of their partnership. The Spy in Black stars Conrad Veidt, Valerie Hobson and Sebastian Shaw, with Marius Goring and Torin Thatcher as two German submarine officers. Grant Sutherland, a minister in Powell's The Edge of the World (1937), appears in this film as a Scottish air raid warden. ==Plot== In March 1917, Captain Hardt (Conrad Veidt), a World War I German U-boat commander, is ordered to lead a mission to attack the British Fleet at Scapa Flow, rendezvousing at the Old Man of Hoy. He sneaks ashore on the Orkney Islands to meet his contact, Fr√§ulein Tiel (Valerie Hobson). Tiel has taken over the identity of a new local schoolteacher, Miss Anne Burnett (June Duprez), who German agents had intercepted en route to the island. Hardt finds himself attracted to her, but Tiel shows no interest. The Germans are aided by a disgraced Royal Navy officer, the former Commander Ashington (Sebastian Shaw) who, according to Tiel, has agreed to aid the Germans after losing his command due to drunkenness, and Tiel implies that she has slept with Ashington to obtain his cooperation. The plan is almost disrupted when Burnett's fianc√©, Rev. Harris, arrives unexpectedly, but the spies take him captive. Then the local minister, Matthews, and his wife (who had already met Harris) come to the house, but Tiel manages to get them to leave. Now equipped with the crucial information he needs about the British fleet movements, Hardt rendezvous with his submarine to arrange for a fleet of U-Boats to attack. Returning to the house, and confident that all is going to plan, Hardt makes advances to Tiel, but she rebuffs him. She leaves the house, believing she has locked Hardt in his room, but he gets out and secretly follows her, discovering that she has gone out to meet Ashington. Hardt overhears them talking and learns the truth: the British are fully aware of his presence, and have turned his mission into a trap for the U-Boats. Hardt's \\"contacts\\" are really British double agents ‚Äì Ashington is in fact RN Commander Blacklock, and \\"Fr√§ulein Tiel\\" is Blacklock's wife, Jill. As Jill prepares to leave the island, Blacklock returns to the house to arrest Hardt, only to find he has eluded them. Disguised in Rev. Harris's clothes, Hardt manages to board the island ferry, which is also carrying Jill, a number of civilian passengers, and eight German POWs. Blacklock reports Hardt's escape to the base commander, who explains that the British had learned of the Germans' plan because the real Anne Burnett luckily survived the German agents' attempt to kill her by throwing her into the sea. At sea, Hardt manages to free the German prisoners and they seize the ferry. The Royal Navy pursue them, but before they can catch up, the ferry is intercepted by Hardt's submarine, and Hardt's first officer, Lieutenant Schuster (Marius Goring) decides to sink it. As the U-boat surfaces and prepares to fire, Hardt realises it is his own submarine. He frantically attempts to signal them, but too late ‚Äì the U-boat shells the ferry, which begins to sink.

He worked on nuclear and quantum physics, elementary particles and gravitation, epistemology, and philosophy, and he has advocated responsible scientific and energy policies. In 1987, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"his profound critique of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his work to convert high technology to peaceful uses.\\" ==Biography== Born in Stuttgart, between 1978 and 1992 he was executive Director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich for several times. He was Vice executive director at the Max Planck Institute for Physics (Werner-Heisenberg- Institute) 1972-1977, 1981‚Äì1986 and 1993-1995. Until 1997 he was professor of physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University, both in Munich, Germany. D√ºrr completed his Ph.D. in 1956 after studying physics in Stuttgart (Dipl.-Phys. 1953) and at University of California in Berkeley, supervised by Edward Teller. In 1962 he was a guest professor in Berkeley, California and Madras, India. As \\"the\\" follower of Werner Heisenberg, he specializes in nuclear physics, quantum physics, elementary particles and gravitation, epistemology and philosophy. He was Heisenberg's closest ally in their attempts to develop a unified field theory of elementary particles. He also champions various social justice causes, and helped fund the \\"David against Goliath\\" organization protesting against a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Bavaria. In the 1980s, D√ºrr advocated the cause of peace as a member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. In 1983, he helped co-fund the Scientists' Initiative \\"Responsibility for Peace\\", which led to the Scientists' Peace Congress in Mainz attended by 3,300 scientists and the Mainzer Appell, a declaration against further nuclear armament. In 1990, another large scientists' convention in G√∂ttingen warned against the militarization of space. In support of these conventions, D√ºrr gave a series of lectures at numerous German universities. D√ºrr is a leading critic of the American Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), otherwise known as Star Wars. In 1986 D√ºrr proposed a World Peace Initiative, on a similar scale to the Strategic Defence Initiative, to solve environmental problems, and achieve social justice and peace. This was later reborn as the Global Challenges Network, which received the Right Livelihood Award together with D√ºrr. More recently, D√ºrr has contributed to the global environmental movement. He served as a member of the board of Greenpeace Germany and as a member of the International Advisory Council on the Economic Development of Hainan in Harmony with the Natural Environment in China. In 1996, D√ºrr was made a member of the UN Secretary General's international advisory group for the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul. D√ºrr was a member of the Club of Rome and served on the scientific committee of the Vienna Internationale Akademie f√ºr Zukunftsfragen, advocating sustainable, equitable, and viable development, emphasizing energy efficiency and sufficiency as a point of entry. He was founder members of German Vereinigung f√ºr √ñkologische √ñkonomie.Hans-Peter D√ºrr, 7.10.1929 ‚Äì 18.05.2014, voeoe.de, accessed February 25, 2015. In 2005, together with Daniel Dahm and Rudolf zur Lippe, he published the Potsdam Manifesto and the Potsdam Denkschrift as a follow-up to the Russell‚ÄìEinstein Manifesto of 1955. They were signed by a large group of scientists from all over the world, including 20 laureates of the Right Livelihood Award. From 2006 until his death, he was a founding councillor at the World Future Council, and a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations. ==Honors== *Award of Merit 1956, Oakland in USA; *Right Livelihood Award 1987 (‚ÄûAlternativer Nobelpreis‚Äú), Stockholm; *Waldemar-von-Knoeringen-Award 1989, Munich; *Ecology Award ‚ÄûGoldene Schwalbe‚Äú 1990, Darmstadt; *Natura Obligat Medaille 1991, Bundeswehr University Munich; *Elise and Walter Haas International Award 1993, University of California; *Medal \`M√ºnchen leuchtet' 1996 in Gold, Culture Award Munich; *Honorary Doctor Dr.phil. h.c, 2002, University Oldenburg, Philosophical Faculty; *Gro√ües Verdienstkreuz des Bundesverdienstorden der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, 2004, Berlin. ==Memberships== *Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Halle, 1975; *Rhodes Scholarship Foundation, Vorsitzender des deutschen Auswahlausschusses, Hamburg, 1979‚Äì1982; *Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler, Berlin, Vorstand, 1980‚Äì1986, und Vorstandsvorsitzender, 1991‚Äì97, 2000-; *E.F.-Schuhmacher-Gesellschaft, Kuratorium, Munich, 1980-; *Studiengruppe Sanfte Energietechnologien M√ºnchen SESAM, University Munich 1981-1983; *Naturwissenschaftler Initiative ‚Äì Verantwortung f√ºr den Frieden, Mainz, 1983; *Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, London/Geneva, 1983, Council 1987-97, *Peace-Nobel Prize 1995; *Energiekommission der Landeshauptstadt, Munich, 1983-; *Wissenschaftszentrum M√ºnchen, Vorstand Beirat, 1983-; *Scientists against Nuclear Weapons and for Peace, Sowjetische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Moskau, 1984-; *August-Bebel-Kreis, T√ºbingen, 1986‚Äì1990; *Greenpeace Deutschland, Hamburg, Vorstand, 1985‚Äì92; *Stabilit√§tsorientierte Sicherheitspolitik, Starnberg, Codirector Forschungsprojekt 1986-1988; *Institut f√ºr Friedensforschung und Sicherheitspolitik, Wissenschaftlicher Beirat, Universit√§t Hamburg, 1986-; *Global Challenges Network, M√ºnchen, Gr√ºnder und Vorstand, 1987; *Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR, Berlin, 1987; *International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, Moskau, Mitbegr√ºnder und Vorstand, 1988; *Institut f√ºr sozial-√∂kologische Forschung, Frankfurt, Wiss.

Alzado played 15 seasons, splitting his time among the Denver Broncos, the Cleveland Browns, and finally the Los Angeles Raiders with whom he won a championship in Super Bowl XVIII. ==Early life== He was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York, to an Italian- Spanish father, Maurice, and a Jewish mother with a Russian family background, Martha Sokolow Alzado, and was himself Jewish.77: Denver, The Broncos, and a Coming of Age - Terry Frei - Google BooksRaiders Terror Lyle Alzado Never Walks Away from a Fight‚ÄîOn or Off the Football Field  PEOPLE.com\\"Lyle Alzado Hits Only on Sunday\\", Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal, October 15, 1978 When he was 10, the family moved to Cedarhurst, Long Island. His father, whom Alzado later described as \\"a drinker and street fighter,\\" left the family during Alzado's sophomore year at Lawrence High School. He played high school football and was a Vardon Trophy Candidate (defense) in high school for three years. ==College== Following his failure to receive a college scholarship offer, Alzado played for Kilgore College, a junior college in Kilgore, Texas. After two years, he was asked to leave the team, he later contended, for befriending a black teammate. From Texas, Alzado moved on to Yankton College in South Dakota. Though playing in relative obscurity in the NAIA, Alzado nonetheless gained notice by the NFL when a scout for the Denver Broncos, having been taken off the road by automobile trouble, decided to pass the time by screening a film of Montana Tech, one of Yankton's opponents. Impressed by the unknown player squaring off against Montana Tech's offense, the scout passed back a favorable report to his team. The Broncos ultimately drafted Alzado in the fourth round of the 1971 draft. Alzado went back to Yankton after his rookie season to get his college degree. He received a B.A. in physical education with an emphasis in secondary education. During his college years, Alzado participated in amateur boxing, and made it to the semi-finals of the 1969 Midwest Golden Gloves Boxing Tournament, held in Omaha. ==NFL career== ===Denver Broncos=== When the Broncos' starting right defensive end Rich \\"Tombstone\\" Jackson was injured in 1971, Alzado took over the job and went on to make various All-rookie teams for his contributions of 60 tackles and 8 sacks. The following year, Alzado began to get national attention as he racked up 10¬Ω sacks to go with his 91 tackles. In 1973, Alzado posted excellent numbers as the Broncos had a winning record for the first time in team history with a 7‚Äì5‚Äì2 mark. In 1974, Alzado gained more notice as one publication named him All-AFC, with his 13 sacks and 80 tackles (eight for a loss) he was recognized as one of the NFL's top defensive ends, along with Elvin Bethea, Jack Youngblood, L. C. Greenwood, Claude Humphrey, and Carl Eller; Bethea, Youngblood, Humphrey and Eller are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Denver Broncos posted their second consecutive winning season, going 7‚Äì6‚Äì1. The 1975 season brought change, as Alzado moved to defensive tackle. He responded with 91 tackles and 7 sacks. Alzado took a step backward as did the Broncos with a 6‚Äì8 record. On the first play of the 1976 season, Alzado blew out a knee and missed that campaign. The Broncos were 9‚Äì5 but SPORT magazine reported that 12 players, including Alzado, did not think the team could reach the playoffs with coach John Ralston. Ralston was replaced as coach by Red Miller for the 1977 season. The 1977 season was the most successful in franchise history to that point; the Broncos had one of the NFL's best defenses, went 12‚Äì2 and then beat Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders, the team for which he later starred, in the playoffs to reach Super Bowl XII. In that game, played in New Orleans, they were beaten soundly 27‚Äì10 by the Dallas Cowboys. Still, the year was a big success for Alzado, who was voted consensus All-Pro and consensus All-AFC as well as winning the UPI AFC Defensive Player of the Year. He also led the Broncos in sacks with 8, while making 80 tackles. In 1978, the Broncos again went to the AFC playoffs, but lost the rematch in the first round to the eventual champion Pittsburgh Steelers. Alzado had 77 tackles and 9 sacks and recorded his first NFL safety. (Alzado recorded two more in his career, which ties him for second place all- time). He was 2nd team All-Pro and a consensus All-AFC pick. In 1979, he had a contract dispute, and the Broncos traded him to the Cleveland Browns. ===Cleveland Browns=== Alzado played well with the Browns, making second team All-AFC in 1979 while playing defensive end. He had 80 tackles that year to go with his seven sacks. The following year, the Browns won the AFC Central division, losing to the Raiders in the Divisional round. Alzado led the Browns in sacks with nine, and was All-Pro and All-AFC. In 1981 he recorded 83 tackles and led the Browns in sacks with 8¬Ω. However, the Browns, who fell from 11-5 in 1980 to 5-11 in 1981, traded him to the Oakland Raiders in 1982. ===Los Angeles Raiders=== Being discarded by the Browns rekindled a fire in Alzado, and he worked out with a vengeance. By the time Alzado joined the Raiders, the team had relocated to Los Angeles. In 1982, he was voted the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. Although he played a full season in the strike- shortened 1982 season of 9 games, his play was seemingly so superior in 1982 that he garnered the award. Alzado recorded 7 sacks and 30 tackles while being voted All-AFC. This was the sixth season out of his first 12 campaigns that he received some sort of post-season honor. He continued to perform well for the Raiders in the 1983 season, helping lead them to a Super Bowl victory while recording 50 tackles and 7¬Ω sacks. Alzado started at right end opposite future Hall of Fame inductee Howie Long. He also had an outstanding 1984 season with 63 tackles and 6 sacks, but the next year his tackle and sack totals dipped to 31 and 3 following a mid-season injury. Alzado retired at the end of the 1985 season. He attempted a comeback in 1990, but injured a knee during training camp and was released. In 196 career games, he racked up 112.5 sacks, 24 forced fumbles, and nearly 1,000 tackles, while earning Pro Bowl honors in 1977 and 1978. Following his retirement from playing, Alzado worked as a part- time color analyst for NBC's NFL coverage in 1988‚Äì89. In 2018, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Alzado to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2018 ==Style of play== The man whom ESPN would later label a \\"...violent, combative player known for his short temper\\" inspired the league rule against throwing a helmet after having done so to an opponent's helmet. Peter Alzado, Lyle's brother, later identified the years of their youth ‚Äì marked by an absent, alcoholic father and an over-worked mother ‚Äî as the crucible for Alzado's unremittingly fierce style of play. \\"That violence that you saw on the field was not real stuff,\\" his brother held. \\"Lyle used football as a way of expressing his anger at the world and at the way he grew up.\\" Defensive end Greg Townsend, a teammate on the Raiders, contended that the savagery for which Alzado became noted represented part of a \\"split personality.\\" \\"Off the field,\\" remembered Townsend, \\"he was the gentle giant: so caring, so warm, so giving.\\" ==Outside football== Alzado was an amateur boxer and, in 1979, fought an exhibition match against Muhammad Ali. Alzado was involved in \\"countless youth organizations\\", receiving the Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White award for community service in 1977.Orange Madness, Woodrow Paige, Jr., Thomas Crowwell Publishers, 1978, pg. 99. He appeared in Stop the Madness, a 1985 anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. ==Acting== Alzado pursued an acting career in both movies and television, appearing mostly in youth-oriented comedy and adventure roles. His most notable film roles include the bully construction worker in Ernest Goes to Camp and the unstoppable killer in Destroyer. He also appeared in Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All as a notorious bodyguard and rifleman. He played prison staff member Brawn in the 1990 film Club Fed, and co-starred in the film Neon City. On television, Alzado appeared in a number of mid-1980s commercials for Sports Illustrated with \\"Jack\\", who tries to help him perform the commercial correctly. He played himself, wearing his Raiders uniform, in Amazing Stories episode \\"Remote Control Man\\" He also played himself in a 1988 episode of Small Wonder, and made a guest appearance on The Super Mario Bros. Super Show in 1989. Alzado starred in the sitcom Learning the Ropes as a high school teacher whose secret alter ego is a professional wrestler known as \\"The Masked Maniac,\\" alongside numerous NWA Wrestling stars. Alzado appeared in the series premiere of the short-lived 1991 sitcom Good Sports with Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett, and appeared in episodes of It's Garry Shandling's Show and MacGyver. ==Steroid use and death== Alzado was one of the first major US sports figures to admit to using anabolic steroids. In the last year of his life, as he battled against the brain tumor that eventually caused his death, Alzado asserted that his steroid abuse directly led to his fatal illness. Alzado recounted his steroid abuse in an article in Sports Illustrated, The role that anabolic steroids may have played in Alzado's death has been the subject of controversy. The lymphoma of the brain that took his life has not been associated clinically with steroid use. The claim was denounced as a myth in the 2008 documentary Bigger, Stronger, Faster and by Wisconsin pediatrician and steroid expert Norm Fost but not proven 100% percent.

He co-founded Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, one of the UK's most popular jazz clubs, in 1959. ==Life and career== Memorial to Ronnie Scott, Golders Green Crematorium Ronnie Scott was born in Aldgate, East London, into a Jewish family. His father, Joseph Schatt, was of Russian ancestry, and his mother Sylvia's family attended the Portuguese synagogue in Alie Street. Scott attended the Central Foundation Boys' School. Scott began playing in small jazz clubs at the age of 16. His claim to fame was that he was taught to play by \\"Vera Lynn's father-in-law!\\". He toured with trumpeter Johnny Claes from 1944 to 1945 and with Ted Heath in 1946. He worked with Ambrose, Cab Kaye, and Tito Burns. He was involved in the short-lived musicians' co-operative Club Eleven band and club (1948‚Äì50) with Johnny Dankworth. Scott became an acquaintance of the arranger/composer Tadd Dameron, when the American was working in the UK for Heath, and is reported to have performed with Dameron as the pianist, at one Club Eleven gig. Scott was a member of the generation of British musicians who worked on the Cunard liner Queen Mary intermittently from 1946 to around 1950 in to visit New York City and hear the new form of jazz called bebop in the clubs there. Scott was among the earliest British musicians to have been influenced by Charlie Parker and other players of modern jazz. In 1952, Scott joined Jack Parnell's orchestra and from 1953 to 1956 led a nine-piece band and quintet which included Pete King, with whom he later opened his jazz club, Victor Feldman, Hank Shaw, and Phil Seamen. He co-led The Jazz Couriers with Tubby Hayes from 1957 to 1959 and was leader of a quartet that included Stan Tracey (1960‚Äì67). From 1967‚Äì69, Scott was a member of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band, which toured Europe and included Johnny Griffin and Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis. Simultaneously he ran his octet, which included John Surman and Kenny Wheeler, and a trio with Mike Carr on keyboards and Bobby Gien on drums (1971‚Äì1975). Scott's other bands often included John Critchinson on keyboards and Martin Drew on drums. He did occasional session work, which included performing the solo on \\"Lady Madonna\\", the 1968 single by the Beatles, playing on Roy Budd's score for the film Fear Is the Key (1972), and performing the tenor sax solo on \\"I Missed Again\\", the 1981 single by Phil Collins. Charles Mingus said of him in 1961, \\"Of the white boys, Ronnie Scott gets closer to the negro blues feeling, the way Zoot Sims does.\\"\\"Ronnie Scott\\", Brian Priestley, in Carr et al. Scott recorded infrequently during the last few decades of his career. He suffered from depression. While recovering from surgery for tooth implants, he died at the age of 69 from an accidental overdose of barbiturates prescribed by his dentist. Ronnie Scott's widow, Mary Scott, and her daughter, Rebecca Scott, wrote the memoir A Fine Kind of Madness: Ronnie Scott Remembered, with a foreword by Spike Milligan. The book was published in 1999 in London by Headline Book Publishing. ==Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club== Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club at 47 Frith Street, Soho, London. Scott is perhaps best remembered for co-founding, with former tenor sax player Pete King, Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, which opened on 30 October 1959 in a basement at 39 Gerrard Street in London's Soho district, with the debut of a young alto sax player named Peter King (no relation), before later moving to a larger venue nearby at 47 Frith Street in 1965.Robert Sandall, \\"Ronnie Scott's says goodbye sticky carpets ‚Äì hello decent food and air conditioning\\", The Daily Telegraph, 24 June 2006. The original venue continued in operation as the \\"Old Place\\" until the lease ran out in 1967, and was used for performances by the up-and-coming generation of domestic musicians. Scott regularly acted as the club's genial Master of Ceremonies, and was noted for his repertoire of jokes, asides and one-liners. A typical introduction might go: \\"Our next guest is one of the finest musicians in the country. In the city, he's crap\\". Another memorable announcement was \\"Next week we're proud to have a quartet featuring Stan Getz and violinist Stuff Smith. It's called the 'Getz-Stuffed quartet'. Ronnie often used in later days the services of John Schatt to book rock bands for Ronnie Scott's upstairs. After Scott's death, King continued to run the club for a further nine years, before selling the club to theatre impresario Sally Greene in June 2005. In September 2013, while the club was being redecorated, a 12-metre-square hoarding was placed on the Frith Street fa√ßade as a tribute to its eponymous founder, bearing a giant photograph of Ronnie Scott by Val Wilmer, alongside one of his legendary one-liners: \\"I love this place, it's just like home, filthy and full of strangers.\\"\\"Ronnie Scott's tribute to founder\\", The Daily Telegraph, 28 August 2013. ==Selected band line-ups== As well as participating in name orchestras, Scott led or co-led numerous bands featuring some of Britain's most prominent jazz musicians of the day. ;Alan Dean's Beboppers: 1949 :Ronnie Scott (tenor sax), Johnny Dankworth (alto sax), Hank Shaw (trumpet), Tommy Pollard (piano), Pete Chilver (guitar), Joe Muddel (double bass), Laurie Morgan (drums), Alan Dean (vocal) ;Ronnie Scott Orchestra: ‚Äì 1954, 1955 :Ronnie Scott (tenor sax), Derek Humble (alto sax), Pete King (tenor sax), Hank Shaw (trumpet), Ken Wray (trombone), Benny Green (baritone sax), Victor Feldman (piano), Lennie Bush (double bass), Phil Seamen (drums) ;Ronnie Scott Quintet: ‚Äì 1955 :Ronnie Scott (tenor sax), Hank Shaw (trumpet), Victor Feldman (piano), Sammy Stokes (double bass), Lennie Bush (double bass), Phil Seamen (drums) ;Ronnie Scott Big Band: ‚Äì 1955 :Ronnie Scott, Pete King (tenor sax); Joe Harriott, Doug Robinson (alto sax); Benny Green (baritone sax); Stan Palmer, Hank Shaw, Dave Usden, Jimmy Watson (trumpet); Jack Botterill, Robin Kaye, Mac Minshull, Ken Wray (trombone); Norman Stenfalt (piano); Eric Peter (double bass); Phil Seamen (drums) ;The Jazz Couriers On 7 April 1957, The Jazz Couriers, co-led by Tubby Hayes and Ronnie Scott, debuted at the new Flamingo Club in Wardour Street, Soho.

It can fall on any date from 11 December to 17 December. ==Gaudete== The incipit for the Gregorian chant introit from which Gaudete Sunday gets its name The day takes its common name from the Latin word Gaudete (\\"Rejoice\\"), the first word of the introit of this day's Mass: This may be translated as: \\"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice. Let your forbearance be known to all, for the Lord is near at hand; have no anxiety about anything, but in all things, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be known to God. Lord, you have blessed your land; you have turned away the captivity of Jacob.\\" Philippians 4:4‚Äì6; Psalm 85 (84):1 ==Background== Roman Catholic Gaudete Sunday Mass in which the priest is wearing the customary rose vestments The season of Advent originated as a fast of 40 days in preparation for Christmas, commencing on the day after the feast of Saint Martin (11 November), whence it was often called Saint Martin's Lent, a name by which it was known as early as the fifth century. In the ninth century, the duration of Advent was reduced to four weeks (a period starting four Sundays before Christmas), and Advent preserved most of the characteristics of a penitential season, which made it a kind of counterpart to Lent. Gaudete Sunday is a counterpart to Laetare Sunday, and provides a similar break about midway through a season which is otherwise of a penitential character, and signifies the nearness of the Lord's coming. The spirit of the liturgy throughout Advent is one of expectation and preparation for the feast of Christmas as well as for the second coming of Christ, and the penitential exercises suitable to that spirit are thus on Gaudete Sunday suspended, as it were, for a while, in order to symbolize that joy and gladness in the promised Redemption. ==Theme== While the theme of Advent is a focus on the coming of Jesus in three ways: his first, his present, and his final Advent, the readings for Gaudete Sunday deal with rejoicing in the Lord ‚Äì Christian joy ‚Äì as well as the mission of John the Baptist and his connection with Advent. The theologian Henri Nouwen described the difference between joy and happiness. While happiness is dependent on external conditions, joy is \\"the experience of knowing that you are unconditionally loved and that nothing ‚Äì sickness, failure, emotional distress, oppression, war, or even death \\\\- can take that love away.\\" Thus joy can be present even in the midst of sadness. In his 2014 Gaudete Sunday homily, Pope Francis said that Gaudete Sunday is known as the \\"Sunday of joy\\", and that instead of fretting about \\"all they still haven't\\" done to prepare for Christmas, people should \\"think of all the good things life has given you.\\" ==Liturgical colour== An Advent wreath with the customary single rose- coloured candle for Gaudete Sunday On Gaudete Sunday rose-coloured vestments may be worn instead of violet (or instead of deep blue, in some Anglican and Lutheran traditions), which is otherwise prescribed for every day in the season of Advent. Gaudete Sunday was also known as \\"Rose Sunday\\". In churches that have an Advent wreath, the rose-coloured candle is lit in addition to two of the violet- or blue-coloured candles, which represent the first two Sundays of Advent. Despite the otherwise somber readings of the season of Advent, which has as a secondary theme the need for penitence, the readings on the third Sunday emphasize the joyous anticipation of the Lord's coming. In Anglicanism, the use of rose-pink, previously informally observed, was formally noted as an option in the Church of England in the Common Worship liturgical renewal.The traditional use of rose-pink vestments on this day is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of Common Worship of which an on-line version may be found here. ==See also== *Advent Sunday *\\"Gaudete\\", a Christmas carol ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Bibliography=== : : : : Category:Advent Category:Christian Sunday observances Category:December observances ","title":"Gaudete Sunday"},{"id":"1273543","text":"Fernando de Toledo, (ca. 1528‚Äì1591) was a Spanish nobleman.

Gen. William S. Harney and a band of the Brul√© Lakota along the Platte River in present-day Garden County, Nebraska. In the 20th century, the town of Lewellen, Nebraska, was developed here as a railroad stop. The American force won the battle: the Brul√© women and children they killed made up nearly half the fatalities; other women and children made up most of the prisoners they took. The Army planned this punitive expedition in retaliation for the \\"Grattan Massacre\\" in August 1854, and for raids by Lakota in its wake. ==Overview== The battle was the defining engagement of a short war between the US and the Lakota Sioux over disputes concerning violations of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. In this battle 600 soldiers attacked 250 Sioux, killing 86 and capturing 70 women and children. In March 1856, without authority to do so, commanding Gen. William Harney negotiated a peace treaty to stop further bloodshed with the Sioux. He required a centralized tribal government among the Lakota, by which he intended to hold leaders accountable for the actions of bands. The people were highly decentralized. While the battle was hailed by many newspapers as a heroic victory over the Indians, the New York Times called it a massacre and other critics decried it as \\"outright butchery,\\" because of the killings of numerous women and children. > The lamentable butcheries of Indians by Harney's command on the Plains have > excited the most painful feelings,\\" wrote a New York Times correspondent in > an 1855 dispatch from Washington. \\"The so-called battle was simply a > massacre, but whether those Indians were really the same who have cut off > emigrant trains with so many circumstances of savage cruelty, or whether it > is possible to distinguish between the innocent and the guilty in > retaliating these outrages, are points on which we have no reliable > information.Stu Whitney, \\"Whitney: In defense of Black Elk Peak\\", Argus > Leader, 12 August 2016; accessed 15 August 2016 Some others claimed that the battle was fought only to justify growth in the American army, which was being encouraged by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. ==Background== === Grattan Massacre === The first decisive event that initialized the First Sioux war was catalyzed when a Mormon emigrant lost a cow while traveling with his party on the Oregon Trail; the animal wandered into a Brul√© Lakota camp. A Miniconjou Sioux named High Forehead killed the cow for food. The Mormon farmer reported the cow as stolen to army officers at Fort Laramie. The fort's commander sent out an inexperienced officer, Lt. John Lawrence Grattan‚Äîsaid to be contemptuous of the Indians‚Äîto arrest High Forehead. But under the treaty of 1851, such matters related to livestock and relations with settlers were supposed to be handled by the Indian Agent, who was due to arrive soon. Grattan vowed to take the wanted Indian \\"at all hazards\\" and took along 30 men and artillery.Beck (2004), pp. 46-47 He pressed the chief to surrender the Sioux man. One of his soldiers shot the chief, Conquering Bear, in the back and killed him. In the ensuing battle the Sioux killed Grattan and 29 of his men. One soldier survived the fighting but died later in the Fort Laramie hospital. President Franklin Pierce vowed to avenge the Grattan Massacre, as it was called by the press. The War Department appointed Harney to command, with instructions to \\"whip the Indians.\\" In the ensuing debate, Grattan was blamed for the fracas in which he was killed. === Harney Expedition === The Harney expedition finally set out in August 1855. On September 1, 1855, the expedition caught up with a Sioux encampment along the Platte River in a place known as Blue Waters. Harney sent a regiment in a long night flanking maneuver to set up a blocking position against which he would drive the Sioux. The flanking maneuver was led by Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke and Capt. Henry Heth. Harney moved up in the morning to drive the Sioux against Cooke and Heth. He first attempted to parlay with the Sioux chief, Little Thunder, but his demands to hand over the men responsible for the Grattan attack were rebuffed. The Sioux felt justified in having killed Grattan and his men, as they had shot first. During the parlay, several Sioux braves discovered Cooke's men. ==Battle== Upon the Sioux discovery of Cooke's men, Harney opened the fight by attacking the Sioux camp. Some of the Sioux took refuge in caves along the river. Harney had his men fire into the caves, where they killed many women and children. A large group of mounted warriors rode toward an escape route away from Cooke's and Harney's forces, but Heth saw them and led his forces to block them. The warriors broke through Heth's men, but were pursued on horseback by cavalry with Heth in the lead. They had a running fight for about five miles, which lasted several hours. At some point Heth got so far ahead of his men that he was presumed killed in action. His death was reported in newspapers around the country and he later took satisfaction in the obituaries his friends had written. The American forces were victorious, killing 86 Sioux and taking 70 prisoners, mostly women and children. Women and children also accounted for about half of the Sioux deaths. Among other American participants of the battle was Gouverneur K. Warren. He wrote in his diary about the horror of killing native women and children. He became a Union general during the American Civil War. Afterward, the army made a wide sweep of the surrounding Sioux country but encountered no further resistance. The Sioux called Harney \\"The Butcher\\" for the battle at Blue Water, \\"the Hornet\\" for invading their territory, and \\"the Big Chief Who Swears\\" for the treaty he forced.Utley (1967), p. 119 Following this battle, there were about ten years of peace between the US and the Sioux. The latter tried to ignore the many emigrants on the Oregon Trail, which passed through their territory. The emigrants took game, plants, and water that the Sioux themselves needed for survival. ==Order of battle== === United States Army === Sioux Expedition: Brevet Brig. Gen. William S.

But the expedition had not come within five miles of it, and the Lakota resented this sacred peak being named after a man who had killed so many innocents. Although the Great Sioux Reservation was established in 1868 under another Treaty of Fort Laramie, which included the territory of West River and preserved the sacred Black Hills for the Lakota, within several years gold was discovered in the hills. The US violated its treaty, taking over the Black Hills and other property to enable European-American development. In 1889 the government broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five smaller ones, and sold off 9,000,000 acres of former Lakota communal land. In 2016 the United States Board on Geographic Names renamed Harney Peak as Black Elk Peak. ==See also== * List of battles fought in Nebraska == Notes== ;Footnotes ;Citations *Paul, R.

It was based on the 1943 novel of the same name by Nigel Balchin. ==Plot== Sammy Rice (David Farrar) is a British scientist working with a specialist \\"back room\\" team in London as a bomb disposal expert during the Second World War. Rice is embittered because he feels military scientific research is being incompetently managed. He is also enduring unremitting pain from his artificial foot. The painkillers he has been prescribed are ineffective, and his use of alcohol as an analgesic has led to his alcoholism. His girlfriend Susan (Kathleen Byron) puts up with his self- pitying, self-destructive behaviour as long as she can, but finally breaks up with him, telling him that he lacks the ambition to better himself. Rice is brought in by Captain Stuart (Michael Gough) to help solve the problem of small booby-trapped explosive devices (mines) being dropped by Nazi bombers, which have killed four people, including three children. They receive some useful information from a critically wounded young soldier (Bryan Forbes in his debut). Two further mines are found at Chesil Beach: they look like common thermos flasks. Stuart is first on the scene but has difficulty getting Rice on the telephone in his flat because Rice is alone following his break-up with Susan, angry, drunk and destructive. Rice quickly sobers up and travels to Chesil Beach, only to find that Stuart tried to defuse one of the mines and has been blown up. Rice sets to work on the second mine after listening to the notes Stuart dictated to an ATS corporal (Ren√©e Asherson) during his attempt earlier in the day. He discovers that the mine has in fact two booby traps, not one, and manages to defuse them both. When Rice returns to London, his self-esteem somewhat restored by his success, he is offered an officer commission as head of the Army's new scientific research unit. He accepts. Susan returns to him and they go back to his flat to find she has repaired and reinstated everything he damaged while drunk. ==Cast== * David Farrar as Sammy Rice * Kathleen Byron as Susan * Jack Hawkins as R.B.

The film was shot at a number of studios: Denham Film Studios in Buckinghamshire; Worton Hall Studios in Isleworth, Middlesex; and Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, Surrey. Location shooting took place at Chesil Bank and St. Catherine's Chapel in Dorset; Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain; on the Victoria Embankment in London; and at Abbotsbury station.

It stars Jennifer Jones, David Farrar, and Cyril Cusack, and features Esmond Knight. The film was significantly changed for the American market by David O. Selznick and retitled The Wild Heart in 1952. Gone to Earth is based on the 1917 novel of the same name by author Mary Webb.Gone to Earth The novel was all but ignored when it first appeared, but became better known in the 1930s, as the neo- romantic revival gathered pace. ==Plot== Hazel Woodus (Jennifer Jones) is a child of nature in the Shropshire countryside in 1897. She loves and understands all the wild animals more than the people around her. Whenever she has problems, she turns to the book of spells and charms left to her by her gypsy mother. Local squire Jack Reddin (David Farrar) sees Hazel and wants her, but she has already promised herself to the Baptist minister, Edward Marston (Cyril Cusack).

Many local people were recruited as extras; for instance, the choir from the local Methodist church appears in the film. When director Michael Powell heard them sing, he thought they weren't ragged enough to portray a choir of \\"country folk\\", only to be told \\"But we are country folk, Mr. Powell.\\"TCM Notes The film was a co-production with American producer David O. Selznick. Selznick, who had a penchant for dictating long and rambling notes to his directors while under the influence of amphetamines, flooded the production with memos, most of which were studiously ignored. Powell summed up the relationship this way, \\"We decided to go ahead with David O. (Selznick) the way hedgehogs make love: verrry carefully!\\" ==Subsequent history== ===The Wild Heart=== Although he had been involved throughout the filming, executive producer David O. Selznick disliked the finished film, and took The Archers, Powell and Pressburger's production company, to court to get it changed. He lost the court case, but discovered that he had the right to have the film changed for its American release. Consequently, Selznick had the film re-edited and some extra scenes shot in Hollywood under director Rouben Mamoulian to make the version known as The Wild Heart (1952). Selznick's changes were mostly additions to the film: a prologue; scenes explaining things, often literally, by putting labels or inscriptions on them; and more close-ups of his wife, Jennifer Jones. The most infamous of the alterations are the scenes at the end when Jones is supposedly carrying a tame fox‚Äîin the additional scenes, she is carrying what is obviously a stuffed toy fox. Selznick also deleted a few scenes that he felt weren't dramatic enough, some of which were major plot points, so the story doesn't make as much sense as it does in the original film. In his autobiographies, Powell claimed that Selznick only left about 35 minutes of the original film, but, in fact, about two-thirds remains intact. Overall, Selznick cut the film's length by 28 minutes, from the original 110 minutes to 82 minutes. ===Restoration=== The original version of Gone to Earth was fully restored by the British Film Institute's National Archive in 1985. A New Statesman review claimed the restored film to be \\"One of the great British regional films\\" and, according to Powell's cinematographer, Christopher Challis, \\"one of the most beautiful films ever to be shot of the English countryside\\". ==Trivia== The movie is rather extensively referenced in Jonathan Coe's novel The Rain Before It Falls (2007), where two of the characters are identified as two extras who appear in the foreground in one of the early scenes (around 8:25). ==References* * .

He entered the Uruguayan Military Academy in 1940 and graduated as an officer of the cavalry regiment (1946-59). He became chief of the Republican Guard in Montevideo in 1962. In 1971, he was promoted to general and then named chief of the Combined Armed Forces Command that ran the counterinsurgency operation against the Tupamaros (urban guerrillas). When the military seized power in the 1973 Uruguayan coup d'√©tat, √Ålvarez became permanent secretary of the new Consejo de Seguridad Nacional (National Security Council). In 1978, he became commander in chief of the army. ==President of Uruguay== After Uruguay voted for a return to democracy in a referendum in 1980, the Consejo de Seguridad Nacional named √Ålvarez transitional president on September 1, 1981. Continuing the repression against labor unions, he lost more popular support and also the support of the majority of the military. He agreed to the holding of legislative and presidential elections in November 1984, which had been preceded by internal party elections in 1982. When Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party won the presidential election, √Ålvarez resigned (on February 12, 1985). Rafael Addiego, president of the Supreme Court, then took office as interim president until Sanguinetti was sworn in on March 1. It might be added that while Alvarez did not look favourably upon Jorge Sanguinetti's candidacy in 1984, in his last years found a slightly unlikely defender in Sanguinetti, who argued that the amnesty relating to the dictatorship of 1973-1985 should not be set aside to prosecute even the more overtly military and unpalatable figures such as √Ålvarez, who were prominent during that period. √Ålvarez's loss of support from the (relatively) more moderate members of the National Security Council in the run-up to the 1984 elections and his subsequent resignation invites scrutiny of the relationship between the Council, the military, and the constitutional party leaders. Some would argue that √Ålvarez's accession to the office of president in 1981 marked a high point of his power, which continued until his resignation. Others would argue that √Ålvarez's assumption of the permanent secretaryship of the National Security Council in 1973 marked the real point at which he gained what amounted to substantial executive powers. From whichever perspective, however, the fact remains that General √Ålvarez's public role as a military figure was set against the background of sizeable civilian participation in government in the 1973-1985. It is also the case that √Ålvarez was to some extent sidelined even during his Presidency. In a country such as Uruguay which had some tradition of civilian rule by decree (e.g., during the presidency of Gabriel Terra, whose interior minister Alberto Demicheli later became president in 1976), it is arguably not accurate to equate rule by decree with military rule, although these may at times coincide. ===Military title=== Among the five individuals who became President of Uruguay in the civilian-military administration that lasted from 1973 to 1985, √Ålvarez, was, in fact, the only one to carry a military title. These five individuals were: Juan Mar√≠a Bordaberry, Alberto Demicheli, Aparicio M√©ndez, √Ålvarez, and Rafael Addiego. Some would argue that this fact is significant when assessing the degree of civilian participation in the regime. Others would argue that an unelected president backed by the military may sometimes merely constitute a cosmetic figurehead. ==Retirement and arrest== Although he was covered by a 1986 amnesty, since the election to the presidency of Tabar√© V√°zquez of the Frente Amplio in November 2004, there had been renewed calls for the prosecution of √Ålvarez for human rights abuses, for his part in Bordaberry's 1973 coup, and subsequent events. √Ålvarez's residence in Montevideo became the focal point for demonstrators protesting the disappearance of opponents of the 1973‚Äì1985 civilian-military administration in July 2006. Defenders of such protests could argue that √Ålvarez symbolizes some of the least attractive aspects of the dictatorship of 1973‚Äì1985. On the other hand, it may be accurately asserted that since √Ålvarez was the only serving military individual to serve as president in the five presidencies of that period, such protests, whether justified or not, may serve to obscure the substantial civilian support for that administration by Colorado and Blanco politicians. From the point of view of those parties, therefore, such protests serve to deflect any focus upon the role exercised by prominent individuals in those parties during that regime. In December 2007 √Ålvarez was indicted for alleged human rights abuses during the dictatorship in which he played a prominent role. On October 22, 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for 37 counts of murder and human rights violations; however, he was not in court to hear the verdict as he was ill. Alvarez died in prison on December 28, 2016, at the age of 91. ==See also== * Politics of Uruguay * Vice President of Uruguay#Lack of inherent legal position * Reynaldo Bignone, last surviving dictator of Argentina ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan National Army generals Category:Presidents of Uruguay Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay Category:Uruguayan anti-communists Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ","title":"Gregorio Conrado √Ålvarez"},{"id":"1273579","text":"Flag of the A Burschenschaft (; abbreviated ' in German; plural: ') is one of the traditional (student fraternities) of Germany, Austria and Chile. Burschenschaften were founded in the 19th century as associations of university students inspired by liberal and nationalistic ideas. They were significantly involved in the March Revolution and the unification of Germany. After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, they faced a crisis, as their main political objective had been realized. So-called were established, but these were dissolved by the National Socialist regime in 1935/6. In West Germany, the were re-established in the 1950s, but they faced a renewed crisis in the 1960s and 1970s, as the mainstream political outlook of the German student movement of that period swerved to the radical left. Roughly 160 exist today in Germany, Austria and Chile. ==History== The Students of Jena Take to the Field in the War of Liberation, 1813 (Ferdinand Hodler, 1908-09) ===Origins=== Wartburg festival of 1817 The very first one, called (\\"original \\"), was founded on June 12, 1815 at Jena as an association drawn from all German university students inspired by liberal and patriotic ideas. Like the Landsmannschaften or the Corps, a student association based on particular German region, the Burschenschaft members also engaged in duelling. However, its main purpose was to break down society lines and to destroy rivalry in the student body, to improve student life and increase patriotism. It was intended to draw its members from a broader population base than the Corps. Indeed, the group was known for its middle-class membership while the Corps' was mainly aristocratic. At first, a significant component of its membership were students who had taken part in the German wars of liberation against the Napoleonic occupation of Germany.This article incorporates text from a work in the public domain: Its motto was ‚Äúhonor, freedom, fatherland‚Äù (), and the original colors were red-black-red (what would become the national colours of Germany) with a golden oak leaves cluster, which might be based on the uniform of the L√ºtzow Free Corps, being a corps of volunteer soldiers during the wars of liberation. ===19th century=== The were student associations that engaged in numerous social activities. However, their most important goal was to foster loyalty to the concept of a united German national state as well as strong engagement for freedom, rights, and democracy. Quite often decided to stress extreme nationalist or sometimes also liberal ideas, leading in time to the exclusion of Jews, who were considered to be un-German. Nevertheless, all were banned as revolutionary by Klemens Wenzel von Metternich of Austria when he issued the reactionary Carlsbad Decrees in 1819. Many took part in the in 1832 and the democratic Revolution in 1848/49. After this revolution had been suppressed, plenty of leading , such as Friedrich Hecker and Carl Schurz, went abroad. After the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, the movement faced a severe crisis, as one major goal had been achieved to some extent: German unification. In the 1880s, a renaissance movement, the , led by the ideas of K√ºster, arose and many new were founded. It was also during this time until the 1890s when members turned increasingly towards anti-Semitic outlook since it provided an approach to achieving the fraternity's fundamental goal. Members viewed the Jews as a problem that hampered the unification of Germany and the achievement of new values the organization advanced. There were members who resigned to protest a resolution adopted at an Eisenach meeting declaring that Burschenschaft \\"have no Jewish members and do not plan to have any in the future.\\" Historical records show that the fraternity again accepted Jewish members later on since it was not in favor of racist antisemitism. ===Interbellum and Nazi Germany=== In 1935/36, most north of the Austrian Alps were dissolved by the Nazi government or transformed and fused with other into so-called (comradeships). Some Nazis (e.g. Ernst Kaltenbrunner) and Nazi opponents (Karl Sack, Hermann Kaiser) were members of . Theodor Herzl, an Austrian Jewish journalist who founded modern political Zionism, was also a member of a . However, he resigned two years after he joined because of the fraternity's antisemitism. ===Postwar=== While in communist East Germany were prohibited as representatives of a bourgeois attitude to be extinguished, in West Germany most were refounded in the 1950s. Some of them had to be transferred into other cities, since Germany had lost great parts of its territories after the Second World War, and many from East Germany also tried to find a new home. The allied victors had forbidden refounding originally, but this could not be upheld in a liberal surrounding. In the 1970s and 1980s, the , as many other student fraternities, underwent a crisis: a lack of new members and strong attacks by the leftist student community. In the 1990s many that had left Eastern Germany in the 1940s and 1950s returned to their traditional home universities in the East. ===Today=== Roughly 160 still exist today and many are organized in different organizations ranging from progressive to nationalistic. Among the latter is the Deutsche Burschenschaft organization (), which represents about a third of the . Others are organized in the , the () or the . While the still insists upon Fichte's idea of a German nation based on language, thought and culture, the favors defining Germany as the political Germany established by the German Basic Law (constitution) in 1949 and altered by the 1990 unification. Many are not organized at all since they do not see an organization that represents their values sufficiently.

Most are , i.e. their members must sustain a number of . Academic fencing is still an important part of their self-understanding as well as political education.

health care provider who performs pharmacy-related functions, working collaboratively with a licensed pharmacist. Pharmacy technicians work in a variety of locations (usually in community, retail, and hospital pharmacies), but can also work for long-term care facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, third-party insurance companies, computer software companies, or in government or teaching. Job accountabilities include dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with doctor's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received. Pharmacy technicians often take on the role of Compounding Supervisor, overseeing day to day sterile and non-sterile dose preparation while meeting standards required by regulatory bodies. In recent times, pharmacy technicians also speak directly with the patients on the phone to aid in the awareness of taking medications on time.PCI Calls.\\"CVS.com\\" , as of Oct, 2011US Bureau of Labor Statistics. \\"Pharmacy Technicians and Aides\\" , Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition, accessed February 6, 2011.World Health Organization. \\"Pharmaceutical technicians and assistants\\" , Classifying health workers, accessed July 12, 2011.Humber College. \\"Pharmacy Technician\\" , School of Health Sciences, accessed 12 July 2011. In many countries, both developed and developing, the relative importance of pharmacy technicians within the pharmacy workforce has been amplified in recent years, largely as a reaction to pharmacist shortages, resulting in an increase in their numbers and responsibilities;Hawthorne N, Anderson C. \\"The global pharmacy workforce: a systematic review of the literature.\\" Human Resources for Health 2009, 7:48 alternative medicine, pharmacotherapeutics, customer care, retail and hospital software systems, inventory management, and infection control.Irish Pharmacy Union.

Practical training, such as completing an internship in a pharmacy, is required as part of training for licensing and employment as a pharmacy technician.National Health Service. Entry requirements and training for pharmacy technicians, NHS Careers in Detail, accessed July 12, 2011. Many employers favor pharmacy technicians to be certified with a national or local pharmacy board, such as by passing standard examinations, including paying a fees and liability insurance. In the United States, voluntary certification is available through many private organizations. Elsewhere, such as in Canada, Tanzania and the United Kingdom, pharmacy technicians are required to be registered with a provincial or a national regulatory body or council. ==Training and practice== In the United States, there is no mandated regulatory agency governing the training of Pharmacy Technicians. Each state has a Board of Pharmacy which regulates the licensure of Pharmacy Technicians in their state. Licensure requirements vary widely by state. Some states require training from board-approved schools, PTCB certification, on-the-job training or no requirements at all. There are two National Examinations for the certification of Pharmacy Technicians (PTCE @ www.ptcb.org) (ExCpT @ www.nhanow.com/pharmacy-technician.aspx). The PTCB, Pharmacy Technician Certification Board, has enacted a plan to require an ASHP (American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists) certified Pharmacy Technician education program by the year 2020.http://www.aacp.org/governance/COMMITTEES/professionalaffairs/Docs/ptcb- certification-program-changes[1].pdf This is a hotly debated issue, as training schools have come under great scrutiny regarding the issuance of Title IV loans. According to RxTechExam.com, all that is required to become a Nationally Certified Pharmacy Technician is: # a demonstrated ability of the material necessary to pass the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam # achievement 18 years of age or older # no disqualifying conditions such as a felony conviction or drug related misdemeanor. In Canada, according to a 2007 profile of the pharmacy technician workforce, 43% of technicians work in hospitals and other related facilities, 37% in chain or franchise community pharmacies, and 16% in independent community pharmacies.Canadian Pharmacists Association. The Pharmacy Technician Workforce in Canada: Roles, Demographics and Attitudes , accessed 13 July 2011. Most (62%) obtained pharmacy technician training from a career college or community college, some (16%) had only a high school education and no formal pharmacy training, while about 20% had some university education. A very small proportion (2%) had trained and worked abroad as either pharmacists or pharmacy technicians. The wide range of technical training and educational attainment likely reflects in part the variety of training programs for pharmacy technicians currently available in the different provinces and territories of the country. Accredited Pharmacy Technician diploma, certificate and college programs are offered in the Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.Canadian-universities.net.

They graduate of several universities after three years of training. This occupation appeared due to the lack of pharmacists in Colombia, that is why they are commonly confused with pharmacists. The Pharmacy Regency Technicians in Colombia are regulated and monitored by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. === Germany === According to the German Statistisches Bundesamt, 66.867 pharmacy technicians (\\"Pharmazeutisch-technische Assistenten\\") are working in Germany (status: 2011). About 90% are working as employees in community pharmacies. Their salary (approx. 1.837 - 2.400 Euros) is part of agreements between employers associations and Adexa. === Saudi Arabia === In Saudi Arabia, Pharmacy Technicians are known as Assistant Pharmacist. They graduate of several universities after three and half years of education And training. This occupation appeared due to the lack of pharmacists in Saudi Arabia in 1990, that is why they are commonly confused with pharmacists. The Pharmacy Regency Technicians in Saudi Arabia are regulated and monitored by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS). According to the MOH Statistics, there is about 8.471 of pharmacy technicians work in MOH Saudi Arabia 2015. In 2010, the Minister of Health, Abdullah Al-Rabiah, issued a decision to stop the teaching of Pharmacy Technicians immediately. === Sri Lanka === In Sri Lanka, the National Apprentices and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) has developed National Competency Standards (NCS) leading to the award of NVQ Level 4 certification as Pharmacy Technician for the Pharmacy Employees who are with above 4 years of Experience. The NCS is approved by the Tertiary And Vocational Education Commission in 2016 and presently it is being implemented. There are over 10,000 experienced employees allover the Island will benefit. The one (1) year training will consists of subject areas in Compounding, Dispensing, stock management,House Keeping Practices and Customer care development the 1st batch of 154 certified Pharmacy Technicians are already employed in Community Pharmacy Sector. === Ghana === In Ghana, a 2009 assessment of pharmaceutical human resources identified a total of 1,637 practicing pharmacists (1 per 14,400 population), 918 practising pharmacy Technicians/Technologists (1 per 25,600), and 1,642 medicine counter assistants (1 per 14,300). Nearly half (45%) of pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers across the country reported having one or more vacancies for pharmaceutical personnel, including 82% of public sector facilities.Ghana Pharmacy Council, Ghana Ministry of Health, and World Health Organization. Assessment of Human Resources for Pharmaceutical Services in Ghana , Accra, 2009. Accessed 13 July 2011. In the area of training, the assessment identified only one pharmacy technologists training school in the country (enrolling 70 students in the Higher National Diploma program). === India === In India, Medical Colleges CPR Also known as Mccpr provides full training on pharmacy technician. The basic eligibility in India to enroll in this course is 10+2 or diploma. There are two batches a year that intakes approximately 40 students per batch. === Nigeria === Pharmacy technicians in Nigeria make up 75% of pharmaceutical work force and are looking for their council (pharmacy technician and technologist council of Nigeria) reason being the pharmacist council of Nigeria (PCN) refuses to allocate responsibilities that will give them right to practice at community level interdependently. The case was in court and the court ruled against PCN on 12/3/2008. Nigerian pharmacy technicians in collaboration with NBTE are currently saving Nigerian Economy and Nigerians from the professional monopoly played by pharmacist Council of Nigeria (PCN) which led to abundant fake drugs due lack of manpower. This exposed Nigerian to a lot of problems which lead reduction in productivity leading to sustainable poverty. Nigerian Pharmacy technicians in collaboration with NBTE are able to achieve these by introducing ND/HND in pharmaceutical technology. PCN is doing everything possible to stop this training in order to sustain its monopoly, demanding Federal ministry of education to direct NBTE to stop accrediting the polytechnics while these course are offered in Ghana, Sudan and other countries. The meeting called at the instance of National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) on 25 May 2016 where the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN), representative of the Honourable Minister of Health, Federal Ministry of Education, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) and National Association of Pharmaceutical Technologists and Pharmacy Technicians of Nigeria were in attendance; certain issues bothering on the nomenclature Pharmaceutical Technologists, the curriculum and the accrediting body for polytechnic graduates of pharmaceutical Technology were raised. There it was made clear that the nomenclature (Pharmaceutical Technologist) is not new in Nigeria as the training of people bearing the name were trained at the former School of Pharmaceutical Technologists between 19811 and 1985. The premises of the school is being used as the liaison office of the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) today. It was also established that National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) is saddled with the accreditation of courses offered by Polytechnics and Monotechnics in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As for the curriculum findings revealed that NBTE is in line with the legal instrument that established the Board. Meanwhile, it was unanimously agreed that all relevant bodies should come together to review the complaints of the PCN.National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) === Tanzania === Tanzania has two Pharmaceutical Technician schools: one is a public sector institution under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and accredited by Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, and the other is affiliated with a faith-based organization located in Kilimanjaro which offers diploma training. The practice of pharmaceutical technicians is regulated by Tanzania Pharmacy Council, which enrols and enlists them. The country has 0.11 registered pharmacy technicians per 10,000 population.Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework , Dar es Salaam, 2010. Accessed 13 July 2011. The main job duties of pharmaceutical technicians include dispensing, stock management, compounding, quantification of pharmaceutical formulations, and laboratory work. In some areas of the country facing acute shortage of physicians and other clinicians, pharmacy technicians have also been found prescribing. === United Kingdom === In the United Kingdom, a Pharmacy Technician now must complete a recognised accredited training programme with vocational training to SVQ/NVQ level 3 in Pharmacy Services as well as an underpinning academic knowledge programme such as BTEC or National Certificate (NC) Pharmacy Services. A period of time of working as a trainee Pharmacy Technician is needed before final qualification and compulsory registration is required before commencing work as a Pharmacy Technician. The period of on-the-job training is usually done concurrently whilst completing the course and typically over a two-year period. Pharmacy Technicians may counsel patients on their medication (under the supervision or direction of a pharmacist, though counselling is not one of the learning outcomes for pharmacy technician training) as well as general dispensing of prescriptions. In community pharmacy, it has been recognised that the role is difficult to distinguish from that of a dispensing assistant with an NVQ2 qualification. Additional training is available to qualified Pharmacy Technicians and can include accuracy checking of dispensed prescriptions (though there is no legal requirement that a person be qualified as a pharmacy technician before undertaking an accuracy checking course), Medicines Management (Hospital or PCT), participation in the running of hospital clinics such as anticoagulant clinics, dosing Warfarin patients under dose banding guidance, or other higher duties traditionally done by Pharmacists. As at 2018, there were 32 regulated healthcare occupations in the UK. Three of those - Pharmacy Technicians, Dental Nurses and Dental Technicians - require a minimum of a level 3 qualification on entry (using the levels based on the frameworks operating in England, Wales and Northern Ireland). One has a minimum of level 4 on entry, seven have a minimum of level 5, sixteen have a minimum of level 6 (equivalent to a bachelor's degree) and five have a minimum of level 7 (equivalent to a master's degree). 31 out of the 32 have a level 6 qualification available for entry to the occupation, with the role of Pharmacy Technician being the only exception, only having a level 3 qualification available for entry. Some individual pharmacy technicians may hold other qualifications higher than level 3 upon commencing training, or may gain such qualifications afterwards. In the National Health Service (NHS) pharmacy technicians work under the direct supervision of a senior/specialist pharmacy technician and is accountable to the chief pharmacy technician/lead pharmacist even if not in a dispensary and work mainly in one of two areas, hospital pharmacy and community pharmacy.National Health Service. \\"Pharmacy technician\\" , NHS Careers in Detail, accessed July 12, 2011. Some also work in doctors' general practices and in primary care trusts. In England, Scotland and Wales, since 1 July 2011, qualified Pharmacy Technicians have to be registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (formerly the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) to practise and call themselves a Pharmacy Technician. The title 'Pharmacy Technician' is a protected title and requires the user to register with the General Pharmaceutical Council. A Pharmacy Dispenser cannot call themselves or work as a Pharmacy Technician or register with the General Pharmaceutical Council. Pharmacy technicians in hospitals are graded on the same Agenda for Change banding as audiovisual technicians, dental nurses and theatre support workers. They start on a set percentage of a Band 4 (usually 75% - an average annual wage of ¬£20,698) as a trainee moving on to Band 4 when newly qualified PhT and can work their way to a Band 8b in charge of a department/area. A Band 8b is the equivalent of a Nurse Lead/Senior Nurse Manager in nursing or other Head of Department in the NHS. Although Band 8b is possible, a successful pharmacy technician can reasonably expect to reach Band 7a in the latter stage of his/her career, earning an average of ¬£35,898. Registered Pharmacy Technicians in the NHS may be responsible for the training and development of Pharmacy Support Workers; Senior Pharmacy Support Workers and Pre-Registration Trainee Pharmacy Technicians. Further training and qualifications after initial registration enable them to perform this mentoring role. Pharmacy Technicians in the UK (as with other countries e.g. Canada) are now referred to by some as professionals, although Registered Pharmacists are obviously considered experts in the Pharmaceutical field and are subordinate to Pharmacists. The reference to pharmacy technicians as professionals has been subject to challenge. A report was published by the Pharmacists' Defence Association in 2019 making proposals for the development of pharmacist and pharmacy technician roles and career frameworks symbiotically in community pharmacy. It also outlined various impediments and governance issues and called for these to be addressed. === United States === According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 75% of pharmacy technicians in the U.S. work in a retail setting, such as an independently owned drugstore, a mass retailer chain, or a mail-order or online pharmacy. An additional 16% of pharmacy technician jobs were in hospitals, while others worked for nursing homes, pharmaceutical wholesalers, or the Federal Government. To work in any of these settings, certain requirements must be met. Requirements vary by state. , the nationwide average hourly pay for pharmacy technicians working in retail or independent pharmacies is $12.26 and for pharmacy technicians working in hospital setting is $14.57. ====CPhT==== CPhT is the abbreviation for Certified Pharmacy Technician. The CPhT works directly under a pharmacist, R.Ph or a PharmD. (An R.Ph is a Registered Pharmacist, who is a licensed pharmacist in that state and may have either a bachelor's degree in pharmacy or a Pharm.D.) The profession has different educational and certification requirements in different locales, set by each state's Board of Pharmacy. For example, in order to remain licensed, all Illinois pharmacy technicians hired on Jan 1, 2008 (and after) will need to be certified within 2 years of registration with the Division of Professional Regulation.Illinois Division of Professional Regulation ‚Äî State Board of Pharmacy. \\"National Healthcare Association\\" , Illinois Pharmacy Technician Certification Requirements, accessed September 19, 2011. After obtaining technical school education, an associate degree, or work training, the technician may take a certification exam. Exam preparation may also be provided by some employers. Examinations are offered by two certifying bodies. The first is the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE), which is offered by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB).Pharmacy Technician Certification Board. Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam, accessed March 12, 2012. The second is the Exam for the Certification of Pharmacy Technician (ExCPT) offered by the National Healthcareer Association (NHA).National Healthcare Association. (ExCPT) Pharmacy Technician Certification, accessed August 1st, 2012. Upon successful completion of the examination, the candidate is granted certification. The technician must then complete continuing education to maintain certification. There are many scopes of the workplace for the Certified Pharmacy Technician. In a retail setting, a CPhT works under the direct supervision of a pharmacist who dispenses prescription medication (tablets, capsules, gels, ointment, creams, suspensions, injections, and inhalation medications), and must be familiar with over-the-counter areas as well as third party insurance billing processes. In an inpatient setting, the CPhT works throughout the hospital, packing and dispensing medications in satellite pharmacies and to the various nursing units; compounding intravenous medication while using aseptic technique; narcotic medication dispensing and inventorial procedures; as well as documenting patients' weight, height, drug allergies and other needed information in medication records. ====State of Arizona Pharmacy Technician requirements==== To practice as a Pharmacy Technician in Arizona, one must acquire a license from the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy.

When applying for a Certified License, you will be required to show proof of your PTCB or NHA certification. Both the Certified License and PTCB or NHA certification must be renewed every 2 years. This requires that the applicant successfully complete 20 hours of continuing education before renewing their certification and applying for a renewed license. ====State of California Pharmacy Technician requirements==== The California State Board of Pharmacy is managed by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. It was established in 1891 in order to regulate the practice of pharmacy and sale of poisons in the State of California. As of 2009, the Board consisted of seven pharmacists and six public members, for a total of thirteen members. All seven pharmacists and four public members were appointed by the governor of the state. The remaining two were appointed by the Assembly Speaker and Senate Rules Committee. The Board issues licenses/registration for pharmacists, intern pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians, as well as site permits for pharmacies or other establishments that dispense prescription drugs in the state. All registration, license, and permit renewals are handled by the Board as well as complaints and enforcement actions.

Potential employees that have met all state requirements can expect to enjoy positive employment and salary growth between now and 2020. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this positive growth trend is expected to play out in the state of California as well as nationwide. Around nine percent of the country's 334,400 pharmacy technicians reside in California and the state is home to the top ten highest paying metropolitan areas for technicians. Employment growth is up across the U.S. overall, with California holding the number one spot for employment growth. Salary growth is notable as well, placing California at number three on the list of states with the highest salaries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pharmacy technician salaries and employment figures for California (and the nation) are as follows: ; Pharmacy Technician Employment Growth California: : New Jobs Since 2006 - 5,310; : Population 2006 - 23,360; : Current Population - 28,670 ; Pharmacy Technician Salary Growth California: : Average Salary 2006 - $34,420; : Average Salary Today - $38,380 ; Pharmacy Technician Employment Growth Nationwide: : New Jobs Since 2006 - 51,950; : Population 2006 - 282,450; : Current Population - 334,400; : Projected Increase 2010-2020 - 32 percent ; Pharmacy Technician Salary Growth Nationwide: : Average Salary 2006 - $26,510; : Average Salary Today: $28,400 ==== State of South Carolina Pharmacy Technician Requirements (state certified) ==== South Carolina requires a current Pharmacy Technician Registration, a copy of high school diploma or GED must be submitted, and completion of a formal academic training program accredited by ASHP (American Society of Health System Pharmacists).

It has three (or, more rarely, four) strings and is played upright, with the horsetail-strung bow rubbing against the strings. In central Japan, the koky≈´ was formerly used as an integral part of the sankyoku ensemble, along with the koto and shamisen, but beginning in the 20th century the shakuhachi most often plays the role previously filled by the koky≈´. Since Shinei Matayoshi, a koky≈´ and sanshin musician and sanshin maker, invented and popularized a four-stringed version of the koky≈´ in order to expand the instrument's range, the koky≈´ has become much more popular. A koky≈´ society, dedicated to promoting the instrument, exists in Japan. The koky≈´ has also been used in jazz and blues, with the American multi-instrumentalist Eric Golub pioneering the instrument's use in these non-traditional contexts. One of the few non-Japanese performers of the instrument, he has recorded as a soloist as well as with the cross-cultural jazz band of John Kaizan Neptune. The koky≈´ is similar to two Chinese bowed lutes with fingerboards: the leiqin and the zhuihu. In Japanese, the term koky≈´ may refer broadly to any bowed string instrument of Asian origin, as does the Chinese term huqin. Thus, the Chinese erhu, which is also used by some performers in Japan, is sometimes described as a koky≈´, along with the k≈´ch≈ç, leiqin, and zhuihu. The specific Japanese name for erhu is niko. ==See also== *Shamisen *Sankyoku *Leiqin *Zhuihu *Erhu ==References== ==External links== *Co-Q.com (Japanese) ===Listening=== *Kokyu audio (click small white stars to listen to individual tracks) Category:Bowed instruments Category:Drumhead lutes Category:Japanese musical instruments pt:Kokyu ","title":"Koky≈´"},{"id":"1273598","text":"Kohlit or Kohalit () is a place name used in rabbinic literature, and more famously in the Copper Scroll, a unique \\"treasure map\\" discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS).

He was born in Concepci√≥n on the son of Eulogio Altamirano Araceda and Antonia Adelina Talavera Appleby. He studied law and started a career in the ministry of Justice. During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, he joined the congressional army as an artillery captain. He was a lieutenant colonel by the end of it, a year later. After the end of revolution he left the army, only to return in 1897. The year after, he was named commander of Regiment N¬∫3 of artillery. In 1908 was promoted to full colonel, and named Under-Chief of General staff. In 1911, he was sent as military attach√© to the Chilean embassy in Berlin. In 1912, was promoted to Brigadier General, and named Inspector General of artillery, and Army Chief of staff. In 1919 was promoted to division general, and named commander of the II Division. In 1922, was named Army Inspector General, the highest position in the Army at the time. As such he was in charge of the Chilean delegation to the swearing-in of a new president of Argentina. That year he also was named Minister of War and Navy, by President Arturo Alessandri. On September 5, 1924, and as a consequence of the episode known as the saber-noise, a group of young military officers, led by Colonel Marmaduque Grove and Major Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, demanded of President Arturo Alessandri the dismissal of three of his ministers, including the minister of War; the enactment of a labor code, the passage of an income tax law, and the improvement of the military salaries. Alessandri had no option but to appoint General Altamirano, then head of the Army, as Interior Minister to head a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri's labor code and the income tax proposal. Congress didn't dare to protest, and the laws were passed in a matter of hours. At that point, Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military and on September 9, he resigned, and requested asylum at the US Embassy. General Altamirano became Vice President (a position reserved, in the absence of a president, to the Interior Minister, according to the Chilean constitution.) Congress refused to accept Alessandri's resignation, and instead granted him a six-months constitutional leave of absence. Alessandri left the country immediately for Italy. On September 11, General Altamirano established a military Junta to rule the country, together with Vice-Admiral Francisco Nef and General Juan Pablo Bennett, retaining the position of President. He assumed dictatorial powers and proceeded to close Congress. During his conservative rule, he tried several measures to control the economic crisis and to reform the local bureaucracy. Nonetheless, he lost the confidence of the \\"military committee\\" who had elevated him to power, and was deposed and arrested by another military coup on January 23, 1925. On February 6, 1925 he retired from active duty and died in Santiago in 1938. ==External links== * Official biography Category:1867 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Chilean Ministers of the Interior Category:Chilean Ministers of Defense Category:Heads of state of Chile Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Chilean Army generals ","title":"Luis Altamirano"},{"id":"1273611","text":"Peter Durand (21 October 1766 ‚Äì 23 July 1822) was an English merchant who is widely credited with receiving the first patent for the idea of preserving food using tin cans. The patent (No 3372) was granted on August 25, 1810 by King George III of England. The patent specifies that it was issued to Peter Durand, a merchant of Hoxton Square, Middlesex, United Kingdom, for a method of preserving animal food, vegetable food and other perishable articles using various vessels made of glass, pottery, tin or other suitable metals. The preservation procedure was to fill up a vessel with food and cap it. Vegetables were to be put in raw, whereas animal substances might either be raw or half-cooked. Then the whole item was to be heated by any means, such as an oven, stove or a steam bath, but most conveniently by immersing in water and boiling it. The boiling time was not specified, and was said to depend on the food and vessel size. Neither was the patent clear on the preservation time, which was merely said to be \\"long\\". The cap was to be partly open during the whole heating and cooling procedure, but right after that, the vessel should be sealed airtight by any means, such as a cork plug, a screw-cap with a rubber seal, cementing, etc. In his patent, Durand clearly mentions that the idea of the invention was communicated to him more than a year ago by a friend abroad. Extensive research in 19th century archives has revealed that he was French inventor Philippe de Girard. The relation between Durand and Girard has not been advertised, and the credit for the first canned food patent remains with Durand. The patent itself consists of two distinct parts: first, the description of the original idea, and second, observations by Durand himself. Durand was clearly suspicious of the invention. However, having a curious mind, he performed a thorough test of it by himself, sealing meat, soups and milk, and boiling them as described. The original inventor had only experimented with small food volumes, whereas Durand envisioned future large scale production and therefore preserved up to 30 pounds (13.6 kg) of meat in one can. For unknown reasons, Durand used only tin cans rather than glass vessels. He arranged for the cans to sail with the Royal Navy for a period of four to six months. Several members of the Royal Society and the Royal Institution examined the food upon its arrival, and found that it was perfectly preserved. Durand's patent was dedicated to the preservation technique rather than to the vessel. The technique itself was developed previously by a Frenchman, Nicolas Appert. However, Appert used exclusively glass vessels whereas Durand was the first to mention in a patent use of tin cans. After receiving the patent, Durand did not pursue canning food himself. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, for ¬£1,000. Donkin was involved with tinning of iron from 1808 and was keen to expand it to the food industry. Donkin and Hall set up a commercial canning factory and by 1813 were producing their first canned goods for the British army. In 1818, Durand introduced tin cans in the United States by re- patenting his British patent in the US. By 1820, canned food was a recognized article in Britain and France and by 1822 in the United States. ==References== ==External links== *History of the Can at the Can Manufacturers Institute.

His mother, Rose Maleson, died of stomach cancer in 1938, and his father later remarried. Alpher graduated at age 15 from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C., and held the ranks of Major and Commander of his school's Cadet program. He worked in the high school theater as stage manager for two years, supplementing his family's Depression-era income. He also learned Gregg shorthand, and in 1937 began working for the Director of the American Geophysical Union as a stenographer. In 1940 he was hired by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Foundation, where he worked with Dr. Scott Forbush under contract for the U.S. Navy to develop ship degaussing techniques during World War II. He contributed to the development of the Mark 32 and Mark 45 detonators, torpedoes, Naval gun control, Magnetic Airborne Detection (of submarines), and other top-secret ordnance work (including the Manhattan Project), and he was recognized at the end of the War with the Naval Ordnance Development Award (December 10, 1945‚Äîwith Symbol), and another Naval Ordnance Development award in 1946. Alpher's war time work been somewhat obscured by security classification. From 1944 through 1955, he was employed at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. During the daytime he was involved in the development of ballistic missiles, guidance systems, supersonics, and related subjects. In 1948 he earned his Ph.D. in Physics with a theory of nucleosynthesis called neutron-capture, and from 1948 onward collaborated with Dr. Robert C. Herman (Ph.D. in Physics, 1940, Princeton University, under E. Condon), also at APL, on predictions of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (now widely referred to by the acronym CMB). Alpher was somewhat ambivalent about the nature of his ordnance work. having dedicated much of his early career to this in order to obtain his doctorate. At age 16, he was offered a full scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but it may have been withdrawn after Alpher had required meeting with an alumnus in Washington, D.C., with little explanation or clarification. Instead, he earned his bachelor's degree and advanced graduate degrees in physics from George Washington University, all the while working as a physicist on contract to the Navy, and eventually for the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. He met Russian-Ukrainian physicist George Gamow at the University, who subsequently took him on as his doctoral student. This was somewhat of a coup, as Gamow was a prominent Soviet defector and one of the luminaries on the GWU faculty. His first physics course was taught by Edward Teller, brought onto the GWU faculty in 1935 to give Gamow a peer on the faculty. Alpher provided much needed mathematical ability to support Gamow's theorizing. Gamow often gave talks across the world on \\"The Origin of the Elements\\", which was Alpher's original dissertation. Gamow continues to be credited with Alpher's work on nucleosynthesis. Alpher followed his dissertation immediately with the first prediction of the existence of \\"fossil\\" radiation from a hypothetical singularity‚Äîthe Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. This was observationally confirmed by Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs using a horn radiotelescope. Further research has shown other observations made, but not interpreted cosmologically. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the observation in 1978. Ironically a group at Princeton was given credit for making a cosmological interpretation in an inflationary universe (Big Bang) in a companion publication in 1965 to Penzias and Wilson, which is incorrect. While attending GWU, Alpher met Louise Ellen Simons, who was majoring in psychology at night school and working as a day secretary with the State Department. Nearly two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Alpher and Louise were married. At this time he had already done classified work for the U.S. Navy through the Carnegie Institution for nearly one and a half years. During a hiatus in his scientific work in early 1944, he did apply to the Navy for a commission, for which he was eligible. By this time he had done so much classified and secret work he was no longer subject to the draft (along with about 7,000 others), and prohibited from enlistment. That summer, he signed on to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to work on another classified project‚Äîa new magnetic-influence torpedo exploder. This was badly needed since the Mark 14 torpedo, which had a poorly tested exploder that had its magnetic component turned off by order of the Chief of Naval Operations in late 1943, was badly in need of replacement (V.S. Alpher, The Submarine Review, October, 2009). == Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory == Alpher's dissertation in 1948 dealt with a subject that came to be known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The Big Bang was the picturesque term coined by Fred Hoyle in BBC Third Programme radio broadcast on 28 March 1949 to describe the cosmological model of the universe as expanding into its current state from a primordial condition of enormous density and temperature. It took two decades for the expression Big Bang to catch on, and Hoyle never used it pejoratively Nucleosynthesis is the explanation of how more complex elements are created out of simple elements in the moments following the Big Bang. Right after the Big Bang, when the temperature was extremely high, if any nuclear particles, such as neutrons and protons, became bound together (being held together by the attractive nuclear force) they would be immediately broken apart by the high energy photons (quanta of light) present in high density. In other words, at this extremely high temperature, the photons' kinetic energy would overwhelm the binding energy of the strong nuclear force. For example, if a proton and a neutron became bound together (forming deuterium), it would be immediately broken apart by a high energy photon. However, as time progressed, the universe expanded and cooled and the average energy of the photons decreased. At some point, roughly one second after the Big Bang, the attractive force of nuclear attraction would begin to win out over the lower energy photons and neutrons and protons would begin to form stable deuterium nuclei. As the universe continued to expand and cool, additional nuclear particles would bind with these light nuclei, building up heavier elements such as helium, etc. Alpher argued that the Big Bang would create hydrogen, helium and heavier elements in the correct proportions to explain their abundance in the early universe. Alpher and Gamow's theory originally proposed that all atomic nuclei are produced by the successive capture of neutrons, one mass unit at a time. However, later studies challenged the universality of the successive capture theory, since no element was found to have a stable isotope with an atomic mass of five or eight, hindering the production of elements beyond helium. It was eventually recognized that most of the heavy elements observed in the present universe are the result of stellar nucleosynthesis in stars, a theory largely developed by Hans Bethe, William Fowler and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Bethe had been a last minute addition to Alpher's dissertation examining committee. Since Alpher's dissertation was perceived to be ground-breaking, over 300 people attended the dissertation defense, including the press, and articles about his predictions and a Herblock cartoon appeared in major newspapers. This was quite unusual for a doctoral dissertation. Later the same year, collaborating with Robert Herman, Alpher predicted the temperature of the residual radiation known as cosmic microwave background radiation resulting from the hypothesized Big Bang. Alpher and Herman first estimated the temperature of the cosmic microwave background as 5¬∞ K, and two years later they re-estimated it as 28¬∞ K. However, Alpher's predictions concerning the cosmic background radiation were more or less forgotten until they were rediscovered by Robert Dicke and Yakov Zel'dovich in the early 1960s. The existence of the cosmic background radiation and its temperature were measured experimentally in 1964 by two physicists working for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for this work in 1978. Elements of Alpher's independent dissertation were first published on April 1, 1948 in the Physical Review with three authors: Alpher, Hans Bethe and Gamow. Although his name appears on the paper, Bethe had no direct part in the development of the theory, although he later worked on related topics; Gamow added his name to make the author list Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, a pun on alpha, beta, gamma (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥), the first three letters of the Greek alphabet. Gamow joked that \\"There was, however, a rumor that later, when the alpha, beta, gamma theory went temporarily on the rocks, Bethe seriously considered changing his name to Zacharias\\". When referring to Robert Herman he wrote: \\"R. C. Herman, who stubbornly refuses to change his name to Delter.\\" Alpher worried that the humor engendered by Gamow may have obscured his own critical role in developing the theory. With the award of the 2005 National Medal of Science, Alpher's original work on nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background radiation prediction was recognised. Neil deGrasse Tyson was instrumental in a NSF committee recommendation (personal communication to Dr. Victor S. Alpher, July 26, 2007). Alpher and Robert Herman were awarded the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1993. They were also awarded the Magellanic Premium of the American Philosophical Society in 1975, the Georges Vanderlinden Physics prize of the Belgian Academy of Sciences, as well as significant awards of the New York Academy of Sciences and the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. Two Nobel Prizes in physics have been awarded for empirical work related to the cosmic background radiation ‚Äî in 1978 to Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson and in 2006 to John Mather and George Smoot. Alpher and Herman (the latter, posthumously) published their own account of their work in cosmology in 2001, Genesis of the Big Bang (Oxford University Press). Published as a trade book, it received little promotion or sales in the first edition. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 2005 Alpher was awarded the National Medal of Science. The citation for the award reads \\"For his unprecedented work in the areas of nucleosynthesis, for the prediction that universe expansion leaves behind background radiation, and for providing the model for the Big Bang theory.\\" The medal was presented to his son, Dr. Victor S. Alpher, on July 27, 2007 by President George W. Bush, as his father could not travel to receive the award. Ralph Alpher died following an extended illness on August 12, 2007. He had been in failing health since falling and breaking his hip in February 2007. == Later career == In 1955 Alpher moved to a position with the General Electric Company's Research and Development Center. His primary role in his early years there was working on problems of vehicle re-entry from space. During the late 1940s at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, he worked as a member of John van Allen's work group, studying cosmic rays with high altitude balloons. In 1955, both Alpher and Herman applied for positions at Iowa, where van Allen was now department chair, however, the salaries in academia were simply too low to support families. Alpher also continued to collaborate with Robert Herman, who had moved to the General Motors Research Laboratory, on problems in cosmology. The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was finally confirmed in 1964, although in retrospect many other astronomers and radio astronomers probably observed it without recognizing the cosmological significance.Alpher & Herman, \\"Genesis of the Big Bang\\", Oxford Press, 2001. From 1987 to 2004 he served as distinguished research professor of physics and astronomy at Union College in Schenectady, New York, during which time he was able to return to research and teaching. During all this time he continued to publish major peer-reviewed scientific papers and was active in community service for Public Broadcasting. Alpher was also (1987‚Äì2004) director of The Dudley Observatory. In 1986 he was recognized with the Distinguished Alumnus Achievement Award of the George Washington University. All of his degrees were achieved by studying at night whilst working for the navy and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory during the daytime. In 2004 he joined the emeritus faculty at Union and was emeritus director of Dudley. He also received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Union College and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. From 2005 until his death, he remained emeritus director of the Dudley Observatory and emeritus distinguished professor of physics and astronomy at Union College. == Alpher's approach to science == Alpher told Joseph D'Agnese in his interview for Discover Magazine, \\"There are two reasons you do science. One is the altruistic feeling that maybe you can contribute to mankind's store of knowledge about the world. The other and more personal thing is you want the approbation of your peers. Pure and simple.\\" Ralph Alpher told his son Victor in 1980, when considering advanced education, that approbation of anyone was not the reason to pursue graduate study or a career requiring advanced intensive study. Rather, he said to Victor, \\"you must enjoy and find satisfaction in the work you do every day, because you will not receive frequent rewards or pats on the back.\\" Up to that time, he had received only three awards for his work in cosmology, from the American Philosophical Society, the Belgian Academy of Science, and the Franklin Institute‚Äîall occurring after he turned 50. == Personal life and views == Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he later on became an agnostic and considered himself to be a humanist. == See also == * List of Jewish American physicists * Nobel Prize controversies == References == == External links == * Website about Alpher maintained by his son Victor S.

Roughly speaking, a system is stable if it always returns to and stays near a particular state (called the steady state), and is unstable if it goes farther and farther away from any state, without being bounded. A marginal system, sometimes referred to as having neutral stability, is between these two types: when displaced, it does not return to near a common steady state, nor does it go away from where it started without limit. Marginal stability, like instability, is a feature that control theory seeks to avoid; we wish that, when perturbed by some external force, a system will return to a desired state. This necessitates the use of appropriately designed control algorithms. In econometrics, the presence of a unit root in observed time series, rendering them marginally stable, can lead to invalid regression results regarding effects of the independent variables upon a dependent variable, unless appropriate techniques are used to convert the system to a stable system. ==Continuous time== A homogeneous continuous linear time- invariant system is marginally stable if and only if the real part of every pole (eigenvalue) in the system's transfer-function is non-positive, one or more poles have zero real part and non-zero imaginary part, and all poles with zero real part are simple roots (i.e. the poles on the imaginary axis are all distinct from one another). In contrast, if all the poles have strictly negative real parts, the system is instead asymptotically stable. If one or more poles have positive real parts, the system is unstable. If the system is in state space representation, marginal stability can be analyzed by deriving the Jordan normal form: if and only if the Jordan blocks corresponding to poles with zero real part are scalar is the system marginally stable. ==Discrete time== A homogeneous discrete time linear time-invariant system is marginally stable if and only if the greatest magnitude of any of the poles (eigenvalues) of the transfer function is 1, and the poles with magnitude equal to 1 are all distinct. That is, the transfer function's spectral radius is 1. If the spectral radius is less than 1, the system is instead asymptotically stable. A simple example involves a single first-order linear difference equation: Suppose a state variable x evolves according to :x_t=ax_{t-1} with parameter a > 0. If the system is perturbed to the value x_0, its subsequent sequence of values is ax_0, \\\\, a^2x_0, \\\\, a^3x_0, \\\\, \\\\dots . If a < 1, these numbers get closer and closer to 0 regardless of the starting value x_0, while if a > 1 the numbers get larger and larger without bound. But if a = 1, the numbers do neither of these: instead, all future values of x equal the value x_0. Thus the case a = 1 exhibits marginal stability. ==System response== A marginally stable system is one that, if given an impulse of finite magnitude as input, will not \\"blow up\\" and give an unbounded output, but neither will the output return to zero. A bounded offset or oscillations in the output will persist indefinitely, and so there will in general be no final steady-state output. If a continuous system is given an input at a frequency equal to the frequency of a pole with zero real part, the system's output will increase indefinitely (this is known as pure resonance). This explains why for a system to be BIBO stable, the real parts of the poles have to be strictly negative (and not just non-positive). A continuous system having imaginary poles, i.e. having zero real part in the pole(s), will produce sustained oscillations in the output. For example, an undamped second- order system such as the suspension system in an automobile (a mass‚Äìspring‚Äìdamper system), from which the damper has been removed and spring is ideal, i.e. no friction is there, will in theory oscillate forever once disturbed. Another example is a frictionless pendulum. A system with a pole at the origin is also marginally stable but in this case there will be no oscillation in the response as the imaginary part is also zero (jw = 0 means w = 0 rad/sec). An example of such a system is a mass on a surface with friction. When a sidewards impulse is applied, the mass will move and never returns to zero. The mass will come to rest due to friction however, and the sidewards movement will remain bounded. Since the locations of the marginal poles must be exactly on the imaginary axis or unit circle (for continuous time and discrete time systems respectively) for a system to be marginally stable, this situation is unlikely to occur in practice unless marginal stability is an inherent theoretical feature of the system. ==Stochastic dynamics== Marginal stability is also an important concept in the context of stochastic dynamics. For example, some processes may follow a random walk, given in discrete time as :x_t=x_{t-1}+e_t, where e_t is an i.i.d. error term. This equation has a unit root (a value of 1 for the eigenvalue of its characteristic equation), and hence exhibits marginal stability, so special time series techniques must be used in empirically modeling a system containing such an equation. ==See also== *Lyapunov stability *Exponential stability ==References== Category:Dynamical systems Category:Stability theory ","title":"Marginal stability"},{"id":"1273630","text":"Montville may refer to: ==Places== ===Australia=== *Montville, Queensland ===France=== *Montville, Seine-Maritime ===United States=== *Montville, Connecticut *Montville, Maine *Montville, New Jersey *Montville Township, Geauga County, Ohio **Montville, Ohio *Montville Township, Medina County, Ohio ==People== *Leigh Montville (born 1943), American sports reporter and author ==See also== * ","title":"Montville"},{"id":"1273631","text":"Cape Breton fiddling is a regional violin style which falls within the Celtic music idiom. Cape Breton Island's fiddle music was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the Highland Clearances. These Scottish immigrants were primarily from Gaelic-speaking regions in the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides. Although fiddling has changed considerably since this time in Scotland, it is widely held that the tradition of Scottish fiddle music has been better preserved in Cape Breton. Dance styles associated with the music are Cape Breton step dancing, Cape Breton square dancing (Iona style and Inverness style), and highland dancing. In 2005, as a tribute to the area's traditional music, the construction of a tourism center and the world's largest fiddle and bow was completed on the waterfront in Sydney, Nova Scotia. ==Playing style== Cape Breton playing is highly accented, characterized by driven up-bowing. The tunes of other music origins (Irish, Canadian, French- Canadian, etc.) sound quite different when performed by Cape Breton players. The strong downbeat pulse is driven by the fiddler's heel into the floor. The pattern tends to be heel-and-toe on reels, the heel on strathspeys. Cape Breton fiddle music is strongly influenced by the intonations of the Scots- Gaelic language, especially Puirt a Beul (mouth music) and strathspeys. The ornaments are adapted from those used on the Great Highland bagpipe. The ornamentation (cuts aka. trebles, drones and doubling) brings out the strong feeling of Cape Breton fiddle. A century ago the violin and pump organ were the common instruments; the latter has been supplanted by piano. ==Repertoire== The types of tunes commonly associated with Cape Breton fiddling are jigs, reels, marches, strathspeys, clogs (hornpipes), and slow airs. Many of the tunes associated with Cape Breton fiddle music are also commonly performed on other instruments, especially bagpipes, piano and guitar. It is not unheard of for the music to be performed on harmonica, tin whistle, mandolin or banjo.

He is best known for his longtime association with Eminem as well as his solo career, recording primarily with producers Carlos \\"6 July\\" Broady and DJ Premier, as well as ghostwriting for the likes of Diddy and Dr. Dre. Royce is currently one half of the rap duo Bad Meets Evil with Eminem and one half of the hip hop duo PRhyme with DJ Premier. He was also one quarter of the hip hop group Slaughterhouse with Joe Budden, Joell Ortiz and Kxng Crooked. The editors of About.com ranked him No. 31 on their list of the \\"Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987‚Äì2007)\\". ==Early life== In an interview with DJ Vlad on YouTube, Royce stated that his only early stage name prior to the \\"Royce\\" nickname was R-Dog, which \\"didn't even last a year\\". He moved to Oak Park, Michigan when he was 10 years old, later acquiring the nickname \\"Royce\\" during high school after wearing a British link chain with an R pendant resembling the Rolls Royce symbol. Royce's name comes from his height, 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm). However, the numbers five and nine have been in his life numerous times as he \\"found his calling\\" as a rapper in 1995 and in his song \\"Tabernacle\\" he discusses his grandmother dying on the fifth floor of a hospital and his first son being born on the ninth. Similar instances suggest that his name has numerous meanings besides his height. He started rapping at age 18, influenced mainly by Ras Kass, Redman, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Esham, Detroit's Most Wanted, and N.W.A.\\"Royce Da 5'9\\" Interview\\", Hip Hop Galaxy, 22 July 2005 .

After Tommy Boy Records shut down, he signed a deal with Columbia and Game Recordings where he started recording an album called Rock City, referring to Detroit's former status as home to Motown Records. When the project was heavily bootlegged, Royce left the label for Koch to re-record some of the album, eventually releasing it in 2002 as Rock City (Version 2.0). While the album did not sell very well, the DJ Premier-produced single \\"Boom\\" gained Royce some underground recognition and eventually resulted in the two working together more closely. ==Career== ===1997‚Äì2001: Early years=== Through his manager Kino Childrey, Royce was introduced to Eminem on December 29, 1997 at a concert, and the two formed a working relationship; they formed up as a duo, Bad Meets Evil, and released several tracks together. On August 20, 1998, Royce and Eminem both appeared on The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show for the first time. Furthermore, Royce appeared on Eminem's major-label debut studio album The Slim Shady LP, in which he was featured on a song called \\"Bad Meets Evil\\". Royce and Eminem also released a track called \\"Renegade\\", from which Royce's vocals would later be replaced with Jay-Z's on the latter's The Blueprint. Through Eminem, Royce would also be introduced to both Dr. Dre and execs at Game Recordings.

Dr. Dre requested that Royce cut ties with Kino. Royce refused to fire his manager Kino, thus Royce's relationship with Dre ended. Royce da 5'9 in 2002 ===2002‚Äì2003: Feud with D12=== In 2002, Royce had a falling out with D12 including mutual friend and group member Proof, which sparked a public rivalry that resulted in Royce releasing a total of three diss tracks. The first, \\"Shit on You\\", was recorded over the instrumental of D12's track of the same name and mainly attacked group member Bizarre. Following Royce's second track, \\"Malcolm X\\", D12 responded with \\"Smack Down\\", over the instrumental of 50 Cent's \\"Back Down\\". Proof himself released the tracks \\"Many Men\\", over the instrumental of 50 Cent's \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\"; and \\"Beef Is Ova\\", with rap group The Purple Gang. Royce responded with his third track, \\"Death Day\\", recorded over 50 Cent's \\"In Da Club\\". Proof confronted Royce outside a Detroit nightclub in 2003, which led to a fight between both rappers' entourages. Proof and Royce were arrested and jailed overnight in adjacent cells, where they talked out their differences and ended the feud.Royce Da 5'9\\" Youtube Interview. Retrieved 2014-15-04.

The in-game radio station, Game Radio FM, prominently featured Royce's \\"I'm the King\\" and The Alchemist-produced solo track, which (along with the publicized beef) helped elevate Royce's name beyond his association with Eminem. In 2001, Royce was featured on pop singer Willa Ford's song \\"I Wanna Be Bad\\". In 2004, he released his second and most critically successful album to date, Death Is Certain, charting with another Premier-produced single, \\"Hip-Hop\\". After the relative success of his second effort, Royce put out a third solo project, Independent's Day, in 2005. This was met with less acclaim than either of his previous releases. During this time, the rivalry between Royce and former friend Proof reached a boiling point in the streets of Detroit, on an occasion where the two rappers drew guns; they were subsequently arrested and left to work out their differences while spending the night in neighboring cells in jail. The time spent in jail led to the artists ending their feud and subsequently embarking on two overseas tours together.\\"The Detroit Reunion Concert (Pics & Video)\\", MichiganHipHop.com.

Irish missionaries took the script to continental Europe, where they founded monasteries such as Bobbio. The scripts were also used in monasteries like Fulda, which were influenced by English missionaries. They are associated with insular art, of which most surviving examples are illuminated manuscripts. It greatly influenced Irish orthography and modern Gaelic scripts in handwriting and typefaces. Insular script comprised a family of different scripts used for different functions. At the top of the hierarchy was the Insular half-uncial (or \\"Insular majuscule\\"), used for important documents and sacred text. The full uncial, in a version called \\"English uncial\\", was used in some English centres. Then \\"in descending order of formality and increased speed of writing\\" came \\"set minuscule\\", \\"cursive minuscule\\" and \\"current minuscule\\". These were used for non-scriptural texts, letters, accounting records, notes, and all the other types of written documents.Brown, Michelle P., Manuscripts from the Anglo-Saxon Age, p. 13 (quoted), 2007, British Library, ==Origin== The scripts developed in Ireland in the 7th century and were used as late as the 19th century, though its most flourishing period fell between 600 and 850. They were closely related to the uncial and half-uncial scripts, their immediate influences; the highest grade of Insular script is the majuscule Insular half-uncial, which is closely derived from Continental half-uncial script. ==Appearance== St Chad Gospels: \\"Et factum est iter[um cum sabbatis ambula]ret Iesus per sata\\" (Mark 2:23, p. 151) Simplified relationship between various scripts, showing the development of Uncial from Roman and the Greek Uncial. Works written in Insular scripts commonly use large initial letters surrounded by red ink dots (although this is also true of other scripts written in Ireland and England). Letters following a large initial at the start of a paragraph or section often gradually diminish in size as they are written across a line or a page, until the normal size is reached, which is called a \\"diminuendo\\" effect, and is a distinctive insular innovation, which later influenced Continental illumination style. Letters with ascenders (b, d, h, l, etc.) are written with triangular or wedge-shaped tops. The bows of letters such as b, d, p, and q are very wide. The script uses many ligatures and has many unique scribal abbreviations, along with many borrowings from Tironian notes. Insular script was spread to England by the Hiberno-Scottish mission; previously, uncial script had been brought to England by Augustine of Canterbury. The influences of both scripts produced the Insular script system. Within this system, the palaeographer Julian Brown identified five grades, with decreasing formality: *Insular half-uncial, or \\"Irish majuscule\\": the most formal; became reserved for rubrics (highlighted directions) and other displays after the 9th century. *Insular hybrid minuscule: the most formal of the minuscules, came to be used for formal church books when use of the \\"Irish majuscule\\" diminished. *Insular set minuscule *Insular cursive minuscule *Insular current minuscule: the least formal;: Entry \\"Script, Anglo-Saxon\\" current here means ‚Äòrunning‚Äô (rapid). (definition e.) Brown has also postulated two phases of development for this script, Phase II being mainly influenced by Roman Uncial examples, developed at Wearmouth-Jarrow and typified by the Lindisfarne Gospels. ==Usage== Insular script was used not only for Latin religious books, but also for every other kind of book, including vernacular works. Examples include the Book of Kells, the Cathach of St. Columba, the Ambrosiana Orosius, the Durham Gospel Fragment, the Book of Durrow, the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Lichfield Gospels, the St. Gall Gospel Book, and the Book of Armagh. Insular script was influential in the development of Carolingian minuscule in the scriptoria of the Carolingian empire. In Ireland, Insular script was superseded in 850 by Late Insular script; in England, it was followed by a form of Caroline minuscule. The Tironian et ‚Äî equivalent of ampersand (&) ‚Äî was in widespread use in the script (meaning agus ‚Äòand‚Äô in Irish and ond ‚Äòand‚Äô in Old English) and is occasionally continued in modern Gaelic typefaces derived from insular script. ==Unicode== There are only a few insular letters encoded, these are shown below, but most fonts will only display U+1D79 (·µπ). To display the other characters there are several fonts that may be used; three free ones that support these characters are Junicode, Montagel, and Quivira. Gentium and Charis SIL support the alphabetic letters (U+A77x and U+A78x).

The business school offers instruction at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. ==History== The School of Industrial Management at Purdue University was created in 1958 from the merger of the Department of Economics (established in the School of Science, Education, and Humanities in 1953) and the Department of Industrial Management and Transportation (part of the Schools of Engineering since 1956). The Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration was founded in 1962 with a $2.7 million endowment from Herman Krannert and Ellnora Krannert. The AACSB accredited the new school in 1967. In the early years, students were required to pursue a second major, in a technical subject, in addition to their coursework in business and management. The curriculum expanded over the following decade and the word \\"Industrial\\" was dropped from the schools' names in the mid 1970s. Today, the Krannert name refers to both the undergraduate and post-graduate programs. Krannert is accredited by the AACSB. ==Academics== The school currently has nearly 20 clubs and organizations open to undergraduates, including the School of Management Council (SMC). There are some 25 professional, cultural and special interest clubs at the graduate level, including the Krannert Graduate Student Association (KGSA) and the Krannert Doctoral Student Association (KDSA). ===Undergraduate=== The School of Management offers eight undergraduate degree programs; Accounting; Economics; Finance; Industrial Management; Management; Marketing; Strategy and Organizational Management; and Supply Chain Information and Analytics. In keeping with the global scope of the modern manager, all programs include instruction in the international aspects of business and economics. The \\"3+2\\" program is available to outstanding undergraduates in the School of Management. The program allows students to complete their B.S. and Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees in just five years. Over the course of an academic year, Purdue is the site for campus interviewing activities and numerous career fairs. Some 1,200-1,400 unique companies visit campus and meet with students seeking internships, co- ops or full employment. One of the highest-profile and most attended, both by employers and student job-seekers, is Krannert‚Äôs School of Management Employers Forum (SMEF), which includes student-run careers fairs each fall and spring semester. Krannert hosted 147 companies for its forum this fall, which equaled the participation in the 2008 fair and is an increase of about 15 percent over the previous two events. Fifty-five of those companies gave presentations either the day before or during the evening after the fair, and about 60 companies requested interview schedules. Job recruiters ranked Krannert School of Management third in a 2012 Bloomberg Businessweek national survey of undergraduate business schools. The survey asked recruiters, among other criteria, which programs turned out the best graduates, which schools have the most innovative curricula, and which have the most effective career services areas. Krannert ranked seventh in 2011 and 13th in 2010. For 2011, US News and World Report ranked Krannert #24 in the nation overall for its undergraduate programs, #4 in quantitative analysis/methods, #8 in supply chain management/logistics and #10 in management information systems. ===Master's & Executive=== Krannert awards several master's degrees: MBA, EMBA, International Masters in Management, Master of Science in Human Resource Management, Master of Science in Industrial Administration, Master of Science in Finance, Master of Science in Global Entrepreneurship, Master of Science in Global Supply Chain Management and a Weekend MBA.Krannert School of Management - Masters Home These programs are housed in Rawls Hall. The school also offers a variety of joint programs with other colleges on campus including the combined Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and Master of Science in Industrial Administration (MSIA), the combined Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering (BSIE) and Master of Business Administration (MBA), and the combined Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and Master of Business Administration (MBA) For 2010, national rankings for Krannert's MBA program included #38 by U.S. News & World Report and #45 by Forbes,. Financial Times ranked the program #54 worldwide (2009), and The Wall Street Journal ranked the program #12 in a list of U.S. programs of regional influence (2007).\\"Where the Schools Rank\\". The Wall Street Journal. September 2007. Retrieved 2011-11-22. In the 2009 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report the school was ranked #27 in North America. ===Doctoral=== The Krannert Doctoral Programs offer students the opportunity to work closely with first-rate faculty in the areas of Economics, Management (with concentrations in Accounting, Finance, Management Information Systems, Marketing, Operations Management, Quantitative Methods/Management Science, and Strategic Management), and Organizational Behavior & Human Resource Management (OBHR). Krannert's doctoral programs were ranked #23 in the world for 2009 and #25 for 2013 by Financial Times. ==Facilities== The school's facilities are located on the southeastern part of Purdue's West Lafayette campus near the Purdue Memorial Union. The majority of undergraduate classes are conducted in the Krannert Building, which opened in 1964. Rawls Hall is the home of all the classes in the Masters program. Rawls Hall houses 13 electronically equipped classrooms, a professional career center, a multimedia-based auditorium, 25 breakout rooms, distance learning facilities, and sophisticated computer labs. The building is named for Krannert master's alum, Jerry S. Rawls. Rawls, the president and chief executive officer of Finisar Corp., donated $10 million to the Krannert at the Frontier Campaign. The gift is the largest in Krannert history and one of the largest at Purdue. In recognition of his generosity, the Purdue Board of Trustees voted in 2000 to name the new Krannert facility Jerry S. Rawls Hall. The Jerry Rawls Hall was dedicated on October 2, 2003. ==Alumni== * Sam Allen, retired chairman and chief executive officer for Deere & Company * Susan Bulkeley Butler, founder and CEO of the SBB Institute, and first female partner of Accenture * Drew Brees, NFL quarterback for the New Orleans Saints * Beth Brooke-Marciniak, global vice chair of public policy for Ernst & Young * Doug DeVos, president of Amway * Joe Forehand, former chairman and CEO of Accenture * Dave Fuente, chairman of SSA & Company * Greg Hayes, CEO and chair of United Technologies; Business Roundtable member * Robbie Hummel, professional basketball player * Howard Lance, executive advisor at The Blackstone Group, former chairman, president, and CEO of Harris Corporation * Marshall Larsen, retired chairman, president, and CEO at Goodrich * Preston McAfee, chief economist at Microsoft * Jerry S.

It was the first manufacturer of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in Iran. ==History== Formerly, Pars Khodro built American Motors' Rambler and General Motors (GM) products under licence. Its first cars, the Aria and the Shahin, were based on AMC's compact 1966 Rambler American and were launched in 1967. Production ended in 1974. It also built Jeep CJ, Jeep Wagoneer and Jeep Gladiator models under licence. The company was called Sherkat-Sahami Jeep at that time. Sherkat- Sahami Shahbaz (Jeep CJ) In June 1972, Sherkat-Sahami inked a deal with GM and formed General Motors Iran Ltd. GM Iran produced the Opel Commodore under licence from 1974 until 1976, with \\"Chevrolet Royale\\" badging. These models featured 2.5- and 2.8-litre engines. After having developed a reputation for reliability problems, the Royale was replaced on the Iranian production lines by the Buick Skylark (\\"Buick Iran\\"), Cadillac Seville and Chevrolet Nova (\\"Chevrolet Iran\\"), along with a Chevrolet pick-up truck. The Jeep continued during this time. These were built until 1981, the Iranian Revolution forcing the cessation of their manufacture and links with GM. Afterward, Pars Khodro switched to the manufacture of the Nissan Patrol and pickups under licence. The last Patrol was produced in 2002. In 1995, Pars Khodro acquired an additional Renault 5 assembly line from SAIPA. SAIPA is a fellow Iranian manufacturer who had been making the car since 1976 as a replacement for the Iranian-built Citro√´n Dyane. The Sepand I and II were versions of the original Renault 5, succeeded by a widened version with Kia Pride underpinnings, called the Sepand PK. In 2000, 51 per cent of Pars Khodro's shares were purchased by SAIPA, which in turn is 48 per cent owned by the Iranian Government. ==Today's range== Today, Pars Khodro builds Renault and Nissan models under licence. Nissan models include the Maxima, Roniz (Xterra), Teana, Patrol, and Safari. Pars Khodro's cars complement SAIPA's range of Kia and Renault licensed models.

He graduated in 1925 from Harvard Law School, and joined the Board of Boeing Air Transport in 1930 while remaining an employee of his Seattle law firm, Donworth, Todd & Higgins. A year later he joined the Board of Boeing Airplane Company as corporate counsel. Following the death of Boeing president Philip G. Johnson in 1944, Chairman Claire Egtvedt was tasked with appointing his replacement. Feeling that none of the company's senior engineers had a sufficiently broad background to run the company, he turned to Bill Allen. Considering himself unqualified to run an engineering company, Allen at first declined the offer before finally accepting. Allen served as the president of the Boeing Company from September 1, 1945, until April 29, 1968. He also served as the chairman of the Boeing Company from 1968 through 1972. While he was president of Boeing, he made the famous decision in 1952 to \\"bet the company\\", when he authorized construction of the Boeing 367-80 and again when he authorized the launch of development of the Boeing 707.Boeing Model 367-80 - The Dash 80 Retrieved 3 August 2011. He also participated in launching other planes of renown, among them the Boeing 727, Boeing 737, and Boeing 747. In 1965, Allen received the Vermilye Medal from The Franklin Institute. In 1966, Allen asked Malcolm T. Stamper to spearhead production of the new 747 airplane on which the company's future was riding. This was a monumental engineering and management challenge, and included construction of the world's biggest factory in which to build the 747 at Everett, Washington, a plant which is the size of 40 football fields. In 1971, Allen received the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation. In 1975, Allen was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. .

It provides the motive force to the cone by the reaction of a magnetic field to the current passing through it. The term is also used for voice coil linear motors, such as those used to move the heads inside hard disk drives, which produce a larger force and move a longer distance but work on the same principle. ==Operation== By driving a current through the voice coil, a magnetic field is produced. This magnetic field causes the voice coil to react to the magnetic field from a permanent magnet fixed to the speaker's frame, thereby moving the cone of the speaker. By applying an audio waveform to the voice coil, the cone will reproduce the sound pressure waves, corresponding to the original input signal. ==Design considerations== Because the moving parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to accurately reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much current through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing distortion and possibly mechanical damage. Power handling is related to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100 mm diameter voice coil, with a 12 mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50 mm diameter voice coil with a 24 mm winding height. In 'underhung' voice coil designs (see below), the coil is shorter than the magnetic gap, a topology that provides consistent electromotive force over a limited range of motion, known as Xmax. If the coil is overdriven it may leave the gap, generating significant distortion and losing the heat-sinking benefit of the steel, heating rapidly. Many hi-fi, and almost all professional low frequency loudspeakers (woofers) include vents in the magnet system to provide forced- air cooling of the voice coil. The pumping action of the cone and the dustcap draws in cool air and expels hot air. This method of cooling relies upon cone motion, so is ineffective at midrange or treble frequencies, although venting of midranges and tweeters does provide some acoustic advantages. In the earliest loudspeakers, voice coils were wound onto paper bobbins, which was appropriate for modest power levels. As more powerful amplifiers became available, alloy 1145 aluminium foil was widely substituted for paper bobbins, and the voice coils survived increased power. Typical modern hi-fi loudspeaker voice coils employ materials which can withstand operating temperatures up to 150¬∞C, or even 180¬∞C. For professional loudspeakers, advanced thermoset composite materials are available to improve voice coil survival under severe simultaneous thermal (<300¬∞C) and mechanical stresses. Aluminium was widely used in the speaker industry due to its low cost, ease of bonding, and structural strength. When higher power amplifiers emerged, especially in professional sound, the limitations of aluminium were exposed. It rather efficiently but inconveniently transfers heat from the voice coil into the adhesive bonds of the loudspeaker, thermally degrading or even burning them. Motion of the aluminium bobbin in the magnetic gap creates eddy currents within the material, which further increase the temperature, hindering long- term survival. In 1955 DuPont developed Kapton, a polyimide plastic film which did not suffer from aluminium's deficiencies, so Kapton, and later Kaneka Apical were widely adopted for voice coils. As successful as these dark brown plastic films were for most hi-fi voice coils, they also had some less attractive properties, principally their cost, and an unfortunate tendency to soften when hot. Hisco P450, developed in 1992 to address the softening issue in professional speakers, is a thermoset composite of thin glassfibre cloth, impregnated with polyimide resin, combining the best characteristics of polyimide with the temperature resistance and stiffness of glassfibre. It withstands brutal physical stresses and operating temperatures up to 300¬∞C, while its stiffness helps maintain the speaker's 'cold' frequency response. The actual wire employed in voice coil winding is almost always copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about one third of the mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper. Anodized aluminium flat wire may be used, providing an insulating oxide layer more resistant to dielectric breakdown than enamel coatings on other voice coil wire. This creates lightweight, low-inductance voice coils, ideally suited to use in small, extended range speakers. The principal power limitation on such coils is the thermal softening point of the adhesives which bond the wire to the bobbin, or the bobbin to the spider and coil. Voice coils can be used for applications other than loudspeakers, where time force linearity and long strokes are needed. Some environments like vacuum or space require specific attention during conception, in order to evacuate coil losses. Several specific methods can be used to facilitate thermal drain. ==Overhung and underhung coils== Overhung and underhung voice coils. Light grey is soft iron, dark grey is permanent magnetic material and the coil is in red. The image above shows two ways in which the voice coil is immersed in the magnetic field. The most common method is the overhung design where the height of the voice coil is greater than the magnetic gap's height. The underhung design which is used mostly in high-end speakers has the coil's height smaller than the gap's. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of both methods are listed below. Overhung coil * Coil height is greater than the gap's height. * This method keeps the number of windings within the magnetic field (or flux) constant over the coil's normal excursion range. * Higher coil mass, sensitivity low to medium.‚Ä° * Soft non-linearity as the coil exceeds limits. Underhung coil * Gap's height is greater than the coil's height. * This method keeps the magnetic flux that the coil experiences, constant over the coil's normal excursion range. * Low coil mass, sensitivity medium to high.‚Ä° * Hard non-linearity as the coil exceeds limits. Both topologies attempt the same goal: linear force acting on the coil, for a driver that reproduces the applied signal faithfully. ==Other uses for the term== The term \\"voice coil\\" has been generalized and refers to any galvanometer-like mechanism that uses a solenoid to move an object back-and-forth within a magnetic field. In particular, it is commonly used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the read‚Äìwrite heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads. ==See also== * Galvanometer ==References== * G2 Consulting, A good paper on Voice Coil Actuators. * The Hisco Loudspeaker Voice Coil Handbook, 7th Edition, August 2001.

Ethnopharmacol. 95(2-3):123-126. == Description == Cerbera odollam bears a close resemblance to oleander, another highly toxic plant from the same family. Its branchlets are whorled about the trunk, and its leaves are terminally crowded, with tapering bases, acuminate apices, and entire margins. The plant as a whole yields a milky, white latex. Its fruit, when still green, looks like a small mango, with a green fibrous shell enclosing an ovoid kernel measuring approximately 2 cm √ó 1.5 cm and consisting of two cross-matching white fleshy halves. On exposure to air, the white kernel turns violet, then dark grey, and ultimately brown, or black. == Toxicity == Flowers of Cerbera odollam The kernels of C. odollam contain cerberin, a digoxin-type cardenolide and cardiac glycoside toxin that blocks the calcium ion channels in heart muscle, causing disruption of the heart beat, most often fatally. The most common symptom of toxicity in humans was noted to be vomiting. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were noted to be common, the most common being sinus bradycardia. Around half of the patients develops thrombocytopenia. Temporary cardiac pacing has been used in the management, apart from other supportive measures. The difficulty in detecting cerberin in autopsies and the ability of strong spices to mask its taste makes it an agent of homicide and suicide in India; there were more than 500 cases of fatal Cerbera poisoning between 1989 and 1999 in the southwest Indian state of Kerala.James Randerson, 2004, \\"'Suicide tree' toxin is 'perfect' murder weapon\\" [commentary on Gaillard, et al., 2004, op. cit.], New Scientist (online), November 26, 2004, see , accessed 18 June 2015. A fatal dose of the poison is contained in one kernel, leading to death within 1‚Äì2 days. Common symptoms include: *burning sensation in mouth *violent vomiting *irregular respiration *headache *irregular heartbeat *coma and eventual death == Uses == The fruits are used for manufacturing bioinsecticides and deodorants.P.I.

The ending of His message, \\"Vegas needs a new King!\\" Buddy, a lone guitarist and swordsman, saves an unnamed boy he simply calls \\"Kid\\" from a group of bandits; consequently, as the Kid's mother was killed by the bandits he tags along with Buddy much to the latter's annoyance. As the duo travel through the desert wasteland, the heavy metal-playing Death stages several attempts to prevent Buddy from reaching Lost Vegas alive and claim the throne for himself. After enduring an attack by a bounty-hunting bowling team, Buddy and the Kid steal a car from another musician to continue their journey. They are later attacked on the road by bandits but escape. When their car breaks down, Buddy and the Kid attempt to borrow a wrench from a suburban family, unaware that they are cannibals. Buddy leaves the Kid with them and takes off on foot. The Kid is about to be eaten but is spared after a group of Windmill People invade the home and the family flees with Buddy and the Kid's abandoned car after revealing they had a socket wrench needed to fix it. Buddy returns to defeat the Windmill People, the two reunite and continue their journey on an abandoned motorcycle. Meanwhile, Death has been killing off all other musicians coming across his path and taking their guitar picks as trophies. Buddy and the Kid arrive in the town of Fallout, where he leaves the Kid with some locals and enters a bar to drink and spend time with a cheerleader. Death arrives but the Kid warns Buddy in time for them to flee. Before they do Buddy is approached by a young guitarist, whom he then humiliates. Continuing their travel, Buddy is attacked by the guitarist. Buddy unintentionally kills him in self defense, feeling guilty he lays his sword down and walks away but the Kid brings it back to him still believing in Buddy and helping regain his confidence, eventually the two begin to bond closer. Later, after they collapse in the desert, they are ambushed by Death and his bandmates, a trio of archers. Buddy slides the Kid and his guitar to safety while he battles the archers, but when the Kid is captured by a group of underground mutants, Buddy pursues the mutants to their lair. Death decides not to follow him as there are other musicians left to kill saving Buddy for last. Buddy manages to save the Kid, after returning to the surface, they find their road to Vegas blocked by the Red Army. After a grueling battle, Buddy is injured with the Kid dragging him to continue. Death finally catches up to them and engages Buddy in a guitar duel clashing their styles of music against one another; Buddy, Rock 'n' Roll and Death, Heavy Metal. When Buddy proves the better guitarist, an angry Death orders his bandmates to shoot him and the Kid with their bows. Buddy shields the Kid, getting shot in the back, but rises up and battles Death in a sword fight. Death mortally wounds Buddy in the end but the Kid discovers water is Death's weakness after spitting at him. The Kid then melts Death away with his water canteen. With his defeat, Death's bandmates are in shock that the Kid bested him. They give him a card and tell him with admiration that if he ever needs them to call them and they take their leave. The Kid saddened by Buddy disappearing after dying bravely accepts to finish Buddy's journey, he puts on his clothes, glasses, carries his sword and guitar. With Lost Vegas now in sight the Kid has completed Buddy's dream and ends with him turning into Buddy symbolizing he's inherited His spirit and a crowd cheering him from Lost Vegas. ==Cast== *Jeffrey Falcon as Buddy, a parody of Buddy Holly *Justin McGuire as the Kid *Stephane Gauger as Death, a parody of Slash :*Lex Lang as the voice of Death *George L.

Director Lance Mungia plays one of the Archers. ==Production== ===Opening sequence distortion=== The opening sequence has an intentionally distorted visual effect. The de-anamorphic visuals are a subtle \\"tribute\\" to the Chinese martial arts films (notably the films by Shaw Brothers) that often had their wide-screen opening sequences compressed to the 1.33:1 format of TV screens for VHS release. ===Thematic elements=== Throughout the film there are homages to many major musical movements in the United States. Buddy, the main character, is a symbol of the birth of rock 'n' roll. He shares the same clothing style of Buddy Holly, especially his horn-rimmed glasses. Death, a character resembling Slash from Guns N' Roses, kills a character representing Jerry Lee Lewis during the film. Death also dispatches a mariachi band and another musician dressed country western style. His minions also torment a traveler dressed in hip hop fashion. Buddy also has a duel with a musician (wielding a ukulele) resembling Ritchie Valens, who died in the same 1959 plane crash as the original Buddy Holly. Death also kills rock music, through the death of Buddy. However, the last scene shows the child donning Buddy's clothing, suggesting that though rock 'n' roll is dead, there is still hope for the future. The film also has references to the Wizard of Oz, loosely imitating the 1939 movie. A little person instructs Buddy to \\"follow the yellow brick road\\". Lost Vegas, seen from the distance, looks like the Emerald City. Death is obsessed with a specific object, Buddy's guitar pick, much like the Wicked Witch trying to get Dorothy's red slippers. Finally, Death is killed when sprayed with water, as was the Wicked Witch. When Buddy dies, his body disappears, leaving only his clothes for the kid to take, again like the Wicked Witch. ==Soundtrack== Six-String Samurai: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the original soundtrack to the film; the soundtrack was released by Rykodisc on August 25, 1998. # United States of Russia (Red Elvises) # Neverland* # Love Pipe (Red Elvises) # A Mother's Hand/Buddy* # Fly Away Little Butterfly* # Kill 200 Men (Dialogue) # Boogie on the Beach (Red Elvises) # I Do Not Like Rock & Roll (Dialogue) # Hungarian Dance #5 (Red Elvises) # Arrowed Kid/Bowlers on the Floor (Dialogue) # Rock & Rolling Ourselves to Death (Dialogue)/Jerry's Got the Squeeze Box (Red Elvises) # Lonely Highway of Love (Dialogue)/Scorchi Chornie (Red Elvises) # My Darling Lorraine (Red Elvises) # Astro* # Follow the Yellow Brick Road(Dialogue)/Leech (Red Elvises) # See You Around Kid (Dialogue)/Siberia (Red Elvises) # Good Golly Miss Molly (Red Elvises) # My Love Is Killing Me (Red Elvises) # Sacred Funeral* # Relentless Sun* # Over the Hill* # Bring His Guitar to Me(Dialogue)/Sahara Burn* # A Boy and His Spirit* # If You Were Me, You'd Be Good-Looking (Dialogue)/Surfing in Siberia (Red Elvises) # Draggin a Fallen Hero* # Nice Tuxedo (Dialogue)/Showdown at Not Okay Corral* # Bend Before the Ways of Heavy Metal (Dialogue)/Dueling Guitars* # Dream March* # The Great Battle* # End of a Hero/Finale* # On My Way to Vegas* (*) indicates original score by Brian Tyler ==Critical reception== Six-String Samurai received mixed reviews, with a 60% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews. Film Threat gave the film a perfect score of five stars. Leonard Klady of Variety called the film \\"A rock 'n' roll Mad Max served up Cantonese style, this is one wildly original and highly entertaining American indie with genuine commercial appeal.\\" Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle commented on his review that \\"If the film didn't have an underlying intelligence, it would soon be irritating -- it's too cartoonish and one- dimensional. But Falcon, an ace martial-arts practitioner, is dazzling as the nerdy main attraction, equally adept at sword fighting and guitar picking.\\" Laurie Stone of The Village Voice wrote on her review: \\"There's one charming sequence, with vaudeville grace and tragicomedy worthy of Beckett, but the rest of the film, even with startling visual effects and some impish humor, is repetitious and derivative, playing like an endless commercial for bullet-hole chic.\\" ==Other media== In September, 1998, a single Six String Samurai comic was released from Rob Liefeld's Awesome Entertainment. Written by Liefeld and Matt Hawkins, it featured art by 'Awesome' artists Dan Fraga and John Stinsman. A continuation rather than an adaptation, the plot summary from the comic is as follows: > In this alternate universe, in 1957 the Russians took the United States by > nuclear force.

He painted many of his favourite subjects in his travels in the East. He first accompanied Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis through Hungary, Wallachia, Russia and Turkey; then, in 1854, he followed the Austrian army across the Wallachian frontier. In 1856 he went to Egypt and Syria, and in 1861 to Algiers. In 1862 he settled in Paris, but returned to Germany in 1870; and settled at Cronberg near Frankfurt, where he died. ==Work== Arab Horsemen by Schreyer Schreyer was, and is still, especially esteemed as a painter of horses, of peasant life in Wallachia and Moldavia, and of battle incidents. His work is remarkable for its excellent equine draughtsmanship, and for the artist's power of observation and forceful statement; and has found particular favour among French and American collectors. Of his battle-pictures there are two at the Schwerin Gallery, and others in the collection of Count Mensdorff-Pouilly and in the Raven Gallery, Berlin. His painting of a Charge of Artillery of Imperial Guard was formerly at the Luxembourg Museum. The Metropolitan Museum, New York owns three of Schreyer's oriental paintings: Abandoned, Arabs on the March and Arabs making a detour; and many of his best pictures are in the Rockefeller family, Vanderbilt family, John Jacob Astor, William Backhouse Astor, Sr., August Belmont, and William Walters collections.

This class includes digitalis-like agents, channel-blockers that as a group have found historic uses as cardiac treatments, but which at higher doses are extremely toxic; in the case of cerberin, consumption of the C. odollam results in poisoning with presenting nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, often leading to death. The natural product has been structurally characterized, its toxicity is clear‚Äîit is often used as an intentional human poison in third-world countries, and accidental poisonings with fatalities have resulted from individuals even indirectly consuming the agent‚Äîbut its potentially therapeutic pharmacologic properties are very poorly described. == Structure and synonyms == Digitoxigenin, the cardenolide substructure of cerberin, with the tetracyclic array of all-carbon steroid rings at its core, to which is attached the butenolide-type, oxygen-containing lactone substituent. Cerberin, like all cardiac glycosides, has as its core a steroid-type set of four carbocycles (all-carbon rings). In cerberin, this steroid core is connected, first, to a separate oxygen-containing lactone ring (shown here, upper right of box), and second, to a sugar substituent (shown in infobox structure, left of image). There are two types of cardiac glycosides depending on the characteristics of the lactone moiety. Cerberin, with its five-membered ring, belongs to the cardenolide class; cardenolides are 23-carbon steroids with methyl groups at positions 10 and 13 of the steroid ring system, and the appended five-membered butenolide-type of lactone at C-17. Many types of sugars can be attached to cardiac glycosides; in the case of cerberin, it is an O-acetylated derivative of Œ±-L-thevetose, which is itself a derivative of L-glucose (6-deoxy-3-O-methyl-Œ±-L-glucopyranose). The cardenolide substructure to which the sugar is attached has also been independently characterised, and can be referred to as digitoxigenin (see image), hence, cerberin is, synonymously, (L-2'-O-acetylthevetosyl)digitoxigenin. As well, the non-acetylated structure was independently discovered and named neriifolin, and so cerberin is, synonymously, 2'-acetylneriifolin. == Physical properties == Cerberin is soluble in chloroform, acetone, and, moderately, in water. == Toxicity == The literature on cerberin toxicity, per se, remains sparse; unless otherwise specifically indicated, the following is general information regarding cardiac glycoside toxicity, with an emphasis on information from cardenolides (i.e., steroid natural products bearing the same digitoxigenin substructure). In poisoning situations, those who are poisoned by ingesting cardiac glycosides experience, within an hour, a variety of gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms. For cerberin, these have been noted to include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Forensic sources indicate presentations for cardiac toxin poisonings that additionally include burning sensations in the mouth, diarrhea, headache, dilated pupils, irregular beating of the heart, and drowsiness; coma and death most often eventually follow.Nageshkumar G. Rao, 1999, Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, pp. 425-434, New Delhi, DL, IND:Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers, , see , accessed 22 June 2015.Krishan Vij, 1999, \\"Cardiac Poisons (Ch. 42),\\" in Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology: Principles and Practice, 5th Edn., pp. 529-530, Gurgaon, HR, IND:Elsevier India, , see , accessed 22 June 2015. There is no clear, reported correlation between the dose and mortality (see below); death often occurs after 3‚Äì6 hours. A historic, reported lethal dose of cerberin in dog is 1.8 mg/kg, and in cat 3.1 mg/kg; that is, it is very low. Hence, eating the core of a fruit from the tree is sufficient for a human to receive a lethal dose, and consumption of the raw leaves of related oleander species has resulted in death. There is significant evidence both from Cerbera and from related species, with regard to lethal poisonings. Individual cases of poisoning from Cerbera, Nerium (oleander), and related speciesMembers of family Apocynaceae that contain cardiac glycosides include the genera Acokanthera, Apocynum, Cerbera, Nerium, Thevetia, and Strophanthus. are documented including direct and indirect, and intentional and unintentional ingestion. In one case of accidental poisoning, two vegans in Europe that were foraging for and ingesting wild plants died after consuming wild oleander. In indirect cases, human consumption of crab, where the crustacean had earlier consumed plants producing cerberin or related cardenolides, fatalities are also known. The response of humans to cardiac glycosides in general often depends on the tissue, exposure time and the dose. These toxins act mainly on the heart, either directly or through the nerves. Ouabain and digoxin have half-lives of about 20 and 40 hours, respectively, hence, for these agents, a few days with constant dosing are required before a steady state concentration is reached in tissues. The concentration of a cardioactive agent at steady state is called the therapeutic plasma concentration; for digoxin this value, in ng/mL, lies in the low single digits. When this value is exceeded, the dose can be toxic or life-threatening. Because of the long half-lives of cardiac glycosides, days might pass before plasma concentrations decrease to safe levels. The therapeutic index of cardiac glycosides is ‚âà2; this is quite narrow, indicating that only a small dose is needed for the compound to be toxic. There are reports that treatment with potassium ion can be used to counter the toxic effects of cerberin, and gastric lavage may also be applied. Even so, cases of direct and indirect poisoning often are fatal, even when the nature and source of the toxin are rapidly identified. == Metabolism == Very little is known about the metabolism of cerberin. For the related digoxin, another cardiac glycoside, it is in largest part excreted unchanged by the kidneys (60-80%), with the remaining mostly metabolised by the liver. The half-life for digoxin is 36‚Äì48 hours for people with a normal renal function and up to 6 days for people with a compromised renal function. This makes the renal function an important factor in the toxicity of digoxin and perhaps for cerberin as well. == Mechanism of action == There is very little formal, modern published information on the mechanism of action of cerberin. Cerberin, as a cardiac glycoside, is seen as binding to and inhibiting the cellular Na+/K+ -ATPase, because it binds to the alpha-subunit of the enzyme. This is the catalytic moiety. There are also a beta- and FXYD subunits. These two subunits influence the affinity of cerberin to Na+/K+ -ATPase. The expression of the beta- and FXYD-subunit is tissue-specific. Because of this, cerberin will have different effects in different tissues. When cerberin binds to the Na+/K+-ATPase the conformation of the enzyme changes. This will lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways in the cell. A detailed description of the effects of cerberin in the cell is given below. === Na+/K+-ATPase pump === Na+/K+-ATPase is an ion transport system of sodium and potassium ions and requires energy. It is often used in many types of cellular systems. Sodium ions move out of the cell and potassium ions enter the cell (3:2) with the aid of this pump. During the transport of these ions, the enzyme undergoes several changes in conformation. Including a phosphorylation and dephosphorylation step. The transport of Na+ and K+ is important for cell survival. Cardiac glycosides, such as cerberin, alter the transport of ions against their gradient. Cerberin is able to bind to the extracellular part of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump and can block the dephosphorylation step. Due to this inhibition it is impossible to transport sodium and potassium across the membrane and results in raising intracellular concentration of Na+. === Na+/Ca2+-exchanger === Accumulation of intracellular sodium ions cause an increase of intracellular calcium. This is because the calcium-sodium exchange pump‚Äôs activity decreases. The calcium-sodium exchange pump exchanges Ca2+ and Na+ without the use of energy. This exchanger is essential for maintaining sodium and calcium homeostasis. The exact mechanism by which this exchanger works is unclear. It is known that calcium and sodium can move in either direction across the membrane of muscle cells. It is also known that three sodium ions are exchanged for each calcium and that an increase in intracellular sodium concentration through this exchange mechanism leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. As intracellular sodium increases, the concentration gradient driving sodium into the cell across the exchanger is reduced. As a result, the activity of the exchanger is reduced, which decreases the movement of calcium out of the cell. Thus by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase, cardiac glycosides cause intracellular sodium concentration to increase. This leads to an accumulation of intracellular calcium via the Na+/Ca2+-exchange system with the following effects: * In the heart, increased intracellular calcium causes more calcium to be released, thereby making more calcium available to bind to troponin-C, which increases contractility (inotropy). * Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in vascular smooth muscle causes depolarization, which causes smooth muscle contraction. The conformational change of Na+/K+-ATPase plays not only a role in the contraction of muscles, but also in cell growth, cell motility and apoptosis. Due to de binding of cerberin, specific second messengers can be activated. After a cascade of cellular interactions nuclear transcription factors binds to the DNA and new enzymes will be made. This enzymes can for example play a role in cell proliferation.[subscription required] == Efficacy == There is very little formal, modern published information on the pharmacological actions of cerberin. One primary source reports that its ingestion results in electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as various types of bradycardia (e.g., sinus bradycardia), AV dissociation, and junctional rhythms; second-degree sinoatrial block and nodal rhythm are also described. In the case of digitalis administration, ST depression or T wave inversion may occur without indicating toxicity; however, PR interval prolongation indicate toxicity. == Therapeutic uses == There are no clearly established therapeutic uses of the title compound, cerberin. Digitalis compounds, related cardiac glycosides, function through the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase-pump,[subscription required] and have been widely used for in the treatment of chronic heart failure and arrhythmias; although newer and more efficacious treatments for heart failure are available, digitalis compounds are still used. Some cardiac glycosides have been shown to have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, and are therefore of interest as potential agents in cancer chemotherapy;[subscription required] there is a single report to date of possible antiproliferative activity of cerberin. ==Further reading== * * == References == Category:Cardiac glycosides ","title":"Cerberin"},{"id":"1273767","text":"Antwaan Randle El (; born August 17, 1979) is an American football coach and former player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He is currently an offensive assistant for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He attended Indiana University where he played college football for the Indiana Hoosiers, and also played basketball and baseball as well. For a time, he was also a sideline reporter for the Big Ten Network for interconference games that the Indiana football team plays. Following four years at Indiana, Randle El was chosen in the second round (62nd overall) of the 2002 NFL Draft, by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Playing with the Steelers for four seasons, he was active in all 64 regular season games with 23 starts, finding success as a wide receiver, kick returner and punt returner. He was also instrumental in a number of trick plays, including throwing a touchdown pass as a wide receiver for the Steelers in Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks, the only wide receiver in Super Bowl history to do so. After the 2005 NFL season, Randle El was signed as a free agent to the Washington Redskins. As a receiver for the Redskins, he scored ten touchdowns, catching eight and throwing two. In 2007, Randle El was sidelined for a game against the Buffalo Bills with a hamstring injury, to date being his only inactive game. Randle El was released by the Redskins in March 2010, re-signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers shortly after. Randle El was also named fifth in USA Today's All-Decade kick returners. ==Early years== Randle El was born in Riverdale, Illinois as the son of Curtis Randle El Sr., a food distributor, and Jacqueline, a day-care provider. Randle El was raised a Pentecostal Christian. A Chicago Bears fan, he attended Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He was a high school teammate of former NFL linebacker Napoleon Harris, as well as NBA center Melvin Ely and former NFL wide receiver Tai Streets. After graduating from Thornton Township in 1997, Randle El was drafted in the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft, selected in the 14th round (424th overall) by the Chicago Cubs. He opted instead to pursue a football scholarship at Indiana University, despite being told he was too small during the recruiting process. ==College career== Randle El attended Indiana University from 1998 to 2001, playing college football primarily as a quarterback. Due to a low SAT score, he sat out his first full technical year at Indiana as a partial academic qualifier. Playing for the first time in Indiana's 1998 season opener against the Western Michigan Broncos, Randle El completed 22-of-29 passing attempts for 385 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, as well as rushing for 82 yards on 23 carries for three touchdowns. The Hoosiers would go on to win the game, 45‚Äì30, with Randle El's 467 yards breaking the NCAA freshman total offense record in his first collegiate game. His performance was also the third all-time highest passing yards in a single game for Indiana, and would earn Randle El the co- Big Ten Player of the Week award. In the same season, Randle El would lead the team to victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes on October 17, 1998, with a rushing touchdown in the final seconds of the game. The win came after a 62‚Äì0 loss to Iowa the previous season, making Indiana the first team in the history of the Big Ten Conference to lose to a team by more than 60 points in one season, and beat them the following year. Randle El would win the Big Ten Player of the Week award for a second time for his performance. On December 1, 1998, Randle El was announced as the winner of the 1998 Big Ten Freshman of the Year award, voted for by both Conference coaches and the media. The award was later re- titled the \\"Thompson-Randle El Freshman of the Year\\" award, partly in honor of Randle El's successful college career. Over the course of the 1998 season, Randle El tallied four 100-yard rushing games, against the Minnesota Golden Gophers, the Michigan Wolverines, the Michigan State Spartans, and the Cincinnati Bearcats. He finished the season and his freshman year with 1,745 passing yards and six touchdowns, as well as 873 yards rushing as a quarterback, breaking the Indiana University season record. While at Indiana, Randle El became the first player in NCAA Division I history to pass for 40 career touchdowns and score 40 career rushing touchdowns. In 2001, he was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, presented by the Chicago Tribune to the Most Valuable Player of the Big Ten Conference. He finished his collegiate career as fifth on the all-time NCAA total yardage list, and became the first player in college football history to record 2,500 total yards for each of four consecutive years. Tallying 7,469 passing yards, 3,895 rushing yards, and 92 touchdowns running and passing for his college career, he finish sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting in his senior season. Randle El ended his college career with a 26‚Äì15 win over the Kentucky Wildcats, passing for two touchdowns. In 2000, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno said of Randle El, \\"He is just the whole offense. It is scary to watch him. He is so quick that if you don't get on him and you wait for him to pitch the ball, he will take off on you. He is just an amazing athlete. I don't know how you get ready for him.\\" While attending Indiana, Randle El also played varsity basketball under Hall of Fame head coach Bob Knight. Randle El joined the 1998‚Äì99 Indiana basketball team following the football season. In the 1998‚Äì99 season, Randle El played 11 games for the basketball team, averaging 1.5 points and 0.7 rebounds in 6.7 minutes per game. He also played varsity baseball during the 2000 season for Indiana University. In November 2012, Randle El was inducted into the Indiana Athletic Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== ===Pittsburgh Steelers (2002‚Äì2005)=== Randle El was drafted as a wide receiver in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft with the 62nd overall pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the ninth wide receiver to be selected in the 2002 NFL Draft. The Steelers made him their top kickoff returner through the 2004 season, and their top punt returner. His quarterback experience allowed the Steelers to use him as a passer in a variety of trick plays, most notably a game-clinching 43-yard reverse touchdown pass to Hines Ward in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XL, his only championship title. He was the third non-quarterback and the first and only wide receiver in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl. ===Washington Redskins (2006‚Äì2009)=== During the free agency period in March 2006, Randle El signed a seven-year deal with the Washington Redskins, worth $31 million with $11.5 million in bonuses. He had initially been in talks to sign a six-year, $18 million contract with the Chicago Bears, but discussions had broken down following the first day of free agency. In the Redskins' Week 7 game against the Indianapolis Colts, he returned a punt 87 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter, his first punt return for a touchdown with the Redskins, then in Week 17, he passed for his first touchdown as a Redskin, completing a 48-yard pass to wide receiver Santana Moss. In the 2007 season opener against the Miami Dolphins, Randle El recorded five receptions for a career-high 162 yards. Randle El at Redskins 2008 Training Camp. In addition, he was the Redskins emergency quarterback. In December 2007, Randle El was inactive in a loss to Buffalo with a hamstring injury. This was his first game missed in his six-year NFL career, ending a run of 91 consecutive regular season starts. In January 2010, Randle El was named in the Bleacher Report's Pittsburgh Steelers All-Decade team for defense and special teams, as a punt returner. He was also named fifth in USA Today's All-Decade kick returners. Randle El was among ten players released by the Redskins on March 4, 2010. The move came as a result of a number of personnel changes in Washington, with new head coach and executive vice president Mike Shanahan ‚Äì signed alongside new offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan - opting to make room in the Redskin's depth chart and salary outgoings in preparation of the 2010 free agency period. Randle El stated that he was \\"shocked\\" at the move, commenting that \\"..with a new GM and a new coach, I thought you'd be given a shot to show them what you can do.\\" ===Second stint with Steelers (2010)=== On March 8, 2010, Randle El again signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in a three-year deal worth $7 million, with a $900,000 signing bonus. He was active in all sixteen regular season games, with 22 receptions for 253 yards. In a Week 4 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Randle El was the team's leading receiver with 50 yards, including a season-longest 34-yard catch. Following the Steelers bye week, Randle El had a twelve-yard receiving touchdown overturned, in a week six loss to the New Orleans Saints. In Week 9, Randle El threw for a touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals, following a hand-off from Ben Roethlisberger. NFL.com named it a \\"Can't Miss Play\\" of the week. Randle El threw for a second passing touchdown in the Steelers' final regular season game against the Cleveland Browns, completing a pass to Hines Ward. The pass added to his career passer rating of 157.5 from 21 completed passes of a possible 26, the highest career rating of any player with more than twenty completions. Finally, Randle El scored a rushing two-point conversion in Super Bowl XLV to bring the Steelers to within three points of Green Bay in the fourth quarter. He was released by the team on July 28, 2011. ===Retirement=== After not playing during the 2011 season, Randle El announced his retirement from professional football on July 13, 2012. In 2013, he became the athletic director at Virginia Academy in Ashburn, Virginia, a Christian high school he helped found. In a 2016 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Randle El expressed regret over playing professional football due to growing memory problems and difficulty walking up and down stairs that he has faced since retirement. He mentioned that he could still be playing baseball at his age had he pursued that path after being drafted by the Chicago Cubs. ==Coaching career== ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== On January 16, 2019, Randle El joined the coaching staff of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an offensive assistant, reuniting with his former wide receivers coach and offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. ==Personal life== Randle El's younger brother, Marcus, was a wide receiver and kick returner for the University of Wisconsin, while his older brother, Curtis, was a defensive back at Indiana University. Randle El is married to Jaune. The couple have four children. Randle El also has three children from previous relations. In total, he has seven children.https://youtube.com/watch?v=3BCLdxgmOHQ?t=868 He currently resides in Loudoun County, Virginia. Randle El also co-hosted Redskins Gameday on WTTG during the 2007 season. Randle El participated in the coverage of the 2008 NFC Divisional playoff game between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles for NFL Network, holding an interview after the game with safety Brian Dawkins. The next week, he traveled to cover the AFC championship game between his former team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Baltimore Ravens. After the game, he held interviews with some of his former teammates, including Ben Roethlisberger, Troy Polamalu, and Hines Ward. Randle El made several appearances in television commercials for Easterns Automotive Group, a local car dealership group on the DC and Baltimore areas, alongside Chris Cooley, Clinton Portis, Jason Campbell, Chief Zee, Santana Moss, Willis McGahee. ==References== ==External links== * ESPN profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Cook County, Illinois Category:Players of American football from Illinois Category:African-American coaches of American football Category:African-American players of American football Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American football return specialists Category:American football wide receivers Category:Indiana Hoosiers football players Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball players Category:Indiana Hoosiers baseball players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Super Bowl champions Category:College football announcers Category:National Football League announcers Category:Washington Redskins broadcasters Category:People from Riverdale, Illinois Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Antwaan Randle El"},{"id":"1273770","text":"==Events== ===January events=== * January 13 ‚Äì Thaddeus Fairbanks is awarded for a railroad scale. === February events === * February 2 ‚Äì With the approach of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth line of the Great Western Railway (GWR), the Bristol and Exeter Railway's Yeovil branch line is extended from Hendford across Yeovil to the GWR station at Pen Mill, coinciding with the GWR line from Frome to Yeovil. * February 9 ‚Äì The Central Pacific Railroad is incorporated in Nebraska Territory to build a railroad from the Missouri River through the Rocky Mountains to Washington Territory. * February 18 ‚Äì The Galena and Illinois River Railroad, a predecessor of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, is incorporated in Illinois. ===April events=== * April 11 ‚Äì The Paris-Lyon-M√©diterran√©e railway company (PLM) is formed in France by amalgamation of the Chemin de fer de Lyon √† la M√©diterran√©e (LM) and the Chemin de fer de Paris √† Lyon (PL) companies. ===May events=== * May 7 ‚Äì Formal opening of Midland Railway Leicester‚ÄìHitchin line, England. === June events === * June 4 ‚Äì The first central connection to the Mississippi River is made when the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad connects Cincinnati, Ohio, to St. Louis, Missouri. * June 11 ‚Äì Norwegian railway director Carl Abraham Pihl is demanded by a Royal Decree to instruct a terrain investigation of the area along the river Drammenselva from Drammen to Randsfjorden. * June 28 - The Lewisham rail crash (1857) in England kills 11 people. * June 29 ‚Äì The Cape Town Railway and Dock Company is granted approval to construct a railway between Cape Town and Wellington.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J.

August Belmont Sr. (December 8, 1813November 24, 1890) was a German-American politician, financier, foreign diplomat, and party chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 1860s, and later a horse-breeder and racehorse owner. He was the founder and namesake of the Belmont Stakes, third leg of the Triple Crown series of American thoroughbred horse racing. ==Early life== He was born to a Jewish family in Alzey, Rhenish Prussia (now Germany), on December 8, 1813, to Simon and Frederika (Elsass) Belmont. His family had Sephardic roots, tracing back to the town of Belmonte, Portugal. After his mother's death, when he was seven years old, he lived with his uncle and grandmother in the German financial capital of Frankfurt am Main (\\"Frankfurt on the Main River\\"). Belmont attended the Philanthropin, a Jewish school, until he began his first job as an apprentice to the Rothschild banking firm in Frankfurt. He would sweep floors, polish furniture, and run errands while studying English, arithmetic, and writing. He was promoted to confidential clerk in 1832 and later traveled to Naples, Paris and Rome. ==Career== In 1837, at the age of 24, Belmont set sail for the Spanish colony of Cuba and its capital city of Havana, charged with the Rothschilds' Cuban interests. On his way to Havana, Belmont stopped in New York City on a layover. He arrived in the previously prospering United States during the first waves of the financial/economic recession of the Panic of 1837, shortly after the end of the iconic two-term administration of President Andrew Jackson, the nation's first Democratic administration. Instead of continuing on to Havana, however, Belmont remained in New York to supervise the jeopardized Rothschild financial interests in America, whose New York agent had filed for bankruptcy. ===August Belmont & Company=== In the financial/economic recession and Panic of 1837, hundreds of American businesses, including the Rothschild family's American agent in New York City, collapsed. As a result, Belmont postponed his departure for Havana indefinitely and began a new firm, August Belmont & Company, believing that he could supplant the recently bankrupt firm, the American Agency. August Belmont & Company was an instant success, and Belmont restored health to the Rothschilds' U.S. interests over the next five years. The company dealt with foreign exchange transactions, commercial and private loans, as well as corporate, railroad, and real estate transactions. Belmont owned a mansion in what is presently North Babylon, Long Island, New York. It is now owned by New York State and is known as Belmont Lake State Park. ===Consul-General of Austria=== In 1844, Belmont was named the Consul-General of the Austrian Empire at New York City, representing the Imperial Government's affairs in the major American financial and business capital. He resigned the consular post in 1850 in response to what he viewed as the Austrian government's policies towards Hungary, which had yet to gain equal status with Austria as part of the Dual Monarchy compromise of 1867. His interest in American domestic politics continued to grow. ===Entry into U.S. politics=== John Slidell, the uncle of Belmont's wife, was a U.S. Senator from Louisiana and later Southern secessionist who served the Confederate States government as a foreign diplomat and potential minister to Great Britain and French Emperor Napoleon III. He was controversially removed in late 1861 from the British trans- Atlantic steam packet ship Trent, off-shore from Havana, by the Union Navy warship . Slidell made Belmont his prot√©g√©. Belmont's first task was to serve as campaign manager in New York for James Buchanan of Wheatland, Pennsylvania, then an American diplomat in Europe, who was running for the Democratic Party's nomination for president in the election of 1852. In June 1851, Belmont wrote letters to the New York Herald and the New York National- Democrat, insisting that they do justice to Buchanan's run for the presidential nomination. But Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, a \\"dark horse\\" candidate, unexpectedly won the Democratic nomination instead, and was elected President. He appointed Buchanan as his Minister to the United Kingdom, and Belmont made further large contributions to the Democratic cause, while weathering political attacks. ===U.S. Minister to the Netherlands=== In 1853, Pierce appointed Belmont Charg√© d'affaires (equivalent to ambassador) to The Hague of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Belmont held this post from October 11, 1853 until September 26, 1854 when the position's title was changed to Minister Resident. He continued as Minister Resident until September 22, 1857. While in the Netherlands, Belmont urged American annexation of Cuba as a new slave state in what became known as the Ostend Manifesto.Katz, pp. 42‚Äì45. Although Belmont lobbied hard for it, newly elected President Buchanan denied him the ambassadorship to Madrid in the Kingdom of Spain after the presidential election of 1856, thanks to the Ostend Manifesto.Katz, pp. 58‚Äì61; John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes, eds., American National Biography, Vol. II (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), pg. 534 As a delegate to the pivotal, but soon violently-split 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, Belmont supported influential U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, (who had triumphed in the famous 1858 Lincoln-Douglas Debates over his long-time romantic and political rival, the newly recruited Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln, in their battle for Douglas's Senate seat). ===Chairman of the Democratic National Committee=== Senator Douglas subsequently nominated Belmont as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Belmont is attributed with single-handedly transforming the position of party chairman from a previously honorary office to one of great political and electoral importance, creating the modern American political party's national organization. He energetically supported the Union cause during the Civil War as a \\"War Democrat\\" (similar to former Tennessee Senator Andrew Johnson, later installed as war governor of the Union Army-occupied seceded state), conspicuously helping U.S. Representative from Missouri Francis P. Blair raise and equip the Union Army's first predominantly German- American regiment.Katz, pg. 90. For more on Belmont's public contributions to the war effort, see Belmont's self-published, A Few Letters and Speeches of the Late Civil War, New York, [Private Printing], 1870. Belmont also used his influence with European business and political leaders to support the Union cause in the Civil War, trying to dissuade the Rothschilds and other French bankers from lending funds or credit for military purchases to the Confederacy and meeting personally in London with the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, and members of Emperor Napoleon III's French Imperial Government in Paris.Allen Johnson, ed., Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. II (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1929), pg. 170. He helped organize the Democratic Vigilant Association, which sought to promote unity by promising Southerners that New York businessmen would protect the rights of the South and keep free-soil members out of office. ===Post-war political career=== Schurz, Belmont, Fenton, Trumbull, Tipton, and others lie before a vengeful Columbia (representing the U.S.) while Uncle Sam (also representing the U.S.) waves his hat beside the victorious Ulysses S. Grant, 1872 Remaining chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the War, Belmont presided over what he called \\"the most disastrous epoch in the annals of the Democratic Party\\".Quoted in Katz, 91. As early as 1862, Belmont and Samuel Tilden bought stock in the New York World in order to mold it into a major Democratic press organ with the help of Manton M. Marble, its editor-in-chief.Garraty and Carnes, pg. 534. According to the Chicago Tribune in 1864, Belmont was buying up Southern bonds on behalf of the Rothschilds as their agent in New York because he backed the Southern cause. Seeking to capitalize on divisions in the Republican Party at the War's end, Belmont organized new party gatherings and promoted Salmon Chase (the former United States Secretary of the Treasury since 1861, and later Chief Justice of the United States in 1864) for president in 1868, the candidate he viewed least vulnerable to charges of disloyalty to the Party during the Republican/Unionists Lincoln-Johnson Administrations, (1861‚Äì69).Garraty and Carnes, pg. 534; Katz, pp. 167‚Äì68. Horatio Seymour's electoral defeat in the 1868 election paled in comparison to the later nomination of Liberal Republican Horace Greeley's disastrous 1872 presidential campaign. In 1870, the Democratic Party faced a crisis when the Committee of Seventy emerged to cleanse the government of corruption. A riot at Tammany Hall led to the campaign to topple William (Boss) Tweed. Belmont stood by his party. While the party chairman had originally promoted Charles Francis Adams for the nomination, Greeley's nomination implied Democratic endorsement of a candidate who as publisher of the famous nationally dominant newspaper, the New York Tribune, had often earlier referred to Democrats before, during and after the War as \\"slaveholders\\", \\"slave-whippers\\", \\"traitors\\", and \\"Copperheads\\" and accused them of \\"thievery, debauchery, corruption, and sin\\".Katz, pg. 200 Although the election of 1872 prompted Belmont to resign his chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, he nevertheless continued to dabble in politics as a champion of U.S. Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware for the presidency, as a fierce critic of the process granting Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in the 1876 election, and as an advocate of \\"hard money\\" financial policies.Katz, pp. 210‚Äì76. ==Personal life== Caroline Slidell Perry Belmont, portrait by George Peter Alexander Healy Painting of Belmont in a carriage with his wife Caroline, by Wouterus Verschuur, 1854 On November 7, 1849, Belmont married Caroline Slidell Perry (1829‚Äì1892). She was the daughter of naval officer Matthew Calbraith Perry (1794‚Äì1858), captain and commodore in the U.S. Navy, later famous for his expedition to open the trading ports of Japan in 1853. According to Jewish newspaper sources, he converted to Christianity at that time, taking his wife's Episcopalian/Anglican faith.American Israelite, August 7, 1874, pg. 4Jewish Exponent, December 19, 1924. Together, they were the parents of six children, with all of his surviving sons becoming involved in politics: * Perry Belmont (1851‚Äì1947), who married Jessie Ann Robbins (1858‚Äì1935), the divorced wife of Henry T. Sloane. * August Belmont Jr. (1853‚Äì1924), who married Elizabeth Hamilton Morgan (1862‚Äì1898). After her death, he married Eleanor Robson (1879‚Äì1979), an actress. * Jane Pauline \\"Jennie\\" Belmont (1856‚Äì1875), who died aged 19. * Fredericka Belmont (1856‚Äì1902), who married Samuel Shaw Howland (1849‚Äì1925), son of Gardiner Greene Howland of Howland & Aspinwall. * Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont (1858‚Äì1908), who married Sarah Swan Whiting (1861‚Äì1924). They divorced, she married George L. Rives and he married Alva Erskine Smith (1853‚Äì1933), former wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt. * Raymond Rodgers Belmont (1863‚Äì1887), who accidentally shot \\"himself while practicing with a pistol.\\" Belmont died in Manhattan, New York City on November 24, 1890, from pneumonia. His funeral was held at the Church of the Ascension in New York City. The Letters, Speeches and Addresses of August Belmont was published at New York in 1890. Belmont left an estate valued at more than ten million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). He is buried in an ornate sarcophagus in the Belmont family plot (along with other Belmonts, Perrys and Tiffanys) in the Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island. His widow died in 1892. ===Society life=== By-the-Sea, Belmont's Newport cottage, ca. 1915 Belmont threw lavish balls and dinner parties, receiving mixed reviews from New York's high society. He was an avid sportsman, and the famed Belmont Stakes thoroughbred horse race is named in his honor. It debuted at Jerome Park Racetrack, owned by Belmont's friend, Leonard Jerome (the maternal grandfather of Winston Churchill). The Belmont Stakes is part of thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown and takes place at Belmont Park racetrack, just outside New York City. Belmont was heavily involved in Thoroughbred horse racing. He served as the president of the National Jockey Club from 1866 to 1887 and owned the Nursery Stud, a horse-breeding farm near Babylon, New York on Long Island that in 1885 was replaced by a stud farm of the same name near Lexington, Kentucky. ===Legacy=== Belmont, New Hampshire, is named in his honor, an honor he never acknowledged. His home, By-the-Sea in Newport, Rhode Island was demolished in 1946. In 1910, sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward completed a bronze statue of a seated Belmont. The statue was originally installed in front of a small chapel adjacent to the Belmont burial plot in the Island Cemetery. It was later moved to a park between Washington Square and Touro Street in Newport. It was replaced by a marker dedicating the park as Eisenhower Park in 1960, to honor President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The statue was loaned by the city of Newport, Rhode Island to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1985. It was eventually installed, about 1995, in front of the headquarters building for the Preservation Society of Newport County at the corner of Bellevue and Narragansett Avenues in Newport. The World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor. ==In popular culture== Author Edith Wharton reputedly modeled the character of Julius Beaufort in her novel The Age of Innocence on Belmont. In The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln by Stephen L. Carter, August Belmont appears as a character. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Photograph of August Belmont's birth record, Zivilstandsregister Alzey, Germany, 1813 *Mr. Lincoln and New York: August Belmont * Category:1813 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the United States to the Netherlands Category:American bankers Category:American financiers Category:American horse racing industry executives Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:American racehorse owners and breeders Category:Belmont family Category:Democratic National Committee chairs Category:German Jews Category:Hessian emigrants to the United States Category:Jewish American government officials Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:People from Alzey Category:Businesspeople from Frankfurt Category:People from Rhenish Hesse Category:People from Hempstead (village), New York Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Converts to Anglicanism from Judaism Category:19th-century American diplomats Category:Burials at Common Burying Ground and Island Cemetery ","title":"August Belmont"},{"id":"1273772","text":"The Combahee River as seen from the Harriet Tubman bridge along U.S. Highway 17 The Combahee River ( )Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary, Third Edition (Merriam-Webster, 1997; ), p. 272. is a short blackwater river in the southern Lowcountry region of South Carolina formed at the confluence of the Salkehatchie and Little Salkehatchie rivers near the Islandton community of Colleton County, South Carolina. Part of its lower drainage basin combines with the Ashepoo River and the Edisto River to form the ACE Basin The Combahee empties into Saint Helena Sound near Beaufort, which in turn empties into the Atlantic Ocean. ==History== The river is named for its first inhabitants, the Combahee tribe of Native Americans. Europeans occupied the area as early as the 1680s, and so the Combahee and others of the Cusabo group are also known as Settlement Indians. Land was set aside for the Yemassee people along several rivers, including the Combahee.South Carolina Tribes: The Yemassee Indians, MCAS Beaufort The Yemassee War of 1715-1717 saw skirmishes in the area. On August 27, 1782, one of the last fights in the Revolutionary War took place along the Combahee River. The British made an attempt at foraging, which the Americans, headed by General Gist and Colonel John Laurens, opposed. Laurens, the son of Henry Laurens, a former president of the Continental Congress, died in the action. The Combahee River bordered and supplied the water for some of the largest, most productive rice plantations prior to the Civil War. It was the site of an important military incident during that conflict, the Raid at Combahee Ferry. This was a Union raid into the interior of South Carolina, which freed over 750 slaves. Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave herself, well known for leading others hundreds of miles to safety on the Underground Railway, led this endeavor on June 2, 1863. The bridge across the Combahee on US Highway 17 is the location today. ==Cultural legacy== The Combahee River Collective was a Black feminist lesbian organization, formed in 1974Marable, Manning; Leith Mullings (eds), Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal, Combahee River Collective Statement, Rowman and Littlefield, 2000, , p. 524. and named after the battle.

Note that the spelling 'Killynure' is used for the names of roads within the townland. The townland is approximately 770 acres (3.1 km¬≤) in area, and still consists mostly of farmland, although since the 1990s, the housing developments of Carryduff have begun to encroach on its north-west corner (including the Killynure Estate). The 'Church of the Yew' which gave the townland its name possibly existed in the 9th century, with the most probable site being at Flowe Farm on Killynure Road West. Local records record that a schoolhouse was constructed in 1795 on the site, re-using existing stone from a ruin in the field, which also contained several yew stumps. A couple of 3rd century Roman coins were also found nearby.\\"Carryduff 2000\\" George A Bowsie & Graham Murphy Killynure Road runs north-south through the townland, connecting Carryduff and Saintfield, passing close to the summit of Ouley Hill. Use of the road is attested as far back as the 17th century, and it formed part of the main stagecoach route between Belfast and Downpatrick. However, horses struggled ascending Ouley Hill, and in the latter half of the 19th century, a new road between Carryduff and Saintfield was constructed, bypassing the hill: this is still in use today as the modern A7. Killynure Road West leaves the Killynure Road at Ouley Hill and runs westward, to meet the A24 road (which connects Carryduff to Ballynahinch). Killynure Avenue, a small road which runs between the Killynure Road and the A7, leading to Lisdoonan townland, is lined with numerous ash trees. The townland contains a few small streams which join the Carryduff River, ultimately flowing into the Lagan some miles north at Minnowburn. ==References== ==See also== *Killinure, County Carlow *Killinure, County Tipperary *Killinure, County Tyrone *Killinure, County Westmeath *Killinure, County Wicklow Category:Townlands of County Down Category:Civil parish of Saintfield ","title":"Killinure"},{"id":"1273799","text":"The suspensory muscle of duodenum is a thin muscle connecting the junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery. It is also known as the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable. The suspensory muscle marks the formal division between the first and second parts of the small intestine, the duodenum and the jejunum. This division is used to mark the difference between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, which is relevant in clinical medicine as it may determine the source of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The suspensory muscle is derived from mesoderm and plays a role in the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally short suspensory muscle. ==Structure== The duodenum and the jejunum are the first and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters the upper part of the mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum. ===Variation=== Considerable anatomic variation exists, in terms of length and point of attachment. Despite the classical description, the muscle only solely attaches to the duodenojejunal flexure in about 8% of people; it is far more common, 40 to 60% of the time to attach additionally to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum; and 20 to 30% of the time it only attaches to the third and fourth parts. Moreover, separate multiple attachments are not that uncommon. According to some authors, who use the original description by Treitz, the muscle may be divided into two sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum. ==Function== The ligament contains a slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending parts of the duodenum. When it contracts, by virtue of connections to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents. ===Embryology=== Embryologically, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum is derived from mesoderm. It plays an important role in the embryological rotation of the small intestine as the superior retention band. ==Clinical significance== This ligament is an important anatomical landmark of the duodenojejunal flexure, separating the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. For example, bloody vomit or melena, black tarry stools, usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed from a location in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, hematochezia, bright red blood or clots in the stool, usually indicates gastrointestinal bleeding from the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is an especially important landmark to note when looking at the bowel for the presence of malrotation of the gut, a syndrome often suspected in young children when they have episodes of recurrent vomiting. Visualising a normal location of the ligament of Treitz in radiological images is critical in ruling out malrotation of the gut in a child; it is abnormally located when malrotation is present. During a Whipple's procedure, commonly used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas, duodenum, and part of the jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMA) is an extremely rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and may--when congenital--result from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out. ==History== The suspensory muscle of the duodenum was first named in 1853 by V√°clav Treitz, as the ' (in Latin), and described as consisting of a lower muscular portion with a broad base, and an upper tendinous portion blending with connective tissue around the origins of the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. It is commonly termed the ligament of Treitz by clinicians and as the suspensory muscle of the duodenum by anatomists. It has also been likened to \\"a polar ice cap ... a structure that many refer to but few have seen.\\" ==Additional images== File:Crura 1.pngDepiction of the origin of the suspensory muscle, from the fibres of the right diaphragmatic crus File:Gray 1913 1285.pngSuspensory muscle of the duodenum or muscle of Treitz seen in a ventral view. ==References== Category:Digestive system ","title":"Suspensory muscle of duodenum"},{"id":"1273803","text":"==Events== ===January events=== * January 3 ‚Äì The Great Western Railway of England officially opens its Swindon Works. * January 28 ‚Äì Boston and Maine Railroad and Eastern Railroad reach an agreement to both lease the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad as a joint line to Portland, Maine. === February events === * February 23 ‚Äì Boston and Maine Railroad extends its line to Agamenticus. * February 25 ‚Äì The Grand Duke of Hesse and Grand Duke of Baden in present-day Germany agree to construct the Main-Neckar-Eisenbahn from Heidelberg to a connection with the state railway in Baden. ===July events=== * July ‚Äì The Leeds and Bradford Railway, in West Yorkshire, England, obtains its Act of Parliament. ===October events=== * October ‚Äì Horatio Allen succeeds William Maxwell as president of the Erie Railroad. * October 15 ‚Äì Official opening of first continuous international railway line between Antwerp, Belgium and K√∂ln, Prussia (third day of the opening festivities, covering the Li√®ge (Belgium)‚ÄìK√∂ln part), making Herbesthal railway station the first international border station in the world. ===November events=== * November 1 ‚Äì The earliest ancestor of the Rutland Railroad, the Rutland & Burlington Railroad, is chartered by the state of Vermont. ===Unknown date events=== * John Cooke, future founder of Cooke Locomotive Works, is promoted to superintendent at American steam locomotive manufacturing company Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works. ==Births== ===February births=== * February 3 ‚Äì William Cornelius Van Horne, oversaw the major construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, youngest superintendent of Illinois Central Railroad (d. 1915). * February 27 ‚Äì Thomas Lowry, president of Minneapolis Street Railway 1877‚Äì1892, president of Twin City Rapid Transit, president of Soo Line Railroad 1889‚Äì1890 and 1892‚Äì1909 (d. 1909). ===July births=== * July 15 ‚Äì Thomas Fletcher Oakes, president of Northern Pacific Railway 1888‚Äì1893 (d. 1919). ===August births=== * August 25 ‚Äì Inoue Masaru, Japanese bureaucrat, first Director of Railways (d. 1910). ===November births=== * November 27 ‚Äì Cornelius Vanderbilt II, president of New York Central railroad (d. 1899). ==Deaths== ==References== ","title":"1843 in rail transport"},{"id":"1273826","text":"The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC or DHEC) is the government agency responsible for public health and the environment in the U.S. state of South Carolina.\\"S.C.

It has about 300 inhabitants. Its main feature is a baroque spa building with famous sculptures by Matthias Braun. ==History== In 1938, it was occupied by the Wehrmacht as one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. The railroad Pardubice‚ÄìJaromƒõ≈ô‚ÄìTrutnov, which goes through Kuks, crossed the newly established border four times within about . After the war, the German-speaking population was expelled in 1945 (see the Bene≈° decrees) and replaced by Czech settlers. ===Spa=== Kuks Hospital from air On the slope of the Elbe in Kuks, there used to be mineral springs. In 1692‚Äì96, Count Franz Anton von Sporck, the owner of the estate, directed three of them at one place and built a simple spa. When the healing effects of the water were proven by professors of the Charles-Ferdinand University and experts from Baden-Baden, Sporck enlarged the spa in 1707‚Äì22 with an octagonal Church of Holy Trinity, a hospital, theatre and other buildings in the Baroque style. The interiors and exteriors were decorated with Baroque sculptures by Matthias Braun, the most famous of which are the Virtues and Vices. Count Georg Ludwig Albrecht von Rantzau stayed in Kuks (Kukus-Bad) together with two young Dukes, Charles and Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, in 1726. In his memoirs, he calls this place the most pleasant and comfortable spa in Europe.Rantzow, George Louis Albert. M√©moires du comte de Rantzow, p. 15 Sporck died in 1738 and his heirs were not interested in maintaining the spa. A flood in 1740 destroyed most of the infrastructure and put the spa out of business. The Hospital, Church, and Pharmacy buildings have been preserved, along with historic furnishings, and are considered masterpieces of the Baroque. Braun's exterior sculptures also survive, but have been fast eroding due to the action of water, from rainfall and moisture rising from the ground. For this reason, the Kuks Forest Sculptures were listed in the 2000 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.World Monuments Fund - Kuks Forest Sculptures With the financial support of American Express, pump boxes were installed to drive groundwater away from the sculptures and low-lying vegetation was removed to enhance air circulation in the damp wooded environment. ==References== * Rantzow, George Louis Albert, de.

Wythenshawe includes the estates of Baguley, Benchill, Brooklands, Peel Hall, Newall Green, Woodhouse Park, Moss Nook, Northern Moor, Northenden and Sharston. ==History== Wythenshawe Hall, a former stately home and local landmark in Wythenshawe ParkThe name of Wythenshawe seems to come from the Old English wi√∞ign = \\"withy tree\\" and sceaga = \\"wood\\" (compare dialectal word shaw). The three ancient townships of Northenden, Baguley and Northen Etchells formally became the present-day Wythenshawe when they were merged with Manchester in 1931. Until then, the name had referred only to Wythenshawe Hall and its grounds. Due to spending cuts, the hall was temporarily closed to the public in 2010. One proposition was that Manchester City Council could sell the building to the National Trust. A Friends Group was formed to support monthly open days and events at the hall. In March 2016, the roof of the hall and an upper floor were severely damaged by a fire in an arson attack, with the clock tower also damaged. Immediately south of Wythenshawe is Manchester Airport, formerly called Ringway Airport. Before Ringway Airport was laid out, three farm fields between Rackhouse Road and Wythenshawe Road in Northern Moor, in what is now the north edge of Wythenshawe, were used as Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome. This was the UK's first municipal airfield, operating between April 1929 and early 1930. A barn was converted to act as the hangar and a farmhouse as the administration building. Temporary fuel pumps were installed. The last recorded flight from Wythenshawe Airport was on 19 June 1930. Area where Manchester Airport and Wythenshawe are now, as around 1925 ==Housing and social history== Wythenshawe is Manchester's largest district, a massive housing estate that was started in the 1920s intended as a \\"garden city\\" where people could be rehoused away from industrial Manchester. In 1920, town planner Patrick Abercrombie identified the area as the most suitable undeveloped land for a housing estate close to the city, and of land were purchased. Part of Benchill (not the area southwest of Gladeside Road) and some areas in the north were built before World War II and called the Wythenshawe Ward of the City of Manchester. The rest was built after the Second World War, starting in the late 1940s as wartime building restrictions were relaxed. Parts of Baguley were still semi-rural in the 1960s, but now there is very little open country left. The estate was built initially without many shops, amenities or services, and there was very little employment directly to hand. Although Northenden already had a shopping area on Palatine Road, the earliest new shops were built in the 1930s and included parades on Hollyhedge Road, and on Altrincham Road in Sharston (the latter was demolished in 1973 to make way for the M56 Sharston bypass). There were smaller local shops, usually a grocers - selling general household provisions, at Minsterly Parade (Woodhouse Park), Haverley Circle (Benchill), However, it took decades for some areas of Wythenshawe to get their own neighbourhood shops, which meant residents had to travel or visit a mobile shop van when it visited their area. Various residents' associations were set up to address those problems, but progress was very slow. After the Second World War, Wythenshawe eventually expanded, with several further shops being built (such as Haveley Circle, built in the early 1950s but demolished in the 1990s) and businesses were attracted to the area with the expansion of the Sharston Industrial Estate and, later, the Moss Nook and Roundthorn industrial complexes. Wythenshawe gradually acquired all the amenities and facilities that the original planners had neglected to include with the building of several new schools, shops, pubs and churches. The area also got its own hospital, and Wythenshawe Hospital grew out of the earlier Baguley Hospital in 1948. The largest shopping area was built in the 1960s in the town centre, known as the Wythenshawe Civic Centre, which has been expanded further since it was first built. In 1971, the Wythenshawe Forum was opened there, which included a library, a swimming pool, a restaurant, a bar and a theatre. From the 1990s to the 2000s, the houses that were built and owned by the council were transferred to the control of local housing associations, such as Willow Park in east Wythenshawe and Parkway Green in west Wythenshawe. Both associations merged in 2013 to form the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group which is now responsible for around 14,000 homes in Wythenshawe. In 2007, The New York Times described the housing estates in Wythenshawe as representing an \\"extreme pocket of social deprivation and alienation\\". Most of the farm buildings in the Wythenshawe area were demolished when the estate was built. Some of them, like Hollyhedge Farm and Floats Hall, were left among the houses but suffered from vandalism and had to be demolished later. Some of the present housing estates were named after former farms. Peel Hall Farm (which had a moat) survived for over 20 years as its occupant lived on the proceeds of selling his land, but soon after he left, the property was vandalised and had to be demolished. Newall Green Farm survived on the edge of the Newall Green housing estate area and was still occupied and run as a farm until the early 21st century when its last occupant died, when it was abandoned and fenced off. The buildings are listed. In 2006, a firm bought Newall Green Farm's buildings from Manchester Corporation. On 21 June 2014, vandals set fire to Newall Green Farm, and its roof was destroyed, but there are plans to turn the buildings into a care home for adults with learning disabilities, a working farm and a horse-riding centre.Manchester Evening News, page 21, 27 June 2014 ==Parks== Wythenshawe has 12 parks and 18 woodland areas including Wythenshawe Park, which was designated a Local Nature Reserve in 2011. It covers over of green space and is home to Manchester's only community farm, Wythenshawe community farm. At the centre of the park is the historic Wythenshawe Hall with its Civil War and Tatton heritage. The park also has riding stables, a horticulture centre, children's play area, athletics track, football pitches, tennis courts, bowls and golfing facilities. Other parks include Hollyhedge Park, Peel Hall Park, Painswick Park and Baguley Park. Northenden's Riverside Park is the first new park to be established in the city in the 21st century. ==Governance== The district is under the authority of Manchester City Council. Manchester Wythenshawe was a parliamentary constituency created in 1950 and represented by Alf Morris of the Labour Party between 1964 and 1997. Before the 1997 election, the boundaries were redrawn and part of the neighbouring area of Sale included in the seat. The new constituency is called Wythenshawe and Sale East. In the same year, Alf Morris stepped down and was replaced by Paul Goggins. It is still considered a safe Labour seat, with Labour securing over 50% of the vote (and more than twice as many votes as its nearest rival) in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections. Labour kept the seat in the 2010 elections, though their share of the vote was decreased to 44.1%. In early 2014, following the death of Paul Goggins, a by-election was held. Labour candidate Mike Kane (a former Northenden councillor until 2008) won the seat with 55.3% of the vote, though voter turnout was low (28%). The 2017 general election saw the largest vote share for Labour in the history of both the current and former Wythenshawe seat with 62.2% of the vote and a 15,000 majority. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, Wythenshawe was divided into six local government wards: Baguley, Benchill, Northenden, Sharston, Woodhouse Park and Brooklands (the latter being an area divided with the neighbouring borough of Trafford). Each ward was represented by three local councillors, giving Wythenshawe 21 of the 99 seats on Manchester City Council. Following a review by the Boundary Committee for England published in 2003, the ward of Benchill was abolished, and its former territory was divided between the wards of Northenden, Sharston, and Woodhouse Park. Wythenshawe typically returns all Labour councillors in local elections, although in the 2008 elections the Liberal Democrats gained a seat in Northenden and a second seat (in the same area) in the 2010 elections. Labour regained these seats in the 2012 and 2014 elections. ==Geography== Wythenshawe is south of the city centre and is the southernmost district of Manchester. It is surrounded by some of the most affluent areas in the UK. Altrincham and Hale lie to the south-west, Sale to the north-west and Cheadle to the east. Manchester Airport, the third largest in the UK, is immediately to the south. Shadow Moss is an area south of Ringway Road in the southeast corner of Wythenshawe. On this old map of Wythenshawe it is roughly the rectangular area between three country lanes with Heyhead at its northwest corner.Wythenshawe, A History of the townships of Northenden, Northen Etchells and Baguley, Volume 1: 10 1926, edited by W.H.Shercliff, , published by Northenden Civic Society 1974 On modern maps, its north edge is the southern branch of Ringway Road. It was partly in Northen Etchells township and partly in Styal parish. For many centuries it was a peat bog which was dug for peat fuel, locally called \\"turf\\"; local manorial law said that after digging peat the top living plant layer had to be lodged back to let more peat form afterwards. Each man's allocated part of the Moss was called his \\"moss room\\". In the 19th century, manorial control was lost over what people used their moss rooms for, and an 1839 tithe map of Northen Etchells shows Northen Etchells's part of Shadow Moss as about 2/3 arable, about 1/3 meadow, one field as pasture, and one field as \\"uncultivated moors\\".W.H.Shercliff, 1974, page 3 Later, the fertile lowland peat soil led to the area being much used for market gardening, with large areas under greenhouses. Of the people who worked there, many lived in Heyhead. As of around 1970, Heyhead was a small settlement at the south end of Woodhouse Lane and the nearby part of Ringway Road. It comprised several terrace houses, a small shop, two or more old cottages, a chapel, and the Ringway Haulage Company. Manchester Airport's ground level car parking has been displaced from other areas and car parks have been formed to the north and south of the runways and under the approach path. The Heyhead area has been progressively replaced by level car parks, and by 2011 all of Heyhead's buildings had vanished (see History of Manchester Airport#Expansion). Some greenhouses remain at the far east of the Shadow Moss area as of June 2012, but are used by private car parking operators (not associated with the airport company) and not for growing any crop. The last market gardener there, who grew tomatoes, closed his business in 2011 due to competition from highly mechanized enormous greenhouse establishments elsewhere. ==Public services== Wythenshawe is policed by the city of Manchester Division of Greater Manchester Police. Wythenshawe's fire and rescue services are the responsibility of the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, and are based at a fire station on Brownley Road. ==Transport== The M56 motorway, constructed in the 1970s as a continuation of the A5103 road (Princess Parkway), bisects east and west Wythenshawe. A bypass connecting it to the nearby M60 motorway was built through Sharston and opened in 1974. The nearest railway station to Wythenshawe was located adjacent to Longley Lane at the edge of Sharston on the Cheshire Lines Railway from Stockport to Liverpool. Named Northenden for Wythenshawe, Northenden railway station was closed on 30 November 1964.Butt, p.173 Wythenshawe did not then have a public railway service for several decades, with the nearest stations being located in the neighbouring areas of Gatley, Heald Green and Altrincham. A station at Manchester Airport was opened in 1993. The Airport Line branch of the Manchester Metrolink tram service includes twelve stops throughout Wythenshawe. The line opened on 3 November 2014, a year ahead of schedule. In addition to the building of the new Metrolink lines and stations, a new public transport hub was built in Wythenshawe Town Centre which opened in June 2015 and includes a new bus station and tram stop. ==Economy== The Civic Centre in Wythenshawe. The Park Court multi-storey flats at the far end were demolished in 2007, replaced by new retail and office buildings. Approximately 43,000 people work in Wythenshawe. There are four areas of industrial activity (estates) - Moss Nook, Ringway (Airport Cargo Centre), Roundthorn and Sharston. It is home to Manchester Airport and UHSM Wythenshawe Hospital, which are two of the largest employers in the area. Many national and international companies have premises or main offices in Wythenshawe, including Timpson Ltd, HellermannTyton, Virgin Media, Vodafone and F. Duerr & Sons. In 1934, George Hamer Scholes built the Wylex Works to produce electrical accessories. The company was later acquired by Electrium, which is now under Siemens' ownership. Several greenfield and greyfield sites have been opened up to developers and there are several new housing developments within the area. The town centre, known as the Civic Centre, was originally built in the 1960s. It expanded over the years and was renovated between 1999 and 2002 to include new stores and other new features, when the city council relinquished ownership and transferred it to St. Modwen Properties. The main shopping area now includes gates that are locked at night to prevent the vandalism that was seen in previous years. The Forum centre, which opened in 1971, houses a library, leisure centre, swimming pool, cafe and other amenities, has also been renovated in a more modern style. For thirty years it also housed the Forum Theatre, but this closed in 2002 and a health clinic and an adult education facility now occupy its space. In 2007, Asda opened a new superstore on the site of the old Co-operative store (originally built by Woolco in the mid-1970s, which also features a multi- storey car park). A walkway going between the multi-storey car park and the large supermarket building now features a wall mosaic depicting various aspects of the town. After the demolition of two 1960s blocks of multi-storey flats in 2007, new buildings were constructed on the site including a new Wilko shop, office premises and a local authority services hub that provides a new frontage for the town centre from its north-facing aspect. ==In the media== Wythenshawe is the outdoor filming location for the Channel 4 series Shameless, which shows various shots of the local tower-blocks, housing estates and other architecture unique to this area. Wythenshawe also housed the outdoor sets for the show, which were built on private property. Production moved from West Gorton (in East Manchester) in early 2007, following disruption to filming caused by local youths. In 2009, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York (former wife of Prince Andrew) went to Wythenshawe to make a television documentary for ITV1 entitled The Duchess On The Estate.ITV1 (The Duchess On The Estate - press release) In it, she visited the Northern Moor area of Wythenshawe to meet locals and discuss their way of life, and to open a new local community centre. Both before and after its transmission, the documentary was criticised for being a self-serving publicity stunt by Ferguson and she was also criticised for her patronising attitude towards the local people. ==Notable people== * The professional boxer and heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury was born and raised in Wythenshawe. * Actor Harry H.

He was executed in the notorious Mokot√≥w Prison as one of anti- communist so-called Cursed soldiers following the Soviet takeover of Poland at the end of World War II. ==Life== Szendzielarz was born in Stryj (Austrian Partition, now Lviv Oblast, Ukraine), then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and from 1919 to 1939 in Poland, into the family of a railway worker. After graduating from primary school in Lw√≥w, he attended a biological-mathematical gymnasium in Lw√≥w and then Stryj. After graduating, he volunteered for the Polish Army and completed Infantry Non-commissioned officer School in Ostr√≥w Mazowiecka (1932), then Cavalry NCO School in GrudziƒÖdz. He was promoted to lieutenant and transferred to Wilno, where he assumed command of a squadron in the 4th Uhlan Regiment. ===World War II=== The young Zygmunt Szendzielarz, before World War II With his unit he took part in the 1939 September Campaign. His unit was attached to the Wilno Cavalry Brigade under General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, part of the Prusy Army. After retreating from northern Poland, the forces of Gen. Anders fought their way towards the city of Lw√≥w and the Romanian Bridgehead. However, in the area of Lublin Szendzielarz's unit was surrounded and suffered heavy losses. Soon afterwards Szendzielarz was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets, but he managed to escape to Lw√≥w, where he lived for a short period under a false name. He tried to cross the Hungarian border to escape from Poland and reach the Polish Army being formed in France, but failed and finally moved with his family to Wilno. In Wilno, Szendzielarz started working on various posts under false names. In mid-1943 he joined the Home Army under the nom de guerre ≈Åupaszka, after Jerzy DƒÖbrowski,\\"≈Åupaszka ‚Äì the cursed soldier\\", Pangea Magazine, June 8, 2014 and in August he started organizing his own partisan group in the forests surrounding the city. Soon the unit was joined by local volunteers and the remnants of a unit of Antoni Burzy≈Ñski (\\"Kmicic\\"), destroyed by Soviet Partisans and the Wehrmacht. By September, the unit was 700 men strong and was officially named the V Vilnian Home Army Brigade (V Wile≈Ñska Brygada Armii Krajowej). Soldiers of the 5th Wilno Brigade. From left: ppor. Henryk Wieliczko (\\"Lufa\\"), por. Marian Pluci≈Ñski (\\"M≈õcis≈Çaw\\"), mjr Zygmunt Szendzielarz (\\"≈Åupaszka\\"), NN, por. Zdzis≈Çaw Badocha (\\"≈ªelazny\\") ≈Åupaszko's unit fought against the German army and SS units in the area of southern Wilno Voivodeship, but was also frequently attacked by the Soviet Partisans paradropped in the area by the Red Army. In April 1944, Zygmunt Szendzielarz was arrested by the Lithuanian police and handed over to the Gestapo. ≈Åupaszko was free in the same month under circumstances that remain unclear. In reprisal actions his brigade captured several dozen German officials and sent several threatening letters to Gestapo but it remains unknown if and how these contributed to his release. ===Operation Ostra Brama=== In August, the commander of all Home Army units in the Wilno area, Gen. Aleksander \\"Wilk\\" Krzy≈ºanowski, ordered all six brigades under his command to prepare for Operation Tempest ‚Äî a planned all-national rising against the German forces occupying Poland. In what became known as Operation Ostra Brama, Brigade V was to attack the Wilno suburb of Zwierzyniec in cooperation with advancing units of the 3rd Belorussian Front. However, ≈Åupaszko, for fear of being arrested with his units by the NKVD and killed on the spot, disobeyed orders and moved his unit to central Poland. Wilno was liberated by Polish and Soviet forces, and the Polish commander was then arrested by the Soviets and the majority of his men were sent to Gulags and sites of detention in the Soviet Union. It is uncertain why Szendzielarz was not court-martialed for desertion. Most likely it was in fact General \\"Wilk\\" himself who ordered ≈Åupaszko's unit away the Wilno area, due to ≈Åupaszko long having been involved in fighting with Soviet partisans and Wilk not wanting to provoke the Red Army. Regardless, after crossing into the Podlasie and Bia≈Çystok area in October, the brigade continued the struggle against withdrawing Germans in the ranks of the Bia≈Çystok Home Army Area. Zygmunt Szendzielarz, the commander of the 5th Brigade, was responsible for the massacres in the area on several Lithuanian and Belarussian Villages. ≈Åupaszko's unit remained in the forests and he decided to await the outcome of Russo-Polish talks held by the Polish Government in Exile. Meanwhile, the unit was reorganized and captured enough equipment to fully arm 600 men with machine guns and machine pistols. ===After World War II=== Photo after arrest 1948 After the governments of the United Kingdom and United States broke the pacts with Poland and accepted the communist \\"Polish Committee of National Liberation\\" as the provisional government of Poland, ≈Åupaszka restarted hostilities‚Äîthis time against the new oppressor, in the ranks of Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá organization. However, after several successful actions against the NKVD units in the area of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, it became apparent that such actions would result in a total destruction of his unit. In September 1945, Zygmunt Szendzielarz moved with a large part of his unit to Gda≈Ñsk-Oliwa, where he remained underground while preparing his unit for a new partisan offensive against the Soviet-backed communist authorities of Poland. On April 14, 1946, Szendzielarz finally mobilized his unit and headed for the Tuchola Forest, where he started operations against the forces of the Internal Security Corps, UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa and the communist authorities. ≈Åupaszko was hoping that in the spring of 1946 the former Western Allies of Poland would start a new war against the Soviet Union and that the Polish underground units could prove useful in liberating Poland. However, when he realized that no such war was planned he decided to disband his unit. He saw further fight as a waste of blood of his men and decided to retire from open fight against the communists. After several years underground, he was arrested by the UB on June 28, 1948, in Osielec near Nowy Targ. After more than two years of brutal interrogation and torture in Warsaw's Mokot√≥w Prison he was sentenced to death on November 2, 1950 by the Soviet-controlled court martial in Warsaw. He was executed on February 8, 1951, together with several other Home Army soldiers. Szendzielarz was 40 years old. His body was buried in an undisclosed location. During a 2013 exhumation Szendzielarz's remains were recovered and identified as one of roughly 250 bodies buried in a mass grave at the so-called Meadow at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery. ==Posthumous history== After ≈Åupaszko's death, communist authorities accused him of many crimes, from the crimes against humanity to robbery and common theft. In 1988 Szendzielarz was posthumously promoted to rotmistrz and awarded the Virtuti Militari, Poland's highest military decoration, by Kazimierz Sabbat, the President of Poland in exile. After the fall of communism, in 1993, Szendzielarz was rehabilitated and declared innocent of all charges. On 2007 Polish president Lech Kaczy≈Ñski posthumously awarded Szendzielarz with the order of Polonia Restituta. 11.11.2007 ==Dubinki Massacre== ===The Course=== On June 23, 1944, the 5th Home Army Brigade of Vilnius attacked the fortified village of Dubinki, which was inhabited by Lithuanian military settlers, capturing a bunker defended by Lithuanian policemen by surprise. The resistance against Polish Partisans was also broken. Having the list of people who collaborated with the occupier they began action to avenge the death of the residents of Glinciszki. Wo≈Çkonowski i ≈Åukomski page=256 In Dubinki between 21 and 27 inhabitants of the village died, including women and children.Wo≈Çkonowski i ≈Åukomski page=256 The actions were done to avenge the deaths of Poles in the village of Glinciszki.Wo≈Çkonowski i ≈Åukomski page=256 On the 20 June 1944 a Lithuanian unit of the Schutzmannschaft murdered 39 Poles in Glinciszki, including women and children. The action was also provoked by the actions of Lithuanian units on the civilian population in Paw≈Ç√≥w, Adamowszczyzna, and Sie≈Ñkowszczyzna. Dubinki became the target of the attack due to many of the policemen, and their families, responsible for the Glinciszki crime living there. According to Pawe≈Ç Rokicki, the actions in Dubinki are a warcrime, and the deaths of the civilians were intentional. ===Crimes against Humanity=== The unit of Zygmunt Szendzielarz massacred civilians in 1944. The victims of the 5th AK Brigade were primarily women and children (about 75% of all those killed). They were shot as a result of the deliberate action of \\"Lupaszka.\\" During the action in Dubinki, there was no fight, in particular with the Lithuanian police, which simply was not there. Findings from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance(IPN) leave no doubt that the retaliatory action of the 5th Home Army Brigade was a war crime on civilians.https://pamiec.pl/pa/tylko-u- nas/15322,ZBRODNIA-DUBINSKA-A-MAJOR-LUPASZKOquot.html On April 17th, 1945 the unit of Zygmunt Sendzielarz once again massacred civilians of Belarusian Origin in the Village of Narewka, Poland.https://www.tygodnikprzeglad.pl/58176-2/ ===Discrepancies=== There are varying accounts of the actions that took place. According to one Zygmunt Szendzielarz told his troops to avenge after hearing about what happened in Glinciszki, and by doing so disregarded the order of his superiors..

In 1820, while staying with his uncle, he learned botany from a professor. ===Commercial career=== He entered commercial life and, in 1828, went to the United States, where he worked for a time as a clerk in Boston and Philadelphia. In 1828, he was requested to supervise a transport of Saxon sheep to the American state of Virginia, where he lived for a time. The same year, he became a partner in a tobacco manufactory at Richmond. The factory was burned, and Schomburgk was ruined. He suffered further setbacks on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas, where he lost all his belongings in a fire. Consequently, he ceased his business activities. Schomburgk's 1840 map of his route through Guayana ===Geographic and exploration career=== In 1830, he left for Anegada, one of the Virgin Isles, notorious for its shipwrecks. Although he did not possess the special knowledge that is required for such a work, he surveyed the island at his own expense and sent to the Royal Geographical Society (London) a report which created such an impression that, in 1835, he was entrusted by that body with conducting an expedition of exploration of British Guiana. He fulfilled his mission (1835‚Äì1839) with great success, incidentally discovering the giant Victoria Regia water lily in 1837 and many new species of orchids, one genus of which, Schomburgkia, was named for him. He also laid to rest the persistent myth of Raleigh's Lake Parime by proposing that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah had been misidentified as a lake.Robert Hermann Schomburgk, A Description of British Guiana, Geographical and Statistical, Surpkin, 1840; p. 6. In 1841, he returned to Guiana, this time as a British Government official to survey the colony and fix its eastern and western boundaries. The result was the provisional boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela, known as the \\"Schomburgk Line\\", and the boundary with the Dutch colony of Surinam. He also made further geographical and ethnological observations and was joined there by his brother, Moritz Richard. He repeatedly urged fixing the boundary with Brazil, motivated by his encounters with Brazilian enslavement of local Indian tribes, most of which no longer exist. Schomburgk's survey later played a role in the arbitration of the southern boundary between British Guiana and Brazil, with arbitration by the King of Italy in 1904. On the brothers' return to London in June 1844, Schomburgk presented a report of his journey to the Geographical Society, for which he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1845, and continued in other official capacities. In 1846, he was stationed in Barbados, where he gathered information to compile a geographical and statistical description of the island, later to be published as the History of Barbados published in 1848 by Cass as a library series of West Indian studies. ===Diplomatic career=== In 1848, he was appointed British consul to the Dominican Republic. In 1850, he signed an advantageous commercial treaty for Great Britain and also secured a truce from Soulouque in behalf of the Dominican government. During the following years, he contributed valuable papers upon the physical geography of the island to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1857, he was promoted to the position of British Consul-General of Siam, where Britain exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction through consular courts over British subjects. In a letter to his cousin William, Schomburgk notes, \\"In order to get an insight into the English summary police court proceedings, I was, before I left London, obliged to attend police courts there for some time, also to acquaint myself with these proceedings by the study of books. Based in Bangkok, he also continued his geographical surveys. The letter gives a short account of his visit to the semi-independent kingdom of Chiang Mai in 1859‚Äì60,'Schomburgk's Account of Xiengmai' in 1859‚Äì1860; 'Schomburgk's Account of 'The Lao' in 1859‚Äì1860'.

Chiang Mai ,Cognoscenti Books, 2012. thence by elephant across the mountain range to Moulmein on the Bay of Bengal, returning to Bangkok after a trip of 135 days and approximately 1000 English miles. ===Death=== He retired from the public service in 1864, hampered by health problems, and died in Sch√∂neberg on 11 March 1865. === Recognition === Schomburgk was a member of various European, American, and Asiatic learned societies, and was a knight of the Legion of Honour and of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle.

It organises the football leagues ‚Äì Allsvenskan for men and Damallsvenskan for women ‚Äì and the men's and women's national teams. It is based in Solna and is a founding member of both FIFA and UEFA. SvFF is supported by 24 district organisations. == Background == Svenska Fotbollf√∂rbundet (SvFF) (English:Swedish Football Association) was founded in Stockholm on 18 December 1904 and is the sports federation responsible for the promotion and administration of organised football in Sweden and also represents the country outside Sweden. SvFF is affiliated to the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF) and the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Karl- Erik Nilsson has been the President since 2012. In 2009 there were 3,359 clubs affiliated to the Svenska Fotbollf√∂rbundet with a total of more than a million members, of whom about 500,000 were active players. Together, they accounted for almost one third of the total Swedish sports movement activities. SvFF administers the Swedish men's respectively women's national football teams, other football teams and leagues including the Allsvenskan and Superettan. The motto of Swedish football ‚Äì \\"one club in every village, football for all\\" ‚Äì is reflected in the democratic constitution of Swedish football. All football competition in the nation is arranged by the SvFF and its 24 district organisations. The clubs are voting members at the annual meetings of the district organisations. The district organisations and the elite clubs are entitled to vote at the F.A.'s general meeting. SvFF was the sole owner of Sweden's national stadium, the R√•sunda Stadium in Solna, from 1999 until it was replaced in 2012 by Friends Arena, located about 1 kilometer away and also in Solna. SvFF is the lead partner in the consortium that owns the current stadium, and maintains its offices there (as it did at the prior stadium). The Swedish Football Association Football Gala is held annually in November since 2005. It includes the award for the best male player (Guldbollen) and female players (Diamantbollen). SvFF had a turnover 2008 of 554 MSEK. == Early history == The first Swedish national football championship was played in 1896 but it was 7 years later in 1903 that the Riksidrottsf√∂rbundet was formed which was to be the precursor to the Svenska Fotbollf√∂rbundet. The new organisation had a football and hockey section (hockey being the term for bandy at that time and not ice hockey or field hockey). In 1904 Sweden was one of 7 nations that founded FIFA. It also introduced ice hockey to Sweden in 1920, before the 1922 establishment of the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. Before the 1925 establishment of the Swedish Bandy Association, the Swedish Football Association also administered organized bandy in Sweden. In 1906 the name Svenska Fotbollf√∂rbundet (Swedish Football Association) was officially accepted and the following year SvFF was officially voted into FIFA. On 12 July 1908, Sweden's first international match was played in which Norway were defeated 11‚Äì3 in Gothenburg. However the Olympics were a disappointment for Sweden, losing 1‚Äì12 to England and 0‚Äì2 to the Netherlands. == Competitions == { class=\\"infobox football\\" style=\\"width: 16em; text-align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"font-size: 14px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Swedish Football League Structure -  style=\\"font-size: 12px;\\"  Allsvenskan (Tier 1) Superettan (Tier 2) Division 1 (Tier 3) Division 2 (Tier 4) Division 3 (Tier 5) Division 4 (Tier 6) Division 5 (Tier 7) Division 6 (Tier 8) Division 7 (Tier 9) Division 8 (Tier 10) - } { class=\\"infobox football\\" style=\\"width: 16em; text-align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"font-size: 14px; background: #BFD7FF;\\"  Swedish Football Women's League Structure -  style=\\"font-size: 12px;\\"  Damallsvenskan (Tier 1) Elitettan (Tier 2) Women's Division 1 (Tier 3) Women's Division 2 (Tier 4) Women's Division 3 (Tier 5) Women's Division 4 (Tier 6) Women's Division 5 (Tier 7) Women's Division 6 (Tier 8) - } Svenska Fotbollf√∂rbundet is responsible for organising the following competitions: ===Men's football=== *Allsvenskan (Tier 1) *Superettan (Tier 2) *Division 1 (Tier 3) ‚Äì two sections *Division 2 (Tier 4) ‚Äì six sections *Division 3 (Tier 5) ‚Äì twelve sections * Folksam utvecklingsserie ‚Äì two sections ===Women's football=== *Damallsvenskan (Tier 1) *Elitettan (Tier 2) *Division 1 Norrettan (Tier 3) *Division 1 S√∂derettan (Tier 3) *Division 2 (Tier 4) ‚Äì nine sections ===Junior=== *Juniorallsvenskan *Pojkallsvenskan ===Cups=== *Svenska Cupen ‚Äì Men *Svenska Cupen ‚Äì Women *CANAL+-cupen ‚Äì Junior Boys *Cup Kommunal ‚Äì Junior Girls ==Honours== ===Men's=== ;FIFA World Cup *Runners-up (1958) *Third place (1950, 1994) ;Olympic Games *Winners (1948) *Third place (1924, 1952) ;FIFA U-17 World Cup * Third place (2013) ;UEFA European Under-21 Championship * Winners (2015) * Runners-up (1992) ===Women's=== ;FIFA Women's World Cup * Runners-up (2003) * Third place (1991, 2011, 2019) ;Olympic Games * Runners-up (2016) ;UEFA Women's Championship * Winners (1984) * Runners-up (1987, 1995, 2001) ;UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship * Winners (1999, 2012, 2015) * Runners-up (2009) ;UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship * Runners-up (2013) == District Football Associations == Swedish football is built on a single pyramid league system.

It was also called Langobarda, Longobarda, Longobardisca (signifying its origins in the territories ruled by the Lombards), or sometimes Gothica; it was first called Beneventan by palaeographer E. A. Lowe. It is mostly associated with Italy south of Rome, but it was also used in Beneventan-influenced centres across the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia. The script was used from approximately the mid-8th century until the 13th century, although there are examples from as late as the 16th century. There were two major centres of Beneventan usage: the monastery on Monte Cassino, and Bari. The Bari type developed in the 10th century from the Monte Cassino type; both were based on Roman cursive as written by the Langobards. In general the script is very angular. According to Lowe, the perfected form of the script was used in the 11th century, while Desiderius was abbot of Monte Cassino, declining thereafter. ==Features== Beneventan features many ligatures and \\"connecting strokes\\" ‚Äì the letters of a word could be joined together by a single line, with forms almost unrecognizable to a modern eye. Ligatures may be obligatory as: , , , and (two different forms: ti-dura where had kept the t sound and ti-assibilata where t had taken the vulgar ts sound). They may be optional: frequent as , and ; or rare as , and .The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058-1105, Francis Newton Ligatures involving the letter resemble late New Latin Cursive as in the Merovingian and Visigothic, exception made for peculiar ligature where is connected to on top influencing later on the German pre-caroline script and all the script from this derived until nowadays.Fonts for latin paleography, 4th ed., Juan-Jos√© Marcos In ligatures can take many forms depending on the letter joined to it. Ligatures with the letters and are also common. In early forms of Beneventan, the letter has an open top, similar to the letter ; later, it resembled \\"cc\\" or \\"oc\\", with long tails hanging to the right. In the Bari type, the letter often has a \\"broken\\" form, resembling the Beneventan form of the letter . However, itself has a very long middle arm, distinguishing it from . The letter can have a vertical or left-slanting ascender, the letter resembles the uncial form, and the letter is very tall and resembles . The script has a unique way to signify abbreviations both by omission and contraction ‚Äì like most other Latin scripts, missing letters can be signified by a macron over the previous letter, although Beneventan often adds a dot to the macron. There is also a symbol resembling the digit , or a sideways , when the letter has been omitted. In other scripts there is often little or no punctuation, but standard punctuation forms were developed for the Beneventan script, including the basis for the modern question mark. Beneventan shares some features with Visigothic and Merovingian script, probably due to the common late Roman matrix. ==References== ==Further reading== * Francesco Bianchi/Antonio Magi Spinetti: BMB.

F. Schumacher, published in 1977. The title is a reference to Maimonides's The Guide for the Perplexed. Schumacher himself considered A Guide for the Perplexed to be his most important achievement, although he was better known for his 1973 environmental economics bestseller Small Is Beautiful, which made him a leading figure within the ecology movement. His daughter wrote that her father handed her the book on his deathbed, five days before he died and he told her \\"this is what my life has been leading to\\". As the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"A Guide for the Perplexed is really a statement of the philosophical underpinnings that inform Small Is Beautiful\\". Schumacher describes his book as being concerned with how humans live in the world. It is also a treatise on the nature and organisation of knowledge and is something of an attack on what Schumacher calls \\"materialistic scientism\\". Schumacher argues that the current philosophical \\"maps\\" that dominate western thought and science are both overly narrow and based on some false premises. However, this book is only in small part a critique. == Four Great Truths== Schumacher put forward what he considers to be the four great truths of philosophical map making: * The world is a hierarchical structure with at least four \\"levels of being\\". * The \\"Principle of Adequateness\\" determines human ability to accurately perceive the world. * Human learning relates to four \\"fields of knowledge\\". * The art of living requires an understanding of two types of problem: \\"convergent\\" and \\"divergent\\". ==Critique of materialistic scientism== Schumacher was very much in favor of the scientific spirit, but felt that the dominant methodology within science, which he called materialistic scientism, was flawed and stood in the way of achieving knowledge in any other arena than inanimate nature. Schumacher believed that this flaw originated in the writings of Descartes and Francis Bacon, when modern science was first established. He makes a distinction between the descriptive and instructional sciences. According to Schumacher the descriptive sciences are primarily concerned with what can be seen or otherwise experienced, e.g. botany and sociology, while the instructional sciences are concerned with how certain systems work and can be manipulated to produce certain results, e.g. biology and chemistry. Instructional science is primarily based on evidence gained from experimentation. Materialistic scientism is based on the methodology of the instructional sciences, which developed to study and experiment with inanimate matter. According to Schumacher many philosophers of science fail to recognize the difference between descriptive and instructional science, or ascribe this difference to stages in the evolution of a specific science, which for these philosophers means that the instructional sciences are seen as being the most advanced variety of science. He is particularly offended by the view that instructional science is the most advanced form of science, because for Schumacher, it is the study of the low hanging fruit of inanimate matter, or less metaphorically the study of the lowest and least complex level of being. As Schumacher sees it, knowledge gained about the higher levels of being, while far harder to get and far less certain, is all the more valuable. He argues that applying the standards and procedures of instructional science to descriptive sciences is erroneous, because in the descriptive fields it is simply not possible to use the experimental techniques of instructional sciences. Experimentation is a very effective methodology when dealing with inanimate matter, but applying it to the living world is liable to destroy or damage living things and systems, and is therefore inappropriate. He uses the term scientism because he argues that many people, including some philosophers of science, have misunderstood the theory behind instructional science and believe that it produces truth. But the instructional sciences are based on induction; and as David Hume famously points out induction is not the same as truth. Furthermore, according to Schumacher, instructional sciences are primarily concerned only with the parts of truth that are useful for manipulation, i.e. they focus on those instructions which are necessary to reliably produce certain results. But this does not mean that an alternative instruction set won't work, or indeed an alternative instruction set based on quite different principles. For Schumacher, instructional sciences therefore produce theories which are useful: pragmatic truths. By contrast, Schumacher argues that the descriptive sciences are interested in the truth in the wider sense of the word. He argues that materialistic scientism follows a policy of leaving something out if it is in doubt. Consequently, the maps of western science fail to show large 'unorthodox' parts of both theory and practice of science and social science, and reveal a complete disregard for art and many other high level humanistic qualities. Such an approach, Schumacher argues, provides a grey, limited, utilitarian worldview without room for vitally important phenomena like beauty and meaning. He observes that the mere mention of spirituality and spiritual phenomena in academic discussion is seen among scientists as a sign of 'mental deficiency' . Schumacher argues that where there is near total agreement a subject becomes effectively dead; it therefore is the subjects where there is doubt that deserve the most intense research. Schumacher believes in contrast to materialistic science that what is in doubt should be shown prominently, not hidden away or ignored. His biggest complaint against materialistic scientism is that it rejects the validity of certain questions, which for Schumacher are actually the most important questions of all. Materialistic scientism rejects the idea of levels of being, but for Schumacher this leads to a one-sided view of nature. For Schumacher, you can learn much about humanity by studying from the perspective of minerals, plants and animals, because humans contain the lower levels of being. But that is not the full or even the most important part of the story, as he puts \\"...everything can be learned about him except that which makes us human.\\" ===Evolutionism=== Schumacher first states that the evolutionist doctrine clearly sits in the descriptive sciences rather than instructive sciences. Schumacher accepts that evolution as a generalization within the descriptive science of biological change has been established beyond any doubt whatsoever. However, he considers the 'evolutionist doctrine' to be a very different matter. The evolutionist doctrine purports to prove and explain biological change in the same manner as the proof and explanation offered by the instructional sciences. Schumacher quotes the 1975 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as an example of this view \\"Darwin did two things: he showed that evolution was in fact contradicting scriptural legends of creation and that its cause, natural selection, was automatic leaving no room for divine guidance or design.\\" He considers the evolutionist doctrine to be a major philosophical and scientific error. Schumacher argues that the evolutionist doctrine starts with the perfectly reasonable explanation of change in living beings, and then jumps to using it as an explanation for the development of consciousness, self-awareness, language, social institutions and the origin of life itself. Schumacher points out that making this conceptual leap simply does not meet the standards of scientific rigor and the uncritical acceptance of this leap is, for Schumacher, completely unscientific. ==Levels of being== For Schumacher one of science's major mistakes has been rejecting the traditional philosophical and religious view that the universe is a hierarchy of being. Schumacher makes a restatement of the traditional chain of being. He agrees with the view that there are four kingdoms: Mineral, Plant, Animal, Human. He argues that there are critical differences of kind between each level of being. Between mineral and plant is the phenomenon of life. Schumacher says that although scientists say we should not use the phrase 'life energy', the difference still exists and has not been explained by science. Schumacher points out that though we can recognize life and destroy it, we can't create it. Schumacher notes that the 'life sciences' are 'extraordinary' because they hardly ever deal with life as such, and instead content themselves with analyzing the \\"physico-chemical body which is life's carrier.\\" Schumacher goes on to say there is nothing in physics or chemistry to explain the phenomenon of life. For Schumacher, a similar jump in level of being takes place between plant and animal, which is differentiated by the phenomenon of consciousness. We can recognize consciousness, not least because we can knock an animal unconscious, but also because animals exhibit at minimum primitive thought and intelligence. The next level, according to Schumacher, is between Animal and Human, which are differentiated by the phenomenon of self-consciousness or self awareness. Self-consciousness is the reflective awareness of one's consciousness and thoughts. Schumacher realizes that the terms‚Äîlife, consciousness and self-consciousness‚Äîare subject to misinterpretation so he suggests that the differences can best be expressed as an equation which can be written thus: * \\"Mineral\\" = m * \\"Plant\\" = m + x * \\"Animal\\" = m + x + y * \\"Human\\" = m + x + y + z In his theory, these three factors (x, y and z) represent ontological discontinuities. He argues that the differences can be likened to differences in dimension; and from one perspective it could be argued that only humans have 'real' existence insofar as they possess the three dimensions of life, consciousness and self-consciousness. Schumacher uses this perspective to contrast with the materialistic scientism view, which argues that what is 'real' is inanimate matter, denying the realness of life, consciousness and self-consciousness, despite the fact each individual can verify those phenomena from their own experience. He directs our attention to the fact that science has generally avoided seriously discussing these discontinuities, because they present such difficulties for strictly materialistic science, and they largely remain mysteries. Next he considers the animal model of humanity which has grown popular in science. Schumacher notes that within the humanities the distinction between consciousness and self consciousness is now seldom drawn. Consequently, people have become increasingly uncertain about whether there is any difference between animals and humans. Schumacher notes that a great deal of research about humans has been conducted by studying animals. Schumacher argues that this is analogous to studying physics in the hope of understanding life. Schumacher goes on to say that much can be learned about humanity by studying minerals, plants and animals because humans have inherited those levels of being: all, that is, \\"except that which makes him [sic] human.\\" Schumacher goes on to say that nothing is \\"more conducive to the brutalisation of the modern world\\" than calling humans the \\"naked ape\\". Schumacher argues that once people begin viewing humans as \\"animal machines\\" they soon begin treating them accordingly. Schumacher argues that what defines humanity are our greatest achievements, not the common run of the mill things. He argues that human beings are open- ended because of self-awareness, which as distinct from life and consciousness has nothing mechanical or automatic about it. For Schumacher \\"the powers of self awareness are, essentially, a limitless potentiality rather than an actuality. They have to be developed and 'realized' by each human individual if one is to become truly human, that is to say, a person.\\" ===Progressions=== Schumacher points out that there are a number of progressions that take place between the levels. The most striking he believes is the movement from passivity to activity, there is a change in the origination of movement between each level: * Cause (Mineral kingdom) * Stimulus (Plant kingdom) * Motive (Animal kingdom) * Will (Humanity) One consequence of this progression is that each level of being becomes increasingly unpredictable, and it is in this sense that humans can be said to have free will. He notes increasing integration is a consequence of levels of being. A mineral can be subdivided and it remains of the same composition. Plants are more integrated; but sometimes parts of a plant can survive independently of the original plant. Animals are physically integrated; and so an appendage of an animal does not make another animal. However, while animals are highly integrated physically, they are not integrated in their consciousness. Humans, meanwhile, are not only physically integrated but have an integrated consciousness; however they are poorly integrated in terms of self-consciousness. Another interesting progression, for him, is the change in the richness of the world at each level of being. A mineral has no world as such. A plant has some limited awareness of its immediate conditions. An animal, however, has a far more rich and complex world. Finally, humans have the most rich and complicated world of all. ===Implications=== For Schumacher, recognizing these different levels of being is vital, because the governing rules of each level are different, which has clear implications for the practice of science and the acquisition of knowledge. Schumacher denies the democratic principles of science. He argues that all humans can practice the study of the inanimate matter, because they are a higher level of being; but only the spiritually aware can know about self-consciousness and possibly higher levels. Schumacher states that \\"while the higher comprises and therefore in a sense understands the lower, no being can understand anything higher than themselves.\\" Schumacher argues that by removing the vertical dimension from the universe and the qualitative distinctions of \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" qualities which go with it, materialistic scientism can in the societal sphere only lead to moral relativism and utilitarianism. While in the personal sphere, answering the question \\"What do I do with my life?\\" leaves us with only two answers: selfishness and utilitarianism. In contrast, he argues that appreciating the different levels of being provides a simple but clear morality. The traditional view, as Schumacher says, has always been that the proper goal of humanity is \\"...to move higher, to develop one's highest faculties, to gain knowledge of the higher and highest things, and, if possible, to \\"see God\\". If one moves lower, develops only one's lower faculties, which we share with the animals, then one makes oneself deeply unhappy, even to the point of despair.\\" This is a view, Schumacher says, which is shared by all the major religions. Many things, Schumacher says, while true at a lower level, become absurd at a higher level, and vice versa. Schumacher does not claim there is any scientific evidence for a level of being above self-consciousness, contenting himself with the observation that this has been the universal conviction of all major religions. ==Adequateness== Schumacher explains that the bodily senses are adequate for perceiving inanimate matter; but we need 'intellectual' senses for other levels. Schumacher observes that science has shown that we perceive not only with the senses, but also with the mind. He illustrates this with the example of a complex scientific book; it means quite different things to an animal, illiterate man, educated man and scientist. Each person possesses different internal 'senses' which means they 'understand' the book in quite different manners. He argues that the common view that \\"...the facts should speak for themselves\\" is problematic because it is not a simple matter to distinguish fact and theory or perception and interpretation. He quotes R. L. Gregory in Eye and Brain, \\"Perception is not determined simply by the stimulus pattern, rather it is a dynamic searching for the best interpretation of data.\\" He argues that we 'see' not just with our eyes; but our mental equipment and \\"since this mental equipment varies greatly from person to person, there are inevitably many things which some people can 'see' while others cannot, or, to put it differently, for which some people are adequate while others are not.\\" For him, higher and more significant perceptive abilities are based on the ability to be critically aware of one's presuppositions. Schumacher writes \\"There is nothing more difficult than to be aware of one's thought. Everything can be seen directly except the eye through which we see. Every thought can be scrutinised directly except the thought by which we scrutinise. A special effort, an effort of self-awareness is needed ‚Äî that almost impossible feat of thought recoiling upon itself: almost impossible but not quite. In fact, this is the power that makes man human and also capable of transcending his humanity.\\" He notes that for anyone who views the world through materialistic scientism this talk of higher perception is meaningless. For a scientist who believes in materialistic scientism, higher levels of being \\"simply do not exist, because his faith excludes the possibility of their existence.\\" He points out that materialistic science is principally based on the sense of sight and looks only at the external manifestation of things. Necessarily according to the principle of adequateness, materialistic science cannot know more than a limited part of nature. Schumacher argues that by restricting the modes of observation, a limited \\"objectivity\\" can be attained; but this is attained at the expense of knowledge of the object as a whole. Only the 'lowest' and most superficial aspects are accessible to objective scientific instruments. He notes that science became \\"science for manipulation\\" following Descartes. Descartes promised humanity would become \\"masters and possessors of nature\\", a point of view first popularised by Francis Bacon. For Schumacher this was something of a wrong turn, because it meant the devaluation of \\"science for understanding\\" or wisdom. One of Schumacher's criticisms is that \\"science for manipulation\\" almost inevitably leads from the manipulation of nature to the manipulation of people. Schumacher argues that 'science for manipulation' is a valuable tool when subordinated for \\"science for understanding\\" or wisdom; but until then \\"science for manipulation\\" has become a danger to humanity. Schumacher argues that if materialistic scientism grows to dominate science even further, then there will be three negative consequences: # Quality of life will fall, because solutions of quantity are incapable of solving problems of quality. # 'Science for understanding' will not develop, because the dominant paradigm will prevent it being treated as a serious subject. # Problems will become insoluble, because the higher powers of man will atrophy through lack of use. Schumacher argues that the ideal science would have a proper hierarchy of knowledge from pure knowledge for understanding at the top of the hierarchy to knowledge for manipulation at the bottom. At the level of knowledge for manipulation, the aims of prediction and control are appropriate. But as we deal with higher levels they become increasingly absurd. As he says \\"Human beings are highly predictable as physico-chemical systems, less predictable as living bodies, much less so as conscious beings and hardly at all as self aware persons.\\" The result of materialistic scientism is that humanity has become rich in means and poor in ends. Lacking a sense of higher values Western societies are left with pluralism, moral relativism and utilitarianism, and for Schumacher the inevitable result is chaos. ==Four fields of knowledge== Schumacher identifies four fields of knowledge for the individual: # I ‚Üí inner # I ‚Üí other persons (inner) # other persons ‚Üí I # I ‚Üí the world These four fields arise from combining two pairs: Myself and the World; and Outer Appearance and Inner Experience. He notes that humans only have direct access to fields one and four. Field one is being aware of your feelings and thoughts and most closely correlates to self awareness. He argues this is fundamentally the study of attention. He differentiates between when your attention is captured by the item it focuses upon, which is when a human being functions much like a machine; and when a person consciously directs their attention according to their choosing. This for him is the difference between being lived and living. Field two is being aware of what other people are thinking and feeling. Despite these problems we do experience a 'meeting of minds' with other individuals at certain times. People are even able to ignore the words actually said, and say something like \\"I don't agree with what you are saying; but I do agree with what you mean.\\" Schumacher argues that one of the reasons we can understand other people is through bodily experience, because so many bodily expressions, gestures and postures are part of our common human heritage. Schumacher observes that the traditional answer to the study of field two has been \\"You can understand others to the extent you understand yourself.\\" Schumacher points out that this a logical development of the principle of adequateness, how can you understand someone's pain unless you too have experienced pain? Field three is understanding yourself as an objective phenomenon. Knowledge in field three requires you to be aware what other people think of you. Schumacher suggests that the most fruitful advice in this field can be gained by studying the Fourth Way concept of external considering. Schumacher observes that relying on just field one knowledge makes you feel that you are the centre of the universe; while focusing on field three knowledge makes you feel that you are far more insignificant. Seeking self-knowledge via both fields provides more balanced and accurate self-knowledge. Field four is the behaviourist study of the outside world. Science is highly active in this area of knowledge and many people believe it is the only field in which true knowledge can be gained. For Schumacher, applying the scientific approach is highly appropriate in this field. Schumacher summarises his views about the four fields of knowledge as follows: * Only when all four fields of knowledge are cultivated can you have true unity of knowledge. Instruments and methodologies of study should be only applied to the appropriate field they are designed for. * Clarity of knowledge depends on relating the four fields of knowledge to the four levels of being. * The instructional sciences should confine their remit to field four, because it is only in the field of appearances that mathematical precision can be obtained. The descriptive sciences, however, are not behaving appropriately if they focus solely on appearances, and must delve in meaning and purpose or they will produce sterile results. * Self-knowledge can only be effectively pursued by balanced study of field one (self awareness) and field three (objective self-knowledge). * Study of field two (understanding other individuals) is dependent on first developing a powerful insight into field one (self awareness). ==Two types of problems== Schumacher argues that there are two types of problems in the world: convergent and divergent. For him, discerning whether a problem is convergent or divergent is one of the arts of living. Convergent problems are ones in which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. An example of this has been the development of the bicycle. Early attempts at developing human-powered vehicles included three- and four-wheelers and involved wheels of different sizes. Modern bicycles look much the same nowadays. Divergent problems are ones which do not converge on a single solution. A classic example he provides is that of education. Is discipline or freedom the best way to teach? Education researchers have debated this issue for thousand of years without converging on a solution. He summarises by saying that convergent problems are those that are concerned with the non-living universe. While divergent problems are concerned with the universe of the living, and so there is always a degree of inner experience and freedom to contend with. According to Schumacher, the only solution to divergent problems is to transcend them, arguing that in education, for instance, that the real solution involves love or caring; love and discipline work effectively, but so does love and freedom. ==Art== Schumacher in a digression from his main argument discusses the nature and importance of art. He notes that there is considerable confusion about the nature and meaning of art; but argues that this confusion dissipates when one considers art with relation to its effect on human beings. Most art fits into two categories. If art is designed to primarily affect our feelings then it is entertainment; while if art is primarily designed to affect our will then it is propaganda. Great art is a multi-faceted phenomenon, which is not content to be merely propaganda or entertainment; but by appealing to people's higher intellectual and emotional faculties, it is designed to communicate truth. When entertainment and propaganda are transcended by, and subordinated to the communication of truth, art helps develop our higher faculties and that makes it great. ==Tasks of humanity== Schumacher notes that within philosophy there is no field in more disarray than ethics. He argues that this is because most ethical debate sidesteps any \\"prior clarification of the purpose of human life on the earth.\\" Schumacher believes that ethics is the study of divergent problems; which require transcendence by the individual, not a new type of ethics to be adopted by all. He argues that there is an increasing recognition among individuals that many solutions to human problems must be made by individuals not by society, and cannot be solved by political solutions that rearrange the system. For Schumacher, the \\"modern attempt to live without religion has failed.\\" He says that the tasks of an individual can be summed up as follows: # Learn from society and tradition. # Interiorize this knowledge, learn to think for yourself and become self-directed. # Grow beyond the narrow concerns of the ego. Humanity, he says, in the larger sense must learn again to subordinate the sciences of manipulation to the sciences of wisdom; a theme he further develops in his book Small Is Beautiful. ==Reviews== The reviews of this book include: * America v. 138 (February 11, 1978). * Best Sellers v. 37 (December 1977). * Choice v. 15 (September 1978). * The Christian Century v. 94 (October 12, 1977). * The Christian Science Monitor (Eastern edition) (September 28, 1977). * Commonweal v. 105 (April 14, 1978). * Critic v. 36 (spring 1978). * The Economist v. 265 (October 1, 1977). * Library Journal (1876) v. 102 (October 1, 1977). * The New York Times Book Review (October 2, 1977). * New Statesman (London, England: 1957) v. 94 (October 7, 1977). ==Footnotes== ==References== * Schumacher, E.F.

He was born near Meppen, Kingdom of Prussia, and died in Bad Pyrmont, German Empire. He was the uncle of Levin Ludwig Sch√ºcking. ==Biography== Born into the Westphalian nobility on the estate of Klemenswerth, near Meppen, his mother, Sibilla Katharina n√©e Busch (1791‚Äì1831) was a poet who occasionally published, whilst his father was Paulus Modestus Sch√ºcking. Levin's mother became friend of the poet Annette von Droste- H√ºlshoff, who wrote her son a letter of introduction when he left home for the gymnasium in M√ºnster. Shortly after he left home, his mother died, and Droste- H√ºlshoff did her best to fill this gap in his life. After studying law at Munich, Heidelberg and G√∂ttingen, Sch√ºcking wished to enter the government judicial service, but, confronted by serious difficulties, abandoned the legal career, and settling at M√ºnster in 1837, devoted himself to literary work. In 1841 he removed to Schloss Meersburg on the Lake of Constance. In 1843, Sch√ºcking married Luise von Gall. Up to this time, Droste-H√ºlshoff had been a major inspiration in his life, but she and his wife did not get along. Droste- H√ºlshoff felt he neglected her and that his head was too turned by the revolutionary \\"young Germany\\". And then Sch√ºcking published a novel on the Westphalian nobility, which did not depict them favorably, and Droste- H√ºlshoff's friends, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly, traced many of the depictions back to Droste-H√ºlshoff. This annoyance led to her avoiding Sch√ºcking for the rest of her life. Also in 1843, he joined the editorial staff of the Allgemeine Zeitung in Augsburg, and in 1845, he joined that of the K√∂lnische Zeitung in Cologne as a literary editor and occasional foreign correspondent. In 1852 he left his career in journalism for his estate in Sassenberg near M√ºnster to have more time for writing. He died at Pyrmont on 31 August 1883. ==Works== His first efforts were descriptive: *Das Malerische und romantische Westfalen (1842) *Der Dom zu K√∂ln und seine Vollendung (1842) Among his numerous romances, which are distinguished by good taste and patriotic feeling, largely reflecting the sound, sturdy character of the Westphalians, the most noteworthy include: *Ein Schloss am Meer (1843) *Ein Sohn des Vosges (1849) *Ein Staatsgeheimnis (1854) *Verschlungene Wege (1867) *Die Herberge der Gerechtigkeit (1879) Schucking wrote a number of short stories: *Aus den Tagen der grossen Kaiserin (1858) *Neue Novellen (1877) In Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff (1862) he gives a sketch of this poet and acknowledges his indebtedness to her beneficial influence upon his mind. There appeared posthumously, Lebenserinnerungen (1886) and Briefe von Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff und Levin Sch√ºcking (1893). His wife, Luise (1815‚Äì1855), daughter of the General Freiherr von Gall, in the Hessian service, published some novels and romances of considerable merit. Among the latter may be mentioned Gegen den Strom (1851) and Der neue Kreuzritter (1853). She also wrote a successful comedy, Ein schlechtes Gewissen (1842). Sch√ºcking's Gesammelte Erz√§hlungen und Novellen appeared in 6 vols (1859‚Äì1866); Ausgew√§hlte Romane (12 vols, 1864; 2nd series, also 12 vols, 1874‚Äì1876). Several of Sch√ºcking's works appeared in the popular German weekly Die Gartenlaube (such as \\"Pulver und Gold\\" in January 1871). ==Sources== * * Carl Schurz, Reminiscences (3 vols.), New York: McClure Publ.

His maternal grandfather was Commodore Matthew C. Perry. His brothers were Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont and August Belmont Jr. He attended Everest Military Academy in Hamden, Connecticut; and graduated from Harvard College in 1872; attended the law school in the University of Berlin; and graduated from the Columbia Law School in 1876. He was admitted to the bar that same year. ===Ancestry and memberships=== Through his mother he was a descendant of Captain Christopher Raymond Perry who had served as a privateer during the American Revolution. By virtue of his descent from Captain Perry, Belmont was a member of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution. In 1929 he was elected an honorary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati. He was also a member of the Veteran Corps of Artillery. ==Career== Belmont practiced law in New York City for five years. Partnered with him in the law firm, Vinton, Belmont & Frelinghuysen, were his cousin, the writer Arthur Dudley Vinton, and George Frelinghuysen, future president of the Ballantine Brewing Company. He and his brother, August Belmont Jr., were also founding members of The Jockey Club. Belmont's former residence in Washington, D.C. Elected as a Democrat to the 47th Congress and reelected to the next three Congresses, Belmont served as U.S. Representative for the first district of New York from March 4, 1881 until his resignation on December 1, 1888. During his first term, he was a member of the committee on foreign affairs; noted for his cross-examination of James G. Blaine, the former secretary of state. The cross-examination concerned Blaine's relations with a syndicate of American capitalists interested in the development of certain guano deposits in Peru. An attempt was made to show that Blaine's efforts toward mediation between Chile and Peru were from interested motives. Belmont served from 1885 to 1887 as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs. On October 6, 1890 Belmont was invested as a Commander of the French Legion of Honor. In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Belmont served for six weeks in the Army as an Inspector General of the First Division, Second Army Corps, United States Volunteers, with the rank of major. He was appointed United States Minister to Spain that same year. Belmont with his wife, the former Jessie Ann Robbins When the Consolidated National Bank of New York was organized on July 1, 1902, the fourteen directors included individuals such as Belmont, John W. Griggs, Henry C. Brewster, George Crocker, and Mortimer H. Wagar. In 1906, Belmont became \\"permanent president\\" of the National Publicity Bill Organization, which fought for campaign finance disclosure. During the First World War, despite being 65 years old, Belmont was commissioned as a captain in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps on May 5, 1917. He was assigned to the Remount Division in Washington, D.C., and was discharged on May 21, 1920.Harvard's Military Record in the World War. Harvard Alumni Association. 1921. pg. 78. ==Personal life== In 1899, after 17 years of marriage, Jessie Ann Robbins (1858-1935) divorced Henry T. Sloane (son of William Sloane, the founder of W. & J. Sloane) to marry Perry Belmont. The marriage occurred only five hours after the divorce was decreed and, at the time, was considered scandalous. Belmont died in Newport, Rhode Island, on May 25, 1947 (age 95 years, 148 days). He is interred along with his parents and his brother August Belmont Jr. in the Belmont family plot in the Island Cemetery in Newport. His former home in Washington, D.C., became the International Temple for the Order of the Eastern Star. ==References* * (with portrait) Category:1851 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from New York (state) Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:Politicians from Newport, Rhode Island Category:Politicians from Washington, D.C.

It was introduced in May 1967 (at a time when cakes were more often bought from local bakers), to sell cakes of a local baker's standard to supermarkets, and grew to become the United Kingdom's largest cake manufacturer by 1976.Mr Kipling Press Information Pack. 2002 The trademark is owned by Premier Foods, after its acquisition of Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) in 2007. Mr Kipling's Cakes were made by the RHM subsidiary known as Manor Bakeries Ltd. which also produced products under the Lyons and Cadbury names. The Cadbury cakes are produced under licence from Cadbury plc, the owners of the brand name. ==Branding== The brand was created in the 1960s by Rank Hovis McDougall which wanted to boost its cake sales, and utilise a new bakery. The brand launched in 1967 and included 20 products sold in premium boxes. Mr. Kipling himself was non- existent, he was invented for marketing purposes. With advertising using the phrase \\"exceedingly good cakes\\", and television adverts which originally featured the voice of actor James Hayter, the brand had become the market leader in the United Kingdom by 1976, a position it still holds over forty years later. Varieties of single-serving and individually wrapped cakes have also been marketed. In the early 2000s, the Mr Kipling brand moved away from its familiar design, and, for about a year, a modern logo, consisting of a red oval with \\"Mr Kipling\\" in a script font inside the oval, was used. The slogan was modified to simply read \\"Exceedingly Good\\" and the description of cakes on the back of the packaging was altered so that it no longer appeared as if it were written by Mr Kipling. Around 2005, the manufacturers briefly experimented with another new logo and a striking pack design: pack-fronts simply consisting of the words \\"Mr Kipling\\", the name of the cake, and the phrase \\"Exceedingly good cakes\\" in a more formal, classic typeface; the only image of the cake on each pack-front was a close-up of one part of it, used as a background image for the entire pack. Around the same time, the write-ups on the back of their packaging once again purported to be written by the person of Mr Kipling. Shortly afterwards, however, the pack design and brand image whole-heartedly returned to its roots. The logo introduced at the time was very closely based on the original one, featuring a traditional-style font in a gold-edged shape, the packs feature images of the cake(s), and various product features and write-ups are featured on the pack-front. In 2009, the pack designs were slightly revamped, with more emphasis put on the name of each product; the write-ups on the back of the pack no longer purport to be written by Mr Kipling. Premier Foods also introduced what it termed 'Snap Pack' packaging (now renamed 'Snack Pack'), providing cakes in individually sealed plastic packs to keep them fresh. It quickly became a top-seller for the brand. ==French Fancies == Mr Kipling French Fancies are small sponge cakes, topped with a hemisphere of vegetable-oil \\"buttercream\\". The cakes are coated with fondant icing, with several varieties drizzled with a second colour. Standard varieties are pink (\\"strawberry\\") with pink drizzle, yellow (\\"lemon\\") with yellow drizzle, and brown (chocolate) with chocolate drizzle. Whereas cocoa is cited in the ingredients list, strawberry and lemon are not. The cakes are 30% sugar. Balfours bakery (Australia) created a frog cake in 1922. French Fancies were among the 20 varieties of cake that were part of the initial Mr Kipling launch in 1967. In September 2008, Mr Kipling announced the Big French Fancy, a large cake which can be sliced into portions. A limited edition appeared in 2012, renamed British Fancies, containing cakes in red, white and blue. Supermarket and home-made copies are called Fondant Fancies. ==References== ==External links== * *Premier Foods website Category:Bakeries of the United Kingdom Category:Food brands of the United Kingdom Category:British pie brands Category:Companies established in 1967 Category:English cuisine Category:Food manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Premier Foods brands Category:1967 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Mr Kipling"},{"id":"1273956","text":"Vehkalahti local history museum in Husula Husula is a neighborhood in Hamina, Finland.

It was later re-released by Activision in June 1997 in North America under the name Twinsen's Odyssey. In July 1997, both Electronic Arts and Virgin Interactive Software re-released LBA 2 - Virgin Interactive Software doing so under the name of \\"Twinsen's Odyssey\\". LBA 2 sold over 300,000 copies worldwide. The game is a sequel to Little Big Adventure (also known as Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure). LBA 2 was also the third game created under the label of Adeline Software International. The game features three-dimensional environments and full motion video, and all of its music is in CD-DA quality. In October 2011 Little Big Adventure 2 was re-released digitally on GOG.com and in October 2015 on Steam. ==Gameplay== Little Big Adventure 2 has two viewing modes - for indoor scenes it uses a 3D isometric perspective (the game field is rotated 45 degrees) like its predecessor, but for outdoor scenes a 3D perspective view is used. All characters and vehicles are 3D polygon-based objects, allowing for full rotation and movement abilities. The interior game field is divided in scenes (a small block of the game that is active). After completion of certain tasks the player is presented with a full motion video sequence. All text in the game is spoken by the characters. The LBA world is considered extremely large and varied for games of its time. There are three planets to visit, with Twinsun and Zeelich containing their own islands, each with their own unique graphical style. Essentially every character in the game is interactive and will respond differently when Twinsen speaks to them. Like its predecessor, LBA 2 is real-time adventure. It combines several action game/arcade sequences and some elements from the role-playing game genre. The game's gameplay is partially free-roaming, allowing the player to travel around the islands once they have been \\"unlocked\\" by completing certain objectives; there are also many tasks which are optional or non-linear. Certain locations in the game are initially blocked from the player until they progress to a certain stage. Almost all characters can be talked to, and enemies are often performing tasks while the game world is active. ==Plot== After Twinsen defeated FunFrock at the end of Little Big Adventure, Twinsun was peaceful, until a sudden storm covered Citadel Island. The Dino-Fly, a creature encountered in LBA 1 is struck by lightning and crashes in Twinsen and Zoe's garden. Twinsen seeks help from Ker'aooc, a healing wizard, who lives on Desert Island. But ferry crossings are cancelled. He aids Bersimon, the island's weather wizard, resulting in the clouds disappearing. After the storm, alien creatures, who call themselves Esmers, land on the planet, under a false diplomatic guise and Twinsen begins training under the Wizard's School after hearing of missing children on the planet. The Esmers use their army to secretly capture Twinsun's Children and openly invite the Wizards to their planet (which is revealed later to be a trap to capture them). After graduating as a wizard, Twinsen is informed by his master of the possible plot of the Esmers and is sent to investigate their planet by accepting their invitation to all Wizards. Once Twinsen lands in Zeelich (the Esmers' two-layered, Jupiter-like gas home planet), the invitation proves to be a trap and he is arrested on the landing port. After tricking one of the guards with the help of another prisoner, Twinsen manages to escape imprisonment and escapes the planet in one of the ships. He eventually crashes in the mountains of Citadel Island, where he is attacked by an Esmerian soldier, after defeating him and making his way into the city he finds out that the Esmers have taken over the planet and have imposed martial law. After going home to check on Zoe he finds out that Baldino has left him a protopack (Prototype Jetpack; it can hover, not fly) in the warehouse, he retrieves it and sets out to find his friend. Once making it to Desert Island he finds out that Baldino has disappeared, he proceeds to investigate his house and discovers that Baldino has built a spacecraft and for some reason went to Emerald Moon (Twinsun's moon). He visits the Wizard's School and learns from his master that in order to proceed in his journey and face the Esmers, who prove to be more than he can handle, he must obtain a powerful artifact from beneath Citadel Island. Home to several different species, Zeelich is a two-layered planet, the upper layer located above the sea of toxic gas that plagues the planet. The lower layer is located beneath the gas. Its inhabitants await the day when a certain prophecy will be fulfilled, and the Dark Monk, the shadow god, will emerge and restore Zeelich. Twinsen eventually gathers together four fragments making up a key which must be placed inside a little temple on Celebration Island. He unmasks Dark Monk, who is really FunFrock, the villain from the first game. He kills FunFrock, and returns to stop the moon of Twinsun crashing into the planet. ==Development== The music of Little Big Adventure 2 is composed by the French composer Philippe Vachey. ==Reception== Little Big Adventure 2 sold above 300,000 units by August 1999. GameSpot reported, \\"In France, Twinsen is big. In the States, he's an obscure oddity.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20001214162200/http://gamespot.com/features/tenspot_neverplayed/game9.html Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World said, \\"With its unparalleled sense of marvel and imagination, engaging story, and deft mix of action and adventure, Twinsen's Odyssey is a true delight and simply the most charming game I've ever played\\". GameSpot's Ron Dulin gave the game 8.1 out of 10, stating \\"Fans of adventure games will not want to pass this one up\\". Jos√© Dias of Adventure Classic Gaming said \\"Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure is among the most original and intriguing adventure games ever released.\\" and gave it a 4 out of 5.

It is also one of the fastest growing religion in South Africa. Islam in South Africa has grown in three phases. The first phase brought the earliest Muslims as part of the involuntary migration of slaves, political prisoners, and political exiles from Africa and Asia (mainly from the Indonesian archipelago) that lasted from about 1652 to the mid-1800s. The second phase was the arrival of indentured labourers from British India to work in the sugar-cane fields in Natal between 1860 and 1868, and again from 1874 to 1911. Of the approximately 176,000 Indians of all faiths who were transported to the Natal province, almost 7-10% of the first shipment were Muslims. Islamic texts in the Nizamiye Mosque in Midrand The third phase has been marked by a wave of African Muslims following the end of apartheid in 1994. Recent figures put the number of these immigrants at approximately at between 75,000 and 100,000. In addition, a considerable number of Muslims from South Asia that have arrived as economic migrants. Although the majority of Muslims are Sunni, smaller numbers are Shia and there is also a large Ahmadi following, particularly in Cape Town. ==History== Mosque in Cape Town ===The VOC period=== In the 17th century, the Dutch controlled East Indies and the Cape. Muslims were brought from Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia), etc. as slaves including those who waged Jihad in the Dutch colonies. The first recorded arrival of free Muslims known as Mardyckers is in 1658. Mardycka or Maredhika implies freedom. The Mardyckers were people from Amboyna in the southern Moluccas and were brought to the Cape in order to defend the newly established settlement against the indigenous people, and also to provide labour in the same way that they had been employed at home, first by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch, in Amboyna. Jan Van Riebeeck had requested that the Mardyckers be sent to the Cape as a labour force. The Mardyckers were prohibited from openly practising their religion: Islam. This was in accordance with the Statute of India (drafted by Van Dieman in 1642) which stated in one of its placaats [statutes]: \\"No one shall trouble the Amboinese about their religion or annoy them; so long as they do not practise in public or venture to propagate it amongst Christians and heathens. Offenders to be punished with death, but should there be amongst them those who had been drawn to God to become Christians, they were not to be prevented from joining Christian churches.\\" The same Placaat was re-issued on 23 August 1657 by Governor John Maetsuycker probably in anticipation of the advent of the Mardyckers to the Cape of Good Hope. The Placaat governed the Cape as part of the Dutch Colonial Empire. During the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century the Dutch continued to exile Muslim leaders from Dutch East Indies to the Cape. 1667 saw the arrival of first Muslim political exiles banished by the Dutch to the Cape. These political exiles or Orang Cayen were Muslim men of wealth and influence who were banished to the Cape from their homeland in the East because the Dutch feared them as a threat to their political and economic hegemony. The first political exiles were the rulers of Sumatra. They were Sheikh Abdurahman Matabe Shah and Sheikh Mahmood. Both were buried in Constantia. From the very outset the Cape authorities accommodated the exiles away from Cape Town as they feared the exiles would escape. A tomb for these political exiles has been erected on \\"Islam Hill\\" in Constantia in the Cape. Sheikh Abdurahman Matebe Shah used his exile to consolidate the teaching of Islam among slaves in the Cape. The next Orang Cayen was Sheikh Yusuf of Bantam who arrived on board 'De Voetboog' on 2 April 1694 along with his family and followers. They were housed on a farm in Zandvleit, near the mouth of the Eerste River in the Cape, far from Cape Town, on 14 June 1694. The Company's attempt to isolate Shaykh Yusuf at Zandvleit did not succeed. On the contrary, Zandvleit turned out to be the rallying point for 'fugitive' slaves and other exiles from the East. It was here that the first cohesive Muslim community in South Africa was established. Since the Sheikh and his followers hailed from Macassar, the district around Zandvleit is still known today as Macassar. Sa‚Äòid Alowie (Sayyid ‚ÄòAlawi), popularly known as Tuan Sa‚Äòid, of Mocca in Yemen, Arabia, arrived at the Cape in 1744 with Hadjie Matarim. They were banished to the Cape by the Dutch and were incarcerated on Robben Island. On his release from Robben Island Tuan Sa'id settled at the Cape where he worked as a police constable - an occupation which gave him ample opportunities for visiting slave quarters at night to teach. Tuan Sa‚Äòid is known for his active Da'wah (missionary endeavor) amongst the slaves in the Slave Lodge. He is generally regarded as the first official imam of the Cape Muslims. In 1767 Prince Abdullah Kadi Abu Salaam of Tidore, Indonesia, was exiled to the Cape. He wrote a copy of the Quran from memory during his incarceration, and the volume is still preserved in Cape Town. He was released from jail in 1793 and establish a madrasah or Islamic school the same year. It is the first madrasah in the country and extremely popular among the slaves and the Free Black community. It played an important role in converting many slaves to Islam. It was also at this madrasah that the literary teaching of Arabic-Afrikaans emerged. It was through his work at the madrasah that he gained the appellation Tuan Guru, meaning mister teacher. In 1793 the growth of the community encouraged Cape Town's Muslims to petition the VOC for permission to build a mosque. Tuan Guru became the first imam of the first mosque established at the Cape. Islam was a popular religion among the slaves - its tradition of teaching enabled literate slaves to gain better positions in their masters' households, and the religion taught its followers to treat their own slaves well. ===Arrival of Indian Muslims=== In the 1800s there were two groups of Muslims that emigrated to South Africa from India. The first began with a wave of immigration by indentured labourers from South India in the 1860s. These labourers were brought to South Africa by the British. 7-10% of these labourers were Muslim. The second group of immigrants were merchants or traders (\\"Passenger Indians\\") that arrived from North India and settled in Natal, the Transvaal and the Cape. The first mosque in Natal, Jumuah Musjid, was built in Grey Street in Durban in 1881. By 1911, 152,641 Indians had come to Natal.Mosques, Mawlanas and Muharram: Indian Islam in Colonial Natal, 1860-1910 Author(s): Goolam H. Vahed Source: Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 31, Fasc. 3 (Aug., 2001), pp. 305-335 ===After apartheid=== After South Africa became a democracy in 1994, there has been a growing number of Muslim migrants from South Asia and North Africa; however, their numbers are fairly low. Most of the non-South African Muslims are urban dwellers and thus live in or near Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, Kimberley, Pretoria or Johannesburg. ===New rise in conversions=== Wayne Parnell, cricketer with the South African team, converted to Islam in January 2011 Even though organizations such as IPCI, the Islamic Dawah Movement of South Africa, and the Africa Muslim Agency have been eager to proselytize in the region, there have been other civic organizations such as the MYMSA and the Call of Islam who considered other approaches to weave Islam into the social fabric of South Africa as a more significant way of making the Muslims' presence conspicuous. According to Michael Mumisa, a researcher and writer on African Islam, there has been an increase in the number of black South Africans converting to Islam particularly among the women and the youth. He believes that for some of the youth and women who were schooled in the politics of South African resistance and confrontation with the security forces of the former Apartheid state, the acceptance of Islam has become part of a radical rejection of a society based on Christian principles which are seen as having been responsible for establishing and promoting the Apartheid doctrine through the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa. The influence of the radical ideas espoused by Malcolm X is very evident among South African Muslims of all races. Branches of the Nation of Islam are already established in South Africa. Louis Farrakhan paid a visit to South Africa and was received by President Nelson Mandela and African Muslim communities. Another reason has been the presence of a growing Number of Sufi Orders and Groups. Amongst these is the Murabitun, a group that has a strong following in Spain. ==Organisations== Organizations such as the Jamiat ul-Ulama of the Transvaal (est. 1923), The Muslim Judicial Council (est. 1945) and Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa (est. 1970) enjoyed a fair amount of moral and financial support from the Muslim community for their social welfare activities. The once strong Muslim Students Association of South Africa (est. 1974), which had branches on many tertiary campuses, became less vocal and thus lost its grip on student activities; the MSA was thus replaced by Islamic societies that were either independent or affiliates of other Muslim organizations outside these institutions. There is also a Turkish school Nizamiye Muslim School which was established in 2011. There is also a community of the Chisti way of Tasawwuf. There is emerging black Muslim movement in the township around Gauteng in particular. Gauteng Muslim Shurah Council (GMSC) this is as results of a lot of dissatisfaction with the above organizations who are predominantly Indian and colored and are viewed as colonizing the black thought into indopak version of Islam. The GMSC is now resourced in all Gauteng townships with regional shurah's with Amir's. Amir Mohammed Gadimang is the leader of this group. With prominent other regional Amir's Zaid Langa (Soweto and Abdul Qadir Mandla Nkosi (Tshwane) who are the biggest regions. === Regulatory & Advisory Bodies === Besides political parties, a number of Islamic organisations operate in South Africa, looking after various aspects of Muslim life. Major organisations include the Muslim Judicial Council, whose activities include the provision of Halaal certification of food. The South African Hajj and Umrah Council (SAHUC) looks after the needs of South Africa's pilgrims and is responsible for the issuing of Hajj permits. There exist many other local organisations that look after the interests of their communities. === Relief Organisations === There are many Muslim relief organisations in South Africa serving both Muslim and Non- Muslim causes: * AWQAF SA * Africa Muslims Agency / Direct Aid International * Al Imdaad Foundation * Gift of the Givers led by Imtiaz Sooliman * Islamic Relief SA * Muslim Hands SA * Muslim Refugees Association of South Africa * Mustadafin Foundation * South African National Zak'ah Fund Some of these organisations have their roots in South Africa, while others form part of a larger international organisation. === Activism === Organisations such as PAGAD have received attention for their fight against gangsterism and drugs. PAGAD consisted of mainly Muslim people, but were joined by people from various religions. PAGAD, as the name suggests, was ostensibly formed to combat the rising trends of gangsterism and drug use. It became known more prominently, however, as proponents of urban terror. The Jamestown Foundation \\"A case study of radical Islam in South Africa\\" They were implicated in over 300 acts of violence, the majority of which involved explosives. PAGAD's operations largely ceased after the arrest and prosecution of its leaders in 2000.Monograph #63, July 2003 \\"The prime suspects? The Metamorphosis of Pagad - Fear in the City, Urban Terrorism in South Africa\\" ===Islamic political parties=== When the first democratic elections took place in April 1994 two Muslim parties emerged, the Africa Muslim Party and the Islamic Party. The AMP contested the National Assembly as well as the provincial legislature and the IP contested only the Western Cape provincial legislature. Neither party was able to secure seats in either legislature. No Islamic party contested the 1999 elections. The 2004 elections were contested by the AMP and the Peace and Justice Congress, again without success. Al Jama-ah was formed in 2007, and won its first seat in 2019, becoming the first Islam-affiliated party to do so. ==Theology== Lenasia Muslim School Most South African Muslims are members of the Sunni branch of Islam; there are also a large numbers of Shi'a and other smaller sects throughout South Africa. ===Sects=== Sunnis make up the majority of South African Muslims followed by Shia Muslims. ====Madhab==== Most of the Indian community follow the Hanafi Madhab, while the Malay, Kokni Indian & East African Communities usually follow the Sha'afi madhab, which predominates in the Western Cape. There is also an increasingly large number of adherents to the Maliki madhab, composed mostly of recent West African and Maghribi Migrants. ====Scholarship==== The Dominant traditions of scholarship are the rival South Asian Deobandi/Barelvi schools within the Indian Community. The Malay Community has a much more varied tradition with graduates of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Umm-al Qurra in Mecca & other universities in Saudi Arabia & South Asia. Most of the Indian scholars are graduates from Deobandi affiliated Madrassahs or Sunni Zia Ul Ulooms Like Jamia Razvia Zia Ul Uloom (Rawalpindi - Pakistan). ===Notable Scholars=== * Moulana Cassim Mohammed Sema (12 May 1920 ‚Äì 9 June 2007) Founder and Principal of Darul Uloom Newcastle. * Moulana Yunus Patel (1946-2011) * Moulana Abdul Hamid Ishaaq (born 20 September 1946) Founder and Principal of Madrasah Arabiyah Islaamiah better known as Darul Uloom Azaadville. * Mufti Ismail Abdur Rahim (founder of Jameah Mahmoodiyah - Springs and Madrasah Mu'einul Islam - Zakariyya Park) * Mufti Ebrahim Desai (Head Mufti, Jamiatul Ulama KwaZulu-Natal) * Moulana Shabir Ahmed Saloojee (born 26 March 1951) Principal of Darul Uloom Zakariyyah * Mufti Ebrahim Salejee (born 1956) Principal of Madrasah Taleemudeen, Isipingo Beach. * Mufti Ebrahim M Hoosen Salajee, Ameer of Siraatul Haq Islamic School & Madrasah, Estcourt.

The Muslim community in South Africa lives in harmony with other faith communities. This religious cohesion is most obvious in the Indian and Coloured residential areas where Muslims live amongst, work with and attend school with fellow South Africans of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, atheist and agnostic beliefs. South African Muslims generally do not segregate themselves from people of other faiths. As per the culture in South Africa, it is not uncommon for South African Muslims, just like their fellow non-Muslims, to shake hands, hug or even kiss (in the case of close friends and distant or close family) as a greeting - even with non- mahrams. The National Interfaith Leadership Council, which advises President Zuma, includes former Western Cape premiere, Erahim Rasool. The Muslim community has been affected by a rise in drug abuse, particularly in Cape Town of the drug Tik (crystal meth Crime and gangsterism are also visible in the poorer Muslim communities. Qur'ans are available in libraries including the National Library. During the month of Ramadan, many Muslim retail stores, radio stations (public and private), publications and organisations send messages of goodwill to the local Muslim community. Many Muslim stores are closed on Eid-ul-Fitr. Financial services providers such as First National Bank, ABSA bank, Standard Bank and Nedbank offer Sharia compliant financial solutions and banking products. South Africa also has several branches of Albaraka Bank (of Saudi Arabia), Habib Overseas Bank Ltd and HBZ Bank Ltd, which offers only Shari'a compliant banking. Oasis Crescent Management Group is also a financial service provider to Muslims in South Africa.Halal food products, butcheries, restaurants are widely available in South Africa although gender segregation is not common within South African society. ==Sharia law in South Africa== ===Marriage=== South Africa is one of the few Muslim minority countries in the world which is considering the implementation of Muslim Personal Law or Muslim Family Law. In 2003, a draft Muslim Marriages Bill was submitted to the Department of Justice. This would allow courts to enforce the marital regulations of sharia law, with the assistance of a Muslim judge and assessors familiar with Islamic law, in order to protect the rights of Muslim women. Proponents of the bill believe it would protect the rights of Muslim women as decisions made by legal scholars are not legally binding regarding financial settlements following a divorce. Questions have been raised about the need for a separate marriage bill for Muslims, and there is lack of consensus in the Muslim community itself on the need for, and structure of the bill. In 2009, an unsuccessful application was brought before the Constitutional Court of South Africa by a Muslim women's organisation, to compel the government to enact the Muslim Marriages bill. During the hearing, Judge Kate O'Regan stated that, \\"the question is whether it is acceptable for the state to take over the management of a particular religion\\". Judge Albie Sachs commented that \\"it's asking the courts to intrude, in a very profound way, on a very sensitive issue\\". ===Halaal certification=== Halal goods market. There are a number of Halal certification authorities, who certify food, retail edible items and restaurants as Halal. There is some disagreement between these organisations. The certifications carry considerable weight amongst South African Muslims. The most prominent Halaal certification authorities in South Africa are: * Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) * South African National Halaal Authority (SANHA) * National Independent Halaal Trust (NIHT) * Islamic Council of South Africa (ICSA) ==Education== The majority of South African Muslim attend mixed gender public schools, while some attend private (mostly Catholic or Anglican) schools, where they are exempt from prayer sessions and Biblical curriculum. Islamic schools also exist under the control of the Association of Muslim Schools (AMS) as well as Madrasahs. The Islamic Schools under AMS offer a syllabus combining secular and Islamic studies. The secular syllabus is taken from the CAPS syllabus issued by the Department of Basic Education while the Islamic studies syllabus is taken from the Taalimi Board affiliated to the Jamiatul Ulama South Africa. Some institutions offer short courses on Islamic teaching, while Islamic Law and Islamic finance studies are also available. Qu'ran Study groups are common and Arabic studies are available through private tutoring, or universities such as Wits University and University of the Western Cape. South Africa has a number of Darul Ulooms around the country. These institutes have students from around the world, including a large number of African students. Some of these institutions include: * Darul Uloom Pretoria * Darul Uloom Azaadville * Darul Uloom Qariyya Gharib Nawaaz, Ladysmith, South Africa * Darul Uloom Newcastle, Newcastle, South Africa ==Prominent Muslims in South Africa== Test captain of the South African cricket team In addition to Cabinet ministers, there are a number of Members of Parliament as well as councillors in the various provinces. The former Western Cape premier, Ebrahim Rasool, is Muslim (Rasool is currently serving as South Africa's Ambassador to the United States of America). Imam Hassan Solomon (Raham) was a Member of Parliament from 1994 until his death in 2009. During the struggle for liberation, Imam found himself being asked by many communities to preach, even in churches! He joined the United Democratic Front, seen by many as a front for the banned African National Congress (ANC). During his years in exile in Saudi Arabia, Imam Solomon furthered his Islamic education, but was always available to enlighten people on the situation in South Africa. Imam Solomon returned to South Africa in 1992, and took up a seat in the National Assembly in Parliament following the first democratic elections in 1994. He served in Parliament until his death in 2009. Naledi Pandor is the minister of Science and Technology, Pandor is the granddaughter of Z.K. Mathews an anti apartheid teacher and a prominent member of the ANC. Naledi converted to Islam after her marriage to Sharif Josef Pandor. Sheikh Ahmed Badsha Peer was a highly respected Sufi. He arrived in South Africa in 1860 as an indentured labourer and was given an honourable discharge by the colonial British authorities when he was discovered to be mystic. His tomb is at the Badsha Peer Square/Brook Street Cemetery in Durban. Abu Bakr Effendi was an Osmanli qadi who was sent in 1862 by the Ottoman sultan Abd√ºlmecid I at the request of the British Queen Victoria to the Cape of Good Hope, in order to teach and assist the Muslim community of the Cape Malays. During his stay at the Cape he produced one of the first works in Afrikaans literature with his work in Arabic Afrikaans, Uiteensetting van die godsdiens (). ===Sports=== *Hashim Amla became first non-White regular test captain of South Africa. *Moeneeb Josephs is a former goalkeeper for the South Africa national football team. *Ashraf Hendricks is a former defender for Morako Swallows, Bidwest Wits, Black Aces and South Africa. *Nizaam Carr became the first Muslim to play for the Springboks *Wayne Parnell is a bowler in the South Africa national cricket team. *Imraan Khan is a cricketer who plays domestic cricket and captains the Dolphins. *Farhaan Behardien is a cricketer who plays ODIs and T20Is. *Imran Tahir is a leg spin bowler who plays cricket for South Africa. *Solly Said is a top ranking karateka based in Johannesburg and founder of his own karate system.

Every weekday public TV channel SABC 1 broadcasts short religious programmes before the Siswati/Ndebele news at 17h30. Each day a different religion is represented, with \\"Reflections on Faith\\" being the Islamic edition, broadcast on Fridays 17H00-17H02. An Nur-The Light is a Muslim religious programme that airs on SABC 1 on Sunday mornings and interfaith programme. Spirit Sundae features Muslim event coverage, personal profiles and discusses issues pertaining to the community. Religions of South Africa also broadcasts information about Islam. Islam Channel is also available on DSTV to South African Muslims as well as other Muslim programmes on the DSTV Indian Bouqet. Regional community TV station Cape Town TV (CTV) has weekly broadcasts of pre-recorded Jumuah (Friday) prayer sessions. During the month of Ramadan, CTV also brings viewers lectures from the days of fasting, which broadcasts every night between 21H30-22H30. ===Radio=== Muslim stations in South Africa are limited to regional, or community based coverage. These include Radio 786 (Cape Town), Radio Islam (Johannesburg), The Voice of the Cape (Cape Town), Channel Islam International (Johannesburg) and Radio Al Ansaar (Durban). ===Print Publications=== Newspapers include Muslim Views, and Al Qalam Newspaper. ==Extremism== Generally, the local Muslim population are known to be peaceful, tolerant and moderate. However, the US state department listed two South African organizations that it claims were international terrorist organizations: People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) and Qibla. While Qibla and Pagad were active in violent activity in 2001, since then they have been involved in peaceful marches and protest actions, speaking out against war's in Iraq, Gaza, Darfur and other regions across the world. Critics claim widespread corruption among police and officials, including the black market sale of South African passports, had undermined counter-terrorism efforts. It was feared prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup that extremists may have carried out attacks during the tournament and there were reports of Somali al-Qaeda, al-Shabab and militant run camps in neighbouring Mozambique. Despite this, no direct threats or attacks materialised. The Muslim community in the country had organized a campaign to welcome guests into their country and homes, actively dispelling any perceived terrorism threats. The campaign, labelled 'SA Muslims 2010', showcased Islam and Muslims in South Africa through various exhibitions, reflecting some of the community's 300-year history. ==Controversies== ===Muhammad cartoons=== In May 2010, the local Mail & Guardian published a cartoon depicting Muhammad by Jonathan Shapiro (a.k.a. Zapiro) which sparked some uproar from the Muslim community. Death threats were made to Mr. Shapiro and the editor of the newspaper. An emergency court interdict was sought by The Council of Muslim Theologians (Jamiatul Ulama) to prevent the publishing of the cartoon, however the petition was denied by the presiding judge - who is herself a Muslim. The judge earlier chose not to recuse herself saying that her religious beliefs would not influence her. Zapiro created the cartoon in response to international outrage over the \\"Everybody Draw Muhammad Day\\" campaign of Facebook. Zapiro depicts the prohet Muhammad on a psychologist's couch moaning that, \\"other prophets have followers with a sense of humour!\\". The council stated that they feared violence in response and that the drawing may put the security of the 2010 FIFA World Cup at risk from extremists. It said that though it does not advocate violence, it would not be able to ensure that there would not be any. The editor of the paper said that, \\"\\"My view is no cartoon is as insulting to Islam as the assumption Muslims will react with violence,\\" and said that the cartoon would not have been published if it was intended to be racist or Islamophobic. Zapiro stated that his cartoon was mild and not offensive and in no way similar to the Danish cartoon depicting Muhammad in a negative light. The following week, Zapiro published a cartoon of himself on a psychologists couch off-loading about the difficult week prior, and also saying, \\"The issue is depicting the prophet... it's that simple\\", and, \\"That's for adherents of Islam! Why should non-believers be censored? And there's the contradiction of all those ancient Iranian and Turkish Muhammad drawings... drawn by devout Muslims!\\". Further, \\"I'm sorry I'm being linked to that juvenile Islamophobic Facebook campaign. And I'm sorry if anyone's linked me to the Islamophobia of the U.S. 'war on terror'! ... Or the Burqa and minaret bans in Western Europe!\\", and that \\"making exceptions for religious censorship is hard for a cartoonist\\". An editorial piece opposite the cartoon stated that the paper \\"clearly underestimated the depth of anger ignited by the cartoon, and sincerely regret the sense of injury it caused many Muslims\\". Zapiro also noted the irony of being so harshly condemned by Muslims who often supported his pro-Palestinian drawing which angered his fellow Jews. Local clerics stated in a meeting with Zapiro that week that while they support freedom of expression, they do not support drawings of Muhammad. No violence or protests ensued after the cartoon was published and most local Muslims found it to be mild and some did not find it to be offensive and found the reaction of the council to have been exaggerated. The Council of Muslim Theologians (Jamiatul Ulama) succeeded in 2006 in preventing the Sunday Times from publishing a controversial cartoon of Muhammad by a Danish cartoonist. ==See also== *Shia Islam in South Africa * Nurul Islam Mosque, a Mosque in the Cape established in 1844. * Nizamiye Masjid the biggest mosque in the Southern Hemisphere; situated in Midrand, Gauteng, completed in 2012. ==References== * * ==Further reading== * Islam in South Africa South Africa Category:History of the Dutch East India Company ","title":"Islam in South Africa"},{"id":"1274012","text":"Wickliffe Preston Draper (August 9, 1891 ‚Äì 1972) was an American political activist. He was an ardent eugenicist and lifelong advocate of strict racial segregation. In 1937, he founded the Pioneer Fund, a registered charitable organisation established to provide scholarships for descendants of original white American settlers and to support research into heredity and eugenics; he later became its principal benefactor. ==Early life and education== Draper was born on August 9, 1891, in Hopedale, Massachusetts.Draper's first name is sometimes spelled \\"Wycliffe\\" in publications. He was the son and heir of Jessie Fremont Preston Draper, daughter of Confederate Brigadier General William Preston III, who had served as the United States Ambassador to Spain, until the American Civil War\\"Jessie Fremont Preston Draper\\", Bancroft Memorial Library, Digital Commonwealth Massachusetts. Retrieved October 10, 2020. and George A. Draper, owner of Draper Looms textile and textile machinery manufacturers, who descended from generations of prominent Americans. Draper graduated from Harvard University in 1913. When the United States was slow to enter World War I, he enlisted in the British Army. When the U.S. eventually declared war, he transferred to the U.S. Army. ==Post-War== In 1924, Draper established the Draper Armor Leadership Award, as a means to competitively test the leadership of small Cavalry units in the US Army. The test was oriented to the platoon level of Horse Cavalry. The first Cavalry Leadership Test for small units was held at Fort Riley, Kansas‚Äîthen home of the Cavalry School. In 1928, Lieutenant Commander Draper established a trust fund of $35,000 to perpetuate the award. In 1927, he participated in the French mission of Captain Marcel Augi√©ras to the southern Sahara that discovered the remains of \\"Asselar man\\", an extinct human believed to belong to the Holocene or Recent Epoch. Some scholars consider it the oldest known skeleton of a black African. The French Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie subsequently awarded him its 1932 gold medal, the Grande M√©daille d'Or des Explorations\\"Les Grands Prix de la Soci√©t√©\\", Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie. Retrieved October 10, 2020. and, in Britain, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. After the war, he traveled and went on numerous safaris. His large New York City apartment was reportedly filled with mounted trophies. ==Eugenics and the Pioneer Fund== During this time, Draper became interested in the field of eugenics. Although eugenics had been a popular movement in the United States during the first three decades of the 20th century, by the early 1930s popular interest had begun to fade, as the underlying science came under question. Groups like the American Eugenics Society (AES) faced declining membership and dwindling treasuries. Draper helped ease the funding shortfall, making a special gift to the AES of several thousand dollars to support the society prior to 1932. In August 1935, Draper traveled to Berlin to attend the International Congress for the Scientific Investigation of Population Problems. Presiding over the conference was Wilhelm Frick, the German Minister of the Interior. At the conference, Draper's travel companion, Dr. Clarence Campbell delivered an oration that concluded with, \\"The difference between the Jew and the Aryan is as unsurmountable [sic] as that between black and white‚Ä¶ Germany has set a pattern which other nations must follow‚Ä¶ To that great leader, Adolf Hitler!\\" Three years later, when Draper paid to print and disseminate the book, White America, by Earnest Sevier Cox, an advocate of white supremacy and racial segregation, a personal copy was delivered to Frick. In 1937, Draper established the Pioneer Fund, a foundation intended to give scholarships to descendants of White American colonial-era families, and to support research into \\"race betterment\\" through eugenics. The scholarships were never given, but the first project of the fund was to distribute two documentary films from Nazi Germany depicting their claimed success with eugenics. The Pioneer Fund was headed by the sociologist and eugenicist, Harry H. Laughlin, an advocate for restrictive immigration laws and national programs of compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and intellectually disabled. At age 50, Draper again volunteered for military service, and was assigned a post with British military intelligence in India during in World War II. After the war, he returned to eugenicist and segregationist activism, and The Pioneer Fund supported the work of a number of noted and controversial researchers of race and intelligence, such as the Nobel Laureate William Shockley, American differential psychologist Arthur Jensen, Canadian evolutionary psychologist J. Philippe Rushton, and British anthropologist Roger Pearson. Though he never served as the Pioneer Fund's president, Draper remained on its board until his death, leaving his estate to the Fund. He also donated considerable funds to right-wing political organizations and candidates, including the World Anti-Communist League (WACL), which was later headed by Dr. Roger Pearson who had received extensive funding from The Pioneer Fund and Draper during his career at Southern Mississippi University. In addition to The Pioneer Fund, Draper financed the Back to Africa repatriation movement, particularly the work of Earnest Sevier Cox whose book \\"White America\\" he also funded. During the civil rights movement of the 1960s he secretly sent $255,000 to the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in 1963 and 1964 to support racial segregation. He had also promoted opposition to the desegregation of public schools mandated by the Supreme Court's 1954 decision, Brown v. Board of Education. These financial contributions came to light in the 1990s, when the Sovereignty Commission records were made public. Doug A. Blackmon of The Wall Street Journal and Prof. William H. Tucker of Rutgers University discovered the incriminating documents. ==Funding of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission== Draper was one of the primary out-of- state benefactors of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (MSC), during 1963 and 1964. MSC attorney John Satterfield identified Draper's contributions, totaling over $250,000 as originating from \\"The Wall Street Gang\\" from the North. Doug Blackmon of The Wall Street Journal uncovered evidence of these contributions via Draper's J. P. Morgan trust account and published his results on June 11, 1999 in The Wall Street Journal. The Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith also received $1,000,000 in the Spring of 1964 to build his \\"Christ of the Ozarks\\" shrine and tourist attraction in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Smith's Cross and the Flag periodical advanced and promulgated Draper's positions and attitudes for three decades, from 1942 to 1972 when Smith died. Draper opposed FDR's efforts to implement the Social Security Act, expanded child labor laws, and early attempts to pass the equivalent of OSHA-styled regulations. He disliked JFK for currying favor with labor unions, for promoting civil rights advances, and for his failure to pass tariff barriers to prevent the import of foreign textiles and cotton. Draper blamed the actions of both presidents for the demise of the domestic textile industry that eventually caused the Draper Company to be dissolved by Rockwell International as an insolvent entity. But Draper had successfully converted an ever-diminishing equity in The Draper Company into a $100,000,000 windfall investment in Rockwell International Preferred Stock when Rockwell began attaining new levels of profitability as the Vietnam War expanded.

Draper maintained a low profile throughout his life, as did the Pioneer Fund. When Draper died in 1972 from prostate cancer, he bequeathed $1.4 million to the Pioneer Fund. Draper's work has become more controversial since the publication of The Bell Curve (1994), because the Pioneer Fund financially sponsored much of the research reported in the book. The publication of The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism (1994) by Stefan K√ºhl resulted in further publicity for Draper and the Fund. ==Notes== 2\\\\. \\"Founders and Former Directors\\", the Pioneer Fund. ==References== * * == Further reading == * ==External links== *Selected writings by Harry Weyher, former Pioneer Fund president *Institute for the Study of Academic Racism: Pioneer Fund *\\"The Tainted Sources of 'The Bell Curve'\\" *Metcalf, Stephen. \\"Moral Courage: Is defending The Bell Curve an example of intellectual honesty?\\" Slate, October 17, 2005 *Blackmon, Douglas A. \\"Silent Partner: How the South's Fight To Uphold Segregation Was Funded Up North,\\" Institute for the Study of Academic Racism. *Lichtenstein, Grace.

He held numerous posts in the government of the United Kingdom, namely Chancellor of the Exchequer, Leader of the House of Commons, Cofferer of the Household and First Lord of Trade. He was also a justice in eyre. ==Early life== Sandys was the eldest son of Edwin Sandys (himself a descendant of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York), and his wife Alice, daughter of Sir James Rushout . He was educated at New College, Oxford, matriculating in 1711 aged 16. He left Oxford in 1715 without graduating, and embarked on a Grand Tour of Continental Europe. ==Opposition== In 1718, at the age of 22, Sandys was elected MP for Worcester, as a Whig. He represented the seat for 25 years. Initially a supporter of Robert Walpole's government, in 1725 Sandys and his uncle Sir John Rushout went into opposition with William Pulteney. Sandys was seen as second-in-command to Pulteney, the leader of the Patriot Whigs. In February 1730 Sandys introduced the Pension Bill, to bar from sitting in the House of Commons anyone with any pensions or offices held in trust for them from the Crown. The bill passed through the House of Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords; he reintroduced the bill several times in subsequent sessions, with the same result. Sandys opposed the government's economic policy: in 1733 he opposed both the motion to take ¬£500,000 from the sinking fund and the Excise Bill to tax tobacco and wine imports; in February 1736 he called attention to the increase of the national debt. On 13 February 1741, Sandys moved a motion to call upon King George II to dismiss Walpole. The Tories did not support the motion, which was defeated by 290 votes to 106; the Tory Jacobite William Shippen commented of Walpole and the opposition Whigs that \\"Robin and I are two honest men: he is for King George and I for King James, but those men in long cravats only desire places under either one or the other\\". ==Chancellor of the Exchequer== This impression that senior opposition Whigs were motivated by self- advancement rather than by opposition to the government gained substance when Walpole fell in February 1742. Pulteney (created Earl of Bath that year) brokered a deal with the Court, without consulting opposition parties. The new ministry led by Lord Wilmington was a continuation of Walpole's ministry with few personnel changes, but with Sandys appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir John Rushout and Phillips Gybbon appointed Lords of the Treasury. Pulteney and Sandys supported the appointment of a secret committee to investigate Walpole's conduct in office; Sandys was elected a member of the committee. They opposed the repeal of the Septennial Act 1716, and objected to the rejection by the Lords of the Indemnification Bill to recompense witnesses against Walpole. In December 1742 Sandys opposed a Place Bill (to limit the capacity of parliamentarians to hold other paid positions, especially in the military), although he had proposed several such bills when in opposition. Wilmington died in July 1743, succeeded as First Lord of the Treasury by Henry Pelham. On 12 December 1743, Pelham took the Chancellorship himself. ==Later career== Sandys was compensated with a peerage, being created Baron Sandys on 20 December 1743, and appointment as Cofferer of the Household. He later held office as Speaker of the House of Lords in the Pitt‚ÄìDevonshire ministry (November 1756 ‚Äì July 1757), and as First Lord of Trade under Lords Newcastle and Bute (March 1761 ‚Äì February 1763). Sandys died on 21 April 1770, from injuries sustained when his post chaise overturned on Highgate Hill. ==Family== On 9 June 1725 Sandys married Letitia, eldest daughter and co- heiress of Sir Thomas Tipping . They had seven sons and three daughters: * Edwin Sandys (28 April 1726 ‚Äì 11 March 1797), MP, succeeded as the 2nd Baron Sandys in 1770 * Cheek Sandys (1727‚Äì1737) * Thomas Sandys (born 30 September 1728, London, died in infancy) * Martin Sandys (baptised 24 November 1729, Ombersley ‚Äì 26 December 1768), Colonel, Equerry to the Duke of Cumberland ** Martin's daughter Mary (wife of Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire) inherited the Ombersley estates upon the 2nd Baron's death in 1797, and was granted a new Sandys barony in 1802. * Letitia Sandys (baptised 25 August 1731, Ombersley ‚Äì 10 January 1784) * William Sandys (baptised 5 August 1732, Ombersley ‚Äì 31 October 1749) * Anne Sandys (born 10 January 1734 ‚Äì 1797) married Christopher Bethell * John Sandys (baptised 31 October 1735, Ombersley ‚Äì 1758), soldier, died in Germany * Katherine Sandys (baptised 25 September 1736, died in infancy) * Henry Sandys (baptised 4 July 1737, Ombersley, died in infancy) ==References== == Bibliography == * * * ==External links== * Category:1695 births Category:1770 deaths Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford Category:18th-century English nobility Category:Peers of Great Britain created by George II Sandys, Samuel Sandys, Samuel Sandys, Samuel Sandys, Samuel Sandys, Samuel Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer of Great Britain Sandys, Samuel Category:Members of the Privy Council of Great Britain Category:People from Greenwich Category:People from Wychavon (district) Category:Leaders of the House of Commons of Great Britain Category:Presidents of the Board of Trade Category:Road incident deaths in London Category:Free speech activists Category:Whig (British political party) politicians Samuel ","title":"Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys"},{"id":"1274034","text":"James King (May 22, 1925November 20, 2005) was an American operatic tenor who had an active international singing career in operas and concerts from the 1950s through 2000. Widely regarded as one of the finest American heldentenors of the post-war period, he excelled in performances of the works of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. King made several recording during his career, most notably singing the role of Siegmund in Die Walkure for Sir Georg Solti's famous recording of Wagner's Ring Cycle. He was a member of the voice faculties at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City and the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University. ==Biography== Born in Dodge City, Kansas, King's father was Irish and his mother was of German lineage. In his youth he actively sang in church choirs and studied the violin. He earned a bachelor's degree in music from Louisiana State University in 1949, where he trained to be a baritone with Dallas Draper. He then pursued a master's degree in vocal performance from the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City (UMKC). He then joined the voice faculty of UMKC, where he taught for nine years and began performing in concerts and operas as a baritone. In 1956 King came to the personal realization that he was in fact a tenor and not a baritone. He began retraining his voice with French baritone Martial Singher and later German tenor Max Lorenz in order to achieve this goal. In 1960 he began his career as a tenor as a resident artist with the Saint Louis Municipal Opera. His last performance of a baritone role was for his debut with the San Francisco Opera as Escamillo in Carmen with Marilyn Horne in the title role in May 1961. In 1961 King won the American Opera Auditions in Cincinnati, whose prize enabled him to pursue further studies in Italy and make his European opera debut in his first tenor role, Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca at the Teatro della Pergola. He was soon offered contracts with major European opera houses, including the Deutsche Oper Berlin (1962), the Salzburg Festival (1962), the Vienna State Opera (1963), the Bayreuth Festival (1965), and La Scala (1968). King made his Metropolitan Opera debut on January 8, 1966, as Florestan in Fidelio. Over the next thirty years, he sang 113 performances at the Met. His other Met roles included The Emperor in Die Frau ohne Schatten; Aegisthus in Elektra; Calaf in Turandot; Lohengrin; Don Jose in Carmen; Erik in The Flying Dutchman; Siegmund in Die Walk√ºre; Bacchus in Ariadne auf Naxos; Cavaradossi in Tosca; Walther in Die Meistersinger; Captain Vere in Billy Budd; and Drum Major in Wozzeck. His final appearance was on April 27, 1996 singing Walther in the finale of Die Meistersinger to conclude the James Levine Gala. Later in life, King was a music and voice professor at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University (IU) from 1984 until his retirement from teaching in 2002. His last performance was in 2000 as Siegmund at IU. King died on November 20, 2005, of a heart attack in Naples, Florida. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Opera tenor James King dies at age 80\\" (USA Today November 22 2005) *Interview with James King by Bruce Duffie, December 9, 1988 *James King papers, 1940-1999, bulk 1968-1999 at the Indiana University Archives.

He attended Merchant Taylors' Boy's School, Crosby and in July 1893 was dramatically rescued from Crosby Beach by Eyton Owen, a schoolmaster of another school, during a tragic incident in which his older brother and their friend, all day boys at Merchant Taylors', were drowned. He received his tertiary education at the Bath School of Art (today Bath School of Art and Design a department of Bath Spa University). There he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London, from which he graduated with a Diploma in Design in his birth name George Edward Kruger. From 1905 he exhibited water colours at the Royal Academy, specialising in landscapes, flower studies and portraits. During the First World War, Kruger served with the Artists Rifles, and a camouflage unit of the Royal Engineers which specialised in hiding military items and making dummy objects to confuse enemy forces. In 1918, following his marriage to (Frances) Audrey Gordon Gray, he changed his name to George Kruger Gray. They had a son, Douglas, in October 1920. After the war, he continued his career as an artist. In 1923, he exhibited his numismatic works at the Royal Academy of Arts, winning a considerable reputation in that area, and become a 'preferred contractor' for the Royal Mint, designing coins for Great Britain, as well as other parts of the Empire. In 1938, he became a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE)\\"George Edward Kruger Gray CBE\\" in Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture, retrieved on 6 October 2013 Although best known for the design of numismatic items, he also designed and made stained glass windows for churches, universities and the like.

Additionally, he designed the reverses of the commemorative florins for 1927 and 1935. *In Canada, he designed the reverse of the one cent (penny) in use from 1937-2012, five cents (nickel) in use from 1937 to the present day, and 50-cent coins in use from 1937 to 1958. *For Cyprus, he designed the reverse of the 1938‚Äì1940 9 piastres and 18 piastres, 1928 45 and 4¬Ω piastres, and 1947‚Äì1949 florin. *For Great Britain he designed the reverse for the 1927‚Äì1945 silver threepence, 1927‚Äì1948 sixpence, 1927‚Äì1936 shilling, both the Scottish and English motifs for the 1937‚Äì1948 shilling, 1927‚Äì1948 florin, 1927‚Äì1948 half crown, 1927‚Äì1936 crown (except for the 1935 Jubilee crown), and 1937 crown.

He designed what became an important distinction given to the Royal Naval Patrol Service in the form of an exclusive silver badge. Officers and men of the Patrol Service were awarded this badge after a total of six months service at sea. It could also be awarded beforehand to those showing worthy conduct while engaged in action. Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, 1939 wrote in the following minute: > FIRST LORD to FORTH SEA LORD > I am told that the Minesweepers men have no badge. If this is so it must be > remedied at once. I am asking Mr. Bracken to call for designs from Sir > Kenneth Clark within one week, after which production must begin with the > greatest speed, and distribution as the deliveries come to hand. The design of the badge measured roughly the size of an old shilling. The design had to symbolise the work of both the minesweeping and the anti- submarine personnel. The finished design took the form of a shield upon which a sinking shark, speared by a marline spike, was set against a background made up of a fishing net with two trapped enemy mines. This was flanked by two examples of the nautical knot and at the top the naval crown. Beneath the badge was a scroll bearing the letters M/S-A/S (Minesweeping Anti-Submarine). The shark symbolised a U-boat and the marline spike the tool of the Merchant navy. The net and the mines were both symbols of the fishermen who now found themselves at war seeking a new deadly catch. Never before had one section of the Royal Navy been similarly honoured. His design for an insignia to denote the award of a \\"King's Commendation for Brave Conduct\\" was accepted and used for a period from 1943. == References == == External links == * George Kruger Gray in World of Coins * Museum Victoria in Melbourne: George Kruger Gray, Designer, Painter & Medallist (1880‚Äì1943) Category:1880 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Coin designers Category:British currency designers Category:Modern artists Category:English stained glass artists and manufacturers Category:Artists' Rifles soldiers Category:Designers from London Category:Artists from London Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:20th-century British sculptors Category:British male sculptors Category:Alumni of Bath School of Art and Design Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art ","title":"George Kruger Gray"},{"id":"1274040","text":"The Tolt River is located in the western foothills of the Cascade Mountains in north central King County in the U.S. state of Washington.

It remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the deadliest natural disasters. At least 500,000 people lost their lives in the storm,Remembering the great Bhola cyclone Dhaka Tribune. primarily as a result of the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the Ganges Delta. This cyclone was the sixth cyclonic storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, and also the season's strongest. The cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal on November 8, and traveled northward, intensifying as it did so. It reached its peak with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on November 11, and made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) on the following afternoon. The storm surge devastated many of the offshore islands, wiping out villages and destroying crops throughout the region. In the most severely affected Upazila, Tazumuddin, over 45% of the population of 167,000 was killed by the storm. The Pakistani government, led by junta leader General Yahya Khan, was criticized for its delayed handling of the relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. During the election that took place a month later, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory in the province, and continuing unrest between East Pakistan and the central government triggered the Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to widespread atrocities and eventually concluded with the creation of the country of Bangladesh. == Meteorological history == Map plotting the track of the storm The remnants of Tropical Storm Nora from the West Pacific, which had lasted for two days in the South China Sea, moved west over the Malay Peninsula on November 5. The remnants of this system contributed to the development of a new depression in the central Bay of Bengal on the morning of November 8. The depression intensified as it moved slowly northward, and the India Meteorological Department upgraded it to a cyclonic storm the next day. No country in the region had ever named tropical cyclones during this time, so no new identity was given. The storm became nearly stationary that evening near 14.5¬∞ N, 87¬∞ E, but began to accelerate toward the north on November 10. The storm further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm on November 11 and began to turn towards the northeast, as it approached the head of the bay. It developed a clear eye, and reached its peak intensity later that day, with 3-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), and a central pressure of 960 hPa. The cyclone made landfall on the East Pakistan coastline during the evening of November 12, around the same time as the local high tide. Once over land, the system began to weaken; the storm degraded to a cyclonic storm on November 13, when it was about south- southeast of Agartala. The storm then rapidly weakened into a remnant low over southern Assam that evening. == Preparations == There is question as to how much of the information about the cyclone said to have been received by Indian weather authorities was transmitted to East Pakistan authorities. This is because the Indian and East Pakistani weather services may not have shared information given the Indo-Pakistani friction at the time. A large part of the population was reportedly taken by surprise by the storm. There were indications that the storm warning system that existed in East Pakistan was not used properly, which probably cost tens of thousands of lives. The Pakistan Meteorological Department issued a report calling for \\"danger preparedness\\" in the coastal regions in danger during the day on November 12. As the storm neared the coast, a \\"great danger signal\\" was broadcast on Pakistan Radio. Survivors later said that this meant little to them, but that they had recognised a No. 1 warning signal as representing the greatest possible threat. Following two previously destructive cyclones in October 1960 which killed at least 16,000 people in East Pakistan, the Pakistani government contacted the American government for assistance in developing a system to avert future disasters. Gordon Dunn, the director of the National Hurricane Center at the time, carried out a detailed study and submitted his report in 1961. However, the government did not carry out all of the recommendations Dunn had listed. == Impact == Although the North Indian Ocean is the least active of the tropical cyclone basins, the coast of the Bay of Bengal is particularly vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones. The exact death toll will never be known, but it is estimated to be 300,000 to 500,000 people in total. The Bhola cyclone was not the most powerful of these, however; the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone was significantly stronger when it made landfall in the same general area, as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone with winds. The Bhola cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record and also one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history. A comparable number of people died as a result of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, but because of uncertainty in the number of deaths in all three disasters, it may never be known which one was the deadliest. === East Pakistan === The meteorological station in Chittagong, to the east of where the storm made landfall, recorded winds of before its anemometer was blown off at about 2200 UTC on November 12. A ship anchored in the port in the same area recorded a peak gust of about 45 minutes later. As the storm made landfall, it caused a high storm surge at the Ganges Delta. In the port at Chittagong, the storm tide peaked at about above the average sea level, of which was the storm surge. Pakistani radio reported that there were no survivors on the 13 islands near Chittagong. A flight over the area showed the devastation was complete throughout the southern half of Bhola Island, and the rice crops of Bhola Island, Hatia Island and the nearby mainland coastline were destroyed. Several seagoing vessels in the ports of Chittagong and Mongla were reported damaged, and the airports at Chittagong and Cox's Bazar were under of water for several hours. Over 3.6 million people were directly affected by the cyclone, and the total damage from the storm was estimated at $86.4 million (1970 USD, $450 Million 2006 USD). The survivors claimed that approximately 85% of homes in the area were destroyed or severely damaged, with the greatest destruction occurring along the coast. Ninety percent of marine fishermen in the region suffered heavy losses, including the destruction of 9,000 offshore fishing boats. Of the 77,000 onshore fishermen, 46,000 were killed by the cyclone, and 40% of the survivors were affected severely. In total, approximately 65% of the fishing capacity of the coastal region was destroyed by the storm, in a region where about 80% of the protein consumed comes from fish. Agricultural damage was similarly severe with the loss of $63 million worth of crops and 280,000 cattle. Three months after the storm, 75% of the population was receiving food from relief workers, and over 150,000 relied upon aid for half of their food. === India === The cyclone brought widespread rain to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, with very heavy rain falling in places on November 8 and 9. Port Blair recorded of rain on November 8, and there were a number of floods on the islands. The MV Mahajagmitra, a 5,500-ton freighter en route from Calcutta to Kuwait, was sunk by the storm on November 12, with the loss of all 50 people on board. The ship sent out a distress signal and reported experiencing hurricane-force winds before it sank. There was also widespread rain in West Bengal and southern Assam. The rain caused damage to housing and crops in both Indian states, with the worst damage occurring in the southernmost districts. === Death toll === Two medical relief surveys were carried out by the Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory: the first in November and the second in February and March. The purpose of the first survey was to establish the immediate medical needs in the affected regions, and the second, more detailed, survey was designed as the basis for long-term relief and recovery planning. In the second survey, approximately 1.4% of the area's population was studied. The first survey concluded that the surface water in most of the affected regions had a comparable salt content to that drawn from wells, except in Sudharam, where the water was almost undrinkable with a salt content of up to 0.5%. The mortality was estimated at 14.2%‚Äîequivalent to a death toll of 240,000. Cyclone-related morbidity was generally restricted to minor injuries, but a phenomenon dubbed \\"cyclone syndrome\\" was observed. This consisted of severe abrasions on the limbs and chest caused by survivors clinging to trees to withstand the storm surge. Initially, there were fears of an outbreak of cholera and typhoid fever in the weeks following the storm, but the survey found no evidence of an epidemic of cholera, smallpox or any other disease in the region affected by the storm. The totals from the second survey were likely a considerable underestimate as several groups were not included. The 100,000 migrant workers who were collecting the rice harvest, families who were completely wiped out by the storm and those who had migrated out of the region in the three months were not included, and by excluding these groups, the risk of hearsay and exaggeration was reduced. The survey concluded that the overall death toll was, at minimum, 224,000. The worst effects were felt in Tazumuddin, where the mortality was 46.3%, corresponding to approximately 77,000 deaths in Thana alone. The mean mortality throughout the affected region was 16.5%. The results showed that the highest survival rate was for adult males aged 15‚Äì49, while more than half the deaths were children under ten, who only formed a third of the pre-cyclone population. This suggests that the young, old, and sick were at the highest risk of perishing in the cyclone and its storm surge. In the months after the storm, the mortality of the middle-aged was lower in the cyclone area than in the control region, near Dhaka. This reflected the storm's toll on the less healthy individuals. == Aftermath == === Government response === The day after the storm struck the coast, three Pakistani gunboats and a hospital ship carrying medical personnel and supplies left Chittagong for the islands of Hatia, Sandwip and Kutubdia. Teams from the Pakistani army reached many of the stricken areas in the two days following the landfall of the cyclone. Pakistani President Yahya Khan returned from a state visit to China and overflew the disaster area on November 16. The president ordered \\"no effort to be spared\\" to relieve the victims. He also ordered that all flags should be flown at half-mast and announced a day of national mourning on November 21, a week after the cyclone struck land. In the ten days following the cyclone, one military transport aircraft and three crop-dusting aircraft were assigned to relief work by the Pakistani government. The Pakistani government said it was unable to transfer military helicopters from West Pakistan as the Indian government did not grant clearance to cross the intervening Indian territory, a charge the Indian government denied. By November 24, the Pakistani government had allocated a further $116 million to finance relief operations in the disaster area. Yahya Khan arrived in Dhaka to take charge of the relief operations on November 24. The governor of East Pakistan, Vice Admiral S. M. Ahsan, denied charges that the armed forces had not acted quickly enough and said supplies were reaching all parts of the disaster area except for some small pockets. A week after the cyclone's landfall, President Khan conceded that his government had made \\"slips\\" and \\"mistakes\\" in its handling of the relief efforts. He said there was a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster. He also said that the general election slated for December 7 would take place on time, although eight or nine of the worst affected districts might experience delays, denying rumours that the election would be postponed. As the conflict between East and West Pakistan developed in March, the Dhaka offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks, first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the Awami League. Relief work continued in the field, but the long-term planning was curtailed. === Criticism of government response === Political leaders in East Pakistan were deeply critical of the central government's initial response to the disaster. A statement released by eleven political leaders in East Pakistan ten days after the cyclone hit charged the government with 'gross neglect, callous indifference and utter indifference'. They also accused the president of playing down the news coverage. On November 19, students held a march in Dhaka in protest of the speed of the government response, and Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani addressed a rally of 50,000 people on November 24, when he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation. The president's political opponents accused him of bungling the efforts and some demanded his resignation. The Pakistan Red Crescent began to operate independently of the government as the result of a dispute that arose after the Red Crescent took possession of 20 rafts donated by the British Red Cross. A pesticide company had to wait two days before it received permission for two of its crop dusters, which were already in the country, to carry out supply drops in the affected regions. The Pakistani government only deployed a single helicopter to relief operations, with Yahya Khan later stating that there was no point deploying any helicopters from West Pakistan as they were unable to carry supplies. A reporter for the Pakistan Observer spent a week in the worst hit areas in early January and saw none of the tents supplied by relief agencies being used to house survivors and commented that the grants for building new houses were insufficient. The Pakistan Observer regularly carried front-page stories with headlines like \\"No Relief Coordination\\", while publishing government statements saying \\"Relief operations are going smoothly.\\" In January, the coldest period of the year in East Pakistan, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, headed by the editor of Ittefaq, said thousands of survivors from the storm were \\"passing their days under [the] open sky\\". A spokesman said families who were made homeless by the cyclone were receiving up to 250 rupees (US$55 dollars in 1971; ) to rebuild, but that resources were scarce and he feared the survivors would \\"eat the cash\\". === Political consequences === The first flag of Bangladesh The Awami League, headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, swept to a landslide victory in the national elections in December 1970, in part because of dissatisfaction over failure of the relief efforts by the national government. The elections for nine national assembly and eighteen provincial assembly seats had to be postponed until January 18 as a result of the storm. The government's handling of the relief efforts helped exacerbate the bitterness felt in East Pakistan, swelling the resistance movement there. Funds only slowly got through, and transport was slow in bringing supplies to the devastated regions. As tensions increased in March, foreign personnel evacuated because of fears of violence. The situation deteriorated further and developed into the Bangladesh Liberation War in March. This conflict widened into the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 in December and concluded with the creation of Bangladesh. This was one of the first times that a natural event helped to trigger a civil war. === International response === India became one of the first nations to offer aid to Pakistan, despite the generally poor relations between the two countries, and by the end of November had pledged $1.3 million (1970 USD, $6.9 million 2007 USD) of assistance for the relief efforts. The Pakistani government refused to allow the Indians to send supplies into East Pakistan by air, forcing them to be transported slowly by road instead. The Indian government also said that the Pakistanis refused an offer of military aircraft, helicopters and boats from West Bengal to assist in the relief operation. US President Richard Nixon allocated a $10 million ($ million in ) grant to provide food and other essential relief to the survivors of the storm, and the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan pledged that he would \\"assist the East Pakistan government in every way feasible.\\" The American government also sent a number of blankets, tents and other supplies. Six helicopters, two helicopters at an aid mission in Nepal and four from the United States, were sent to East Pakistan. Some 200,000 tons of wheat were shipped from the United States to the stricken region. By the end of November, there were 38 helicopters operating in the disaster area, ten of which were British and ten American. The Americans had provided about 50 small boats and the British 70 for supply distribution. CARE halted aid shipments to the country the week after the cyclone hit, because of unwillingness to let the Pakistani government handle distribution. However, by January, they had reached an agreement to construct 24,000 cement brick houses at a cost of about $1.2 million ($ million in ). American concerns about delays by the Pakistani government in determining how the relief should be used meant that $7.5 million ($ million in ) of relief granted by the US Congress had not been handed over in March. Much of the money was earmarked to be spent on constructing cyclone shelters and rebuilding housing. The American Peace Corps offered to send volunteers but were rebuffed by the Pakistani government. A Royal Navy task force, centred on and , left Singapore for the Bay of Bengal to assist with the relief efforts. They carried eight helicopters and eight landing craft, as well as rescue teams and supplies. Fifty soldiers and two helicopters were flown in ahead of the ships to survey the disaster area and bring relief work. The British task force arrived off the Pakistan coast on November 24, and the 650 troops aboard the ships immediately began using landing craft to deliver supplies to offshore islands. An appeal by the British Disasters Emergency Committee raised about ¬£1.5 million (¬£ million in ) for disaster relief in East Pakistan. The Canadian government pledged $2 million of assistance. France and West Germany both sent helicopters and various supplies worth $1.3 million. Pope Paul VI announced that he would visit Dhaka during a visit to the Far East and urged people to pray for the victims of the disaster. The Vatican later contributed $100,000 to the relief efforts. By the start of 1971, four Soviet helicopters were still operating in the region transporting essential supplies to hard-hit areas. The Soviet aircraft, which had drawn criticism from Bengalis, replaced the British and American helicopters that had operated immediately after the cyclone. The government of Singapore sent a military medical mission to East Pakistan which arrived at Chittagong on December 1, 1971. They were then deployed to Sandwip where they treated nearly 27,000 people and carried out a smallpox vaccination effort. The mission returned to Singapore on December 22, after bringing about $50,000 worth of medical supplies and 15 tons of food for the victims of the storm. The Japanese cabinet approved a total of $1.65 million of relief funds in December. The Japanese government had previously drawn criticism for only donating a small amount to relief work. The first shipment of Chinese supplies to East Pakistan was a planeload of 500,000 doses of cholera vaccine, which was not necessary as the country had adequate stocks. The Chinese government sent $1.2 million in cash to Pakistan. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi declared that the disaster was also an Iranian one and responded by sending two planeloads of supplies within a few days of the cyclone striking. Many smaller, poorer Asian nations sent nominal amounts of aid. The United Nations donated $2.1 million in food and cash, while UNICEF began a drive to raise a further million. UNICEF helped to re-establish water supplies in the wake of the storm, repairing over 11,000 wells in the months following the storm. UN Secretary-General U Thant made appeals for aid for the victims of the cyclone and the civil war in August, in two separate relief programs. He said only about $4 million had been contributed towards immediate needs, well short of the target of $29.2 million. By the end of November, the League of Red Cross Societies had collected $3.5 million to supply aid to the victims of the disaster. The World Bank estimated that it would cost $185 million to reconstruct the area devastated by the storm. The bank drew up a comprehensive recovery plan for the Pakistani government. The plan included restoring housing, water supplies and infrastructure to their pre-storm state. It was designed to combine with a much larger ongoing flood-control and development program. The Bank provided $25 million of credit to help rebuild the East Pakistan economy and to construct protective shelters in the region. This was the first time that the IDA had provided credit for reconstruction. By the start of December, nearly $40 million had been raised for the relief efforts by the governments of 41 countries, organisations and private groups. ==== The Concert for Bangladesh ==== In 1971, ex-Beatle George Harrison was inspired to organize The Concert for Bangladesh, in part from the 1970 Bhola Cyclone, and from the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and Bangladesh Liberation War. Although it was the first benefit concert of its type, it was extremely successful in raising money, aid and awareness for the region's plight. === Post-disaster === In December, the League of Red Cross Societies drafted a plan for immediate use should a comparable event to the cyclone hit other \\"disaster prone countries\\". A Red Cross official stated some of the relief workers sent to East Pakistan were poorly trained, and the organisation would compile a list of specialists. The UN General Assembly adopted a proposal to improve its ability to provide aid to disaster-stricken countries. In 1966, the Red Crescent had begun to support the development of a cyclone warning system, which developed into a Cyclone Preparedness Programme in 1972, today run by the Government of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society. The programme's objectives are to raise public awareness of the risks of cyclones and to provide training to emergency personnel in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. In the 30 years after the 1970 cyclone, over 200 cyclone shelters were constructed in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. When the next destructive cyclone approached the country in 1991, volunteers from the Cyclone Preparedness Programme warned people of the cyclone two to three days before it struck land. Over 350,000 people fled their homes to shelters and other brick structures, while others sought high ground. While the 1991 cyclone killed over 138,000 people, this was significantly less than the 1970 storm, partly because of the warnings sent out by the Cyclone Preparedness Programme. However, the 1991 storm was significantly more destructive, causing 1.5 billion dollars in damage (2 billion inflation-adjusted) compared to the 1970 storm's 86.4 million dollars in damage. Footage of the incident appeared in the film Days of Fury (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price. == See also == * List of tropical cyclones * List of Bangladesh tropical cyclones * 1999 Odisha cyclone * 1991 Bangladesh cyclone * Cyclone Sidr - The next deadliest cyclone affecting Bangladesh in November with wind speed up to 260 km/h that killed at highest estimate 15,000 people in 2007.http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/news/15112007news.shtmlhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1569832/Bangladesh- cyclone-death-toll-hits-15000.html * Cyclone Flores ‚Äì The deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere ==References== == External links == * On this day ‚Äì liketelevision Bhola cyclone Category:Extremely severe cyclonic storms Category:Tropical cyclones in Bangladesh Category:Tropical cyclones in India Bhola Cyclone, 1970 Bhola Cyclone, 1970 Bhola Cyclone, 1970 Bhola Cyclone, 1970 Category:November 1970 events in Asia Category:Environment of Bangladesh Category:Environment of West Bengal ","title":"1970 Bhola cyclone"},{"id":"1274072","text":"Jos√© Luis L√≥pez may refer to: *Jos√© Luis L√≥pez Aranguren, Spanish philosopher, see Prince of Asturias Awards *Jos√© Luis L√≥pez Rubio or Jos√© L√≥pez Rubio, Spanish film writer and director *Jos√© Luis L√≥pez V√°zquez (1922‚Äì2009), Spanish film and TV actor *Jos√© Luis \\"Pupy\\" L√≥pez, Costa Rican footballer *Jos√© Luis L√≥pez (footballer) (born 1979), Mexican footballer *Jos√© Luis L√≥pez (boxer) (born 1973), Mexican boxer *Jos√© Luis L√≥pez (handballer) (born 1998), Chilean handball player ==See also== *Jos√© L√≥pez (disambiguation) *Luis Lopez (disambiguation) ","title":"Jos√© Luis L√≥pez"},{"id":"1274073","text":"William Drayton Sr. (March 21, 1732 ‚Äì May 18, 1790) was Chief Justice of the British American Province of East Florida and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. ==Education and career== Born March 21, 1732, near the Ashley River in the Province of South Carolina, British America, Drayton graduated from the Middle Temple in London, England in 1754 and read law in 1756.

It eschewed foreign and defense policy. The magazine published prominent writers and scholars including Seymour Martin Lipset, James Q. Wilson, Peter Drucker, Charles Murray, James S.

Editor Irving Kristol was the dominant personality, especially after Daniel Bell relocated to Harvard in 1969. Bell, troubled by what he perceived to be an excessively conservative slant, withdrew in 1973, and was replaced as co-editor by the sociologist Nathan Glazer. Kristol continued, and the magazine become known as the principal house organ of neoconservatism, a hostile label which Kristol embraced. The magazine's sub-editors were considered apprentices, and were seeded into high journalism, academia, and government staff posts. Many policies advanced by the magazine were absorbed into the mainstream of public policy. In 1988, the journal moved its offices from New York City to Washington, D.C. With foundation support flagging, Kristol aging, and no obvious successor, The Public Interest published its final issue in the spring of 2005. Towards the end, its readership had declined significantly.

She previously served as the seventh Secretary General of Amnesty International (from 2001 to 2009). In 2011, she was elected Director-General of the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) in Rome, an intergovernmental organization that works to promote the rule of law, and sustainable development. She was a consulting editor of The Daily Star. ==Early life== Khan was born in Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Her family came from Sylhet. She is the daughter of Dr Sikander Ali Khan, a non- practicing medical doctor; granddaughter of Ahmed Ali Khan, a Cambridge University mathematics graduate and barrister; and great-granddaughter of DrAsdar Ali Khan of Calcutta, the personal physician of Syed Hasan Imam. Her uncle, Rear Admiral Mahbub Ali Khan, was the chief of the Bangladesh Navy. She was the star pupil at St Francis Xavier's Green Herald International School, 1964-1972 where she was the record holder at the school-leaving examinations. During her childhood, East Pakistan became the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971 following the Bangladesh Liberation War. Human rights abuses that occurred during the war helped shape the teenage Khan's activist viewpoint. She left Bangladesh as a teenager for St. Louis Grammar school in Kikeel, Northern Ireland 1973-1975. Khan went to England, where she studied law at the University of Manchester and then, in the United States, at Harvard Law School. She specialized in public international law and human rights. ==Career== ===Human rights=== Khan helped to create the organisation Concern Universal in 1977, an international development and emergency relief organisation. She began her career as a human rights activist with the International Commission of Jurists in 1979. Khan went to work at the United Nations in 1980. She spent 20 years at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In 1995 she was appointed UNHCR India's Chief of Mission, becoming the youngest UNHCR country representative at that time. After less than one year in New Delhi the Indian government requested that se be removed from that position. During the Kosovo crisis in 1999, Khan led the UNHCR team in the Republic of Macedonia for three months. This led to her being appointed as Deputy Director of International Protection later that year. ===Amnesty International=== Khan at the World Economic Forum 2007 Khan joined Amnesty International in 2001 as its Secretary General. In her first year of office, she reformed Amnesty's response to human rights crises and launched the campaign to close the United States' Guantanamo Bay detention camp, which held suspected enemy combatants. In 2004 she initiated a global campaign to stop violence against women. In May 2009 Khan launched Amnesty's \\"Demand Dignity\\" campaign to fight human rights abuses that impoverish people and keep them poor. === Rule of law === During her leadership of IDLO, Irene Khan has promoted the notion that the rule of law is an important tool that can advance equity and people-centered development, whether in reducing inequalities or fostering social justice and inclusion for peace ==Other activities== * Transparency International, Member of the Advisory CouncilAdvisory Council Transparency International. * Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Member of the Board (since 2010) ==Recognition== ===In media=== Khan is featured in a 2003 TV documentary titled Human Rights, by the French filmmaker Denis Delestrac. The film, shot in Colombia, Israel, Palestine and Pakistan, analyses how armed conflicts affect civilian communities and foster forced migration. In 2009 Khan was featured in Soldiers of Peace, an anti-war film. ===Awards=== * Khan received a Ford Foundation Fellowship in 1979. * 2002, she received the Pilkington \\"Woman of the Year\\" Award as well as *2006, the Sydney Peace Prize. * Since 2007, she has received several honorary doctorates, including from Ghent University, the University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), and Manchester, St. Andrews, Salford and Staffordshire, and Edinburgh in UK, American University of Beirut (Lebanon), Ferris University (Japan), SOAS and State University of New York (USA). In 2008, she was one of the two finalists for the election of the new Chancellor of the University of Manchester. In July 2009, she was appointed as Chancellor of the University of Salford a post she held until January 2015. In 2006 she was awarded the City of Sydney Peace Prize for \\"her leadership as a courageous advocate of universal respect for human rights, and her skills in identifying violence against women as a massive injustice and therefore a priority in campaigning for peace.\\" == Controversies == ===Pay controversy=== In February 2011, newspaper stories in the UK revealed that Khan had received a payment of ¬£533,103 from Amnesty International following her resignation from the organization on 31 December 2009, a fact pointed to from Amnesty's records for the 2009‚Äì2010 financial year. The sum paid to her was in excess of four times her annual salary of ¬£132,490.Mason, Tania, \\"Charity Commission has 'no jurisdiction' over board member's payment from Amnesty\\", civilsociety.co.uk, 21 February 2011. Retrieved 21 February 2011. The deputy secretary general, Kate Gilmore, who also resigned in December 2009, received an ex-gratia payment of ¬£320,000.Chapman, John, \\"Amnesty boss gets secret ¬£500,000 payout\\", Daily Express, 19 February 2011. Retrieved 21 February 2011. Peter Pack, the chairman of Amnesty's International Executive Committee (IEC), initially stated on 19 February 2011: \\"The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of AI (Amnesty International) Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between AI Ltd and Irene Khan\\" and that \\"It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party.\\" The payment and AI's initial response to its leakage to the press led to considerable outcry. Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, decried the payment, telling the Daily Express: \\"I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they were subsidising a fat cat payout. This will disillusion many benefactors.\\" On 21 February Peter Pack issued a further statement, in which he said that the payment was a \\"unique situation\\" that was \\"in the best interest of Amnesty's work\\" and that there would be no repetition of it. He stated that \\"the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again.\\" Pack also stated that Amnesty was \\"fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights\\". On 25 February, Pack issued a letter to Amnesty members and staff. In summary, it states that the IEC in 2008 had decided not to prolong Khan's contract for a third term. In the following months, IEC discovered that due to British employment law, it had to choose between the three options of either offering Khan a third term, discontinuing her post and, in their judgement, risking legal consequences, or signing a confidential agreement and issuing a pay compensation. Khan's lawyers issued a letter published by the Charity Times \\"It was not accurate of Amnesty International to record in its 2009/2010 corporate accounts that the amount ¬£532,000 was paid to our client\\". The published letter detailed the sum as including: a) her salary and contractual benefits until 31 December 2009; b) outstanding back pay and the shortfall arising in her contractual benefits from previous years (in some part going back to 2005); relocation costs for her return abroad from where she had been recruited; d) compensation as well as severance payment (¬£115,000 gross) in respect of a legal claim and grievances that our client had asserted against Amnesty International Limited pursuant to her UK employment rights). Outgoing IEC Chairman Peter Pack, a high school teacher, stated that paying off Khan was \\"the least worst option\\" available to IEC. The amount paid out to Khan and her deputy (who was also removed by IEC) amounted to 4% of Amnesty International's budget that year. The organization was hurt by this scandal and by choosing to pay Khan to leave, with Chairman Pack promising to make amends and move the organization forward following Khan's departure. Naftali Balanson of NGO-Monitor said that the highly usually large payouts caused Amnesty \\"great damage\\". She also took issue with Khan's successor's salary since Salil Shetty receives an annual take home pay of $300,000. In 2003, Irene Khan wrote a piece titled Security for Whom? in which she, inter alia, accused the allies of the occupying force in Afghanistan of \\"mass killings\\". In 2005, Irene Khan penned the introduction to that year's Amnesty International report in which she, inter alia, referred to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay as \\"the gulag of our time,\\" accusing the United States of \\"thumb[ing] its nose at the rule of law and human rights [as] it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity\\". Much backlash followed in the media. Michael Totten of World Affairs called her a \\"hysterical heavy-breather\\". An editorial opinion in the Washington Post referred to it as \\"[i]t is ALWAYS SAD when a solid, trustworthy institution loses its bearings and joins in the partisan fracas that nowadays passes for political discourse\\". John Podhoretz of the New York Post said that \\"[t]he case of Amnesty International proves that well-meaning people can make morality their life's work and still be little more than moral idiots.\\" In his The United Nations, Peace and Security, Ramesh Thakur called Khan's likening of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to a gulag a \\"hyperbole\\" that is \\"wrong\\". Commentary on Europe's Ariel Cohen said that Khan's statement was a product of being \\"blinded by a hatred of U.S. policies,\\" \\"deception or deep[] ignoran[ce],\\" stating to that statement Khan, reportedly, added \\"[i]ronic that this should happen as we mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz\\". Cohen stated that he is \\"incensed at Amnesty's gall in trivializing [the suffering of prisoners in Soviet gulags that included his grandfather] for political purposes. A former Soviet prisoner of conscience, Pavel Litvinov, told the Amnesty International staffer, who called him to inquire on behalf of Khan whether it would be appropriate to use the word 'gulag' in an Amnesty report and in relation in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, that there was \\"an enormous difference\\" between the gulags and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Roger Kimball of Arma Virumque called it \\"a preposterous remark\\". In a letter to the editor of The New York Times, Margers Pinnis demanded that Khan issue \\"an apology to the peoples of all nations who suffered under the inhuman conditions of the Soviet Union's notorious prison system\\". The Bush Administration responded to it in the following manner: President Bush called it \\"an absurd allegation;\\" Vice President Cheney said he was \\"offended by it;\\" Defense Secretary Rumsfeld called it \\"reprehensible\\" and \\"those who make such outlandish charges los[ing] any claim to objectivity or seriousness\\". Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Myers called it \\"absolutely irresponsible\\" The White House spokesman Scott McClellan called the characterization \\"ridiculous\\". Anne Applebaum, the author of Gulag: A History, found this characterization \\"infuriating,\\" stating that \\"Amnesty misus[ed] language [and] discard[ed] its former neutrality\\" and that it \\"attack[ed] the American government for the satisfaction of [the Amnesty's] own political faction\\". However, not everyone rallied against Khan's 'gulag' characterization. Retired US State Department officer Edmund McWilliams who monitored prisoner abuse committed in the Soviet Union and Vietnam stated the following in support of Khan's characterization: \\"I note that abuses that I reported on in those inhumane systems parallel abuses reported in Guantanamo, at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and at the Abu Ghriab prison: prisoners suspended from the ceiling and beaten to death; widespread \\"waterboarding;\\" prisoners \\"disappeared\\" to preclude monitoring by the International Committee of the Red Cross‚Äîand all with almost no senior-level accountability\\". ==Publications== * 2009: The Unheard Truth: Poverty and Human Rights (W.W.

He was repeatedly punished for his social-critical writing and spent ten years in severe conditions in jail. ==Life== Born at Obersontheim in Swabia, he entered the University of Erlangen in 1758 as a student of theology. He led a dissolute life, and after two years' stay was summoned home by his parents. After attempting to earn a livelihood as private tutor and as assistant preacher, his musical talents gained him the appointment of organist in Geislingen an der Steige. Meeting Schubart in Ludwigsburg in 1772, Charles Burney called him \\"the first, real great harpsichord player that I had hitherto met with in Germany ... He is formed on the Bach school; but is an enthusiast, and original in genius. Many of his pieces are printed in Holland; they are full of taste and fire. He played on the Clavichord, with great delicacy and expression; his finger is brilliant, and fancy rich.\\"Charles Burney, (1773) The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces, London, T. Becket and Co., Robson and G. Robinson. Schubart was unappreciated in Ludwigsburg, according to Burney: \\"The common people think him mad, and the rest overlook him.\\" As a consequence of his wild life and blasphemy, found expressed in a parody of the litany, he was later expelled from the country. He then visited in turn Heilbronn, Mannheim, Munich and Augsburg. In Augsburg, he made a considerable stay, began his ' (German Chronicle, 1774‚Äì1778) and eked out a subsistence by reciting from the latest works of prominent poets. In 1775, Schubart witnessed a piano playing competition in Munich between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Ignaz von Beecke. He wrote in his Teutsche Chronik (27 April 1775) that in his opinion, von Beecke played far better than Mozart: \\"In Munich... I heard two of the greatest clavier players, Mr Mozart and Captain von Beecke. Mozart‚Äôs playing had great weight, and he read at sight everything that we put before him. But no more than that; Beecke surpasses him by a long way. Winged agility, grace and melting sweetness.\\" John Irving: Mozart Piano Sonatas: Contexts, Sources, Style. Cambridge University Press 1997, , page 56 Owing to a bitter attack upon the Jesuits, he was expelled from Augsburg and fled to Ulm, where he was arrested in 1777 and confined in the fortress of Hohenasperg. Here he met with lenient treatment, and he spent the time by a study of mystical works and in composing poetry. His ' (Complete Poems) appeared in two volumes at Stuttgart in 1785/1786 (new edition by Gustav Hauff, Leipzig, 1884, in Reclams Universal-Bibliothek); in this collection most of the pieces are characterized by the \\"Sturm und Drang\\" period. One of the poems he wrote there and published in the Schw√§bischer Musenalmanach in 1783 was \\"Die Forelle\\", set to music by Franz Schubert in 1817. He was set free in 1787 by Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, and expressed his gratitude in \\"\\" (\\"Hymn to Frederick the Great\\"). Schubart was now appointed musical director and manager of the theatre at Stuttgart, where he continued his ' and began his autobiography, ' (\\"Schubart's Life and Thoughts\\", 2 vols, 1791‚Äì1793), but he died before its completion in Stuttgart.

It was designed by James Anderson for banking duties on the Lickey Incline in Worcestershire (south of Birmingham), England. It became known as \\"Big Bertha\\" or \\"Big Emma\\" by railwaymen and railway enthusiasts. ==Banking on the Lickey Incline== 2290 descending the Lickey Bank, 1947 The Lickey Incline is the steepest sustained main-line railway incline in Great Britain. The function of a banker is to provide extra power on steep inclines by being added to the rear of other trains.In North America, a locomotive assisting at the head of the train is a helper, while one at the rear is a pusher. Bankers were also used to protect against wagons or coaches breaking away, in which case they might run in front of a train going downhill. They largely went out of use with the introduction of advanced braking systems and diesel and electric locomotives, although banking on the Lickey Incline continues into 2010 with a pool of specialised Class 66 diesel- electric locomotives being used for the task. ==Numbering== No 2290 was built at the Derby Works of the Midland Railway in 1919 and was in use up to the year 1956 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and British Railways (BR). She was numbered 2290 from new and kept this number through most of her LMS life, but was renumbered to 22290 in 1947 to make room for the numbering of a Fairburn 2-6-4T. Only a year later she was renumbered to 58100 by British Railways since adding 40000 to her number (as was done with the majority of LMS engines) would have put her in the 6XXXX ex-LNER series. ==Specification== Big Bertha's cylinder arrangement was unusual. There were four cylinders but only two sets of piston valves because there was insufficient space under the smokebox to fit piston valves for the inside cylinders. Instead, the large outside piston valves (as well as supplying the outside cylinders) supplied the inside cylinders through cross-over steam ports. The steam-flow characteristics would have been poor (because of the length of the ports) but this would not have mattered unduly in an engine that ran only at slow speed. It has been suggested that this design has been influenced by the four-cylinder cross-ported arrangement of the Italian 0-10-0 FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotive (in which this was motivated by its being part of an asymmetrical compound design), of which a complete set of drawings were stored at Derby. With a weight of and 10 driving wheels with a diameter of , she had a tractive effort of .

He was Minister of Health between 1951 and 1952 and Leader of the House of Commons between 1951 and 1955. ==Background and education== Crookshank was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of Harry Maule Crookshank and Emma, daughter of Major Samuel Comfort, of New York City. On his father's side, he descended from Alexander Crookshank, of County Longford, Ireland, who represented Belfast in the Irish House of Commons and served as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford. In the First World War, he joined the Hampshire Regiment and served as a captain in the Grenadier Guards. On one occasion he was buried alive by an explosion for twenty minutes, and on another in 1916 he was castrated by shrapnel, requiring him to wear a surgical truss for the rest of his life.Ball 2004, p. 41, 60 He was awarded by Serbia the Order of the White Eagle and Gold Medal for Valour.Article by Viscount Chandos. He joined the Diplomatic Service in 1919 and worked at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., until 1924. ==Political career== Crookshank was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Gainsborough in 1924, a seat he held for the next 32 years. He entered the government as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1934 under Ramsay MacDonald. When Stanley Baldwin became prime minister in 1935 Crookshank was appointed Secretary for Mines, a post he retained when Neville Chamberlain became prime minister in 1937 until February 1939. In the latter year, he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He continued in this post also when Winston Churchill came to power in 1940,leighrayment.com Peerage: Cowper to Cutts of Gowran and was then Postmaster General under Churchill between 1943 and 1945. In 1942 he was offered the post of British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean at Algiers following the liberation of Algeria by Operation Torch but he declined, Harold Macmillan being appointed instead. When the Conservatives returned to office under Churchill in 1951, Crookshank was appointed Minister of Health and Leader of the House of Commons, with a seat in the cabinet. In 1952 exchanged his post at the Ministry of Health for the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal, while he remained as Commons Leader. He continued in these two positions until December 1955, the last year under the premiership of Sir Anthony Eden. In the 1955 New Year Honours he was made a Companion of Honour.leighrayment.com Companions of Honour He retired from the House of Commons in 1956 and was raised to the peerage as the Viscount Crookshank, of Gainsborough in the County of Lincoln, in January of that year. He had been offered a peerage in February 1940 but declined, having considered it at the time an insult because his First World War wounds had left him incapable of fathering any heir to a title.Article by S.J. Ball. Papers released by The National Archives, London, November 2007, show that Crookshank, with Harold Macmillan, led a faction within the Cabinet of Sir Winston Churchill's government, who opposed what they perceived to be an attempt to bounce the Cabinet into a premature decision to authorise a British thermonuclear bomb programme in July 1954. ==Personal life== Lord Crookshank was a Scottish Rite Freemason and Grand Master of Lincolnshire.Walton Hannah, Christian by Degrees (London: Britons Publishing Company, 1954), 211. Incapable as result of his First World War wounds of fathering children, Crookshank was a lifelong bachelor. He was also (not publicly) known as a homosexual and caused a near scandal when a male lover of his was adopted as Conservative candidate for the Grimsby constituency in 1958 but later withdrawn.The Conservative candidate for Grimsby at the 1959 and 1964 elections, Wilfred Pearson, was not the same man. His home from 1937 was at 51 Pont Street, Kensington, London, where in 1947 he hosted a meeting of like- minded backbench MPs who unsuccessfully demanded Churchill's removal as Conservative Party leader. He died of cancer at Chelsea, London, in October 1961, aged 68. The viscountcy died with him. Having been since 1960 High Steward of the City of Westminster, his funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey, followed by burial at Lincoln Cathedral.

The term was used by the ancient Germanic peoples to describe inhabitants of the former Western Roman Empire, who were largely romanised and spoke Latin or Celtic languages (cf. Valland in Old Norse). The adjectival form is attested in Old Norse ', meaning \\"French\\"; Old High German ', meaning \\"Romance\\"; New High German ', used in Switzerland and South Tyrol for Romance speakers; Dutch ' \\"Walloon\\"; Old English ', ', ', meaning \\"Romano-British\\". The forms of these words imply that they are descended from a Proto-Germanic form *walhiska-. It is attested in the Roman Iron Age from an inscription on one of the Tjurk√∂ bracteates, where walhakurne \\"Roman/Gallic grain\\" is apparently a kenning for \\"gold\\" (referring to the bracteate itself). ==From *Walhaz to welsch== *Walhaz is almost certainly derived from the name of the tribe which was known to the Romans as Volcae (in the writings of Julius Caesar) and to the Greeks as Œü·ΩêœåŒªŒ∫Œ±Œπ / Ou√≥lkai (Strabo and Ptolemy).Ringe, Don. \\"Inheritance versus lexical borrowing: a case with decisive sound-change evidence.\\" Language Log, January 2009. This tribe occupied territory neighbouring that of the Germanic people and seem to have been referred to by the proto-Germanic name *Walhaz (plural *Walh≈çz, adjectival form *walhiska-). It is assumed that this term specifically referred to the Celtic Volcae, because application of Grimm's law to that word produces the form *Walh-. Subsequently, this term *Walh≈çz was applied rather indiscriminately to the southern neighbours of the Germanic people, as evidenced in geographic names such as Walchgau and Walchensee in Bavaria. These southern neighbours, however, were then already completely Romanised. Thus, Germanic speakers generalised this name first to all Celts, and later to all Romans and Romanised peoples. Old High German Walh became Walch in Middle High German, and the adjective OHG walhisk became MHG welsch, e.g. in the 1240 Alexander romance by Rudolf von Ems ‚Äì resulting in Welsche in Early New High German and modern Swiss German as the exonym for all Romance speakers. For instance, the historical German name for Trentino, the part of Tyrol with a Romance speaking majority, is Welschtirol, and the historical German name for Verona is Welschbern. Today, welsch is not in usage in German except in Switzerland. This term is used there not only in a historical context, but also as a somewhat pejorative word to describe Swiss speakers of Italian and French. ==From *Walhaz to Vlach== In Central and Eastern Europe, the word for Romance peoples was borrowed from the Goths (as *walhs) into Proto-Slavic some time before the 7th century. The first source using the word was the writings of Byzantine historian George Kedrenos in the mid-11th century. From the Slavs the term passed to other peoples, such as the Hungarians (ol√°h, referring to Vlachs, more specifically Romanians, olasz, referring to Italians), Turks (\\"Ulahlar\\") and Byzantines (\\"ŒíŒªŒ¨œáŒøŒπ\\", \\"Vl√°hi\\") and was used for all Latin people of the Balkans. Over time, the term Vlach (and its different forms) also acquired different meanings. Ottoman Turks in the Balkans commonly used the term to denote native Balkan Christians (possibly due to the cultural link between Christianity and Roman culture), and in parts of the Balkans the term came to denote \\"shepherd\\" ‚Äì from the occupation of many of the Vlachs throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The Polish words W≈Çoch (pl. W≈Çosi), \\"Italian\\", and W≈Çochy, \\"Italy\\", and the Slovenian lah, a mildly derogatory word for \\"Italian\\", can also be mentioned. ==Toponyms and exonyms== In the Frankish Table of Nations (c. 520, emended c. 700), there are a people called the Walagothi or Ualagothi. The term combines the prefix wala- (foreign) and the name of the Goths. The implication is that these were Romance-speaking Goths, probably the Visigoths in Spain.. Numerous names of non-Germanic, and in particular Romance-speaking, European and near-Asian regions derive from the word Walh, in particular the exonyms *Wallachia and Vlachs ‚Äì \\"Romanians\\" Consider the following terms historically present in several Central and Eastern European, and other neighbouring languages: *in Polish: W≈Çochy , the name of Italy, and Wo≈Çoch, referring to Vlachs and historically Romanians. *in Hungarian: \\"ol√°h\\", referring to Romanians, Ol√°horsz√°g to Wallachia; \\"vlachok\\" referring to Romanians/Vlachs, generally; \\"olasz\\", referring to Italians. *in Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian: Vlah (–≤–ª–∞—Ö) ‚Äì to Romanians or other Romanian/Vlach subgroup.

La≈°ko is also the old Slovene name for the area around Monfalcone and Ronchi in Italy, on the border with Slovenia. These names are linked to the presence of larger nuclei of Romance-speaking populations at the time where the Slavs settled the area in the 6th century.

Schurman lived on his parents' farm as a child, then in 1867 took a job at a store near his home, which he held for two years. At the age of fifteen, Schurman entered the Summerside Grammar School on Prince Edward Island, and in 1870 he won a scholarship to study at Prince of Wales College for two years. After Prince of Wales College, he studied for a year and a half at Acadia College in Nova Scotia. In 1874 while a student at Acadia College in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, he won the Canadian Gilchrist scholarship to study at the University of London, from which he received a BA degree in 1877 and an MA in 1878. Schurman also studied in Paris, Edinburgh, Heidelberg, Berlin, G√∂ttingen and Italy. He was professor of English literature, political economy and psychology at Acadia College in 1880‚Äì1882, of metaphysics and English literature at Dalhousie College, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1882‚Äì86, and of philosophy (Sage professor) at Cornell University in 1886‚Äì92, being Dean of the Sage School of Philosophy in 1891-92 where he edited The Philosophical Review.Profile, The Philosophical Review, volume 1 (1892). In 1892 he became the third president of Cornell University, a position he held until 1920. He received an LL.D (honoris causa) from the University of Edinburgh in March 1902. ==Cornell president== As Cornell's president, Schurman helped invent the modern state-supported research university. Under the Morrill Act, states were obligated to fund the maintenance of land grant college facilities, but were not obligated to fund operations. Subsequent laws required states to match federal funds for agricultural research stations and cooperative extension. In his inaugural address as Cornell's third president on November 11, 1892, Schurman announced his intention to enlist the financial support of the state. Cornell, which had been offering a four-year scholarship to one student in each New York assembly district every year and was the state's land-grant university, was determined to convince the state to become a benefactor of the university. In 1894, the state legislature voted to give financial support for the establishment of the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine and to make annual appropriations for the college. This set the precedents of privately controlled, state-supported statutory colleges and cooperation between Cornell and the state. The annual state appropriations were later extended to agriculture, home economics, and following World War II, industrial and labor relations. In 1898, Schurman persuaded the State Legislature to found the first forestry college in North America, the New York State College of Forestry. The College undertook to establish a demonstration forest in the Adirondacks, funded by New York State. However, the plans of the school's director Bernhard Fernow for the land drew criticism from neighbors, and Governor Benjamin B. Odell vetoed the 1903 appropriation for the school. In response, Cornell closed the school. Subsequently, in 1911, the State Legislature established a New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, and the remains of Cornell's program became the Department of Natural Resources in its Agriculture College in 1910. The State later followed the same model to establish a state college of ceramics at Alfred University. In 1911, Schurman ruled in favour of admitting two Black female students to Sage Hall despite 269 of their white female peers petitioning to deny them residency. ==International career== The cornerstone of the Shanghai American Club laid by Schurman in 1924 He was chairman of the First United States Philippine Commission in 1899, and wrote (besides a part of the official report to Congress) Philippine Affairs--A Retrospect and an Outlook (1902). With J. E. Creighton and James Seth he founded in 1892 The Philosophical Review. He also wrote Kantian Ethics and the Ethics of Evolution (1881); The Ethical Import of Darwinism (1888); Belief in God (1890), and Agnosticism and Religion (1896). Schurman served as United States Ambassador to Greece in 1912‚Äì13, Minister to China between 1921 and 1925, and then as Ambassador to Germany between 1925 and 1929, a position twice previously held by Cornell's first president Andrew Dickson White. In 1917 Schurman was appointed honorary chairman of the American Relief Committee for Greeks of Asia Minor, an organization which provided humanitarian relief to Ottoman Greeks during the Greek genocide. He retired to Bedford Hills, New York in 1930. In 1960, Cornell named the administrative wing of its veterinary school Jacob Gould Schurman Hall in his honor. ==Notes== ==References== * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Cornell Presidency: Jacob Gould Schurman * Cornell University Library Presidents Exhibition: Jacob Gould Schurman (Presidency; Inauguration) * * * Category:1854 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Acadia University alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States Category:Canadian people of Dutch descent Category:Presidents of Cornell University Category:Ambassadors of the United States to China Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Germany Category:People from Prince County, Prince Edward Island Category:People of United Empire Loyalist descent Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Greece Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Category:New York State College of Forestry Category:People from Bedford Hills, New York ","title":"Jacob Gould Schurman"},{"id":"1274122","text":"The early Canadian banking system (British North America and New France until 1763; then renamed Upper and Lower Canada) was regulated entirely by the colonial government. Primitive forms of banking emerged early in the colonial period to solve the drain of wealth caused by the application of mercantilist theory. The drain of wealth translated into a complete lack of gold or silver bullion in the colonies, and thus, a complete lack of forms of economic exchange and payment. __TOC__ ==History== In New France, playing cards were issued as a method of payment in the 1680s by the Intendant of New France, in addition to the coins introduced in the 1660s. However, the massive drain of wealth from New France to Europe resulting from mercantilist trade policies made it impossible to back card money with gold bullion. Card money was thus essentially worthless. The card system collapsed in the 1690s, causing long- term suspicion of paper money on the part of the French settlers. Card money was replaced in the 18th century by a type of promissory note called bons, derived from the French phrase, bon pour, meaning good for the indicated amount. These were issued to a limited extent by French merchants, who, lacking in any other form of currency, were forced to create their own, and who consequently became the first Canadian bankers. The issue of bons spread rapidly into British North America after 1763, when New France became a British possession. Bons persisted as the most common type of currency until 1812, along with the English pound, American and Spanish coinage, and the Halifax standard. The British administration under Isaac Brock introduced what became known as army bills in 1812, in order to finance the War of 1812. The total value of these bills was 250,000 pounds. These were promissory notes issued directly by the government. They came into wide usage during the war (1812‚Äì1815) to make up for the lack of bullion in Upper and Lower Canada. Unlike the card money used in the late 17th century, army bills could be and were in fact exchanged for gold coin once the war had ended. The army bills had thus proven themselves reliable, eradicating any real stigma against paper currency. 20 dollar note, Bank of Montreal, 1817 In 1817, Montreal bankers were granted a charter by the British government to open the first formal bank in Canada. This was the Bank of Montreal. Under its charter, the Bank of Montreal was given a monopoly on the right to issue promissory notes on the model of the army bills. Because of its monopoly rights, the Bank of Montreal essentially acted as a central bank for both Upper and Lower Canada. In the years after 1817, Britain granted several new bank charters, including a charter to the now-defunct Bank of Kingston, which was to act as a competitor to the Bank of Montreal in Upper Canada. The new chartered banks were required under the terms of their charters to recognise one another's currency, a practice that allowed for the development of long-distance trade within British North America. However, banking remained in private hands, which meant that the issue of currency was at the discretion of private bankers. This frequently led to high inflation when the infant Canadian economy was in recession. 4 Dollars, Bank of Montreal, overprinted as provincial note The Provincial Note Act was passed in 1866 to link note issue to the needs of the British administration. This marked the beginning of an enduring policy of government intervention in the Canadian economy. The British North America Act of 1867 formally codified this policy, allowing for government control over coinage, currency, bills of exchange, promissory notes, banking, and incorporation of banks. This in turn allowed for the creation of a uniform currency across Canada. Official Canadian currency took the form of the Canadian dollar in 1871, overriding the currency of individual banks. After Confederation, Canada developed a banking system very different from that of the United States. Whereas the United States was served a large number of small banks serving just one town or, at most state, Canada's banking sector came to be dominated by a few banks with transcontinental branch networks. The Canadian system promoted stability and produced far fewer bank failures than either the contemporary United States or Australian banking systems. The downside of the Canadian banking system was that it was much less competitive that the United States and Australian systems, which meant that consumers paid more for banking services. The legal foundation of the Canadian banking system consisted of a series of laws passed in 1870 and 1871.Andrew Smith, \\"Continental Divide: The Canadian Banking and Currency Laws of 1871 in the Mirror of the United States\\". Enterprise and Society vol. 13 no. 3 (2012): 455-503 Banking remained relatively decentralized until 1935, when the Bank of Canada was founded in response to the economic instability experienced during the Great Depression in Canada. First opened on December 5, 1980, Canada's Currency Museum is located on the ground floor of the Bank of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. ==References== * Breckenridge, Roeliff Morton.

Sarah MacDiarmid (born 15 November 1966) was a 23-year-old Scottish-Australian woman who disappeared from Kananook railway station in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 11 July 1990. She is presumed murdered, although no trace of her body has ever been found. ==Disappearance== MacDiarmid, who emigrated with her family in 1987 from the Scottish Highlands to Australia, had been playing tennis after work with two friends at what was then known as Flinders Park in Batman Avenue, East Melbourne, before walking to Richmond station, where they found that they had just missed a Frankston line train. They caught a train to Caulfield, then changed to a Frankston service. MacDiarmid's friends disembarked this train at Bonbeach while she remained, continuing on to Kananook station where her vehicle was parked. She was last seen alighting the train and heading for the poorly lit car park at approximately 10:20 p.m. ==Investigation== Police suspected that MacDiarmid had been assaulted based on bloodstains found beside her red 1978 Honda Civic abandoned in the station car park and drag marks leading into the bushes, as well as finding a cigarette lighter on the ground belonging to Sarah, but no trace of her was ever found. Later, witnesses said Sarah got off the train and crossed the footbridge to the car park, where some people heard a woman shouting, ‚ÄòGive me back my keys.‚ÄôCase File 1730DFVIC:Sarah MacDiarmid, The Doe Network Archive A 21-day extensive air, sea, and land search with more than 250 police produced no results. A later appeal for information led to two witnesses reporting they had also heard a woman exclaim, 'Give me back my keys!'. In May 2006, an inquest held by coroner Ian West, found MacDiarmid 'had met her death as a result of foul play but the exact circumstances were unknown'. An initial State Government reward of $50,000 was increased after an additional $75,000 was offered by an anonymous benefactor. This was increased to $1 million, in 2004, and remains current. In 2011, convicted Australian serial killer Paul Denyer was interviewed by police and denied any involvement in MacDiarmid's disappearance. In May 2014, News Corp Australia claimed police investigators considered convicted Australian serial killer Bandali Debs to be a suspect in the case. Fairfax Media quoted a 'senior police source' who said 'it was \\"common practice\\" for homicide investigators to examine links between unsolved murders and known offenders'. A Victoria Police spokesperson declined to comment to Fairfax Media as MacDiarmid's disappearance was an 'active' case. ==Aftermath== The cold case was featured in the first episode of the Australian psychic TV series Sensing Murder, which aired on Network Ten in September 2004. The psychics used by this programme opined that MacDiarmid had been murdered and her body thrown into a now-closed rubbish dump on the Mornington Peninsula. In 2010, marking the 20th anniversary of MacDiarmid's disappearance, her family and friends visited Kananook railway station to leave wreaths at a memorial established there. Her family also announced they had created a website Not Alone which was 'designed to help other families who find themselves in a position similar to them'. Police used the anniversary to issue a new call for information on the case with Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Dannye Moloney stating 'You do not close the books on these sorts of crimes... History proves that if you continue to communicate with the people out there, in Victoria, in Australia, in the world in some cases, that piece of information, that key will come forward and we'll solve it.' ==See also== *List of people who disappeared ==References== ==External links== *The Doe Network: Case File 1730DFVIC *Not Alone ‚Äì established by the family of Sarah MacDiarmid Category:1966 births Category:1990 in Australia Category:1990 crimes in Australia Category:1990s in Melbourne Category:1990s missing person cases Category:1990 murders in Oceania Category:1990s murders in Australia Category:Australian people of Scottish descent Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Missing person cases in Australia Category:Unsolved murders in Australia ","title":"Disappearance of Sarah MacDiarmid"},{"id":"1274135","text":"Larry Grenadier (born February 6, 1966 in San Francisco) is an American jazz double bassist. ==Early life== Grenadier's father, Albert, was a trumpet player, and his two brothers, Phil and Steve, play trumpet and guitar, respectively. Grenadier began on trumpet when he was 10 years old before beginning to play the bass the following year. Grenadier's father helped introduce him to the instruments and music theory. Larry's older brother Phil began listening to jazz around this time, influencing his sibling's musical interests. Grenadier began listening to several jazz bassists including Ray Brown, Charles Mingus, Richard Davis, Paul Chambers, Wilbur Ware and Oscar Pettiford, among others. At age 12 Grenadier began formal study of the acoustic bass, learning from local jazz bass players Chris Poehlor, Paul Breslin, and Frank Tusa and later classical bassists Michael Burr and Stephen Tramontozzi. At 16, Grenadier had a busy career playing in the San Francisco Bay Area with both local musicians and those traveling through town in need of a bass player. These musicians included Harvey Wainapel, Bobby Hutcherson, Joe Henderson, Larry Vuckovitch, Eddie Henderson, Bruce Forman, Eddie Marshall, Vince Lateano, George Cables and Donald Bailey, Toots Thielmans, Johnny Griffin, Charles McPherson and Frank Morgan, among others. Grenadier studied at Stanford University and graduated in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in English Literature. At Stanford, he met Stan Getz, with whom he toured. ==Career== Larry Grenadier, 2014 After graduating from Stanford, Grenadier moved to Boston to play with vibraphonist Gary Burton. In 1991, he moved to New York. He continued to collaborate with some of the musicians he had met during his time in Boston, such as Kurt Rosenwinkel, Joshua Redman, Mark Turner, Jorge Rossy, and Chris Cheek. Others he met for the first time in New York include Bill Stewart, Kevin Hays, Renee Rosnes, Ralph Moore, Billy Drummond, Danilo Perez, David S√°nchez, Tom Harrell and Billy Hart. Grenadier continued his association with Joe Henderson, touring with his band which at times included Al Foster, Renee Rosnes and Larry Willis. He also spent a few months during his earlier years in New York playing in Betty Carter's band. In the early 1990s, Grenadier first met and played with pianist Brad Mehldau. He joined Mehldau's Trio with drummer Jorge Rossy; together they toured and recorded for more than ten years. Rossy was replaced by drummer Jeff Ballard in 2004. Grenadier has worked with guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom he toured as a trio along with drummer Bill Stewart. He credits his experiences touring with Metheny's trio as a significant learning experience. Grenadier has also played with John Scofield, Hudson (a collaborative project with Jack DeJohnette, John Medeski and John Scofield), Charles Lloyd, Chris Potter, Billy Higgins, Michael Brecker, and Paul Motian, among many others. Grenadier is a member of FLY, a trio which includes drummer Jeff Ballard and tenor saxophonist Mark Turner. They have recorded three critically acclaimed albums. He also tours and records with his wife, singer-songwriter Rebecca Martin. A landmark solo bass album The Gleaners was issued by the ECM label in 2019.https://www.marlbank.net/marlbank/a-jazz-blog/4830-larry-grenadier- embarks-on-a-solo-flight.html Grenadier lives with Rebecca and their son Charlie James in the Hudson Valley, north of New York City. ==Gallery== Larry-grenadier01.jpg Larry-grenadier03.jpg Larry-grenadier05.jpg ==Selected discography== As leader * The Gleaners (ECM, 2019) With BeatleJazz * With a Little Help From Our Friends (Lightyear, 2005) * All You Need is Love (Lightyear, 2007) With Peter Beets * New York Trio ‚Äì Page Two (Criss Cross, 2002) With Peter Bernstein * Heart's Content (Criss Cross, 2002) * Stranger in Paradise (Venus, 2004) With Seamus Blake * The Call (Criss Cross, 1993) * Four Track Mind (Criss Cross, 1994) With Chris Cheek * Blues Cruise (Fresh Sound, 2005) With George Colligan * The Endless Mysteries (Origin, 2013) With Fly * Fly (Savory, 2004) * Sky & Country (ECM, 2009) * Year of the Snake (ECM, 2012) With Jon Gordon * Ask Me Now (Criss Cross, 1994) * Currents (Double-Time, 1998) With Phil Grenadier * Sweet Transients (Fresh Sound New Talent, 2000) * Playful Intentions (Fresh Sound New Talent, 2002) With Kevin Hays * Ugly Beauty (SteepleChase, 1991) With David Kikoski * Details (Criss Cross, 2003) * Limits (Criss Cross, 2005) With Jonathan Kreisberg * Nine Stories Wide (Criss Cross, 2003) With Charles Lloyd * The Water Is Wide (ECM, 1999) * Hyperion with Higgins (ECM, 1999) * Lift Every Voice (ECM, 2002) With Herbie Mann * America/Brasil (Lightyear, 1995) * Celebration (Lightyear, 1995) With Brad Mehldau * Introducing Brad Mehldau (Warner Bros., 1995) * The Art of the Trio Volume One (Warner Bros., 1997) * Live at the Village Vanguard: The Art of the Trio Volume Two (Warner Bros., 1998) * Songs: The Art of the Trio Volume Three (Warner Bros., 1998) * Art of the Trio 4: Back at the Vanguard (Warner Bros., 1999) * Places (Warner Bros., 2000) * Progression: The Art of the Trio, Vol. 5 (Warner Bros., 2001) * Largo (Warner Bros., 2002) * Anything Goes (Warner Bros., 2004) * Day Is Done (Nonesuch, 2005) * House on Hill (Nonesuch, 2006) * Brad Mehldau Trio Live (Nonesuch, 2008) * Highway Rider (Nonesuch, 2009) * Ode (Nonesuch, 2012) * Where Do You Start (Nonesuch, 2012) * Blues and Ballads (Nonesuch, 2016) * Seymour Reads the Constitution!

The default route is generally the address of another router, which treats the packet the same way: if a route matches, the packet is forwarded accordingly, otherwise the packet is forwarded to the default route of that router. The route evaluation process in each router uses the longest prefix match method to obtain the most specific route. The network with the longest subnet mask or network prefix that matches the destination IP address is the next-hop network gateway. The process repeats until a packet is delivered to the destination host. Each router traversal counts as one hop in the distance calculation for the transmission path. The device to which the default route points is often called the default gateway, and it often carries out other functions such as packet filtering, firewalling, or proxy server operations. The default route in Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is designated as the zero-address 0.0.0.0/0 in CIDR notation, The subnet mask is specified as /0, which effectively specifies all networks, and is the shortest match possible. A route lookup that does not match any other rule, falls back to this route. Similarly, in IPv6, the default route is specified by ::/0. In the highest-level segment of a network, administrators generally point the default route for a given host towards the router that has a connection to a network service provider. Therefore, packets with destinations outside the organization's local area network, typically destinations on the Internet or a wide area network, are forwarded to the router with the connection to that provider. ==References== Category:Internet architecture Category:Routing ","title":"Default route"},{"id":"1274142","text":"Herbert William Bowden, Baron Aylestone, (20 January 1905 ‚Äì 30 April 1994) was a British Labour politician.

He was intended for a medical career and graduated MD from the University of Strasbourg in 1855, but his interests laid in physical and chemical sciences. In 1853 he went to Paris as preparateur to JF Persoz (1805‚Äì1868), professor of chemistry at the Conservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers. A year later he was entrusted with a course of chemical instruction at Mulhouse, and he remained in that town until 1865 as professor at the √âcole Sup√©rieure des Sciences. He then returned to Paris as assistant to AJ Balard at the College de France, in 1876 he succeeded him in the chair of chemistry, and in 1882 he became directing professor at the municipal √âcole de Physique et de Chimie. The two latter chairs he held together until his death, which happened at M√©zy, Seine et Oise. During the period he spent at Mulhouse, Sch√ºtzenberger paid special attention to industrial chemistry, particularly in connection with colouring matters, but he also worked at general and biological chemistry which subsequently occupied the greater part of his time. He is known for a long series of researches on the constitution of alkaloids and of the albuminoid bodies, and for the preparation of several new series of platinum compounds and of hyposulphurous acid, H2S2O4. Towards the end of his life he adopted the view that the elements have been formed by some process of condensation from one primordial substance of extremely small atomic weight, and he expressed the conviction that atomic weights within narrow limits are variable and modified according to the physical conditions in which a compound is formed.

These tools are designed to find information on the user's PC, including web browser history, e-mail archives, text documents, sound files, images, and video. A variety of desktop search programs are now available; see this list for examples. Most desktop search programs are standalone applications. Desktop search products are software alternatives to the search software included in the operating system, helping users sift through desktop files, emails, attachments, and more. \\"What do you do for desktop search in VDI and RDSH?\\". Blogpost by Brian Madden on brainmadden.com. Retrieved on March 25, 2015. Desktop search emerged as a concern for large firms for two main reasons: untapped productivity and security. According to analyst firm Gartner, up to 80% of some companies' data is locked up inside unstructured data ‚Äî the information stored on a user's PC, the directories (folders) and files they've created on a network, documents stored in repositories such as corporate intranets and a multitude of other locations.. Moreover, many companies have structured or unstructured information stored in older file formats to which they don't have ready access. The sector attracted considerable attention in the late 2004 to early 2005 period from the struggle between Microsoft and Google.. According to market analysts, both companies were attempting to leverage their monopolies (of web browsers and search engines, respectively) to strengthen their dominance. Due to Google's complaint that users of Windows Vista cannot choose any competitor's desktop search program over the built-in one, an agreement was reached between US Justice Department and Microsoft that Windows Vista Service Pack 1 would enable users to choose between the built-in and other desktop search programs, and select which one is to be the default. As of September 2011, Google ended life for Google Desktop. == Technologies == Most desktop search engines build and maintain an index database to improve performance when searching large amounts of data. Indexing usually takes place when the computer is idle and most search applications can be set to suspend indexing if a portable computer is running on batteries, in order to save power. There are notable exceptions, however: Voidtools' Everything Search Engine, which performs searches over only file names, not contents, is able to build its index from scratch in just a few seconds. Another exception is Vegnos Desktop Search Engine, which performs searches over filenames and files' contents without building any indices. An index may also not be up-to-date, when a query is performed. In this case, results returned will not be accurate (that is, a hit may be shown when it is no longer there, and a file may not be shown, when in fact it is a hit). Some products have sought to remedy this disadvantage by building a real-time indexing function into the software. There are disadvantages to not indexing. Namely, the time to complete a query can be significant, and the issued query can also be resource-intensive. Desktop search tools typically collect three types of information about files: * file and folder names * metadata, such as titles, authors, comments in file types such as MP3, PDF and JPEG * file content, for the types of documents supported by the tool Long- term goals for desktop search include the ability to search the contents of image files, sound files and video by context. ==Platforms & their histories== === Windows === Indexing Service a \\"a base service that extracts content from files and constructs an indexed catalog to facilitate efficient and rapid searching\\" was originally released in August 1996, it was built in order to speed up manually searching for files on Personal Desktops and Corporate Computer Network. Indexing service helped by using Microsoft web servers to index files on the desired hard drives. Indexing was done by file format. By using terms that users provided, a search was conducted that matched terms to the data within the file formats. The largest issue that Indexing service faced was the fact that every time a file was added, it had to be indexed. This coupled with the fact that the indexing cached the entire index in RAM, made the hardware a huge limitation. This made indexing large amounts of files require extremely powerful hardware and very long wait times. In 2003, Windows Desktop Search (WDS) replaced Microsoft Indexing Service. Instead of only matching terms to the details of the file format and file names, WDS brings in content indexing to all Microsoft files and text-based formats such as e-mail and text files. This means, that WDS looked into the files and indexed the content. Thus, when a user searched a term, WDS no longer matched just information such as file format types and file names, but terms, and values stored within those files. WDS also brought \\"Instant searching\\" meaning the user could type a character and the query would instantly start searching and updating the query as the user typed in more characters. Windows Search apparently used up a lot of processing power, as Windows Desktop Search would only run if it was directly queried or while the PC was idle. Even only running while directly queried or while the computer was idled, indexing the entire hard drive still took hours. The index would be around 10% of the size of all the files that it indexed, e.g. if the indexed files amounted to around 100GB, the index size would be 10GB. With the release of Windows Vista came Windows Search 3.1. Unlike its predecessors WDS and Windows Search 3.0, 3.1 could search through both indexed and non indexed locations seamlessly. Also, the RAM and CPU requirements were greatly reduced, cutting back indexing times immensely. Windows Search 4.0 is currently running on all PCs with Windows 7 and up. === Mac OS === In 1994 the AppleSearch search engine was introduced, allowing users to fully search all documents within their Macintosh computer, including file format types, meta-data on those files, and content within the files. AppleSearch was a client/server application, and as such required a server separate from the main device in order to function. The biggest issue with AppleSearch were its large resource requirements: \\"AppleSearch requires at least a 68040 processor and 5MB of RAM.\\" At the time, a Macintosh computer with these specifications was priced at approximately $1400; equivalent to $2050 in 2015. On top of this, the software itself cost an additional $1400 for a single license. In 1997, Sherlock was released alongside Mac OS 8.5. Sherlock (named after the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes) was integrated into Mac OS's file browser ‚Äì Finder. Sherlock extended the desktop search function to the World Wide Web, allowing users to search both locally and externally. Adding additional functions‚Äîsuch as internet access‚Äîto Sherlock was relatively simple, as this was done through plugins written as plain text files. Sherlock was included in every release of Mac OS from Mac OS 8, before being deprecated and replaced by Spotlight and Dashboard in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. It was officially removed in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard Spotlight was released in 2005 as part of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. It is a Selection-based search tool, which means the user invokes a query using only the mouse. Spotlight allows the user to search the Internet for more information about any keyword or phrase contained within a document or webpage, and uses a built-in calculator and Oxford American Dictionary to offer quick access to small calculations and word definitions. While Spotlight initially has a long startup time, this decreases as the hard disk is indexed. As files are added by the user, the index is constantly updated in the background using minimal CPU & RAM resources. === Linux === There are a wide range of desktop search options for Linux users, depending upon the skill level of the user, their preference to use desktop tools which tightly integrate into their desktop environment, command-shell functionality (often with advanced scripting options), or browser-based users interfaces to locally running software. In addition, many users create their own indexing from a variety of indexing packages (e.g. one which does extraction and indexing of PDF/DOC/DOCX/ODT documents well, another search engine which works w/ vcard, LDAP, and other directory/contact databases, as well as the conventional \`find\` and \`locate\` commands. ====Ubuntu==== Unity Dash search tool in Ubuntu 16.04 Ubuntu Linux didn't have desktop search until release Feisty Fawn 7.04. Using Tracker desktop search, the desktop search feature was very similar to Mac OS's AppleSearch and Sherlock. It not only featured the basic features of file format sorting and meta-data matching, but support for searching through emails and instant messages was added. In 2014 Recoll was added to Linux distributions, working with other search programs such as Tracker and Beagle to provide efficient full text search. This greatly increased the types of queries and file types that Linux desktop searches could handle. A major advantage of Recoll is that it allows for greater customization of what is indexed; Recoll will index the entire hard disk by default, but can be made to index only selected directories, omitting directories that will never need to be searched. ====openSUSEhttp://www.opensuse.org/==== Starting with KDE4, the NEPOMUK was introduced. It provided the ability to index a wide range of desktop content, email, and use semantic web technologies (e.g. RDF) to annotate the database. The introduction faced a few glitches, much of which seemed to be based on the triplestore. Performance improved (at least for queries) by switching the backend to a stripped-down version of the Virtuoso Open Source Edition, however indexing remained a common user complaint. Based on user feedback, the Nepomuk indexing and search has been replaced with the Baloo frameworkhttps://community.kde.org/Baloo based on Xapian. ==See also== *List of desktop search engines == References == Category:Information retrieval genres ","title":"Desktop search"},{"id":"1274162","text":"Datacasting (data broadcasting) is the broadcasting of data over a wide area via radio waves. It most often refers to supplemental information sent by television stations along with digital terrestrial television, but may also be applied to digital signals on analog TV or radio. It generally does not apply to data which is inherent to the medium, such as PSIP data which defines virtual channels for DTT or direct broadcast satellite systems; or to things like cable modem or satellite modem, which use a completely separate channel for data. == Overview == Datacasting often provides news, weather, traffic, stock market, and other information which may or may not relate to the programs it is carried with. It may also be interactive, such as gaming, shopping, or education. An electronic program guide is usually included, although this stretches the definition somewhat, as this is often considered inherent to the digital broadcast standard. The ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards allow for broadband datacasting via DTT, though they do not necessarily define how. The overscan and VBI are used for analog TV, for moderate and low bandwidths (including closed captioning in the VBI) respectively. DirectBand and RDS/RBDS are medium and narrow subcarriers used for analog FM radio. The EUREKA 147 and HD Radio standards both allow for datacasting on digital radio, defining a few basics but also allowing for later expansion. The term IP Datacasting (IPDC) is used in DVB-H for the technical elements required to send IP packets over DVB-H broadband downstream channel combined with a return channel over a mobile communications network such as GPRS or UMTS. The set of specifications for IP Datacast (phase1) was approved by the DVB project in October 2005. ==Datacasting services around the world== ===North America=== ====Ambient Information Network==== Ambient Information Network, a datacasting network owned by Ambient Devices presently hosted by U.S.A. Mobility, a U.S. paging service and focuses on information of interest to the local (or larger) area, such as weather and stock indices, and with a paid subscription Ambient will provide a particular device with more personalized information. ====RBDS==== A slight variation of the European Radio Data System, RBDS is carried on a 57kHz subcarrier on FM radio stations. While originally intended for program-associated data, it can also be used for datacasting purposes including paging and dGPS. ====DirectBand==== DirectBand, owned by Microsoft, uses the 67.65 kHz subcarrier leased from FM radio stations. This subcarrier delivers about 12 kbit/s (net after error correction) of data per station, for over 100 MB per day per city. Data includes traffic, sports, weather, stocks, news, movie times, calendar appointments, and local time. ====MovieBeam==== The now-defunct MovieBeam service used dNTSC technology by Dotcast to transmit 720p HDTV movies in the lower vestigial sideband of NTSC analog TV. The set- top box stored the movies to be viewed on demand for a fee. This was distributed through PBS's National Datacast. ====TV Guide On Screen==== TV Guide On Screen is an advertising-supported datacast sent by one local station in each media market. It supplements or replaces the limited electronic program guide sent by each TV station, which is already mandated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). ====ATSC-M/H==== ATSC-M/H is yet another mobile TV standard, although it is transmitted and controlled by the broadcasters instead of a third party, and is therefore mostly free-to-air (although it can also be subscription-based). From a technical standpoint, it is an IP-encapsulated datacast of MPEG-4 streaming video, alongside the ATSC MPEG transport stream used for terrestrial television broadcasting. Heavy error correction, separate from that native to ATSC, compensates for ATSC's poor mobile (and often fixed) reception. ====UpdateTV==== UpdateTV is a service used by some brands of TV sets and other ATSC tuners to update their firmware via over-the-air programming. This is also transmitted on PBS stations via National Datacast. ===Australia=== Australian broadcast infrastructure company Broadcast Australia undertook a three-year trial in Sydney of a datacasting service using the DVB-T system for use in Australia. The trial consisted of a number of services on one standard 7MHz multiplex, collectively known as Digital Forty Four. The collection included: * A combined program guide for the free-to-air broadcasters (Channel 4) * ABC news, sport, and weather items (Channel 41) * Channel NSW (link) Government and Public Information, including real time traffic information and life surf webcam images (Channel 45) * Australian Christian Channel (Channel 46) * Expo Home Shopping (Channel 49) and * Federal parliamentary audio broadcasts. More recently a near-Australia wide broadcast of a datacasting channel called MyTalk commenced on April 13, 2007. Broadcasting as part of the multiplex on Southern Cross and Southern Cross Ten stations, it provided news, weather and other information, available free to anyone able to tune in. The stream consisted of text applicable to the viewer's location and a 4:3 video window of terrestrial TV from the relevant Southern Cross/Southern Cross Ten station. On February 25, 2008, MyTalk ceased broadcasting. Digital Forty Four was shut down at exactly midnight on the night of April 30, 2010. === Malaysia === Malaysian multi-channel pay-TV operator, MiTV Corporation Sdn Bhd has launched its IP-over-UHF service in September 2005. The full digital broadcast capacity is being used to deliver IP services which such as multicast streaming and datacasting. === South Africa === Mindset Network has developed an IP satellite datacast platform for the distribution of educational and health content to sites around South Africa and increasingly throughout the rest of Africa as well. he model is a forward and store model allowing users of the platform to view content in an on-demand fashion. Content distributed in this way includes video content, print-based content (in the form of PDF files), as well as interactive computer-based multimedia content. Significantly, the model also includes access to a GPRS network that allows the receiving sites to communicate back to the Mindset central server. Communications include statistics about the physical health of the machine (e.g. power status, disk drive usage) as well as usage statistics indicating what content has been viewed. The model also includes a distributed deployment of the Moodle LMS, allowing users to take assessments and then have the results transmitted via GPRS to the Mindset server for accreditation. === United Kingdom === Teletext was used extensively on analogue channels; a type of datacasting using the overscan on analogue transmissions. Teletext Limited and Ceefax were the main providers. Within digital terrestrial television, the Digital Teletext name is used extensively although the technology used to provide this service is unrelated and uses the MHEG-5 UK profile. === Worldwide === ====Outernet==== Outernet's goal is to provide free access to content from the web through geostationary and Low Earth Orbit satellites, made available effectively to all parts of the world. The project uses datacasting and User Datagram Protocol through both small satellites, such as CubeSats, and larger, more conventional geostationary communications satellites in a satellite constellation network. Wi-Fi enabled devices would communicate with the satellite hotspots, which receive data broadcasts from satellites. == Advantages over Internet transmission == Datacasting has a number of significant advantages over using the Internet, specifically when it comes to privacy and censorship resistance. Both satellite and terrestrial broadcast channels can carry multicast IP data which can be forwarded onto a LAN with a suitable receiver, which can be as simple as a low-cost set-top-box running custom firmware. The software to transmit web pages over multicast is fairly easy to implement and some of the technology has been already developed. === Privacy === Because the data stream is receive only, nobody can tell what you are receiving. Thus the government cannot round up citizens for reading forbidden material in oppressive regimes. In extreme cases the receiver can be physically disconnected from the Internet to ensure maximum security, thus providing a system much more secure than Internet based anonymity networks such as Tor. === Censorship === It is much more difficult, on a technical and political level to jam a satellite signal compared to blocking a web site. Data streams can be transmitted alongside television channels. An attempt to jam the data stream will end up jamming the TV stations as well. === Efficiency === Despite the very high cost of satellite bandwidth, broadcasting to hundreds of thousands or millions of receivers may well be cheaper than using the Internet. == See also == * Interactive television * DVB-H * Multimedia home platform * UDcast * MPEG Multiprotocol encapsulation * MPEG Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation == References == Category:Broadcasting Category:Broadcast engineering Category:Radio technology Category:Interactive television ","title":"Datacasting"},{"id":"1274164","text":"Index on Censorship is an organization campaigning for freedom of expression, which produces a quarterly magazine of the same name from London. It is directed by the non-profit-making Writers and Scholars International, Ltd. (WSI) in association with the UK-registered charity Index on Censorship (founded as the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust), which are both chaired by the British television broadcaster, writer and former politician Trevor Phillips. Index is based at 1 Rivington Place in central London. WSI was createdScammell, Michael (1984). \\"How Index on Censorship Started\\" in They Shoot Writers, Don't They?, Theiner, George; London: Faber & Faber, pp. 19‚Äì28. . by poet Stephen Spender, Oxford philosopher Stuart Hampshire, the publisher and editor of The Observer David Astor, and the writer and expert on the Soviet Union Edward Crankshaw. The founding editor of Index on Censorship was the critic and translator Michael Scammell (1972‚Äì1981), who still serves as a patron of the organisation. == Founding history == ===An Appeal from the USSR=== Larisa Bogoraz and Pavel Litvinov, late 1960s The original impetus for the creation of Index on Censorship came from an Open Letter addressed \\"To World Public Opinion\\" by two Soviet dissenters, Pavel Litvinov and Larisa Bogoraz. In the words of the samizdat periodicial A Chronicle of Current Events, they described \\"the atmosphere of illegality\\" surrounding the January 1968 trial of Ginzburg and Galanskov and called for \\"public condemnation of this disgraceful trial, for the punishment of those responsible, the release of the accused from detention and a retrial which would fully conform with the legal regulations and be held in the presence of international observers.\\"see \\"Protests about Galanskov-Ginzburg trial\\", A Chronicle of Current Events, (1.2, 30 April 1968). (One of the accused Alexander Ginzburg resumed his dissident activities on release from the camps, until expelled from the USSR in 1979; another, the writer Yuri Galanskov, died in a camp in November 1972.) The Times (London) published a translation of the Open Letter and in reply the English poet Stephen Spender composed a brief telegram: > ‚ÄúWe, a group of friends representing no organisation, support your > statement, admire your courage, think of you and will help in any way > possible.‚Äù Among the other 15 British and US signatories were the poet W.H. Auden, philosopher A.J. Ayer, musician Yehudi Menuhin, man of letters J. B. Priestley, actor Paul Scofield, sculptor Henry Moore, philosopher Bertrand Russell, writer Mary McCarthy and composer Igor Stravinsky. Later that year, on 25 August, Bogoraz, Litvinov and five others demonstrated on Red Square against the invasion of Czechoslovakia. A few weeks before, Litvinov sent Spender a letter (translated and published several years later in the first May 1972 issue of Index). He suggested that a regular publication might be set up in the West \\"to provide information to world public opinion about the real state of affairs in the USSR\\". ===Title, scope and relations with Amnesty International=== Spender and his colleagues, Stuart Hampshire, David Astor, Edward Crankshaw and founding editor Michael Scammell decided, like Amnesty International, to cast their net wider. They wished to document patterns of censorship in right-wing dictatorships ‚Äî the military regimes of Latin America and the dictatorships in Greece, Spain and Portugal ‚Äî as well as the Soviet Union and its satellites. Meanwhile, in 1971, Amnesty International began to publish English translations of each new issue of A Chronicle of Current Events, which documented human rights abuses in the USSR and included a regular \\"Samizdat Update\\". In a recent interview, Michael Scammell explains the informal division of labour between the two London-based organisations: \\"When we received human rights material we forwarded it to Amnesty and when Amnesty received a report of censorship they passed it on to us\\".\\"Pavel Litvinov and the Creation of Index on Censorship\\", Colta.ru, 8 August 2020 (in Russian). Originally, as suggested by Scammell, the magazine was to be called Index, a reference to the lists or indices of banned works that are central to the history of censorship: the Roman Catholic Church's Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books); the Soviet Union's Censor's Index; and apartheid South Africa's Jacobsens Index of Objectionable Literature. Scammell later admitted that the words \\"on censorship\\" were added as an afterthought when it was realised that the reference would not be clear to many readers. \\"Panicking, we hastily added the words 'on Censorship' as a subtitle\\", wrote Scammell in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, \\"and this it has remained ever since, nagging me with its ungrammaticality (Index of Censorship, surely) and a standing apology for the opacity of its title.\\" Describing the organisation's objectives at its inception, Stuart Hampshire said: > \\"the tyrant's concealments of oppression and of absolute cruelty should > always be challenged. There should be noise of publicity outside every > detention centre and concentration camp and a published record of every > tyrannical denial of free expression.\\" == The magazine == Jodie Ginsberg, former Chief Executive Index on Censorship Index on Censorship magazine was founded by Michael Scammell in 1972. It supports free expression, publishing distinguished writers from around the world, exposing suppressed stories, initiating debate, and providing an international record of censorship. The quarterly editions of the magazine usually focus on a country or region or a recurring theme in the global free expression debate. Index on Censorship also publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers. Index Index, a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, was published in the magazine until December 2008. While the original inspiration to create Index came from Soviet dissidents, from its outset the magazine covered censorship in right-wing dictatorships then ruling Greece and Portugal, the military regimes of Latin America, and the Soviet Union and its satellites. The magazine has covered other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and Internet censorship. In the first issue of May 1972, Stephen Spender wrote: > \\"Obviously there is the risk of a magazine of this kind becoming a bulletin > of frustration. However, the material by writers which is censored in > Eastern Europe, Greece, South Africa and other countries is among the most > exciting that is being written today. Moreover, the question of censorship > has become a matter of impassioned debate; and it is one which does not only > concern totalitarian societies.\\" Accordingly, the magazine has sought to shed light on other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and internet censorship. Issues are usually organised by theme, and contain a country-by-country list of recent cases involving censorship, restrictions on freedom of the press and other free speech violations. Occasionally, Index on Censorship publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers as well as censored ones. Over the half century it has been in existence, Index on Censorship has presented works by some of the world's most distinguished writers and thinkers, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Milan Kundera, V√°clav Havel, Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Arthur Miller, Noam Chomsky, and Umberto Eco.Hampshire, Stuart (1997), \\"Should Index be above the battle?\\" in W. L. Webb & Rose Bell, An Embarrassment of Tyrannies: 25 years of Index on Censorship, London: Victor Gollancz, pp. 186‚Äì195. . Issues under the editorship of Rachael Jolley have covered taboos, the legacy of the Magna Carta and Shakespeare's enduring legacy in protest. There have been special issues on China, reporting from the Middle East, and on internet censorship. The Russia issue (January 2008) won an Amnesty International Media Award 2008 for features by Russian journalists Fatima Tlisova and Sergei Bachinin, and veteran Russian free speech campaigner Alexei Simonov, founder of the Glasnost Defence Foundation. Since January 2010 it has been published by Sage Publications, an independent for-profit academic publisher. Between 2005 and 2009, the magazine was published and distributed by Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis group. In addition to print and annual subscriptions, Index on Censorship is available on Exact Editions, an application for the iPhone/iPad and Android. It is also a partner with Eurozine, a network of more than 60 European cultural journals. == Publishing landmarks == Philip Spender, Jo Glanville, Michael Scammell Logo until 2012 Other landmark publications include Ken Saro-Wiwa's writings from prison (Issue 3/1997) and a translation of the Czechoslovak Charter 77 manifesto drafted by V√°clav Havel and others in Issue 3/1977. Index published the first English translation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Nobel Prize acceptance speech. Index on Censorship published the stories of the \\"disappeared\\" in Argentina and the work of banned poets in Cuba; the work of Chinese poets who escaped the massacres that ended the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Index on Censorship has a long history of publishing writers in translation, including Bernard-Henri L√©vy, Ivan Klima, Ma Jian and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, and news reports including Anna Politkovskaia's coverage of the war in Chechnya (Issue 2/2002). Tom Stoppard's play Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977) is set in a Soviet mental institution and was inspired by the personal account of former detainee Victor Fainberg and Clayton Yeo's expose of the use of psychiatric abuse in the USSR, published in Index on Censorship (Issue 2, 1975).Nadel, Ira (2004). Double Act: A Life of Tom Stoppard. London: Methuen. pp. 264‚Äì268. . It was first performed with the London Symphony Orchestra. Stoppard became a member of the advisory board of Index on Censorship in 1978 and remains connected to the publication as a Patron of Index. Index on Censorship published the World Statement by the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie in support of \\"the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs and to discuss them with their critics on the basis of mutual tolerance, free from censorship, intimidation and violence. Six months later, Index published the Hunger Strike Declaration from four student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, Hou Dejian and Gao Xin. Index Index, a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, continued to be published in each edition of the magazine until December 2008, when this function was transferred to the website. The offences against free expression documented in that first issue's Index Index listing included censorship in Greece and Spain, then dictatorships, and Brazil, which had just banned the film Zabriskie Point on the grounds that it \\"insulted a friendly power\\" ‚Äì the United States, where it had been made and freely shown. Index on Censorship paid special attention to the situation in then Czechoslovakia between the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution of 1989, devoting an entire issue to the country eight years after the Prague Spring (Issue 3/1976). It included several pieces by V√°clav Havel, including a first translation of his one act play Conversation, and a letter to Czech officials on police censorship of his December 1975 production of The Beggar's Opera by John Gay. The magazine also carried articles on the state of the Czech theatre and a list of the so-called Padlock Publications, 50 banned books that circulated only in typescript. Index also published an English version of Havel's play Mistake, dedicated to Samuel Beckett in gratitude for Beckett's own dedication of his play Catastrophe to Havel. Both short plays were performedGlanville, Jo (16 September 2009). \\"Godot to the Rescue\\". Index On Censorship. at the Free Word Centre to mark the launch of Index's special issue looking back at the changes of 1989 (Issue 4, 2009). == Campaigns == Free Speech is not For Sale, a joint campaign report by Index on Censorship and English PEN highlighted the problem of so- called libel tourism and the English law of defamation's chilling effect on free speech. After much debate surrounding the report's ten key recommendations, the UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw pledged to make English defamation laws fairer.Glanville, Jo (22 November 2009). \\"Libel reform will liberate us all\\", The Guardian (UK), Comment is Free. \\"A free press can‚Äôt operate or be effective unless it can offer readers comment as well as news. What concerns me is that the current arrangements are being used by big corporations to restrict fair comment, not always by journalists but also by academics.\\" He added: \\"The very high levels of remuneration for defamation lawyers in Britain seem to be incentivising libel tourism.\\"Oakeshott, Isabel; Swinford, Steven (November 22, 2009), \\"Jack Straw pledges action to end libel tourism\\", The Times (UK). These campaigns and others were illustrative of then CEO John Kampfner's strategy, supported by then chair Jonathan Dimbleby, to boost Index's public advocacy profile in the UK and abroad beginning in 2008. Until then the organisation did not regard itself as \\"a campaigning organisation in the mould of Article 19 or Amnesty International\\", as former news editor Sarah Smith noted in 2001,Smith, Sarah (2001), \\"Index on Censorship\\" in Jones, Derek (ed.), Censorship: A World Encyclopaedia. London: Routledge. preferring to use its \\"understanding of what is newsworthy and politically significant\\" to maintain pressure on oppressive regimes (such as China, from 1989) through extensive coverage. == Arts and international programmes == Index on Censorship also runs a programme of UK based and international projects that put the organisation's philosophy into practice. In 2009 and 2010 Index on Censorship worked in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Tunisia and many other countries, in support of journalists, broadcasters, artists and writers who work against a backdrop of intimidation, repression, and censorship. The organisation's arts' programmes investigate the impact of current and recent social and political change on arts practitioners, assessing the degree and depth of self-censorship. It uses the arts to engage young people directly into the freedom of expression debate. It works with marginalised communities in UK, creating new platforms, on line and actual for creative expression. Index on Censorship works internationally to commission new work, not only articles for print and online, but also new photography, film & video, visual arts and performance. Examples have included an exhibition of photostories produced by women in Iraq, Open Shutters; and programme involving artists from refugee and migrant communities in UK, linking with artists from their country of origin, imagine art after, exhibited at Tate Britain in 2007. Index has also worked with Burmese exiled artists and publishers on creating a programme in support of the collective efforts of Burma's creative community. Index also commissioned a new play by Actors for Human Rights, Seven Years With Hard Labour, weaving together four accounts from former Burmese political prisoners now living in the UK.\\"Amnesty hosts hard-hitting performances of real life stories\\". Amnesty.org (UK). Index also co-published a book of poetry by homeless people in London and St. Petersburg. == Partners == Index on Censorship works in partnership with major groups working for freedom of expression rights, including Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Liberty, English PEN, PEN International, Human Rights House Network and IFEX among many other groups to create landmark events of national and international significance. Index was one four international freedom of expression organisations on the programming committee of the First Global Forum on Freedom of Expression in Oslo June 1-6 2009. The organisation regularly contributes to the national and international media, and plays a regular part in major literary events and public debate, including the Hay and Edinburgh Festivals and political functions such as the Institute of Ideas, the Convention on Modern Liberty. Index on Censorship is a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organisations that monitors censorship worldwide and defends journalists, writers, Internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression. It is also a member of the Tunisia Monitoring Group, a coalition of 16 free expression organisations that lobbies the Tunisian government to improve its human rights record. ==CEO== The Chief Executive of Index on Censorship from May 2014 was Jodie Ginsberg.Former journalist to head Index on Censorship, The Guardian, 5 February 2014 In December 2019, Index announced Ginsberg was standing down from the post in early 2020. In June 2020, she was replaced by Ruth Smeeth. == Freedom of Expression Awards == Index on Censorship annually presents awards to courageous journalists, artists, campaigners and digital activists from around the world who have made a significant contribution to free expression over the past year. Sponsors have included The Guardian, Google, SAGE Publications and the London law firm Doughty Street Chambers. The most recent face-to-face Index Freedom of Expression Awards took place on Thursday 4 April 2019 at The Mayfair Hotel; the most recent online awards were held online on Thursday 16 April 2020 during the 2019‚Äì20 COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 winners: Journalism: OKO.press; Campaigning: Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, Veysel Ok; Digital: 7amleh; Arts: Yulia Tsvetkova. 2019 winners: Journalism: Mimi Mefo; Campaigning: Cartoonists Rights Network, International; Digital: Fundaci√≥n Karisma; Arts: Zehra Doƒüan. 2018 winners: Journalism: Wendy Funes; Campaigning: Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms; Digital: Habari RDC; Arts: The Museum of Dissidence. 2017 winners: Journalism: Maldives Independent; Campaigning: Ildar Dadin; Digital: Turkey Blocks; Arts: Rebel Pepper. 2016 winners: Journalism: Zaina Erhaim; Campaigning: Bolo Bhi; Digital: GreatFire; Arts: Murad Subay. 2015 winners: Journalism: Rafael Marques de Morais and Safa Al Ahmad; Campaigning: Amran Abdundi; Digital:Tamas Bodoky; Arts: Mouad \\"El Haqued\\" Belghouat. 2014 winners: Journalism: Azadliq; Advocacy: Shahzad Ahmad; Digital: Shu Choudhary; Arts: Mayam Mahmoud. 2013 winners: Journalism: Kostas Vaxevanis; Digital Freedom: Bassel Khartabil; Advocacy: Malala Yousafzai; Arts: Zanele Muholi. 2012 winners: Journalism: Idrak Abbasov; Advocacy: Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, collected by Nabeel Rajab; Innovation: Freedom Fone by Kubatana; Arts: Ali Ferzat; 40th Anniversary Award: Research and Information Centre \\"Memorial (society)\\" St Petersburg. 2011 winners: Journalism: Ibrahim Eissa; Advocacy: Gao Zhisheng; New Media: Nawaat; Arts: M.

Speaking to students the previous May, Malkovich had been asked who ‚Äì as the star of Les Liaisons Dangereuses ‚Äì he would like to fight a duel with. He picked Robert Fisk, The Independent newspaper's Middle East correspondent, and George Galloway, at the time a Glasgow Labour MP, adding that rather than duel them, he would \\"rather just shoot them\\". Fisk reacted with outrageRobert Fisk, \\"Hate and Star Power: Why Does Malkovich Want to Kill Me?\\" , Counterpunch, 13 May 2002. and the media rights group Reporters sans Frontieres condemned Malkovich, but in an online article Index's then Associate Editor (now deputy CEO) Rohan Jayasekera, dismissed the actor's comments as \\"flippant\\" in an article on the organisation's (www.indexonline.org) blog site: :Over the years since (the Rwanda genocide), and not without criticism, Index on Censorship has turned to reporting the areas where the right to free speech conflicts with these other rights. Index on Censorship is a journalistic enterprise, not a campaigning agency. This has freed it to make judgement calls ‚Äî some say to equivocate ‚Äî on when and where and how and why the freely expressed word can be a direct threat to other human rights. The fundraising event went ahead in December 2002 despite a street protest outside the ICA. After taking over as CEO in 2008, John Kampfner strongly reinforced the campaigning profile of the organisation (see Arts and Advocacy programmes above). === Theo Van Gogh === In November 2004, Index on Censorship attracted further controversy over another indexonline.org blog post by Jayasekera that, to many readers, seemed to condone or justify the murder of Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh. The blog described Van Gogh was a \\"free-speech fundamentalist\\" on a \\"martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities\\" in an \\"abuse of his right to free speech\\". Describing Van Gogh's film Submission as \\"furiously provocative\\", Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as: :A sensational climax to a lifetime's public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo Van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of Pim Fortuyn's life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo! Bravo! There were many protests from both left- and right-wing commentators. Nick Cohen of The Observer newspaper wrote in December 2004, that: :When I asked Jayasekera if he had any regrets, he said he had none. He told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn't have made the mistake of believing that Index on Censorship was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle ‚Äì in the same way as Amnesty International is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle. It may have been so its radical youth, but was now as concerned with fighting 'hate speech' as protecting free speech. Ursula Owen, the chief executive of Index on Censorship, while agreeing that the blog post's \\"tone was not right\\" contradicted Cohen's account of his conversation with Jayasekera in a letter to The Observer. === Danish cartoons === In December 2009 the magazine published an interview with Jytte Klausen about a refusal of Yale University Press to include the Mohammed Cartoons in Klausen's book The Cartoons that Shook the World. The magazine declined to include the cartoons alongside the interview.\\"Censorship at Index on Censorship\\", TheAtlantic.com. December 2009.Eden, Richard (19 December 2009), \\"Any Questions?

During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus. The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others. The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise programs. ==Form== A deep squat The movement begins from a standing position. Weight is often added; typically in the form of a loaded barbell but dumbbells and kettlebells may also be used. When a barbell is used, it may be braced across the upper trapezius muscle, termed a high bar squat, or held lower across the rear deltoids, termed a low bar squat. The movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position. Squats can be performed to varying depths. The competition standard is for the crease of the hip (top surface of the leg at the hip joint) to fall below the top of the knee;Technical Rules Book 2013 . International Powerlifting Federation. powerlifting-ipf.com this is colloquially known as \\"parallel\\" depth.Hanna, Wade (March 2002) Squat depth clarified. USA Powerlifting Online Newsletter. Usapowerlifting.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-05. Confusingly, many other definitions for \\"parallel\\" depth abound, none of which represents the standard in organized powerlifting. From shallowest to deepest, these other standards are: bottom of hamstring parallel to the ground;Hi- and Low-bar Squatting. Home.comcast.net. Retrieved on 2013-08-05. the hip joint itself below the top of the knee, or femur parallel to the floor;6 Things I Really Dislike. T Nation. Retrieved on 2013-08-05. and the top of the upper thigh (i.e., top of the quadriceps) below the top of the knee.A Closer Look at the Parallel Squat. Bigger Faster Stronger, March/April 2008, pp. 36‚Äì38. Squatting below parallel qualifies a squat as deep while squatting above it qualifies as shallow. Some authorities caution against deep squats; though the forces on the ACL and PCL decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the menisci and articular cartilages in the knee peak at these same high angles.Clarkson, HM, and Gilewich, GB (1999) Musculoskeletal Assessment: Joint Range of Motion And Manual Muscle Strength. Baltimore, MD: Williams and Wilkins, p. 374, . This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine. As the body descends, the hips and knees undergo flexion, the ankle extends (dorsiflexes) and muscles around the joint contract eccentrically, reaching maximal contraction at the bottom of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles concentrically, and the hips and knees undergo extension while the ankle plantarflexes. Common errors of squat form include descending too rapidly and flexing the torso too far forward. Rapid descent risks being unable to complete the lift or causing injury. This occurs when the descent causes the squatting muscles to relax and tightness at the bottom is lost as a result. Over-flexing the torso greatly increases the forces exerted on the lower back, risking a spinal disc herniation. Another error is when the knee is not aligned with the direction of the toes, entering a valgus position, which can adversely stress the knee joint. Another error is the raising of heels off the floor, which reduces the contribution of the gluteus muscles.bodyweight squat ==Muscles used== Agonist muscles * Quadriceps femoris * Gluteus maximus * Adductor magnus * Soleus Stabilizing muscles * Erector spinae * Rectus abdominis * Internal and external obliques * Hamstrings * Gluteus medius and minimus * Gastrocnemius ==Equipment== Kirk Karwoski completing a heavy squat in competition. Note the spotters either side of him and the power cage which the barbell was lifted out of. Various types of equipment can be used to perform squats. A power cage can be used to reduce risk of injury and eliminate the need for a spotting partner. By putting the bar on a track, the Smith machine reduces the role of hip movement in the squat and in this sense resembles a leg press.Cornacchia, pp. 121, 125. The monolift rack allows an athlete to perform a squat without having to take a couple of steps back with weight on as opposed to conventional racks. Not many powerlifting federations allow monolift in competitions (WPO, GPC, IPO). Other equipment used can include a weight lifting belt to support the torso and boards to wedge beneath the ankles to improve stability and allow a deeper squat (weightlifting shoes also have wooden wedges built into the sole to achieve the same effect). Wrist straps are another piece of recommended equipment; they support the wrist and help to keep it in a straightened position. They should be wrapped around the wrist, above and below the joint, thus limiting movement of the joint. Heel wedges and related equipment are discouraged by some as they are thought to worsen form over the long term. The barbell can also be cushioned with a special padded sleeve. ==Variants== Starting position of a front squat using a cross-armed grip Zercher squat The hack squat as pictured page 70 of George Hackenschmidt's book The Way to Live (1908) Machine hack squat A photo of an Indian wrestler performing baithaks (Hindu squats). A sissy squat machine The squat has a number of variants, some of which can be combined: ===Barbell=== *Back squat ‚Äì the bar is held on the back of the body upon the upper trapezius muscle, near to the base of the neck. Alternatively, it may be held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids. In powerlifting the barbell is often held in a lower position in order to create a lever advantage, while in weightlifting it is often held in a higher position which produces a posture closer to that of the clean and jerk. These variations are called low bar (or powerlifting squat) and high bar (or Olympic squat), respectively. **Sumo squat ‚Äì A variation of the back squat where the feet are placed slightly wider than shoulder width apart and the feet pointed outwards. **Box squat ‚Äì at the bottom of the motion the squatter will sit down on a bench or other type of support then rise again. The box squat is commonly utilized by powerlifters to train the squat. *Front squat ‚Äì the barbell is held in front of the body across the clavicles and deltoids in either a clean grip, as is used in weightlifting, or with the arms crossed and hands placed on top of the barbell. In addition to the muscles used in the back squat, the front squat also uses muscles of the upper back such as the trapezius to support the bar. *Hack squat ‚Äì the barbell is held in the hands just behind the legs; this exercise was first known as Hacke (heel) in Germany. According to European strength sports expert and Germanist Emmanuel Legeard this name was derived from the original form of the exercise where the heels were joined. The hack squat was thus a squat performed the way Prussian soldiers used to click their heels (\\"Hacken zusammen\\"). The hack squat was popularized in the English-speaking countries by early 1900s wrestler, George Hackenschmidt. It is also called a rear deadlift. It is different from the hack squat performed with the use of a squat machine. *Overhead squat ‚Äì the barbell is held overhead in a wide-arm snatch grip; however, it is also possible to use a closer grip if balance allows. *Zercher squat ‚Äì the barbell is held in the crooks of the arms, on the inside of the elbow. One method of performing this is to deadlift the barbell, hold it against the thighs, squat into the lower portion of the squat, and then hold the bar on the thighs as you position the crook of your arm under the bar and then stand up. This sequence is reversed once the desired number of repetitions has been performed. Named after Ed Zercher, a 1930s strongman. *Deep knee bend on toes - it is similar to a normal back squat only the lifter is positioned on their forefeet and toes, with their heels raised, throughout the repetition. Usually, the weight used is not more than moderate in comparison to a flat footed, heavy back squat. *Loaded squat jump - the barbell is positioned similarly to a back squat. The exerciser squats down, before moving upwards into a jump, and then landing in approximately the same position. The loaded squat jump is a form of loaded plyometric exercise used to increase explosive power. Variations of this exercise may involve the use of a trap bar or dumbbells. ===Lunge=== *Split squat ‚Äì an assisted one-legged squat where the non-lifting leg is rested on the ground a few steps behind the lifter, as if it were a static lunge. *Bulgarian split squat ‚Äì performed similarly to a split squat, but the foot of the non-lifting leg is rested on a platform behind the lifter. ===Other=== *Belt squat ‚Äì is an exercise performed the same as other squat variations except the weight is attached to a hip belt i.e. a dip belt *Goblet squat ‚Äì a squat performed while holding a kettlebell next to one's chest and abdomen with both hands. *Smith squat ‚Äì a squat using a Smith machine. * Machine hack squat ‚Äì using a squat machine. *Trap bar squat ‚Äì a trap bar is held in the hands while squats are performed. More commonly referred to as \\"trap bar deadlifts.\\" *Monolift squat ‚Äì a squat using a monolift rack. *Anderson Squat (aka Pin Squat, Bottoms Up Squat) ‚Äì starting the squat from the bottom position. ===Bodyweight=== *Bodyweight squat ‚Äì done with no weight or barbell, often at higher repetitions than other variants. *Overhead squat ‚Äì a non-weight bearing variation of the squat exercise, with the hands facing each other overhead, biceps aligned with the ears, and feet hip-width apart. This exercise is a predictor of total-body flexibility, mobility, and possible lower body dysfunction. *Hindu squat ‚Äì also called a baithak, or a deep knee bend on toes. It is performed without additional weight, and body weight placed on the forefeet and toes with the heels raised throughout; during the movement the knees track far past the toes. The baithak was a staple exercise of ancient Indian wrestlers. It was also used by Bruce Lee in his training regime.Lee, Bruce,'Preliminaries' in The Tao of Jeet Kune Do, California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29 It may also be performed with the hands resting on an upturned club or the back of a chair. *Jump squat ‚Äì a plyometrics exercise where the squatter engages in a rapid eccentric contraction and jumps forcefully off the floor at the top of the range of motion. *Pistol squat ‚Äì a bodyweight single leg squat done to full depth, while the other leg is extended off the floor. Sometimes dumbbells, kettlebells or medicine balls are added for resistance. *Shrimp squat ‚Äì also called the flamingo squat, a version of the pistols squat where instead of extending the non-working leg out in front, it is bent and placed behind the working leg while squatting, perhaps held behind in a hand.Periodic Table of Bodyweight Exercises with Clickable Videos. Strength.stack52.com. Retrieved on 2015-04-24. *Jockey squat - a half-squat, performed by being balanced on the forefeet throughout the repetition, with fingertips touching across the chest. This squat can be performed quickly and in high repetitions. *Sissy squat ‚Äì the knees travel over the toes, stretching the quadriceps and the body leans backwards. Can be done in a special sissy squat machine, and can also be weighted. ==Injury considerations== Although the squat has long been a basic element of weight training, it has not been without controversy over its safety. Some trainers claim that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees.Cornacchia, p. 120. Others, however, continue to advocate the squat as one of the best exercises for building muscle and strength. Some coaches maintain that incomplete squats (those terminating above parallel) are both less effective and more likely to cause injury than a full squat (terminating with hips at or below knee level). A 2013 review concluded that deep squats performed with proper technique do not lead to increased rates of degenerative knee injuries and are an effective exercise. The same review also concluded that shallower squats may lead to degeneration in the lumbar spine and knees in the long-term. ===Squats used in physical therapy=== Squats can be used for some rehabilitative activities because they hone stability without excessive compression on the tibiofemoral joint and anterior cruciate ligament. Deeper squats are associated with higher compressive loads on patellofemoral joint and it is possible that people who suffer from pain in this joint cannot squat at increased depths. For some knee rehabilitation activities, patients might feel more comfortable with knee flexion between 0 and 50 degrees because it places less force compared to deeper depths. Another study shows that decline squats at angles higher than 16 degrees may not be beneficial for the knee and fails to decrease calf tension. Other studies have indicated that the best squat to hone quadriceps, without inflaming the patellofemoral joint, occurs between 0 and 50 degrees. Combining single-limb squats and decline angles have been used to rehabilitate knee extensors. Conducting squats at a declined angle allows the knee to flex despite possible pain or lack of mobilization in the ankle. If therapists are looking to focus on the knee during squats, one study shows that doing single- limb squats at a 16-degree decline angle has the greatest activation of the knee extensors without placing excessive pressure on the ankles. This same study also found that a 24-degree decline angle can be used to strengthen ankles and knee extensors. Different Sets For Squats Forced repetitions are used when training until failure. They are completed by completing an additional 2-4 reps (assisted) at the end of the set. Partial repetitions are also used in order to maintain a constant period of tension in order to promote hypertrophy. Lastly, drop-sets are an intense workout done in at the end of a set which runs until failure and continues with a lower weight without rest. ==World records== *The world record for the biggest equipped squat, with a multi-ply squat suit and knee wraps, is performed by Nathan Baptist at the UPA Utah Kick Off Meet on 2 January 2020..

In 1968 she was part of the extraordinarily successful revue L'Osstidcho, followed the next year by L'Osstidchomeurt with Robert Charlebois, Yvon Deschamps and Mouffe. She and Charlebois recorded the landmark song \\"Lindberg'\\" and toured France in 1969. In April 1970 Forestier starred in the Michel Tremblay, Fran√ßois Dompierre musical, Demain matin Montr√©al m'attend. She continued with acting, appearing in Jacques Godbout's 1972 film IXE-13, singing on the original film score. Forestier topped the Quebec charts in 1973 with a version of the folk song \\"La Prison de Londres\\", performed with guitarist Claude Lafrance, and pianist Jacques Perron. With this song Forestier started to turn away from the hard rock of her early career to a repertoire largely inspired by Quebec folk music, and to a more personal style, which she continued through the 1970s. In 1980 Forestier played Marie-Jeanne, the robot waitress in the Montreal production Luc Plamondon, Michel Berger rock opera Starmania. Two years later, with Plamondon as producer, she staged the hit show Je suis au rendez-vous. This was the first of a series of shows in the 1980s, culminating in an appearance with Belgian singer Maurane as part of the Francofolies de Montr√©al in 1989. In 1990 she appeared at the Place-des-Arts in Montreal as √âmilie Nelligan, the mother of the poet in the romantic opera Nelligan by Michel Tremblay and Andr√© Gagnon. Forestier defended Yann Martel's novel Histoire de Pi in the French version of Canada Reads, which was broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004. In March 2019, she was one of 11 singers from Quebec, alongside Ginette Reno, Diane Dufresne, C√©line Dion, Isabelle Boulay, Luce Dufault, Laurence Jalbert, Catherine Major, Ariane Moffatt, Marie Denise Pelletier and Marie-√âlaine Thibert, who participated in a supergroup recording of Ren√©e Claude's 1971 single \\"Tu trouveras la paix\\" after Claude's diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease was announced.\\"La chanson pour Ren√©e Claude en t√™te du palmar√®s iTunes Canada\\".

From humble beginnings, the Roman Republic (509 BCE to 27 BCE) and empire (27 BCE to 476 CE) expanded to rule much of Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East and thus comprised many agricultural environments of which the Mediterranean climate of dry, hot summers and cool, rainy winters was the most common. Within the Mediterranean area, a triad of crops were most important: grains, olives, and grapes. The great majority of the people ruled by Rome were engaged in agriculture. From a beginning of small, largely self- sufficient landowners, rural society became dominated by latifundium, large estates owned by the wealthy and utilizing mostly slave labor. The growth in the urban population, especially of the city of Rome, required the development of commercial markets and long-distance trade in agricultural products, especially grain, to supply the people in the cities with food. ==Background== The main texts of the Greco-Roman agricultural tradition are mostly from the Roman agronomists: Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura, Columella's De re Rustica, Marcus Terentius Varro and Palladius. Attributed to Mago the Carthaginian, the agricultural treatise Rusticatio, originally written in Punic and later translated into Greek and Latin, is now lost. Scholars speculate whether this text may have been an early source for agricultural traditions in the Near East and Classical world. ==The \\"delightful\\" life== Agriculture in ancient Rome was not only a necessity, but was idealized among the social elite as a way of life. Cicero considered farming the best of all Roman occupations. In his treatise On Duties, he declared that \\"of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a free man.\\" When one of his clients was derided in court for preferring a rural lifestyle, Cicero defended country life as \\"the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice\\" (parsimonia, diligentia, iustitia).Pro Roscio Amerino 75. Cato, Columella, Varro and Palladius wrote handbooks on farming practice. In his treatise De agricultura (\\"On Farming\\", 2nd century BC), Cato wrote that the best farms contained a vineyard, followed by an irrigated garden, willow plantation, olive orchard, meadow, grain land, forest trees, vineyard trained on trees, and lastly acorn woodlands.Cato the Censor, Columbia University Records of Civilization: On Farming, translated by Ernest Brehaut (Columbia University Press) Though Rome relied on resources from its many provinces acquired through conquest and warfare, wealthy Romans developed the land in Italy to produce a variety of crops. \\"The people living in the city of Rome constituted a huge market for the purchase of food produced on Italian farms.\\" Land ownership was a dominant factor in distinguishing the aristocracy from the common person, and the more land a Roman owned, the more important he would be in the city. Soldiers were often rewarded with land from the commander they served. Though farms depended on slave labor, free men and citizens were hired at farms to oversee the slaves and ensure that the farms ran smoothly. ==Crops== ===Grains=== Staple crops in early Rome were millet, and emmer and spelt which are species of wheat. According to the Roman scholar Varro, common wheat and durum wheat were introduced to Italy as crops about 450 BCE.Fussell, G. E.

Accessed 10 Nov 2018 Durum (hard) wheat became the preferred grain of urban Romans, because it could be baked into leavened bread and was easier to grow in the Mediterranean region than common (soft) wheat.Erdkamp, Paul, \\"The Food Supply of the Capital,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Rome, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 262-263James et al, p. 165 Grains, especially baked into bread, were the staple of the Roman diet, providing 70 to 80 percent of the calories in an average diet.Rosenstein, Nathan (2013), \\"Agriculture, Roman Republic,\\" Encyclopedia of Ancient History, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah20007, Accessed 9 Nov 2018. Barley was also grown extensively, dominating grain production in Greece and on poorer soils where it was more productive than wheat. Wheat was the preferred grain, but barley was widely eaten and also important as animal feed.Jasy, Naum (1950), \\"The daily bread of the Ancient Greeks and Romans,\\" Ostria,, Vol. 9, pp. 231-233. Downloaded from JSTOR. In De re Rustica Columella wrote that emmer was more resistant to moisture than wheat. According to Columella four types of emmer were cultivated, including one variety that he calls Clusian (named for the town Clusium).Columella, De re Rustica, 2.6.3-4 Cato wrote that if sowing grain in humid or dewy soils was unavoidable, they should be sown alongside turnips, panic grass, millet and rape.Cato, De Agricultura, 6.1 Despite listing panicum and millet among the legumes Columella says they should be considered grain crops \\"for in many countries the peasants subsist on food made from them\\".Columella, De re Rustica, 2.9.17 ===Legumes=== Of legumes, Columella lists some that are preferred for cultivation: lentils, peas, lupinus, beans, cowpeas, and chickpeas (also listing sesame, panicum, cannabis, barley, and millet as legumes).Columella, De re Rustica, 2.7.1 He writes the following about lupinus:Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.1 > \\"...it requires the least labour, costs least, and of all crops that are > sown is most beneficial to the land. For it affords an excellent fertilizer > for worn out vineyards and ploughlands; it flourishes even in exhausted > soil; and it endures age when laid away in the granary. When softened by > boiling it is good fodder for cattle during the winter; in the case of > humans, too, it serves to warn off famine if years of crop failures come > upon them.\\" ===Olives=== The Romans grew olive trees in poor, rocky soils, and often in areas with sparse precipitation. The tree is sensitive to freezing temperatures and intolerant of the colder weather of northern Europe and high, cooler elevations. The olive was grown mostly near the Mediterranean Sea. The consumption of olive oil provided about 12 percent of the calories and about 80 percent of necessary fats in the diet of the average Roman.James et al, p. 169 ===Grapes=== Viticulture was probably brought to southern Italy and Sicily by Greek colonists, but the Phoenicians of Carthage in northern Africa gave the Romans much of their knowledge of growing grapes and making wine. By 160 BCE, the cultivation of grapes on large estates using slave labor was common in Italy and wine was becoming a universal drink in the Roman empire. To protect their wine industry, the Romans attempted to prohibit the cultivation of grapes outside Italy,\\"Wine and Rome\\", , accessed 15 Nov 2018 but by the 1st century CE, provinces such as Spain and Gaul (modern-day France) were exporting wine to Italy.Casson, Lionel (1991), The Ancient Mariners, Princeton: Princeton University Press, pl 200. ===Fodder=== Columella mentions turnips as important, high-yielding food crop, especially in Gaul where they were used as winter fodder for cattle.Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.22 As other \\"fodder crops\\" he lists Medic clover, vetch, barley, cytisus, oats, chickpea and fenugreek.Columella, De re Rustica, 2.7.2 Of Medic clover, he says it improves the soil, fattens lean cattle and is a high-yielding fodder crop.Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.25 Cato the Elder wrote that leaves from poplar, elm and oak leaves should be gathered in the Fall before they have dried completely and stored for use as fodder. Turnips, lupines and forage crops were to be sown after the rainy season.Cato, De Agricultura, 5.8 ===Other crops=== The Romans also grew artichoke, mustard, coriander, rocket, chives, leeks, celery, basil, parsnip, mint, rue, thyme 'from overseas', beets, poppy, dill, asparagus, radish, cucumber, gourd, fennel, capers, onions, saffron, parsley, marjoram, cabbage, lettuce, cumin, garlic, figs, 'Armenian' apricots, plums, mulberries, and peaches. ==Storage== Columella describes how produce is stored and gives advice to prevent spoilage. Liquids produced for market like oil and wine were stored on the ground floor and grain was stored in lofts with hay and other fodder. He instructs that granaries be well venilated, cool, with minimal humidity, to prolong freshness. He describes certain methods of construction to avoid buildings developing cracks that would give animals and weevils access to the grains.Columella, De re Rustica, 1.6.9-1.6.17 Press rooms, he advised, should be warm receiving light from the south to prevent the oil from freezing, which makes oil spoil faster. Columella, De re Rustica, 1.6.18 ==Land== Columella describes land as being classified into three types of terrain which he calls champaign (sloping plains), hills with a gradual but gentle rise, and wooded, verdant mountain highlands. Of soil, he says there are six qualities: fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry. The permutations of these qualities producing many varieties of soils.Columella, De re Rustica, 2.2.1-3 Columella quotes Vergil's comment that loose soil is \\"what we rival when we plough\\". Of the most preferred types of soil he says the best is fat and loose soil that is the least costly and most productive, then fat and dense which is productive though requiring more effort, and after these are the moist soils.Columella, De re Rustica, 2.2.4-7 ==Farming practices== Field Museum in Chicago In the 5th century BC, farms in Rome were small and family-owned. The Greeks of this period, however, had started using crop rotation and had large estates. Rome's contact with Carthage, Greece, and the Hellenistic East in the 3rd and 2nd centuries improved Rome's agricultural methods. Roman agriculture reached its height in productivity and efficiency during the late Republic and early Empire. Farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18‚Äì108 iugera. (One iugerum was equal to about 0.65 acres or a quarter of a hectare). Medium-sized farms were from 80‚Äì500 iugera. Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. In the late Republican era, the number of latifundia increased. Wealthy Romans bought land from peasant farmers who could no longer make a living. Starting in 200 BC, the Punic Wars called peasant farmers away to fight for longer periods of time. This is now disputed; some scholars now believe that large-scale agriculture did not dominate Italian agriculture until the 1st century BC. Cows provided milk while oxen and mules did the heavy work on the farm. Sheep and goats were cheese producers and were prized for their hides. Horses were not widely used in farming, but were raised by the rich for racing or war. Sugar production centered on beekeeping, and some Romans raised snails as luxury food. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm's produce; forced labour by slaves owned by aristocrats and supervised by slave managers; and other arrangements in which a farm was leased to a tenant. Cato the Elder (also known as \\"Cato the Censor\\") was a politician and statesman in the mid- to late Roman Republic and described his view of a farm of 100 iugera in the de agricultura. He claimed such a farm should have \\"a foreman, a foreman's wife, ten laborers, one ox driver, one donkey driver, one man in charge of the willow grove, one swineherd, in all sixteen persons; two oxen, two donkeys for wagon work, one donkey for the mill work.\\" He also said that such a farm should have \\"three presses fully equipped, storage jars in which five vintages amounting to eight hundred cullei can be stored, twenty storage jars for wine-press refuse, twenty for grain, separate coverings for the jars, six fiber-covered half amphorae, four fiber-covered amphorae, two funnels, three basketwork strainers, [and] three strainers to dip up the flower, ten jars for [handling] the wine juice...\\" It is important to note that Cato's description is not indicative of the majority of farms in the early 2nd century BC. The de agricultura is a political document designed to show off Cato's character as much as it is a practical guide. ==Trade== There was much commerce between the provinces of the empire, and all regions of the empire were largely economically interdependent. Some provinces specialized in the production of grains including wheat, emmer, spelt, barley, and millet; others in wine and others in olive oil, depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his Res Rustica, \\"Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for winter wheat and spelt. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry.\\"Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, On Agriculture (Res Rustica), (Loeb Classical Library), Book II, p. 145 Pliny the Elder wrote extensively about agriculture in his Naturalis Historia from books XII to XIX, including chapter XVIII, The Natural History of Grain. Greek geographer Strabo considered the Po Valley (northern Italy) to be the most important economically because \\"all cereals do well, but the yield from millet is exceptional, because the soil is so well watered.\\" The province of Etruria had heavy soil good for wheat. Volcanic soil in Campania made it well-suited for wine production. In addition to knowledge of different soil categories, the Romans also took interest in what type of manure was best for the soil. The best was poultry manure, and cow manure one of the worst. Sheep and goat manure were also good. Donkey manure was best for immediate use, while horse manure wasn't good for grain crops, but according to Marcus Terentius Varro, it was very good for meadows because \\"it promotes a heavy growth of grass plants like grass.\\" ==Economics== In the grain-growing area of north Africa, centered on the ancient city of Carthage, a family of six people needed to cultivate 12 iugera/ 3 hectares of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals). If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera was needed. More land would be required to meet subsistence levels if the family farmed as sharecroppers. In Africa Proconsularis in the 2nd century AD, one-third of the total crop went to the landowner as rent (See Lex Manciana). Such figures detail only the subsistence level. It is clear that large scale surplus production was undertaken in some provinces, such as to supply the cities, especially Rome, with grain, a process known as the Cura Annonae. Egypt, northern Africa, and Sicily were the principal sources of grain to feed the population of Rome, estimated at one million people at its peak.. Downloaded from JSTOR. For yields of wheat, the number varies depending on the ancient source. Varro mentions 10:1 seed-yield ratio for wheat as normal for wealthy landowners. In some areas of Etruria, yield may have been as high as 15:1. Cicero indicates In Verrem a yield of 8:1 as normal, and 10:1 in exceptionally good harvest. Paul Erdkamp mentions in his book The Grain Market in the Roman Empire, that Columella was probably biased when he mentions a much lower yield of 4:1. According to Erdkamp, Columella wanted to make the point that \\"grain offers little profit compared to wine. His argument induces him to exaggerate the profitability of vineyards and at the same time to diminish the yields that were obtained in grain cultivation. At best Columella provides a trustworthy figure for poor soils; at worst, his estimate is not reliable at all.\\" Average wheat yields per year in the 3rd decade of the century, sowing 135 kg/ha of seed, were around 1,200 kg/ha in Italy and Sicily, 1,710 kg/ha in Egypt, 269 kg/ha in Cyrenaica, Tunisia at 400 kg/ha, and Algeria at 540 kg/ha, Greece at 620 kg/ha.Hopkins , K. ( 1983 b) ‚Äò Models, ships and staples ‚Äô, in Garnsey , Whittaker ( 1983 ), 84 ‚Äì 109 This makes the Mediterranean very difficult to average over all. An agricultural unit was known as a latus fundus mentioned by Varro as a great estate. Which can be interpreted as a Latifundia or at 500 iugera or around 125 hectares because this is the land limit imposed by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus as tribune in 133 BCE. With the incorporation of Egypt into the Roman empire and the rule of the emperor Augustus (27 BCE-14 CE), Egypt became the main source of supply of grain for Rome.Erdkamp, p. 270 By the 70s CE, the historian Josephus was claiming that Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year and Egypt only four. Although that statement may ignore grain from Sicily, and overestimate the importance of Africa, there is little doubt among historians that Africa and Egypt were the most important sources of grain for Rome.Rickman (1980), pp 263-264 To help assure that the grain supply would be adequate for Rome, in the second century BCE, Gracchus settled 6,000 colonists near Carthage, giving them about each to grow grain.Cristofori, p. 143. Grain made into bread was, by far, the most important element in the Roman diet. Several scholars have attempted to compute the total amount of grain needed to supply the city of Rome. Rickman estimated that Rome needed 40 million modii (200,000 tonnes) of grain per year to feed its population.Rickman (1980), p. 264. A modii of grain weighs six to seven kilograms. Erdkamp estimated that the amount needed would be at least 150,000 tonnes, calculating that each resident of the city consumed of grain per year.Rickman (1980), p. 263 The total population of Rome assumed in calculating these estimates was between 750,000 and one million people. David Mattingly and Gregory Aldrete Ancient Rome, The Archaeology of the Ancient City, The Feeding of Imperial Rome, Editors John Coulston and Hazel Dodge, 2000, reprinted 2011, pp. 142-165, estimated the amount of imported grain at 237,000 tonnes for 1 million inhabitants;p. 154 (they also estimated the amount of wine and oil; and the number of shiploads, an average of 250 tonnes of products per ship, to carry at 1,692 and the number of ships arriving daily at 17 per day from April to September, 4 months, 100 days (sic!) not 120) This amount of grain would provide 2,326 calories daily per person not including other foods such as meats, seafood, fruit, legumes, vegetable and dairy. In the Historia Augusta, it is stated Severus left 27 million modii in storage - considered to be a figure for the canon at the end of the 4th century and enough for 800,000 inhabitants at 500 lbs of bread per person per annumJones A.H.M. Later Roman Empire Vol. I pp. 698, 1287 Pliny the Younger painted a picture that Rome was able to survive without Egyptian wheat in his speech the Panegyricus in 100 AD. In 99 there was an Egyptian crisis due to inadequate flooding. Pliny the Younger stated that for \\"long it was generally believed that Rome could only be fed and maintained with Egyptian aid\\". However, he argued that \\"Now [that] we have returned the Nile its riches... her business is not to allow us food but to pay a proper tribute. ==Mechanization== Arles Aqueduct Mills below rock-cut channel The Romans improved crop growing by irrigating plants using aqueducts to transport water. Mechanical devices aided agriculture and the production of food. For example, extensive sets of mills existed in Gaul and Rome at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at Barbegal in southern France, near Arles. Sixteen overshot water wheels arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century.Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of flour per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time. Vertical water wheels were well known to the Romans, described by Vitruvius in his De Architectura of 25 BC, and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia of AD 77. There are also later references to floating water mills from Byzantium and to sawmills on the river Moselle by the poet Ausonius. The use of multiple stacked sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels was widespread in Roman mines. There is evidence from bas-reliefs that farmers in northern Gaul (present day France) used a kind of automatic harvester or reaper when collecting ripe grain crops. The machine, called the \\"vallus\\" or \\"gallic vallus\\", was apparently invented and used by the TreveriKing, Anthony (1990), Roman Gaul and Germany. Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 1001-101 people. It cut the ears of grain without the straw and was pushed by oxen or horses. Pliny the Elder mentions the device in the Naturalis Historia XVIII, 296. Possibly because the vallus was cumbersome and expensive, its adoption never became widespread and it fell into disuse after the 4th century CE.White, K.D. (2010), Agricultural Implements of the Roman World Reissue Edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 160-171 Scythes and sickles were the usual tools for harvesting crops. ==Acquiring a farm== Gallo- Roman harvesting machine Aristocrats and common people could acquire land for a farm in one of three ways. The most common way to gain land was to purchase the land. Though some lower-class citizens did own small pieces of land, they often found it too difficult and expensive to maintain. Because of the many difficulties of owning land, they would sell it to someone in the aristocracy who had the financial backing to support a farm. Though there were some public lands available to the common person for use, aristocrats also tended to purchase those pieces of land, which caused a great deal of tension between the two classes. ‚ÄúMass eviction of the poor by the rich underlay the political tensions and civil wars of the last century of the Roman Republic.‚Äù Another way to acquire land was as a reward for going to war. High-ranking soldiers returning from war would often be given small pieces of public land or land in provinces as a way of paying them for their services. The last way to obtain land was through inheritance. A father could leave his land to his family, usually to his son, in the event of his death. Wills were drawn out that specified who would receive the land as a way of ensuring that other citizens did not try to take the land from the family of the deceased. ==Aristocracy and the land== Cato the Elder, author of a book on Roman agriculture Though some small farms were owned by lower-class citizens and soldiers, much of the land was controlled by the noble class of Rome. Land ownership was just one of many distinctions that set the aristocracy apart from the lower classes. Aristocracy would \\"reorganize small holdings into larger more profitable farms in order to compete with other nobles.\\" It was considered a point of pride to own not just the largest piece of land, but also to have land that grew high quality produce. As Marcus Cato wrote \\"when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: 'Good husband good farmer'; it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come.\\"Marcus Cato, On Agriculture, 1-2,5 The farms would produce a variety of crops depending on the season, and focused on trying to acquire the best possible farm under the best possible conditions. Cato discusses many of the primary focuses of the farmer and how to distinguish a great piece of land. He notes that a good farmer must take precious time to examine the land, looking over every detail. Not only did the land need to be perfect for purchase, but the neighbors must maintain their farms as well because \\"if the district was good, they should be well kept.\\" Individuals looking to buy a piece of land had to also take into consideration the weather of the area, the condition of the soil, and how close the farm would be to a town or port. Careful planning went into every detail of owning and maintaining a farm in Roman culture. ==Running a farm in Rome== While the aristocracy owned most of the land in Rome, they often were not present at the farms. With obligations as senators, generals, and soldiers at war, many of the actual landowners spent very little time working on their farms. The farms instead were maintained by slaves and freedmen paid to oversee those slaves. The overseer of the farm had many responsibilities that coincided with maintaining the land. He was responsible for ensuring that the slaves were kept busy and for resolving conflicts between them. An overseer had to be dependable and trustworthy in that the land owner had to know that the person he hired to run the farm was not going to try to steal any of the produce from the farm. Overseers were also responsible for ensuring that both servants and slaves were properly fed and housed, and that they were assigned work fairly and efficiently. They had to ensure that any orders given by the owner of the land were followed diligently and that everyone on the farm honored the gods completely and respectfully, which Romans believed was necessary to ensure a bountiful harvest. Good inscription evidence of how the system was organized is visible in the Lex Manciana. The majority of the work was done by servants and slaves. Slaves were the main source of labor. In Roman society, there were three main ways to obtain a slave. The first and possibly most common way to gain a slave was to buy one on the market. Slaves were purchased at auctions and slaves markets from dealers or were traded between individual slave owners. Another way slaves were acquired was through conquest in warfare. As Keith Hopkins explains in his writings, many landowners would go to war and bring back captives. These captives were then taken back to Roman territory and either sold to another citizen or made to work on the capturer's farm. The final way a slave could be obtained was through birth: if a female slave gave birth to a child, that child became property of the slave's owner. Extramarital relations with women who were not citizens was not considered to be adultery under Roman law (and Roman wives were expected to tolerate such behavior), so there was no legal or moral impediment to having children being fathered by a slave's owner or overseer. Slaves were relatively cheap to use because they were property; their treatment depended on the humanity of their owners, who met the needs of their slaves on what they cared to spend, not what they had to. Overseers motivated slaves by imposing punishments and by giving rewards. \\"If the overseer sets his face against wrongdoing, they will not do it; if he allows it, the master must not let him go unpunished.\\" Although outright cruelty to slaves was considered a mark of bad character in Roman culture, there were few limits on the punishments an overseer or slave-owner could inflict. ==Problems for farmers== Roman farmers faced many of the problems which have historically affected farmers, including the unpredictability of weather, rainfall, and pests. Farmers also had to be wary of purchasing land too far away from a city or port because of war and land conflicts. As Rome was a vast empire that conquered many lands, it created enemies with individuals whose land had been taken. They would often lose their farms to the invaders who would take over and try to run the farms themselves. Though Roman soldiers would often come to the aid of the farmers and try to regain the land, these fights often resulted in damaged or destroyed property. Land owners also faced problems with slave rebellions at times. \\"In addition to invasions by Carthaginians and Celtic tribes, slaves rebellions and civil wars which were repeatedly fought on Italian soil all contributed to the destruction of traditional agricultural holdings.

He was born in Holloway, North London, of mixed Sri Lankan-Scots-Irish parentage. ==Career== Jayasekera began his journalistic career as an apprentice reporter in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire in 1980, worked for a variety of London and national newspapers during the 1980s and 1990s before going abroad, covering half a dozen conflicts thereafter including Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. He is a former managing editor of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting and former deputy CEO of the UK quarterly magazine Index on Censorship, where he was responsible for the charity's international programmes and fundraising. He is now a freelance digital publisher managing a series of new R&D;, advocacy and journalism projects on freedom of expression rights issues in conflict zones and repressive states Between 2008 and the years running up to and during the Arab Spring, Jayasekera chaired the Tunisia Monitoring Group (IFEX-TMG), a campaigning group of 21 Arab and international free expression rights groups supporting dissidents in Tunisia.http://www.englishpen.org/campaigns/tunisian-partners-share-history- in-the-making-with-ifex-tmg/ ==Background== Jayasekera's maternal grandfather left Ireland as a child, fought Moselyites in Cable Street and spent the war in the Royal Navy, which exposed him to three life changing experiences: US segregation in Norfolk, Virginia; Soviet segregation in Murmansk, Siberia, and the war itself. His paternal grandfather was the first Sinhalese owner-manager of an independent plantation in pre-war Sri Lanka. His uncle was Kingsley Jayasekera, a Sri Lankan singer, actor and play producer. ==Controversies== ===Jayasekera and David Irving=== Between 2001 and 2004, Jayasekera ran an associated blog for the UK quarterly magazine Index on Censorship at www.indexonline.org.The domain is now no longer connected with Index on Censorship In May 2001, he provoked outrage from critics of the Holocaust denier David Irving by agreeing to share a stage with him at the Oxford Union to oppose the proposition that \\"this house would restrict the free speech of extremists\\". The previous year a High Court judge had found that Mr Irving was \\"an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo- Nazism\\".http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448417.stm Strong protest followed,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1321775.stm including direct appeals to the then chair of the board, Michael Grade, and objections from some of Jayasekera's colleagues. At a time before Irving's jailing in Austria, Jayasekera was criticised for breaking the so-called \\"no platform\\" rule. This policy ‚Äì formally adopted by Britain's National Union of Students and other groups ‚Äì requires, first, that fascists should not be given public forum, and secondly that if they do gain a platform other political parties and organisations should refuse to share it with them. Jayasekera declined to comply. The debate was eventually cancelled on the advice of the police.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1321775.stm ===John Malkovich=== There was similar protest a year later when Jayasekera went online to defend Index on Censorship's refusal to cancel a charity performance of the John Malkovich film The Dancer Upstairs at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). In May 2002, Malkovich had been asked who ‚Äì as the star of Les Liaisons Dangereuses ‚Äì he would like to fight a duel with. He picked Robert Fisk, The Independent newspaper's Middle East correspondent, and Glasgow MP George Galloway, adding that rather than duel with them, he would \\"rather just shoot them\\". Fisk reacted with outrage ; Reporters sans Frontieres condemned Malkovich's comments, but Jayasekera dismissed them as \\"flippant\\" in an article for the Index website.http://rohanjayarchive.tumblr.com/post/26483243057/berating-john- malkovich \\"You can cry wolf once too often over unrealistic threats\\", Jayasekera wrote. \\"It undermines the case for real action when real and present dangers to journalists raise their heads.\\" He added: :Over the years since (the Rwanda genocide), and not without criticism, Index on Censorship has turned to reporting the areas where the right to free speech conflicts with these other rights. Index on Censorship is a journalistic enterprise, not a campaigning agency. This has freed it to make judgement calls ‚Äì some say to equivocate ‚Äì on when and where and how and why the freely expressed word can be a direct threat to other human rights. The fundraising event went ahead in December 2002 despite a street protest outside the ICA. Index on Censorship has since changed its strategy to include a number of successful advocacy campaigns in the UK and abroad. ===Theo van Gogh=== Jayasekera spent much of 2003 and 2004 in Iraq working on Index on Censorship's \\"local media rights support\\" projects in Baghdad, but in late 2004 he was again involved in controversy after writing an online article that to many readers seemed to condone or justify the murder of the Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh. The article claimed that van Gogh was a \\"free-speech fundamentalist\\" who had been on a \\"martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities\\" in an \\"abuse of his right to free speech\\". Describing van Gogh's film Submission as \\"furiously provocative\\", Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as: :A sensational climax to a lifetime's public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of Pim Fortuyn's life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo!

He worked with several artists before joining the Shadows, including Bournemouth band the Interns (nowadays sometimes confused with Welsh band the Interns, who were based in London at this time signed with Tito Burns Agency; in fact, they were two different bands), the Flintstones and a stint as part of Zoot Money's early backing band. He also played in the bands recruited to back such visiting artists as the Everly Brothers and Tommy Roe. Stylistically, Rostill combined the solidity of Brian Locking and the adventurousness of Jet Harris. Many of his bass lines were heavily syncopated and he developed a range of new sounds on the Burns bass during his time with the group, a longer period than Harris and Locking put together. To many players, Rostill was ahead of his time and included double-stopping in his technique. Unusually for that time, Rostill sometimes played bass finger-style as well as with a plectrum, depending on the sound he wanted. After the Shadows' break-up at the end of the 1960s, Rostill toured with Tom Jones. Although he was not involved in the Marvin, Welch & Farrar project ‚Äì he was with Tom Jones at the time (1970‚Äì72) ‚Äì he had no plans to reunite with the Shadows as he wanted to continue working with Tom Jones and focus on composing. Rostill was a prolific songwriter, contributing to the Shadows' output from the start (both as a solo composer and as part of the mid-sixties \\"Marvin/Welch/Bennett/Rostill\\" team). This combination composed the hits \\"The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt\\" (a UK no. 5, 1964) and ‚ÄúGenie with the Light Brown Lamp\\" (UK no. 17, 1965) as well as all the tunes on the 1964 Rhythm & Greens EP. They also wrote the Cliff Richard and the Shadows hits, \\"I Could Easily Fall (In Love with You)\\" (UK no. 6, 1964), \\"Time Drags By\\" (UK no. 10, 1966) and \\"In the Country\\" (UK no. 6, 1967). He later went on to write for other artists such as Elvis Presley and Olivia Newton- John (\\"Let Me Be There\\" (US no. 6, 1973), \\"If You Love Me, Let Me Know\\" (US no. 5, 1974) and \\"Please Mr. Please\\" (US no. 3, 1975), the last co-written with Bruce Welch). As a Shadow, Rostill played a prototype Burns \\"Shadows\\" bass guitar which differed from the production model that followed. A replica of his bass was produced by Burns London in late 2006. His personal favourite instrument was a Fender Jazz bass, which he played in both the Terry Young Band and in Bournemouth band, the Interns. He also used it with the Shadows towards the end when the Burns instrument began to wear out. John Rostill died in Radlett, Hertfordshire, England, on 26 November 1973 aged 31. He was found dead from barbiturate poisoning in his recording studio by his wife and Bruce Welch. The coroner recorded a \\"verdict of suicide while in a depressed state of mind\\". He was survived by his wife Margaret and his son Paul, who was a year old when his father died. ===Early career=== ;1963 ‚Äì Zoot Money Quartet *Zoot Money (keyboards); Andy Summers (guitar); Jimmy Shipstone (guitar); John Rostill (bass); Colin Allen (drums) ;1964 ‚Äì The Interns ==Discography== *1969: Tom Jones Live in Las Vegas *1971: \\"Green Apples\\"/\\"Funny Old World\\" ‚Äì Columbia ‚Äì DB 8794. ==Filmography== *Wonderful Life (US title: Swingers' ParadiseOverview for Swingers' Paradise (1965)\\", Turner Classic Movies page) *Finders Keepers *Rhythm 'n Greens (B-film) *Thunderbirds are Go (as puppets) ==Pantomimes== *Aladdin (appeared with Cliff Richard) *Cinderella (appeared with Cliff Richard) ==Bibliography== *Funny Old World by Rob Bradford. ==References== Category:English guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:English bass guitarists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:1942 births Category:1973 deaths Category:20th-century English musicians Category:The Shadows members Category:People from Radlett Category:20th-century bass guitarists ","title":"John Rostill"},{"id":"1274195","text":"Ten ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Pandora after the mythological Pandora.

A gun pod is a detachable pod or pack containing machine guns, autocannons or rotary cannons and ancillaries, mounted externally on a vehicle such as a military aircraft which may or may not also have its own guns. ==Description== A gun pod typically contains one or more guns, a supply of ammunition, and, if necessary, a power source. Electrically powered cannon, such as the M61 Vulcan, may be powered from the aircraft's electrical system or by a ram-air turbine. Gun pods increase a vehicle's firepower without occupying internal volume. When not required for a specific mission they can be omitted to save weight. On some vehicles they isolate delicate internal components such as radar from the weapon's recoil and gases, and for jet aircraft allow the weapons to be mounted away from the intakes of the engines, reducing problems of gun-gas ingestion, which may cause the engine to stall. When designed to be suspension-mounted on a hardpoint on a typical post-WW II aircraft, gun pods are inherently less accurate than integral guns, or the type of \\"conformal\\" gun pods that are faired smoothly into or onto the nearby surfaces of an aircraft, because the \\"hardpoint\\" mounting is necessarily less rigid, so that the weapon's recoil produces more deflection. This problem is particularly acute with powerful cannon like the 30mm GPU-5 gun pod. Both hardpoint-mounted and conformal-mount gun pods also cause substantial drag on fast-moving vehicles such as fighter aircraft. Gun pods are commonly carried on military helicopters, and are often fitted to light aircraft to equip them for counter- insurgency operations. Some air arms use gun pods for fighter bombers for use in strafing attacks. Since the Vietnam War, United States Air Force policy has been that the use of multimillion-dollar aircraft for strafing is not economically justified, but the Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, have remained proponents of strafing, and have continued to develop systems for this purpose. Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980s led to an unusual innovation in the form of the SPPU series of gun pods, which have traversable barrels allowing them to continue to fire on a fixed target as the aircraft passes overhead. Lessons learned during the Vietnam War showed the effectiveness of guns. Then expensive fighter jets such as the F-4 didn't even carry an internal cannon. Missiles (thought to be superior) -- in particular radar-guided missiles‚Äîhad notoriously poor combat track records in air-to-air combat. Engineers and air crews quickly created a solution by attaching rotary cannons in a cut-out fuel drop tank, creating an impromptu gun pod suitable for attacking ground targets. ==World War II== A Bf 109G-6 of the WW II Luftwaffe's JG 27 in Reichsverteidigung service, armed with two MG 151/20 underwing gun pods. In World War II the Third Reich's Luftwaffe made use of many different, and most often rigidly mounted, conformal and suspended-mount gun pod systems usually called Waffenbeh√§lter (prefix of WB, literally 'weapon container') or Waffentr√§ger (prefix of WT, literally 'weapon carrier'), and carrying anything from rifle caliber MG 81 machine guns, all the way up to the enormous Bordkanone anti-tank cannon based ordnance weapon series, ranging from 37 to 75mm in caliber, though the usual underwing conformal gun pods fitted to Bf 109 and Fw 190 single engined fighters used either the MG 151/20 or MK 108 in gun pod mounts. Other countries also used gun pods on their aircraft; the U.S. SBD Dauntless could be equipped with two gun pods on each wing, each with two M2 Browning machine guns. ==Common gun pods== ===US=== * GPU-2/A: Gun pod with M197 cannon. * GPU-5/A: Gun pod with GAU-13/A cannon. * M18/SUU-11/A: Gun pod with M134/GAU-2/A machine gun. * M12/SUU-16/A: Gun pod with M61A1 cannon. * M25/SUU-23/A: Gun pod with GAU-4/A cannon. ===USSR/Russia=== * GUV-8700 Gun Pod (9A624) 2 GShG 7.62mm / 9A622 and 1 Yak-B 12.7mm / 9A624 * GUV-8700 Gun Pod (9A669), similar as above, 1 9A800 (version of AGS-17 30mm automatic grenade launcher) in the same pod. * UPK-23-250 Gun Pod GSh-23L twin barreled 23mm * SPPU-22 Depressible Gun Pod GSh-23L twin barreled 23mm * SPPU-6 Fully Mobile Gun Pod GSh-6-23 six barreled 23mm * SPPU-687 Depressible Gun Pod (9A-4273) GSh-30-1 high velocity 30mm (prototype) ==External links== Category:Aircraft guns ","title":"Gun pod"},{"id":"1274206","text":"Cold hardening is the physiological and biochemical process by which an organism prepares for cold weather. ==Plants== Plant covered in snow after an ice storm in 2013, Ontario, Canada Rosa canina whilst frost, Swabian Jura Plants in temperate and polar regions adapt to winter and sub zero temperatures by relocating nutrients from leaves and shoots to storage organs. Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases. Water in and between cells in the plant freezes and expands, causing tissue damage. Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive ‚àí5 ¬∞C, while an acclimatized individual in the same species can survive ‚àí30¬∞C. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity. Schematic of typical plant cell When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on arabidopsis show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in alfalfa and arabidopsis. The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than a root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of reactive oxygen species and excitation of photosystem 2, which influences low- temp signal transduction mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation. Cold increases cell membrane permeability and makes the cell shrink, as water is drawn out when ice is formed in the extracellular matrix between cells. To retain the surface area of the cell membrane so it will be able to regain its former volume when temperature rises again, the plant forms more and stronger Hechtian strands. These are tubelike structures that connect the protoplast with the cell wall. When the intracellular water freezes, the cell will expand, and without cold hardening the cell would rupture. To protect the cell membrane from expansion induced damage, the plant cell changes the proportions of almost all lipids in the cell membrane, and increases the amount of total soluble protein and other cryoprotecting molecules, like sugar and proline. Chilling injury occurs at 0‚Äì10 degrees Celsius, as a result of membrane damage, metabolic changes, and toxic buildup. Symptoms include wilting, water soaking, necrosis, chlorosis, ion leakage, and decreased growth. Freezing injury may occur at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. Symptoms of extracellular freezing include structural damage, dehydration, and necrosis. If intracellular freezing occurs, it will lead to death. Freezing injury is a result of lost permeability, plasmolysis, and post-thaw cell bursting. When spring comes, or during a mild spell in winter, plants de-harden, and if the temperature is warm for long enough ‚Äì their growth resumes. ==Insects== Cold hardening has also been observed in insects such as the fruit fly and diamondback moth. The insects use rapid cold hardening to protect against cold shock during overwintering periods. Overwintering insects stay awake and active through the winter while non- overwintering insects migrate or die. Rapid cold hardening can be experienced during short periods of undesirable temperatures, such as cold shock in environment temperature, as well as the common cold months. The buildup of cryoprotective compounds is the reason that insects can experience cold hardening. Glycerol is a cryoprotective substance found within these insects capable of overwintering. Through testing, glycerol requires interactions with other cell components within the insect in order to decrease the body's permeability to the cold. When an insect is exposed to these cold temperatures, glycerol rapidly accumulates. Glycerol is known as a non-ionic kosmotrope forming powerful hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The hydrogen bonds in the glycerol compound compete with the weaker bonds between the water molecules causing an interruption in the makeup of ice formation. This chemistry found within the glycerol compound and reaction between water has been used as an antifreeze in the past, and can be seen here when concerning cold hardening. Proteins also play a large role in the cryoprotective compounds that increase ability to survive the cold hardening process and environmental change. Glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) has been a key protein found during testing to increase in comparison to a controlled group not experiencing the cold hardening. Once warmer temperatures are observed the process of acclimation begins, and the increased glycerol along with other cryoprotective compounds and proteins are also reversed. There is a rapid cold hardening capacity found within certain insects that suggests not all insects can survive a long period of overwintering. Non-diapausing insects can sustain brief temperature shocks but often have a limit to which they can handle before the body can no longer produce enough cryoprotective components. The common fruit fly Inclusive to the cold hardening process being beneficial for insects survival during cold temperatures, it also helps improve the organisms performance. Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is one of the fastest cold temperature responses recorded. This process allows an insect to instantly adapt to the severe weather change without compromising function. The Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) is a frequently experimented insect involving cold hardening. A proven example of RCH enhancing organisms performance comes from courting and mating within the fruit fly. It has been tested that the fruit fly mated more frequently once RCH has commenced in relation to a controlled insect group not experiencing RCH. Most insects experiencing extended cold periods are observed to modify the membrane lipids within the body. Desaturation of fatty acids are the most commonly seen modification to the membrane. When the fruit fly was observed under the stressful climate the survival rate increased in comparison to the fly prior to cold hardening. The diamondback moth In addition to testing on the common fruit fly, Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) also has been widely studied for its significance in cold hardening. While this insect also shows an increase in glycerol and similar cryoprotective compounds, it also shows an increase in polyols. These compounds are specifically linked to cryoprotective compounds designed to withstand cold hardening. The polyol compound is freeze- susceptible and freeze tolerant. Polyols simply act as a barrier within the insect body by preventing intracellular freezing by restricting the extracellular freezing likely to happen in overwintering periods. During the larvae stage of the diamondback moth, the significance of glycerol was tested again for validity. The lab injected the larvae with added glycerol and in turn proved that glycerol is a major factor in survival rate when cold hardening. The cold tolerance is directly proportional to the buildup of glycerol during cold hardening. Cold hardening of insects improves the survival rate of the species and improves function. Once environmental temperature begins to warm up above freezing, the cold hardening process is reversed and the glycerol and cryprotective compounds decrease within the body. This also reverts the function of the insect to pre-cold hardening activity. == See also == *Antifreeze protein *Cryobiology *Cryopreservation *Overwintering *Hibernation ==References== Category:Physiology Category:Plant physiology Category:Cryobiology ","title":"Cold hardening"},{"id":"1274207","text":"CGL may refer to: *Carrier Grade Linux *Catalyst Game Labs *Core OpenGL: Apple Computer's Macintosh Quartz windowing system interface to the Mac OS X implementation of the OpenGL specification *Conway's Game of Life *Chronic granulocytic leukemia, also known as Chronic myelogenous leukemia *Confederazione Generale del Lavoro *Commercial General Liability, a common type of liability insurance *CGL (charity) ","title":"CGL"},{"id":"1274215","text":"Fritz Muliar, born as Friedrich Ludwig Stand (December 12, 1919 ‚Äì May 4, 2009), was an Austrian actor who, due to his huge popularity, is often referred to by his countrymen as Volksschauspieler. == Biography == Born in Neubau, Vienna as the stepson of a jeweller, Muliar became a cabaret artist in the late 1930s.

After the war, Muliar started his career as a stage actor. Of small build, he once said that his ambitions had never included playing parts such as that of Othello. Rather, he had always preferred comic roles and traditional Austrian fare (Johann Nestroy, Ferdinand Raimund). Muliar also excelled in imitating various accents, in particular those used by Czech and Yiddish speakers of German. In 1990, he had enormous success in Felix Mitterer's play for one person, Siberia (televised in 1991), a study in ageism about an old man who has been abandoned by his family in a retirement home and his struggle for dignity. While he also performed regularly at the Salzburg Festival in the play Jedermann (a version of Everyman), Muliar was associated with two Viennese theatres in particular: the Burgtheater (whose tenured member he was until his retirement), and the Theater in der Josefstadt, where he worked until his death in 2009. He was one of the severest critics of Claus Peymann (born 1937), director of the Burgtheater between 1986 and 1999 whose leadership polarized Austrian theatregoers by its focus on controversial playwrights such as Thomas Bernhard and Elfriede Jelinek. Musical theatre saw Muliar in the non-singing role of Frosch in Die Fledermaus. At Theater in der Josefstadt, Muliar was perhaps best known for the role of Mr. Green in Jeff Baron's Visiting Mr. Green (Besuch bei Mr Green). Muliar, Michael Dangl the theater and Jeff Baron were awarded the 2001 Kulturpreis Europa for this production, which ran for several seasons and was nationally telecast. Muliar appeared in numerous films and in some television series such as Kir Royal (alongside Franz Xaver Kroetz) and Kommissar Rex. He is best remembered beyond the boundaries of his native Vienna for playing the title role in the 13-part TV series, Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk, which was filmed in German and broadcast by the Austrian state TV (ORF) in 1972. Muliar was a committed Social Democrat who publicly supported various Austrian Social Democratic politicians during their election campaigns. He was married from 1955 to Franziska Kalmar, Austria's first television presenter. In January 2006 he was elected to the position of a public advisor in the Austrian state TV (ORF). He died in Vienna, aged 89. ==Awards== * Decoration for Services to the Liberation of Austria * Gold Medal for services to the City of Vienna * Medal of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation * Professor by the Republic of Austria (1975) * Merit Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (1977) * Kainz Medal for Peachum in Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera (1978) * Nestroy Ring (1984) * Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class (1984) * Gold Medal of Styria (1985) * Kammerschauspieler (\\"Chamber actor\\") (1985) * Gold Medal of Salzburg (1989) * Naming of a street in Grossenzersdorf after Fritz Muliar in 1994 * Honorary member of the Burgtheater (1995) * Honorary member of the Theater in der Josefstadt (1996) * Ring of Honour of the City of Vienna (1999) * European Culture Prize (2001) * Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver for Services to the Republic of Austria (2002) * Grand Golden Decoration for services to the province of Lower Austria (2002) * Platinum Romy for lifetime achievement (2004) * Ferdinand Raimund-Ring 2008 * Ring of honour of Grossenzersdorf == References == == External links == * * Category:1919 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Austrian male stage actors Category:Austrian male film actors Category:Austrian male television actors Category:Kabarettists Category:Jews and Judaism in Vienna Category:People from Neubau Category:People associated with Scouting Category:Scouting and Guiding in Austria Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Recipients of the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Decoration for Services to the Liberation of Austria Category:Recipients of the Grand Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria Category:Recipients of the Romy (TV award) Category:20th- century Austrian male actors ","title":"Fritz Muliar"},{"id":"1274221","text":"Licence Renewed, first published in 1981, is the first novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond.MI6 :: The Home Of James Bond 007 It was the first proper James Bond novel (not counting novelizations and a faux biography) since Kingsley Amis's Colonel Sun in 1968. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Richard Marek, a G. P. Putnam's Sons imprint. The release of Licence Renewed successfully relaunched the Bond literary franchise, being the first of 14 original novels by Gardner until his retirement in 1996. In that time frame Gardner also wrote two novelizations. ==Updating James Bond== In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) approached Gardner and asked him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. When hired to begin a new series of James Bond novels, author John Gardner was tasked with updating James Bond and his allies and transporting them into the 1980s. Updating the time frame to the 1980s, Gardner's series picks up the career of James Bond some years after the Fleming novels ended. Due to the time frame change Gardner's series suggests that Fleming's stories took place in the 1960s and 70s, rather than the 1950s and 60s. Likewise with James Bond, his companions and allies, specifically those working for the British Secret Service such as M, Bill Tanner, Miss Moneypenny, and Q are also all transported to the 1980s, although Q is rarely mentioned and is mostly substituted by Ann Reilly, a genius of gadgetry who is promptly nicknamed \\"Q'ute\\" by fellow workers as well as Bond, not long before being added to Bond's long list of romantic conquests. The novel was initially titled Meltdown during the manuscript stage. ==Plot summary== When Licence Renewed begins, M reminds Bond that the \\"00\\" section has in fact been abolished; however, M retains Bond as a troubleshooter (pun intended), telling him, \\"You'll always be 007 to me\\". Bond is assigned to investigate Dr. Anton Murik, a brilliant nuclear physicist who is thought to have been having meetings with a terrorist named Franco. Franco is identified and tracked by MI5 to a village in Scotland called Murcaldy. Since Murcaldy is outside of MI5's jurisdiction, the Director-General of MI5, Richard Duggan, requests that M send Bond to surveil Murik. Relying on information that MI5 did not have, M orders Bond to instead infiltrate Murik's castle and gain his confidence. Bond makes contact with Murik at Ascot Racecourse, where he feigns a coincidental meeting, mentioning to Murik that he is a mercenary looking for work. Later, Bond joins Murik in Scotland at Murik's behest and is hired to kill Franco, for reasons at the time unknown. Franco in turn has been tasked by Murik to kill his young ward, Lavender Peacock, because she is the true heir to the Murik fortune, which could only be proved by secret documents Murik keeps hidden in a safe within his castle. Murik's plan is to hijack six nuclear power plants around the world simultaneously with the aid of bands of terrorists supplied by Franco. To ensure that Murik can never be associated with this deal, he attempts to use Bond to assassinate Franco. Ultimately terrorists do take over six nuclear power plants, but are prevented from starting a meltdown when they are given an abort code by Bond, who they believe to be Murik. Murik is eventually defeated by Bond and Lavender before his demands can be met. ==Characters== * James Bond - agent 007 * M - head of the British Secret Intelligence Service * Bill Tanner - M's Chief of Staff * Miss Moneypenny - M's secretary * Ann Reilly aka Q'ute - Q Branch * Dr. Anton Murik: the current Laird of Murcaldy, owning the village of Murcaldy as well as most of the land surrounding it. Murik is a brilliant nuclear physicist who had been kicked out of the Atomic Energy Commission for his radical beliefs on the safety of nuclear power. Murik had claimed to have designed a nuclear reactor that was as powerful as a standard nuclear power plant, but safely disposed of the nuclear waste - a view debunked by many other nuclear physicists. To make a point to the world that the current nuclear power plants in use around the world were unsafe, Murik planned to have terrorists infiltrate six plants simultaneously and start a global meltdown. * Mary Jane Mashkin: Murik's mistress who attempts to become \\"more than friends\\" with James Bond to see if Bond was lying to Murik about being a mercenary looking for work. * Lavender Peacock: Dr. Anton Murik's ward. Unbeknownst to her, she is the true heir to the Murik family fortune. * Caber: Murik's personal bodyguard and the \\"Champion of Murcaldy\\". He especially dislikes Bond for beating him in a wrestling match in which Bond cheated to ensure victory. * Franco Oliveiro Quesocriado: an international terrorist leader wanted in most European countries as well as some in the Middle East. He aids Murik by supplying willing terrorists for his meltdown operation and additionally accepts the task of assassinating Murik's ward, Lavender. ==The Silver Beast== In Licence Renewed Bond drives a Saab 900 Turbo. For some editions of the book, the car is shown as black or red on the book cover; however, in the book the car's colour is not mentioned. It only became silver and took on the nickname the \\"Silver Beast\\" in the follow-up Gardner novel, For Special Services. The car is Bond's personal vehicle, updated at his own expense by Communication Control Systems Ltd (CCS), a real-life company (now known as Security Intelligence Technology Group) that provided author John Gardner with ideas about feasible gadgets to be used. Consequently, Gardner gave them the credit in the book and not Q Branch. With the release of Licence Renewed Saab Automobile took the opportunity to launch a Bond themed promotional campaign complete with an actual car outfitted like the one in the book (but using smoke instead of tear gas). ==Influence on future Bond films== Some key plot elements in Licence Renewed may have had some influence on subsequent Bond films; most notably Anton Murik's plot of a nuclear disaster with the aid of an infamous terrorist which was the basis of The World Is Not Enough. Other key elements from Renewed that appeared in future Bond films were Anton's cheating at horse racing, which Max Zorin did in A View to a Kill, and the obsession with weapons, not unlike Brad Whitaker in The Living Daylights. ==New 30th Anniversary reprints== To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Licence Renewed, all fourteen of John Gardner's James Bond books were republished by Orion in the UK starting in June 2011. The first five titles were released in hardback featuring their original covers. The rest of John Gardner's Bond books were released in the UK as paperbacks in 2012 as a redesigned collection. In the US, Pegasus released the first three John Gardner titles in newly-designed paperback in the autumn of 2011. The editions featured new introductions from luminaries in the world of Bond, and were followed by a complete re-issue of all 14 titles in the US. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: May 1981 Jonathan Cape. * US first hardback edition: April 1981 Richard Marek/G. P. Putnam's Sons. * UK first paperback edition: 1982 Coronet Books. * US first paperback edition: May 1982 Berkley Books. The U.S. hardcover edition sold more than 130,000 copies. Available online. ==Reviews== Poet Philip Larkin writing in The Times Literary Supplement, felt that the book had no life of its own and lacked Fleming's compelling readability. For Kingsley Amis, the book was \\"So sodding tame\\" and Gardner \\"can't write exciting stories.\\" Amis's 9 June 1981 letter to Philip Larkin. Later, Amis was to say the novel \\"was bad enough by any reasonable standard.\\" Listener crime critic Marghanita Laski, a long-time admirer of Gardner's books, said Licence Renewed \\"is competent and has its funny moments. But this fine thriller-writer can't perfectly adjust down to the simpler genre, and the world-destructive plot is a waste of Gardner, without ever really convincing as Bond.\\" Novelist Jessica Mann said in the British Book News that \\"Ian Fleming's James Bond books were never as crass as Licence Renewed. Writing for himself, Gardner is intelligent and original. In this Fleming rip-off, he reproduces Fleming's faults without their saving charms, except that he has cut down on the sex and sadism. Fleming's plots were always preposterous, but they carried a crazy, unifying conviction. Gardner's is just illogical. And how the mighty Bond is fallen; he has become a dull, dim ‚Äî too many knocks on the head in the past, perhaps? ‚Äî middle-aged man who chooses the wrong trade- names to advertise.\\" Nicholas Shrimpton, in the New Statesman, argued that Bond was best left in his own era. \\"What John Gardner has failed to realise is that the charm of Bond is as strictly related to a sense of period as that of Sherlock Holmes or Philip Marlowe. Removed from this distinctive environment, Bond is a fish out of water. The glamour shrivels, the self-indulgence becomes apologetic, and the atmosphere seems absurd.\\" Robin W. Winks said in the Library Journal that \\"Gardner lacks the sparkle of Fleming's truly original plotting and humor, and Lavender Peacock simply is not Pussy Galore. What's sound here isn't very new and what's new isn't very sound. 007's license is best left unrenewed.\\" The Globe and Mail crime fiction critic Derrick Murdoch complained that the villains were weak especially compared to Fleming's own, and that love interest Lavender Peacock is \\"a schoolgirl next to Pussy Galore.\\" Murdoch also criticized the plot saying, \\"The story line is also a bit cluttered. There's one sub-plot about an international terrorist that seems derived indirectly from Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity, and another about a stolen birthright that could come directly from Victorian melodrama. In his Liquidator series, Gardner showed that he can be much slyer, funnier and bawdier than he has allowed himself to be here. It almost seems he has approached his task too respectfully in Licence Renewed.\\" People Magazine's anonymous reviewer felt that \\"Gardner's approach is sometimes too tame ‚Äî as in the uninspiring title ‚Äî but, on the whole, it's a treat to have Bond working again. Welcome back, old friend.\\"Available online. Novelist Michael Malone commented in The New York Times that \\"in License Renewed, the whole world seems scantier and blander, as if Bond could not shake off the malaise of those intervening years when the Government abolished his license to kill and stuck him in a desk job. He has less wit, less wardrobe and less sex drive. Miss Moneypenny even has difficulty arousing him. With his mechanized swashbuckling and elegant machismo, Bond was so suited to his time, so right in that age of astronauts and Thunderbirds, perhaps he should have decided you only live once.\\" Available online. Time Magazine praised Gardner's \\"way around military hardware, neo-villainy and a plot whose absurdity even Ian Fleming might admire. In classic style, Gardner piles picaresque on bizarre: Neanderthal henchmen, a medieval castle equipped with radar, cars that repel attackers with clouds of tear gas.\\" Kirkus Reviews believed Gardner was equal to the task. \\"More tongue-in-cheek than Fleming, but mindless fun as usual: savory fluff for the curious and the old fans too.\\" Available online. ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== ==External links== * Coverage of Licence Renewed at MI6-HQ.com * Overview of Licence Renewed at CommandBond.net Category:1981 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:Novels by John Gardner (British writer) Category:Novels set in France Category:Novels set in Scotland ","title":"Licence Renewed"},{"id":"1274226","text":"G√©rald Larose (17/12/2009) G√©rald Larose (born October 24, 1945) is a Quebec activist, professor, and former President of the Conf√©d√©ration des syndicats nationaux labour union.

The southern locales include the Sun Belt and Hawaii in the United States, as well as Mexico and the Caribbean. Snowbirds used to primarily be retired or older, but are increasingly of all ages. Conversely, a sunbird is one who leaves warmer locales in the summer, migrating to cooler locales such as higher elevations or more northerly regions. == Profile == Snowbirds are typically retirees who wish to avoid the snow and cold temperatures of northern winter, but maintain ties with family and friends by staying there the rest of the year. In recent years, younger people with jobs tied to seasonal tourists often migrate southward, following the tourist season to southern resorts. Some are also business owners who have a second home in a warmer location or whose business can be easily moved from place to place. Many families in the United States often spend their Christmas holiday time (up to 2 weeks) at beach resorts in Florida, California, and Hawaii. \\"Snowbirds descend on region,\\" a news article by Anne Mitchell published in the Nov 8, 1999, edition of the Fort Myers, Fla., News Press, page F12, especially \\"The winter snowbird season also coincides with a rise in tourism. ... The parking lot at Fleamasters flea market provides a useful barometer.\\" Some are people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder who wish to enjoy the longer daylight hours in the southern latitudes in winter. Some snowbirds bring their homes with them, as campers (mounted on bus or truck frames) or as boats following the East Coast Intracoastal waterway southward. == RVers == A significant portion of the snowbird community is made up of recreational vehicle users (RVers). Many own a motorhome for the sole purpose of traveling south in the winter. Often they go to the same location every year and consider the other RVers that do the same a \\"second family\\". Many RV parks label themselves \\"snowbird friendly\\" and get the majority of their income from the influx of RVing snowbirds. Several areas in Florida and Arizona have large RV communities that appear and disappear seasonally. Quartzsite, Arizona, has been labeled \\"white city\\", because from a bird's-eye view all the motorhomes cover the landscape in white and then in the summer are gone. While historically Florida and Arizona have been the top RV snowbird locations, other southern U.S. states are experiencing a boom from snowbirds enjoying Desert and Tropical climates. == Legal status == Many of these \\"snowbirds\\" also use their vacation time to declare permanent residency in low- or no-tax income tax states and claim lower non-resident income taxes in their home states. Canadian snowbirds usually retain residency in Canada in order to retain health benefits. Due to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act there are now additional implications for Canadian snowbirds in the United States.http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/357362/tax+authorities/Obamacare+in+Canada In the United States, the right to vote for local office is governed by local and state law, so it may be possible to vote for local offices in both places if the locality permits nonresident voting based on property ownership. However, representation in the United States Congress is for residents as enumerated by the decennial census and voting in U.S. federal elections in more than one jurisdiction is deemed to be electoral fraud. ==See also== * Auto Train ‚Äì A popular Amtrak train route for Snowbirds during the Winter months. * Canadian Snowbird Association * Canadians of convenience * Coachella Valley ‚Äì a major destination in the desert of California for snowbirds and part-time residents from Canada and the Pacific Northwest * RV lifestyle * Seasonal human migration * \\"Snowbird\\" (song) ==References == ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Canadian Snowbird Association Website *Canadian Law Website Category:Itinerant living Category:Canada‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Canada‚ÄìCaribbean relations Category:Canada‚ÄìMexico relations Category:Canadian culture Category:Arizona culture Category:Florida culture Category:California culture Category:Nevada culture Category:Texas culture es:Emigraci√≥n golondrina ","title":"Snowbird (person)"},{"id":"1274236","text":"Zbigniew Stefan Messner (; 13 March 1929 ‚Äì 10 January 2014) was a Communist economist and politician in Poland.

He was a founder of Texas Instruments. With his wife Ida Green, he was a philanthropist who helped found the University of Texas at Dallas, Green College at the University of British Columbia, St. Mark's School of Texas, and Green College at the University of Oxford. They were also major contributors to the Cecil H. Green Library at Stanford University, the Cecil H. & Ida Green Graduate and Professional Center at the Colorado School of Mines, the Cecil H. & Ida Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California San Diego, the Cecil & Ida Green Building for earth sciences at MIT (designed by I.M. Pei), and the Cecil and Ida Green Tower (the headquarters of the international Society of Exploration Geophysicists in Tulsa, OK). ==Biography== Born in Whitefield, England, in 1900, Green and his family migrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada and San Francisco, United States, where he witnessed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where Green attended UBC for two years before transferring to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning both a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering in 1924. Green met Ida Flansburgh in 1923 while working on his master's thesis at the General Electric Research Center in Schenectady, New York. They were married for 60 years, until her death in 1986. In 1941, Green and his partners J. Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott and H.B. Peacock bought GSI, a geophysical exploration service. The company began to do electronics work during World War II, and in 1951, the company's name changed to Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI), and GSI became a wholly owned subsidiary of TI. Green served as vice president (1941‚Äì1951), president (1951‚Äì1955) and chairman of GSI (1955‚Äì1959). He also served as vice president and director of Texas Instruments and in 1976 was named honorary director of the company. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970. In 1978, he was given the inaugural Maurice Ewing Medal of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, its highest award. In 1979 Green and his wife were awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1985, Green received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Cecil Howard Green died in 2003 at the age of 102. == Philanthropy == The growth of TI made Green an enormously wealthy man, and he and Ida quickly set about giving his wealth away. The Greens' philanthropic efforts totalled over $200 million, and most of this money was given to education and medicine. He was given an honorary knighthood in 1991 (at age 91) by Queen Elizabeth II. One gift was the founding of the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green branch of the University of California Systemwide Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP). This branch is located at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. It was because of Green's gift that Green College, Oxford was founded in 1979. Green College merged with Templeton College in 2008 to become Green Templeton College, on the site of what was previously Green College. Some of Green's philanthropy at the University of British Columbia (UBC) was encouraged by William Carleton Gibson, a neurologist in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Both Gibson and Green referred to Gibson as \\"Cecil Green's most expensive friend\\" due to his encouragement to fund the Cecil and Ida Green Visiting Professorship and Green College, University of British Columbia.

The Canadian Encyclopedia, July 25, 2017. == Early years == Laure Waridel was born in Switzerland, in the village of Chesalles-sur-Oron just north of Lake Geneva in the Canton of Vaud. She has three sisters and a brother. When she was two, their new home was a dairy farm in Mont-Saint-Gr√©goire, Quebec, in the Mont√©r√©gie region. It was not long before Laure became aware of the shift towards industrial farming methods and the vulnerability of farm producers. As a young girl, she worked at a local organic farm, the Cadet Roussel farm in Mont-Saint-Gr√©goire, Quebec. She lives in Montreal and is the mother of two children, Colin and Alph√©e; Alph√©e was the subject of a 2012 documentary film, Alph√©e of the Stars (Alph√©e des √©toiles), by her father and Waridel's then- spouse Hugo Latulippe. Waridel is now married to Bruce Johnston. == Education == From 1990 to 1992, Waridel studied social sciences at the C√©gep Lionel- Groulx. Subsequently, she earned a degree in sociology and international development from McGill University. She completed her university studies with a communications certificate from the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al and a Master's degree in law and environmental studies from the University of Victoria in British Columbia. Waridel earned a doctorate degree at the Geneva- based Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. == Social activist == After the Earth Summit (1992) in Rio, Waridel became one of the founders of √âquiterre, a non-profit organisation based in Montreal and dedicated to promoting ecological and socially responsible choices through action, education and research. It focuses on four issues: fair trade, ecological agriculture, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, energy conservation, and ecological and socially just choices. Laure Waridel was the president of √âquiterre. Her collaborators are quick to say that Waridel's considerable charm and communication skills were instrumental in getting Equiterre off the ground and in the success of the fair trade. Waridel is no longer an employee of Equiterre, but continues as its most public representative. She remains with the non-profit organization today as a consultant. In 2002, she was named by Maclean's Magazine as one of 25 Canadian personalities who are making a difference. Waridel defended Gil Courtemanche's novel Un dimanche √† la piscine √† Kigali in the French version of Canada Reads, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004. This novel eventually won the competition. In 2012, she was made a member of the Order of Canada \\"for her contributions as a writer, commentator and social activist on environmental issues, notably as co-founder of √âquiterre\\". In 2016, she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. ==Works== * L'envers de l'assiette (1998, 2003) * Une cause caf√© (1997) * Coffee with Pleasure (2001) * Acheter c'est voter (2005) ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian environmentalists Category:Canadian non-fiction writers Category:Canadian women non-fiction writers Category:Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al alumni Category:Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies alumni Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Knights of the National Order of Quebec Category:Swiss emigrants to Canada ","title":"Laure Waridel"},{"id":"1274245","text":"The genera of plants within the tribe Stapelieae are all to varying degrees stem succulents. Many of the species resemble cacti, though are not closely related, as an example of convergent evolution. The stems are often angular, mostly four-angled in cross-section, but in some species there are six or more, with some species of Hoodia having more than thirty angles. In size they vary from less than 2.5 cm/1\\" in length to over 2 m/6\\" tall. The leaves are in most species reduced to rudiments, sometimes hardened and thorn-like, arranged on bumps or tubercles on the angles. Some species, however, still have recognisable leaves, most notably the Indian species Frerea indica, and some members of Tridentea. Stapeliads are most abundant in warm, dry climates. In Africa, there are two separate regions where Stapeliads have most diversified: northeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Several species are endemic to the small island of Socotra off the Horn of Africa. The Arabian Peninsula, and most specifically the country of Yemen, contain another concentration of species. Several more are found in the drier parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. A single species, Caralluma europea is found in Europe, in the very southern part of the Iberian peninsula. Stapeliads are often regarded as a climax group within the family because of their often structurally complex flowers. Certain aspects of these reproductive parts mirror the pollination systems in the Orchid family and represent a case of parallel evolution though both groups are quite unrelated and have developed similar, though not identical means to achieve the ultimate goal of pollination and therefore reproduction. Most stapeliads use flies as pollinators, that are attracted to odours resembling dung or rotting meat, emanating from the flowers. Many of the flowers also bear some physical resemblance to rotting animal carcasses, leading to their popular name of Carrion Flowers. However, not all stapeliads smell bad, or attract flies. Some species use beetles, bees, wasps, butterflies or moths as pollinators. Stapeliad flowers range in size from mere millimetres in species of Echidnopsis and Pseudolithos to those of Stapelia gigantea that can reach 40 cm/16\\" in diameter, and are some the largest of flowers to be found on any species of succulent. ==List of genera== * Angolluma * Baynesia * Caralluma * Desmidorchis * Duvalia * Echidnopsis * Edithcolea * Frerea * Hoodia * Huernia * Huerniopsis * Larryleachia * Notechidnopsis * Orbea * Orbeopsis * Piaranthus * Pachycymbium * Pectinaria * Pseudolithos * Pseudopectinaria * Quaqua * Rhytidocaulon * Stapelia * Stapelianthus * Stapeliopsis * Tavaresia * Tridentea * Tromotriche * Whitesloanea ==References== * and Category:Asclepiadoideae Category:Asterid tribes ","title":"Stapelieae"},{"id":"1274248","text":"Islam is the second religion in Ethiopia, with 34% of the people professing the religion. == Introduction == A mosque in Jimma.Islam was in 2007 the second largest religion in Ethiopia with over 33.9% of the population.2007 Ethiopian census, first draft, Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency, p.17 (accessed 6 May 2009) The faith arrived in Ethiopia at an early date, shortly before the hijira.J. Spencer Trimingham. 1952. Islam in Ethiopia. Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, p. 44 Ethiopia was the first foreign country to accept Islam when it was unknown in most parts of the world. Ethiopia also favored its expansion and making Islam present in the country since the times of Muhammad(571-632). Islam and Christianity are the two major religions and have co-existed for hundreds of years. This is in part by Islam in Ethiopia is interrelated with international religious institutions, associations, and networks, resulting in the decline of Islam in the country. ==History== Many diverse forms of Islam are practised in Ethiopia. Muslims arrived in the Axumite Empire during the Hijarat as early disciples from Mecca, persecuted by the ruling Quraysh tribe. They were received by the Christian ruler of Axum, whom Arabic tradition has named Ashama ibn Abjar (King Armah in Ge'Ez and Amharic), and he settled them in Negash. Located in the Tigray Region. On the other hand, the principal center of Islamic culture, learning, and propagation has been Wello. The Quraysh sent emissaries to bring them back to Arabia, but the King of Axum refused their demands. The Prophet himself instructed his followers who came to the Axumite empire, to respect and protect Axum as well as live in peace with the native Christians. While the city of Medina, north of Mecca, ultimately became the new home of most of the exiles from Mecca, a 7th-century cemetery excavated inside the boundaries of Negash shows the Muslim community survived their departure.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 43. The period of Fasilides (r.1632-1667) gave Muslims a good opportunity to expand their religion throughout the country. Emperor Yohannis (r.1667-1682) created a council of Muslims to establish their own quarters in Addis Alem, far from the Christians in the political commercial capital, Gondar town. Muslims were able to have their own space and the population of Muslims increased because of wider urbanization. Islam and Christianity have had their conflicts within the country, from the birth of Islam into the 16th century Christians dominated the borderlands where Islam was more prominent. This brought about the settlement of Islam to Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. In the Dahlak islands, the first Muslims resided in the 8th century until the 10th century where Islam spread along the Red Sea and Islam was restricted to norther Ethiopia because Christianity was already more dominant in the rest of the country. The port of Zeila allowed Islam to enter through the eastern and central parts of Ethiopia where Christianity had not reached yet. During the 19th century, Emperor Tewodros II (r.1855-1868) demanded that his Muslim subjects convert to Christianity or leave his empire. Some Muslims converted due to coercion and those who didn't moved to the western parts of the Gojjam near Sudan where they continued practicing Islam. Emperor Tewodros II successor, Emperor Yohannes IV (r.1872-1889) continued to coerce Muslims into converting to achieve religious uniformity by ordering them to be baptized within three years. A traditional home in Harar with a niche adorned with Islamic calligraphy. Islam developed more rapidly in the eastern part of the Horn region, particularly among the Somali and Harari. This was challenged by the mostly Christian northern people of Abyssinia, including Amhara, Tigray and north western Oromo. However the north and northeastern expansion of the Oromo, who practiced mainstream traditional Waaqa, affected the growth of Islam in its early days. Historian Ulrich Braukamper says, \\"the expansion of the non-Muslim Oromo people during subsequent centuries mostly eliminated Islam in those areas.\\" However, following the centralization of some Oromo communities, some of them adopted Islam and today constitutes over 68% of their population.Ulrich Braukamper, Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia (2003) In the 16th century, Muslims from the Adal Sultanate embarked on a Conquest of Abyssinia (Futuh al- Habash) under the command of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (referred to as Gragn Mohammed or \\"Mohammed the left-handed\\" in Amharic). Under the former Emperor Haile Selassie, Muslim communities could bring matters of personal and family law and inheritance before Islamic courts; many did so and probably continued to do so under the revolutionary regime. However, many Muslims dealt with such matters in terms of customary law. For example, the Somali and other pastoralists tended not to follow the requirement that daughters inherit half as much property as sons, particularly when livestock was at issue. In parts of Eritrea, the tendency to treat land as the corporate property of a descent group (lineage or clan) precluded following the Islamic principle of division of property among one's heirs. ===The First Hijrah=== A mosque in Mekelle. When Mohammed saw the persecution to which his followers were subjected to in Mecca, he told them to find safe haven in northern Ethiopia, Abyssinia, where they would \\"find a king there who does not wrong anyone.\\" It was the first hijra (migration) in Islam history.the first hijrah to Abyssinia The persecution his followers suffered was due to polytheists who harmed the weaker Muslims and blackmailed richer Muslims, causing a severe decline in business. The abuse the Muslims endured eventually led people to convert while others held their Islamic beliefs. Abdullah ibn Masud was a new convert and participated in a Muslim group where a member suggested to recite the Qur‚Äôan in Masjid al-Haram because the people of the Quraysh never heard it before. Abdullah agreed to do so and the polytheists were amazed they pounded on him until he bled to prevent the verses from affecting them. Subsequently, because of the threats early Muslims suffered the verses from An-Nahl were revealed. According to historians, these verses were specifically sent as instructions for the migration to Abyssinia. The threats by the polytheists were so harsh it prompted the Prophet to save his people and have them migrate to Abyssinia to escape the harassment making it the first migration in Islam. ===The fourth holiest Muslim city=== Ethiopia is home to Harar. According to UNESCO, it is regarded as the fourth holy city of Islam. It has 82 mosques, three of which date from the 10th century, as well as 102 shrines.The fourth holiest Muslim city The city of Harar is located in Eastern Ethiopia and got its role of being an Islamic center in the 16th century AD. Harar is contained by a djugel, a wall built of local Hashi stone bonded together by mud and wood and it was able to protect the city from the invasion of the non-Muslim Oromo in 1567. Harar began to develop the characteristics of an Islamic city with the Shafi‚Äòi school in the 19th century as well as Harar serving as a conduit for the spreading of Islam in the Oromo population during a Islamization campaign under the reign of Amir Muhammad. Harar, Ethiopia The 82 mosques in Harar have served a religious and social function for society. Once a day men go and pray in the mosque while the women pray at home, though construction has begun to areas where women can pray as well. Mosques would also allow Islamic learning such as the interpretation of the Quran, the Arabic language, and the principles of Islam. == Denominations == === Sunni === Muslims in Ethiopia are predominantly Sunni. In Sunni Islam, there are four schools of thought and three of them are located in Ethiopia, the main one is held by the Shafi‚Äòi school.According to a survey by Pew, 63% of Muslims were raised under Sunni Islam and because of intra-religious switching roughly 68% of Ethiopian Muslims are Sunni, whilst 23% are non-denominational Muslims, whilst another 4% adhere to other sects.https://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds- muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity === Shia === Shia Islam is not represented in Ethiopia compared to other denominations. In fact, only 1% were raised as Shia and the number of conversions raised by one point. === Ibadism === Ibadism were allegedly seen as the most admirable Muslims to be eligible for the caliphate office and are known for being the earliest sect of Islam. They are about 500,000 Ibadis residing in North and East Africa as well as Oman and Tanzania. === Islamic Orthodox === The Orientalist notion defined Islamic Orthodoxy \\"as the point of departure that consequently measured other practices and beliefs as syncretistic or pre- Islamic.\\" J. Spencer Trimingham the author of Islam in Ethiopia examined the impacts of Islam in the country and arranged his analysis by a hierarchical typology of different forms of appropriation categorized as an \\"orthodox system.\\" Institutions of Islamic learning in Ethiopia were maintaining an Islamic Orthodoxy within the community. == Muslim Land Rights == Gojjam, Ethiopia Muslims were one of the marginalized groups that weren‚Äôt allowed access to land until the 1974 revolution. The revolution brought forth major changes to the socio-political and religious position of Ethiopian Muslims. In Gojjam, most Muslims did not have access to land, but had ways to get around it. They could rent, buy land, or enter in a crop sharing verbal agreement with the landowner. Muslims didn‚Äôt have the right to own, administer, or inherit land they simply were only allowed to live as tenants. If a verbal agreement was not an option, another way Muslims were able to acquire land was by clearing out unoccupied land and settling there, but only if they were able to offer some type of service to the balebat. Muslims were marginalised in Ethiopia, but particularly in Gojjam. == Rise of Salafism == Salafism is derived from al-salaf, signifying a link back to what is known as pure and authentic Islam. The main aspect of Salafism is the emphasis on the idea that there is only one God. In Ethiopia, the concept of Salafism applies to the resistance of pilgrimages to local shrines, celebration of the Prophets birthday and other practices. Saudi Arabia is known for the rise of Salafism in Ethiopia, but the arrival of Salafism in Ethiopia is due to the Italian occupation from 1936-1941. Many Ethiopians were making their way to hajj when they were subsidized by the Italians and introducing Salafi teachings to the town of Harar, before spreading to other parts of the country. The Salafi movement began to spread in the 1990s due to the political transition in 1991 and the arrival of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The EPRDF promised a change within Ethiopia‚Äôs religious groups through decentralizing the structure of ethnic federalism to enable Salafi‚Äôs to raise their activities. During this period, a new generation of Salafi‚Äôs emerged. Salafi teachings became widespread due to organizations in Ethiopia like, World Association of Muslim Youth (WAMY). the Islamic Da'wa and Knowledge Organization, and the Awolia College. Besides the organizations the Salafi movement was led by Oromo scholars who were developing the Salafi ideology in Ethiopia. The youth became involved in the movement and began to call people to align with the obligatory practices of Islam with strict Salafi teachings. In January 2012 to August 2013, the city Addis Ababa was swarmed with protests by Muslim demonstrators because of the alleged government enforced al-Ahbash campaigns that they Muslims viewed it as an interference in religious affairs by the regime. The protests sparked concern within the regime of what looked like ‚Äúextremism,‚Äù a concept that is accredited with the Salafi movement. Within the regime, local, and international observers are claiming that Salafi ‚Äúextremists‚Äù are wanting to gain political power to turn Ethiopia into an Islamic State. Others have argued that Ethiopian Salafis are reluctant and opposed to getting involved in politics. Due to the expansion of the Salafi movement it has brought up intense debates over religious symbols and rituals, intrinsic to Ethiopian Islam. == Sharia Court == All around the world, Sharia courts are designed to question and make decisions regarding Muslim law. Sharia courts have existed in Ethiopia since the country accepted Islam and the influence of the religion in the coastal areas that is surrounding the country. The courts became officially recognized by the state in 1942 when the Proclamation for the Establishment of Khadis Courts was issued. The Proclamation defined the authority of the courts, but was repealed in 1994 by the Khadis and Naiba Councils Proclamation, providing a three set of courts: the Supreme Court of Sharia, the High Court of Sharia and the First Instance Court of Sharia each with its own judges and necessary number of Khadis. The Khadis and Naiba councils decide on any questions surrounding marriage such as divorce and guardianship of children all that must be related to Mohammedans law or all the parties are Muslim. Also, the councils decide on any questions about wills or succession given that the donor or deceased was a Muslim. Lastly, the courts decide on any questions regarding payments of the cost incurred by the aforementioned decisions. The provisions provided by the courts made the Ethiopian Muslim courts similar to ones Sudan, Nigeria and other Africa countries where Sharia courts exist to handle the personal laws of the Muslim population. In terms of gender equality, sharia law has a different approach to tackling gender equality. Islamic law contains different ways to treat women that can be applied to courts for example, divorce, partition of property, inheritance and many more. Final decisions made by the Sharia court are treated as an exception to the constitutional standard of Article 9(1), which states ‚ÄúThe Constitution is the supreme law of the land. All laws, customary practices, and decisions made by state organs or public officials inconsistent therewith, shall be null and void.‚Äù It raises a question about Ethiopia‚Äôs commitment to human rights because personal status laws, which are under Ethiopia‚Äôs jurisdiction of sharia courts are considered an area of law which discrimination on the basis of gender is established. ==Muslims in Contemporary Ethiopia== A mosque in Bahir Dar. Much as the rest of the Muslim world, the beliefs and practices of the Muslims in Ethiopia are basically the same: embodied in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. There are also Sufi brotherhoods present in Ethiopia such as the Qadiriyyah order in Wello. The most important Islamic religious practices, such as the daily ritual prayers (Salat) and fasting (Arabic ÿµŸàŸÖ, Sawm, Ethiopic ·åæ·àù, S.om or Tsom - used by Christians during their holy days as well) during the holy month of Ramadan, are observed both in urban centers as well as in rural areas, among both settled peoples and nomads. Numerous Muslims in Ethiopia perform the pilgrimage to Mecca every year. In Ethiopia's Muslim communities, as in neighboring Sudan and Somalia, many of the faithful are associated with, but not necessarily members of any specific Sufi order. Nevertheless, formal and informal attachment to Sufi practices is widespread. The emphasis seems less on the contemplative and disciplined mysticism, and more on the concentration of the spiritual powers possessed by certain founders of the orders and the leaders of local branches. Muslims in contemporary Ethiopia have become actively engaged in challenging their political marginalization through the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. They‚Äôre persistent in wanting to engage with the EPRDF‚Äôs basis of political legitimacy and challenging their forceful secularism that limits religion to the private domain. In the context of electoral politics, Muslims have become increasingly involved in voting blocs. Their demands include expanding into Western financial institutions, consolidation with other parts of the Islamic world and the right to religious expression freely. Muslims in Ethiopia are looking to redefine themselves in this new day and age after continuing being marginalized in their home country. ==See also== *First migration to Abyssinia *List of non-Arab Sahaba *Islam by country *JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n b.

He was educated at Arbuthnott Parish School. At the age of thirteen he entered King's College, University of Aberdeen, where the first prize in mathematics and physical and moral sciences fell to him. In his twenty-first year he took orders in the Scottish Episcopal Church, and was ordained to the pastoral charge of a congregation at Pittenweem, Fife, whence he removed in 1790 to Stirling. He became a frequent contributor to the Monthly Review, the Gentleman's Magazine, the Anti-Jacobin Review and the British Critic. In 1786 he declined the office of bishop of Brechin. He also wrote several articles for the third edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and on the death of the editor, Colin Macfarquhar, in 1793, was engaged to edit the remaining volumes. Among his principal contributions to this work were articles on Instinct, Theology and Metaphysics. The two supplementary volumes were mainly his own work. In 1797 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Gregory, Sir James Hall, and Dugald Stewart. He was twice chosen bishop of Dunkeld, but the opposition of Bishop Skinner, afterwards Primus of Scotland, rendered the election on both occasions ineffectual. In 1808 he was consecrated assistant and successor to the bishop of Brechin, in 1810 was preferred to the sole charge, and in 1816 was elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, in which capacity he greatly aided in the introduction of many useful reforms, in fostering a more catholic and tolerant spirit, and in cementing a firm alliance with the sister Church of England.

Such ribbons were also used to crown victorious athletes in important sports games in antiquity. It was later applied to a metal crown, generally in a circular or \\"fillet\\" shape. For example, the crown worn by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands was a diadem, as was that of a baron later (in some countries surmounted by three globes). The ancient Celts were believed to have used a thin, semioval gold plate called a mind (Old Irish) as a diadem.William Dwight Whitney, The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language.

In some societies, it may be a wreath worn around the head. The ancient Persians wore a high and erect royal tiara encircled with a diadem. Hera, queen of the Greek gods, wore a golden crown called the diadem. The Priest king of the Indus Valley Civilization wore what is probably the oldest example of a Diadem approx. 3000BC. By extension, \\"diadem\\" can be used generally for an emblem of regal power or dignity. The head regalia worn by Roman Emperors, from the time of Diocletian onwards, is described as a diadem in the original sources. It was this object that the Foederatus general Odoacer returned to Emperor Zeno (the Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire) after his expulsion of the usurper Romulus Augustus from Rome in 476 AD. ==Image gallery== File:Crown_of_Sit- Hathor_Yunet_(Senusret_II's_daughter).jpgThe diadem or crown of Princess Sit- Hathor Yunet from her tomb. 12th Dynasty Egypt 19th century BC.

His father was semi-illiterate and worked as a fruit vendor in a market of S√£o Paulo, but he was able to enroll his only child in college.Serra agarra a sua chancehttp://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT419866-2011,00.html In the early 1960s, he was a prominent member of the socio-political movement A√ß√£o Popular which opposed the conservative political system that existed at the time.See http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/jose- serra/4f8897b2a076935111000191.html Serra interrupted his studies in engineering at age 22 and left the country in 1964, after the coup that established the military government in Brazil. Serra came to the attention of the authorities having served as President of the Uni√£o Nacional dos Estudantes (UNE), (National Student Union) which opposed the existing conservative regime while he was a 4th year engineering student at the Polytechnic School at the University of S√£o Paulo. Jos√© Serra was in exile from 1964 to 1978 in Bolivia, France, Chile, and the United States. In Chile, he did his masters in Economics and taught Economics at the University of Chile (Universidad de Chile). There he also married Monica Allende (1967), then a top ballerina at the National Ballet of Chile. They had two children, Veronica (1969) and Luciano (1973). In the United States Jos√© Serra was awarded a Masters and Ph.D. in economics at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) and later spent 2 years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. On returning to Brazil after the political amnesty in 1978, Serra lectured in economics at the University of Campinas, did research for Cebrap, and wrote for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. ==Political career== In 1982 he was appointed S√£o Paulo's State Secretary for Economics and Planning under Franco Montoro's governorship, and became an influential secretary of Montoro's government. In 1986 and 1990 he was elected and then reelected to Congress. In 1994 he was elected Senator for the State of S√£o Paulo with more than 6.5 million votes. His first bid for the mayorship of the City of S√£o Paulo came in 1988 in an election won for the Worker's Party (PT) by Luiza Erundina. He ran again in 1996, resigning as Minister of Planning to participate in the election for mayor, which was won by Celso Pitta. Pitta was the designated successor of mayor Paulo Maluf, who headed the right-wing populist Progressive Party (PP). After another stint as minister in the federal government, Serra ran for president on behalf of the PSDB party in 2002. He was beaten by four- time candidate and PT founder Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva in the second round. In every elections since 1988 Serra represented the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), which he helped found in 1988 alongside former and future S√£o Paulo State governors Franco Montoro and Mario Covas and future Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, from a split in the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). PSDB was seen as a coalition of democrats, liberals and social democrats with more centrist outlook than the leftist Workers' Party (PT) of presidents Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. Both parties have great support in S√£o Paulo state, but the state has been governed by the PSDB since 1994. Serra came to political prominence under Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidency (1994‚Äì2002), when he was appointed minister of planning, and later minister of health. During Serra's tenure in the Health Ministry, the generic drug industry, which gave wider access to medicines to a poor population, and ANVISA, the Brazilian food and drug regulatory agency, were both created. All forms of tobacco advertising were banned, and cigarette packages were required to display images of smoking-related diseases. === Mayor of S√£o Paulo === Serra was elected mayor of S√£o Paulo in 2004, defeating incumbent Marta Suplicy in the second round. Serra created the Virada Cultural, a 24-hour cultural festival inspired by the French Nuit Blanche. He also established the Bilhete √önico system in the S√£o Paulo Metro subway system. Serra sought nomination as the PSDB candidate for president in the 2006 elections, but on March 14, 2006 decided to run instead for governor of the state of S√£o Paulo. He resigned as mayor of S√£o Paulo, although he had signed a pledge to finish his four-year term. Gilberto Kassab, the deputy mayor, took office and remained the mayor until 2012. Serra won the governor's race and on January 1, 2007 took office as the Governor of S√£o Paulo State.

In 2004, he was elected mayor of S√£o Paulo in a run-off election with 55% of the votes after he signed a public commitment to stay in office for the full term. Nevertheless, he resigned after 15 months to run for governor of S√£o Paulo in 2006, and was elected in the first round with almost 60% of the vote. Serra during the annual meeting of PSDB, in which he announced his pre-candidacy, 10 April 2010. Serra announced another run for the Brazilian presidency as the PSDB candidate in the 2010 elections. He received support from his party, as well as the Socialist People's Party (PPS) and the Democrats (DEM). His primary opposition in the election was Workers' Party (PT) candidate Dilma Rousseff. Serra's candidacy received support from O Estado de S. Paulo and British newspaper Financial Times. In the first-round voting October 3, 2010, an unexpectedly strong showing from Green Party candidate Marina Silva forced a second round run-off election between Serra and Rousseff on October 31, 2010, which Rousseff won 56% to 44%. On February 2012, Serra announced he would run for mayor of S√£o Paulo, which would have resulted in his second non-consecutive term, though he had left the first one before it ended. In the second round of the 2012 municipal elections he was defeated by Fernando Haddad, the Workers' Party candidate. ==See also== *List of foreign ministers in 2017 *Michel Temer *Energy in Brazil ==References== ==External links== *S√£o Paulo 2004 mayoral race pages *http://citymayors.com/mayors/saopaulo_mayor.html Profile on CityMayors.com - - - - - Category:1942 births Category:Brazilian economists Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:Brazilian people of Calabrian descent Category:Brazilian Social Democracy Party politicians Category:Candidates for President of Brazil Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Foreign ministers of Brazil Category:Government ministers of Brazil Category:Governors of S√£o Paulo (state) Category:Living people Category:Mayors of S√£o Paulo Category:People from S√£o Paulo Category:People of Calabrian descent Category:University of Campinas faculty Category:University of S√£o Paulo alumni Category:University of Chile alumni ","title":"Jos√© Serra"},{"id":"1274272","text":"Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient, born Wilhelmine Schr√∂der (6 December 180426 January 1860), was a German operatic soprano. As a singer, she combined a rare quality of tone with dramatic intensity of expression, which was as remarkable on the concert platform as in opera. == Biography == Schr√∂der was born in Hamburg, the daughter of the actress Sophie Schr√∂der and the tenor Friedrich Schr√∂der. Her first role was at the age of 15 as Aricia in Schiller's translation of Racine's Ph√®dre, and in 1821, aged 17, she was received with so much enthusiasm as Pamina in Mozart's The Magic Flute that her future career in opera was assured. Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient In 1823, she married Karl Devrient, becoming known as Wilhelmine Schr√∂der- Devrient, but separated from him in 1828. Meanwhile, she had maintained her popularity at Dresden and elsewhere. She made her first Paris appearance in 1830, and sang in London in 1833 and 1837. Richard Wagner, born in 1813, claimed to have seen her as Leonore in Fidelio when he was 16, but this is almost certainly fanciful. He did hear (and conduct) her in numerous roles after 1834, however, and continued to laud her stage artistry right up until his essay \\"On Actors and Singers\\" (1872) which is dedicated to her memory. She created several roles for Wagner ‚Äì Adriano in Rienzi, Senta in The Flying Dutchman and Venus in Tannh√§user. Had Wagner's political profile not been compromised by his involvement with the Dresden uprising in May 1849, Schr√∂der-Devrient would have created Elsa in Lohengrin which was advertised in 1849 as a forthcoming production in Dresden. In 1847 she married David Oskar von D√∂ring, an officer, but divorced him in 1848. She took part in the Revolution of 1848 and the Dresden uprising and was later imprisoned. In 1850 she married , a wealthy Livonian land owner, who was 14 years her junior. They settled first in TrikƒÅta, Latvia, relocating later to von Bock's ancestral home in Loodi (Kersel) in Estonia. She left her husband in the winter of 1858, planning to move to America; but her health began to deteriorate rapidly. She died in Coburg, Germany, on 26 January 1860. == Apocryphal memoirs == After her death, an erotic memoir in two volumes, ' (Memoirs of a Songstress), was wrongly attributed to her.\\"Schr√∂der-Devrient, Wilhelmine\\", S√§chsische Biografie == References == Attribution: * ==Further reading== * (1862).

Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 rendezvoused in orbit in 1965, but without Agena. Next, Gemini 8 successfully docked with the Agena on March 16, 1966. The Agena-Gemini rendezvous also achieved other objectives in later Gemini launches, including docked orbital maneuvering (Gemini 10 and Gemini 11), inspection of the abandoned Gemini 8 ATV (Gemini 10) and space walks (Gemini 12). ==Apollo== 1961 sketch showing 10 C-1 launches required to assemble in Earth orbit an Apollo lunar landing mission. The EOR proposal for Apollo consisted of using a series of small rockets half the size of a Saturn V to put different components of a spacecraft to go to the Moon in orbit around the Earth, then assemble them in orbit. Experiments of Project Gemini involving docking with the Agena target vehicle were designed partly to test the feasibility of this program. In the end, NASA employed the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous for the Apollo Program: a Saturn V would simultaneously lift both the Apollo Command and Lunar Modules into low Earth orbit, and then the Saturn V third stage would fire again (Trans-lunar injection) to send both spacecraft to the Moon. ==Constellation== This mode had been revived for Project Constellation as the Earth Departure Stage (EDS) and Altair (LSAM), which would be launched into low Earth orbit on the Ares V rocket. The EDS and Altair would be met by the separately launched Orion (CEV).

It is the largest river flowing into Hood Canal, a western arm of Puget Sound. From its source at the confluence of the North and South Forks the main stem Skokomish River is approximately long. The longer South Fork Skokomish River is , making the length of the whole river via its longest tributary about . The North Fork Skokomish River is approximately long.River lengths calculated in Google Earth using GNIS coordinates. A significant part of the Skokomish River's watershed is within Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park. ==Course== The Skokomish River and its two tributary forks drain the southeast corner of the Olympic Mountains, mainly in Mason County but including a portion of Jefferson County. The main stem Skokomish River is formed by the confluence of the North Fork and South Fork near small community of Mohrweis. It flows east through the broad Skokomish Valley. After being crossed by U.S. Route 101 the river turns northeast. Washington State Route 106 crosses the river near its mouth on Hood Canal. Near the towns of Union and Skokomish the Skokomish River enters Annas Bay at The Great Bend of Hood Canal from the south, where it creates a large estuary called Skokomish Flats. The lower portion of the river flows along the southern portion of the Skokomish Indian Reservation.General course info from USGS topographic maps accessed via the \\"GNIS in Google Map\\" feature of the USGS Geographic Names Information System website. The South Fork Skokomish River originates near Sundown Pass in Olympic National Park, near the sources of the Wynoochee River and Graves Creek, a tributary of the Quinault River. The South Fork flows southeast out of the national park and between Capitol Peak, on the west, and Wonder Mountain on the east. After receiving Rule Creek from the west the South Fork turns more directly south and enters a broader valley. It receives Church Creek from the west, then turns to flow southeast and east through a widening river valley. A number of tributary streams join the South Fork, including Pine Creek and Cedar Creek, from the south, and Le Bar Creek, Brown Creek, and Harp Creek from the north. The South Fork Skokomish leaves the main Olympic Mountains and enters flatter terrain, but flows through gorges for several miles. After exiting the gorges the South Fork turns east and enters the broad Skokomish Valley where it joins with the North Fork to form the main stem Skokomish River. The North Fork Skokomish River originates on the northern slopes of Mount Skokomish. It flows west into Olympic National Park. The valley of the North Fork Skokomish is used for one of the national park's main backcountry hiking trails. At the junction of Nine Stream, the river turns south, then turns southeast and receives a number of tributaries including Four Stream and Slate Creek. The river rushes over Staircase Rapids shortly upriver from Staircase Campground and the national park's Staircase Ranger Station. The Staircase area is the main entry into the southeast portion of Olympic National Park. The North Fork receives Elk Creek at the campground and Lincoln Creek shortly downstream. The river then meanders southeast into Lake Cushman, a reservoir created to supply Tacoma with electricity. The tributary Big Creek enters the lake near Lake Cushman State Park. The North Fork exits Lake Cushman's southern end and flows a short distance to another reservoir, Lake Kokanee, from which it flows south into the Skokomish Valley to join the South Fork, forming the main stem Skokomish River. Lake Cushman and Lake Kokanee are maintained by Cushman Dam No. 1 and Cushman Dam No. 2 respectively. Until recently the entire flow of the North Fork is normally diverted at Cushman Dam No. 2, except for instream flow requirements and infrequent larger releases. On January 12, 2009, Tacoma Power, the Skokomish Tribe, and state and federal agencies signed settlement agreements that resolved long-standing disputes and damage claims relating to the Cushman Hydroelectric Project. As part of the settlement water will be released into the North Fork Skokomish River below the dams in order to mimic natural flow. ==History== Prior to the construction of the Cushman Hydroelectric Project, the Skokomish River was once the largest and most productive salmon-producing river in the Hood Canal region of Puget Sound. The name \\"Skokomish\\" comes from the Twana sq ∑uq ∑√≥ îb…ô≈°, also spelled sqWuqWu'b3sH, and meaning \\"river people\\" or \\"people of the river\\".http://hood.hctc.com/~skok1/ The Skokomish Tribal Nation The Skokomish were one of the largest of the nine different Twana village communities that existed before about 1860. By their locations, the nine groups were the Dabop, Quilcene, Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hoodsport, Skokomish, Vance Creek, Tahuya, and Duhlelap communities. See also map on page 2 Within these nine communities there were at least 33 settlements. The South Fork's drainage was heavily logged, although logging has been significantly reduced in the Olympic National Forest since the late 1980s. ==Flooding== U.S. Route 101 north of Shelton flooded over by nearly four feet of floodwaters from the Skokomish River in Washington State. Photo taken December 3, 2007 at the height of the December 2007 Pacific Northwest storms. The Skokomish is the most flood-prone river in Washington State, as it is the first river to flood during any major rain event.. See also, It set an all-time record-high flood level on December 3, 2007 when an intense tropical rainstorm moved in following several inches of snow from the day prior. Its maximum discharge of per second, recorded on December 3, 2007, was more than twenty times its mean flow, and bested its previous record set on November 5, 1934 at more than per second. The floods completely ripped up Highway 101 through the Skokomish Valley, resulting in two-day closure while emergency repairs were made. The 2007 flood event prompted Mason County officials and the Washington Department of Transportation in conjunction with the Skokomish Tribe, to design and construct a newer, elevated roadway structure over the area of Purdy Creek, which is the lowest point in elevation in the valley that Highway 101 crosses. After 16 months of planning and construction, a 350-foot bridge elevated 12 feet higher than the original roadway was opened in July, 2009. One notable flood in 1996 closed U.S. Route 101 and State Route 106 for four days, stranding a KOMO TV news crew from Seattle. Typically, these floods on the Skokomish spawn scores of Seattle TV news crews and print journalists to the scene, and is not unheard of for stories of Skokomish River floods by the media to include the joke \\"Why did the salmon cross the road?\\" The combination of increased sediment load due to extensive clearcut logging, the reduced sediment carrying capacity due to the damming of the North Fork, and winter-weather rain patterns are suspected to be the primary reasons for the flooding that occurs almost every year on the South Fork. In late fall through early spring, storms often come from the southwest. These usually drop the most rain in the vicinity of the Skokomish River due to the topography of the Olympic Peninsula. Notably, the Skokomish Tribe, through the restoration of the Skokomish delta, (The Nallies Project), removed dikes surrounding Nallies Island, relieving some of the flooding in the valley. Recently on the second highest flood event recorded after the restoration, the flooding was only minor, compared with what it would have been before, moderate to severe flooding. Additionally, it is suspected that tectonic uplift of the land around the lower Skokomish River may be contributing to flooding by decreasing the gradient of the river channel, even prior to any major anthropogenic disturbances. ==See also== *List of rivers of Washington ==References== ==External links== *Salmon, Tribes, and Hydropower Dams in the U.S. Puget Sound *Cushman Hydro Project Statistics *Skokomish River Basin, USGS *Skokomish Watershed, Surf Your Watershed, EPA * Category:Rivers of Washington (state) Category:Rivers of Mason County, Washington ","title":"Skokomish River"},{"id":"1274309","text":"Direct ascent is a method of landing a spacecraft on the Moon or another planet directly, without first assembling the vehicle in Earth orbit, or carrying a separate landing vehicle into orbit around the target body. It was proposed as the first method to achieve a crewed lunar landing in the United States Apollo program, but was rejected because it would have required developing a prohibitively large launch vehicle. ==Apollo program== Artist's conception of an early Apollo spacecraft that would have used direct ascent The Apollo program was initially planned based on the assumption that direct ascent would be used. This would have required developing an enormous launch vehicle, either the Saturn C-8 or Nova rocket, to launch the three-man Apollo spacecraft, with an attached landing module, directly to the Moon, where it would land tail-first and then launch off the Moon for the return to Earth. The other two options that NASA considered required a somewhat smaller launch vehicle, either the Saturn C-4 or C-5. These were Earth Orbit Rendezvous, which would have involved at least two launches to assemble the direct-landing and return vehicle in orbit; and Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), which carried a smaller two-man lunar lander spacecraft for flight between lunar orbit and the surface. LOR was the strategy used successfully in Apollo. The Soviet Union also considered several direct ascent strategies, though in the end they settled on an approach similar to NASA's: two men in a Soyuz spacecraft with a one-man LK lander. The Soviets attempted to launch the N1 rocket on 21 February and 3 July 1969, both of which failed, before NASA's Apollo 11 lifted off and made the first crewed lunar landing on 20 July 1969. The Soviets would make two more attempts to launch the N1, in 1972 and 1974, but neither was successful. The Soviet engineering firm OKB-52 continued to develop the UR-700 modular booster for the direct ascent LK-700 ship.

He studied law in Berlin and Heidelberg, and afterwards practised in his native city. He was, however, generally more interested in politics and literature than law. He was attracted by the social democratic labour movement and after the death of Ferdinand Lassalle, in 1864, he became president of the General Working-men's Union of Germany, and in this capacity edited the Sozialdemokrat, which brought him into frequent trouble with the Prussian government. He was arrested and charged with the crime of homosexuality but key people within the Social Democrats still supported him.Detlef Grumbach, \\"Die Linke und das Laster,\\" in Detlef Grumbach ed., Die Linke und das Laster (Hamburg: M√§nnerschwarm, 1995), 21.

The village is located on the south coast of the island, and overlooks a bay in the Atlantic Ocean dominated by Kisimul Castle, as well as nearby islands such as Vatersay. Castlebay is also within the parish of Barra. The village is located on the A888, which serves as a circular road around Barra. ==Community== Castlebay is home to the majority of shops on the island. The main street forms a square with the ferry terminal and the ring road, and features several grocery shops, a bank, post office, and tourist information centre. There is a larger supermarket now to the west of the village, having opened in October 2009. There are also several hotels in the village, plus the Island's medical centre, a filling station and the police station. ===Church=== The Catholic church in Castlebay, The Church of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, was opened in 1888 on a mound overlooking the town centre. It was designed by an architect from Oban, G. Woulfe Brenan, along with a house further down the slope for the priest to reside in. The northern gable of the church features a stained glass window depicting the Crucifixion, and the southern gables depict Our Lady, Star of the Sea. Renovation works on the church were completed in early 2007. ===Education=== The Castlebay Community School (), is located on the western side of Castlebay. It is the only source of secondary education on Barra. Since 2007, the school has had responsibility for the Castlebay preschool (both the English and the Gaelic Medium),\\"Sgoil Bh√†gh a‚Äô Chaisteil\\" Castlebay Community School.

In September 2007, the school received an HMIE report heavily criticising the relationships amongst the secondary school's staff and management, but complimenting them in the primary school.Castlebay Community School (2008) (pdf) HM Inspectorate of Education. Retrieved 11 September 2008. One of the girls from this school was killed in the Ariana Grande Concert Bombing at Manchester M E N Arena ==History== Kisimul Castle is located approximately away from the ferry terminal in the centre of the bay that Castlebay overlooks. Kisimul was abandoned in 1838 when the island was sold, and the castle's condition subsequently deteriorated. Some of its stone was used as ballast for fishing vessels, and some even ended up as paving in Glasgow. The remains of the castle, along with most of the island of Barra, were purchased in 1937 by Robert Lister MacNeil, the then chief of Clan MacNeil, who made efforts at restoration. In 2001 the castle was leased by the chief of Clan MacNeil to Historic Scotland for 1,000 years for the annual sum of ¬£1 and a bottle of whisky. For the 2011 census the island was classified by the National Records of Scotland as an inhabited island that \\"had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses\\". Kisimul castle in the bay of Castlebay ==Media== Castlebay was the main setting for the 1949 Ealing Studios comedy Whisky Galore! and its 1957 sequel Rockets Galore! which were both filmed on Barra. The earlier film is based on the novel Whisky Galore by Sir Compton Mackenzie, itself a fictionalised telling of the story of the SS Politician, which ran aground with a cargo of some 50,000 cases of whisky on board in 1941. Mackenzie, who lived near the airport and died in 1972, is buried in a grave marked by a simple cross at cemetery, which is situated a little way up the hillside overlooking Eoligarry jetty.\\"Grave of Compton MacKenzie, Eolaigearraidh, Barra\\" Photograph NF 7007.

In the 2010 Channel 4 programme Dom Joly and the Black Island, Joly and Tintinologist Michael Farr identify Castlebay and Kisimul as the locations of Kiltoch and the Ben More Castle used as settings in The Adventures of Tintin comic The Black Island, although the scenes of reaching it by boat and exploring it on foot were filmed at Lochranza Castle on the Isle of Arran. In 2011, 18 episodes, series 5 and 6, of An Island Parish were screened on BBC2 documenting the arrival and subsequent experiences of a new Catholic priest on the island - Father John Paul. == Transport == Castlebay is home to the main ferry terminal, which is operated by Caledonian MacBrayne. It is known that steam ferries were plying between Castlebay and Oban in the late 1800s, but travelling conditions were poor. The first roll-on-roll-off ferry was the MV Iona in 1974, which could load broadside on, which was necessary until the 1980s, when a purpose-built bow loading ramp for vehicles was built at Castlebay, allowing much larger ferries to dock and resulted in quicker loading times. Between 1989 and 1998, travelled daily between Oban, Castlebay and Lochboisdale on the island of South Uist, sometimes stopping on the Isle of Mull. In 1998, replaced Lord of the Isles on the Oban-Castlebay-Lochboisdale run. From April 2016, the former Stornoway ferry took over the Barra route with a new dedicated service, operating seven return sailings a week between Castlebay and Oban, allowing Clansman to operate dedicated services from Oban to Coll, Tiree and Colonsay. From summer 2016, Lord of the Isles began a dedicated daily service between Mallaig and Lochboisdale, ending South Uist's link with Oban. ==Gallery== File:Castlebay and the Heaval.jpgCastlebay village and the heights of Heaval, from Vatersay File:Castlebay perspective.jpgThe Main Street Castlebay ==References== ==External links== *Canmore - Barra, Castlebay, Barra Parish Church site record *Canmore - Barra, Castlebay, Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea site record Category:Villages on Barra Category:Ports and harbours of Scotland ","title":"Castlebay"},{"id":"1274321","text":"Michel Majerus (June 9, 1967 ‚Äì November 6, 2002) was a Luxembourgish artist who combined painting with digital media in his work.

Brooks and starring Adam Sandler, T√©a Leoni, Paz Vega, and Cloris Leachman. It was released in the United States on December 17, 2004 by Columbia Pictures. The film was a box office bomb grossing $55 million worldwide on an $80 million production budget, and received mixed reviews from critics. ==Plot== Cristina Moreno (Shelbie Bruce) is applying to Princeton University. For her application essay, she tells the story of a year from her childhood, and how it shaped the person she has become today (narrated by Aimee Garcia). Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) is a poor Mexican single mother who moved to America undocumented years earlier seeking a better life for her and her daughter, Cristina. She takes on two jobs, but soon cannot maintain them, so Flor's cousin helps her find work as a nanny and housekeeper for the Clasky family, consisting of John (Adam Sandler) and Deborah (T√©a Leoni), their children Bernice (Sarah Steele) and Georgie (Ian Hyland), and Deborah's mother Evelyn Wright (Cloris Leachman). John is a successful chef and an easygoing man who enjoys cooking and spending time with his children, while Deborah is a former businesswoman turned stay-at-home mother, and Evelyn is quietly alcoholic. Deborah is uptight and her neurotic behavior often upsets the family - Deborah psychologically abuses her daughter, body-shaming Bernice by forcing her to exercise, buying her smaller-sized clothes and putting her down for certain behaviors; she frustrates John by expecting him to be submissive and accepting of her parenting style with Georgie. John is more laid back and supports the mental well-being of his children, but feels he cannot stand up to Deborah. Soon, Flor is needed to work and live at the Claskys' summer rental home on the beach. Desperate to keep Flor employed with them, Deborah invites Cristina to stay with them. Deborah becomes attached to the beautiful and personable Cristina, who informally translates for Flor, and begins to treat her more like a daughter than she does Bernice. The attention Deborah pays Cristina does not go unnoticed by Flor, who does not approve. Needing to get materials for a project that he is working on, John gives the children a small task, in which they will receive money in exchange for pieces of glass they collect from the beach. Cristina takes the task seriously and ends up receiving $640 for her collection. When Flor learns of this, she is overwhelmed and angry at the large sum of money given to her daughter. Flor and John argue, with Cristina as the interpreter, and Flor wants to leave because of the awkward family dynamic. John coaxes her into staying, much to Cristina's delight, and Flor begins to learn English so she can better communicate with the Claskys. When John‚Äôs restaurant receives a highly laudatory, star-making review, John falls into a temporary depression because of the related stress, while Deborah begins an affair. Deborah enrolls Cristina in a private school with Bernice, upsetting Flor, who wants Cristina to keep in touch with her Mexican roots and working-class values. Flor feels that her employer is overstepping her bounds and voices her objection to John, who tells her he is also frustrated with Deborah because Bernice has no support system from her own mother. Flor tries to encourage Bernice and build her self-confidence, by showing her small acts of kindness, especially after Deborah has been hard on her. Summer ends and Cristina and Bernice attend their first day of school together. That afternoon, Cristina is allowed to bring her school friends back to the Claskys' house; however, Bernice is not. Flor, who had not given permission for this, is upset at the situation and Deborah tries to cover for Cristina. The now-sober Evelyn realizes that her daughter is having an affair and that her marriage is in trouble. She pleads with Deborah to end the affair, telling her she will never get another man as good as John. Deborah confesses to John that she cheated on him and begs him to stay so that they can work things out; however, a dejected John walks out and bumps into Flor. He gives her a ride to the bus stop, during which she informs him she is quitting, and the pair go to his restaurant, where he cooks for Flor. They kiss and have a genuine and deep conversation, realize they cannot have a relationship. A desperate Deborah continuously tries to contact John and confides in Evelyn, telling her mother that Evelyn‚Äôs failings as a parent caused Deborah to become the person that she is. The two have a frank conversation during which they become closer as mother and daughter. The next day, Flor comes to take her daughter home and informs her that she quit her job, which angers Cristina, who got along well with the Claskys. As they are about to leave, John tells Flor he envies whoever will get to be with her in the future. On their way home, Flor tells Cristina that she cannot attend the private school anymore, upsetting Cristina even more. She screams in the street, accusing Flor of ruining her life. Flor loses patience with Cristina after she asks her mother for \\"space\\", and explains to her daughter it is time she answers an important question: \\"Is what you want for yourself to become someone very different than me?\\" Cristina considers this on their bus ride home, and they make up and embrace. ==Cast== * Adam Sandler as John Clasky * Paz Vega as Flor Moreno * T√©a Leoni as Deborah Clasky * Cloris Leachman as Evelyn Wright * Aimee Garcia as the narrator (Adult Cristina Moreno) ** Shelbie Bruce as 12-year-old Cristina ** Victoria Luna as 6-year-old Cristina * Sarah Steele as Bernice \\"Bernie\\" Clasky * Ian Hyland as George \\"Georgie\\" Clasky * Jake Pennington as Young George * Cecilia Su√°rez as Monica * Thomas Haden Church as Mike the Realtor * Antonio Mu√±oz as Mexican at Family Dinner * Sarah Hyland as Girl at Sleepover ==Production== Brooks cast Sandler after seeing his more dramatic performance in Punch-Drunk Love. Vega could not speak English when filming began and a translator was on set during filming so that she could communicate with the director. Leachman replaced Anne Bancroft, who dropped out of the part after four weeks of shooting because of illness. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Based on 168 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 53% of critics gave Spanglish a positive review, with an average rating of 5.93/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"Paz Vega shines, and Adam Sandler gives a performance of thoughtfulness and depth, but Spanglish is ultimately undermined by sitcommy plotting and unearned uplift.\\" Its proponents claim it is a moving portrayal of the difficulty of family problems and self-identity (and perhaps to a lesser extent the difficulties and rewards of cross-cultural communication). Advocates of the film found the intense sexual chemistry between Leoni and Sandler particularly compelling. Some critics described the film as \\"uneven\\", \\"awkward\\" (where John and Flor attempt to bare their souls to one another...[with] lots of words coming out of their mouths, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a context)\\", and \\"The supporting performers deserve better, especially ... Cloris Leachman, who's consigned to a demeaning role...[and] the butt of rather mean-spirited jokes.\\" ===Accolades=== Hans Zimmer was nominated for Best Original Score at the 62nd Golden Globe Awards and Cloris Leachman was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role at the 11th Screen Actors Guild Awards. ==See also== *Spanglish ==References* * * Category:2004 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Spanish- language films Category:2004 romantic comedy-drama films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer Category:Films about language and translation Category:Films directed by James L.

To accomplish this, the University has increased the number of agreements it has with foreign universities in recent years, which in turn has resulted in an increment of incoming and outgoing students and exchanges of faculty and researchers. The UMH is continuously interested in fostering its international relations and expanding its number of foreign partners. The UMH organizes language courses in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish as a foreign language. In fact, interested students can take the DELE examination, the Diploma de Espa√±ol como Lengua Extranjera (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language), at the UMH, which is a certification from the Cervantes Institute with international recognition. ==References== ==External links== * Universidad Miguel Hern√°ndez * Universidad Miguel Hern√°ndez (English) Category:Universities in the Valencian Community Category:Educational institutions established in 1997 Category:Elche ","title":"Miguel Hern√°ndez University of Elche"},{"id":"1274331","text":" USS Preston (DD‚Äì19) was a in the United States Navy during World War I.

He was responsible for the organizing of the world's first credit unions. He was also co-founder of the German Progress Party. ==Biography== Schulze-Delitzsch was born at Delitzsch, in Saxony. He studied law at Leipzig and Halle universities and, when thirty, he became an assessor in the court of justice at Berlin. Three years later he was appointed patrimonial-richter at Delitzsch. Entering the parliament of 1848, he joined the Left Centre. At this time, his surname was expanded from Schulze to Schulze-Delitzsch: the name of his birthplace was appended to his surname to distinguish him from other Schulzes in the Prussian National Assembly. Acting as president of the commission of inquiry into the condition of the labourers and artisans, he became impressed with the necessity of co-operation to enable the smaller trades-people to hold their own against the capitalists.. He was a member of the Second Chamber in 1848-1849; but as matters ceased to run smoothly between himself and the high legal officials, he gave up his public appointments in October 1851, and withdrew to Delitzsch. Here he devoted himself to the organization and development of co-operation in Germany, and to the foundation of Vorschussvereine (peoples' banks), of which he had established the first at Delitzsch in 1850. These developed so rapidly that Schulze-Delitzsch in 1858, in Die arbeitenden Klassen und das Assoziationswesen in Deutschland, enumerated twenty-five as already in existence. In these banks, the subscribers made small deposits, obtaining proportional credit and dividends. The management was vested in a board composed of subscribers.. In 1859 the more than 200 such banks were centrally organized under the direction of Schulze-Delitzsch. He promoted the first Genossenschaftstag, a co-operative meeting, in Weimar, and founded a central bureau of co-operative societies. In 1861 he again entered the Prussian Chamber, and became a prominent member of the Progressist party. In 1863 he devoted the chief portion of a testimonial, amounting to $1,165,567.43 in today's money, to the maintenance of his co-operative institutions and offices. This, however, was only to meet an exceptional outlay, for he always insisted that they must be self-supporting. The next three or four years were given to the formation of local centres, and the establishment of the Deutsche Genossenschafts-Bank, 1865. The spread of these organizations naturally led to legislation on the subject, and this too was chiefly the work of Schulze- Delitzsch. As a member of the Chamber in 1867 he was mainly instrumental in passing the Prussian law of association, which was extended to the North German Confederation in 1868, and later to the empire. Schulze-Delitzsch also contributed to uniformity of legislation throughout the states of Germany, in 1869, by the publication of Die Gesetzgebung √ºber die privatrechtliche Stellung der Erwerbs- und Wirthschaftsgenossenschaften, etc. With the legislation in place, his life's work was complete; he had placed the advantages of capital and co-operation within the reach of struggling tradesmen throughout Germany. His remaining years were spent in consolidating this work. He endeavored to accustom the people to rely upon their own initiative to improve their condition, and declared that the function of the state should be limited to assuring industrial and personal liberty. Both as a writer and a member of the Reichstag his industry was incessant, and he died in harness on 29 April 1883 at Potsdam, leaving the reputation of a benefactor to the smaller tradesmen and artisans, in which light he must be regarded rather than as the founder of true co-operative principles in Germany. At the time of his death, there were in Germany alone 3,500 co-operative banking branches with more than $100,000,000 in deposits, while the system had been extended to Austria, Italy, Belgium and Russia. His work was noteworthy enough to attain mention in Leo Tolstoy's novel, Anna Karenina. ==Gallery== File:DBPSL 1958 438 Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch.jpgStamp commemorating Schulze- Delitzsch's 150th birthday.

The municipality has a land area of 25.25 square miles which constitutes 3.41% of Laguna's total area. According to the , it has a population of people. Situated at southeast of Manila, via Calamba and Los Ba√±os. The town got its name from the term kalawang, which means rust. Folklore has it that the town got its name when the Spanish started construction of the Municipal Church and water seeped in from the holes dug into the ground for the Church's foundation. The water was colored brown and rusty in character hence the name Calauan (Kalawang). Calauan is known for the Pineapple Festival, which is celebrated every 15 May. The patron saint of Calauan is Isidore the Laborer, the patron of farmers, known in Spanish as San Isidro Labrador. Calauan's population is expected to rise, as the town is being used as resettlement of informal settlers in Metro Manila through the Bayan ni Juan and the Kapit-Bisig para sa Ilog Pasig project of the ABS-CBN Foundation. Popular destinations in the area include the Field of Faith situated in Barangay Lamot 2 and the Isdaan Floating Restaurant located along the National Highway going to Victoria Laguna. ==History== The fertile soil of Calauan attracted the oattention of Captain Juan de Salcedo, when he passed through Laguna and Tayabas (now Quezon) on his way to Bicol Region in 1570. Ten years later, Spanish authorities established a town government two kilometers from the site of the present Poblacion, in what is now Barrio Mabacan. They called the townsite ‚ÄúCalauan‚Äù (Tagalog word for rust). Following in epidemic in 1703, the town was moved to its present site at the fork of three roads---now to the south-west leading to San Pablo City, the other southeastward to Santa Cruz, the provincial capital, and the third going North to Manila. At the turn of the 18th century, when Bay was designated as the provincial capital of Laguna, Calauan became a sitio of Bay. Merchants going to Southern Luzon passed through Bay and Calauan. One of them, an opulent Spaniard by the name of I√±igo, bought large tracts of land in Calauan in 1812. The landholdings of I√±igo and, later, of his heirs were so vast that many portions were still unsettled. The property was and still is, known as Hacienda Calauan. About a century later, the people of Calauan fought a ‚Äúguardia civil‚Äù during the Philippine Revolution. Basilio Geiroza (better known as Cabesang Basilio) and his men routed a battalion of ‚Äúguardia civiles‚Äù in a five-hour battle in Bario Cupangan (now Lamot I) in December 1897. During the subsequent Philippine-American hostilities, Calauan patriots fought numerically superior forces of General Otis in Barrio San Diego of San Pablo. With the establishment of civilian authority in Calauan in 1902, the Americans assigned Mariano Marfori as first ‚Äúpresidente‚Äù. Hacienda Calauan financed the construction of a hospital in 1926, and Mariano O. Marfori Jr. son of the first municipal presidente, as hospital director and the resident physician, respectively. In 1939, by the request of President Quezon, Do√±a Margarita Roxas vda. de Soriano, granddaughter of the Spaniard, I√±igo., subdivided Hacienda Calauan and sold it to the tenants, part of what remained was converted into a rest house and a swimming pool and it became one of the tourist attractions until 1956. In 1993, the town became the focus of media attention when Antonio Sanchez, who was serving as mayor at the time, got involved into a rape and double murder case involving two UPLB students. Sanchez and several other men were given a life sentence in March 1995. == Geography == === Geographical landmarks === Barangay Lamot 2 in Calauan is the site is the site of Mount Kalisungan, known for being site where retreating Japanese soldiers made their last stand in Laguna at the end of World War II. The 760 MASL mountain is sometimes also known as Mount Nagcarlan or Mount Lamot, and is a traditional during holy week hiking site among locals. It is considered a hiker's favorite because it offers a clear view of Talim Island, Mount Tagapo, the Jalajala peninusla and Mount Sembrano to the north, the Caliraya highlands to the east, the seven lakes of San Pablo, Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw to the south, and Mount Makiling to the west. ===Barangays=== Welcome Arch Calauan is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. * Balayhangin * Bangyas * Dayap * Dayap 2(NHA) * Hanggan * Imok * Lamot 1 * Lamot 2 * Limao * Mabacan * Masiit * Paliparan * P√©rez * Kanluran (Poblacion) * Silangan (Poblacion) * Prinza * San Isidro * Santo Tom√°s ===Climate=== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Calauan, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Local government== Municipal officials (2013-2016): * Mayor: Buenafrido \\"George\\" Berris (UNA) * Vice Mayor: Allan Jun \\"Dong\\" V.

SPEs are typically used by companies to isolate the firm from financial risk. A formal definition is \\"The Special Purpose Entity is a fenced organization having limited predefined purposes and a legal personality\\". Normally a company will transfer assets to the SPE for management or use the SPE to finance a large project thereby achieving a narrow set of goals without putting the entire firm at risk. SPEs are also commonly used in complex financings to separate different layers of equity infusion. Commonly created and registered in tax havens, SPEs allow tax avoidance strategies unavailable in the home district. Round-tripping is one such strategy. In addition, they are commonly used to own a single asset and associated permits and contract rights (such as an apartment building or a power plant), to allow for easier transfer of that asset. They are an integral part of public private partnerships common throughout Europe which rely on a project finance type structure.European PPP Expertise Centre A special-purpose entity may be owned by one or more other entities and certain jurisdictions may require ownership by certain parties in specific percentages. Often it is important that the SPE is not owned by the entity on whose behalf the SPE is being set up (the sponsor). For example, in the context of a loan securitization, if the SPE securitization vehicle were owned or controlled by the bank whose loans were to be secured, the SPE would be consolidated with the rest of the bank's group for regulatory, accounting, and bankruptcy purposes, which would defeat the point of the securitization. Therefore, many SPEs are set up as 'orphan' companies with their shares settled on charitable trust and with professional directors provided by an administration company to ensure that there is no connection with the sponsor. ==Uses== Some of the reasons for creating special-purpose entities are as follow: * Securitization: SPEs are commonly used to securitize loans (or other receivables). For example, a bank may wish to issue a mortgage-backed security whose payments come from a pool of loans. However, to ensure that the holders of the mortgage-backed securities have the first priority right to receive payments on the loans, these loans need to be legally separated from the other obligations of the bank. This is done by creating an SPE, and then transferring the loans from the bank to the SPE. * Risk sharing: Corporates may use SPEs to legally isolate a high risk project/asset from the parent company and to allow other investors to take a share of the risk. * Finance: Multi-tiered SPEs allow multiple tiers of investment and debt. * Asset transfer: Many permits required to operate certain assets (such as power plants) are either non-transferable or difficult to transfer. By having an SPE own the asset and all the permits, the SPE can be sold as a self-contained package, rather than attempting to assign over numerous permits. * To maintain the secrecy of intellectual property: For example, when Intel and Hewlett- Packard started developing IA-64 (Itanium) processor architecture, they created a special-purpose entity which owned the intellectual technology behind the processor. This was done to prevent competitors like AMD accessing the technology through pre-existing licensing deals. * Financial engineering: SPEs are often used in financial engineering schemes which have, as their main goal, the avoidance of tax or the manipulation of financial statements. The Enron case is possibly the most famous example of a company using SPEs to achieve the latter goal. * Regulatory reasons: A special-purpose entity can sometimes be set up within an orphan structure to circumvent regulatory restrictions, such as regulations relating to nationality of ownership of specific assets. * Property investing: Some countries have different tax rates for capital gains and gains from property sales. Letting each property be owned by a separate company can mean a lower tax bill. These companies can then be sold and bought instead of the actual properties, effectively converting property sale gains into capital gains in order to pay less tax. ==Types== ===Securitization=== * A real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), used for the pooling and securitization of mortgage loans for mortgage-backed securities. * A financial asset securitization investment trust (FASIT), a defunct entity used for securitization of any debt for asset- backed securities. * An Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) (S110 SPV), the largest SPV in the EU for securitisation. ===Investment=== * A real estate investment trust (REIT), a tax designation for a corporate entity investing in real estate for the purpose of reducing or eliminating corporate tax. ==Establishment== Like a company, an SPE must have promoter(s) or sponsor(s). Usually, a sponsoring corporation hives off assets or activities from the rest of the company into an SPE. This isolation of assets is important for providing comfort to investors. The assets or activities are distanced from the parent company, hence the performance of the new entity will not be affected by the ups and downs of the originating entity. The SPE will be subject to fewer risks and thus provide greater comfort to the lenders. What is important here is the distance between the sponsoring company and the SPE. In the absence of adequate distance between the sponsor and the new entity, the latter will not be an SPE but only a subsidiary company. A good SPE should be able to stand on its feet, independent of the sponsoring company. Unfortunately, this does not always happen in practice. One of the reasons for the collapse of the Enron SPE was that it became a vehicle for furthering the ends of the parent company in violation of the prudential norms of corporate financing and accounting. ==Abuses== Special-purpose entities were one of the main tools used by executives at Enron, in order to hide losses and fabricate earnings, resulting in the Enron scandal of 2001. They were also used to hide losses and overstate earnings by executives at Towers Financial Corporation, which declared bankruptcy in 1994. Several executives of the company were found guilty of securities fraud, served prison sentences, and paid fines. ==Accounting guidance== Under US GAAP, a number of accounting standards apply to SPEs, most notably FIN 46R that sets out the consolidation treatment of these entities. There are a number of other standards that apply to different transactions with SPEs. Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the relevant standard is IAS 27 in connection with the interpretation of SIC12 (Consolidation‚ÄîSpecial-Purpose Entities). For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements supersedes IAS 27 and SIC 12. ==See also== *FIN 46 (FASB ruling on consolidation of variable interest entities) *Off-balance-sheet entity *Variable interest entity (VIE) *Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) *Orphan structure *Special purpose private equity fund, similarly named business term *Stichting *Structured investment vehicle *Enron *Instex, a special purpose vehicle intended to promote trade with Iran without using the US dollar and evade Sanctions against Iran. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Corporate finance ","title":"Special-purpose entity"},{"id":"1274342","text":"In English law, a writ of scire facias (Latin, meaning literally \\"make known\\") was a writ founded upon some judicial record directing the sheriff to make the record known to a specified party, and requiring the defendant to show cause why the party bringing the writ should not be able to cite that record in his own interest, or why, in the case of letters patent and grants, the patent or grant should not be annulled and vacated. In the United States, the writ has been abolished under federal law but may still be available in some state legal systems. ==History== The writ of scire facias was created in 1285 during the 13th year of the reign of Edward I by the English Parliament in the Second Statute of Westminster. The writ of quo warranto was created during this same period. ==Procedure== Proceedings in scire facias were regarded as a form of action, and the defendant could plead his defense as in an action. They were analogous to quo warranto proceedings. In 1684, the royal charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was rescinded by a writ of scire facias for the colony's interference with the royal prerogative in founding Harvard College and other matters. By the beginning of the 20th century, the writ was of little practical importance. Its principal uses were to compel the appearance of corporations aggregate in revenue suits, and to enforce judgments against shareholders in companies regulated by the Companies Clauses Act 1845, or similar private acts, and against garnishees in proceedings in foreign attachment in the Lord Mayor's Court. (Google Books) It was not used in Scottish law. Proceedings by scire facias to repeal letters patent for inventions were abolished by the Patents, Designs and Trademarks Act 1883, and a petition to the court substituted. The writ was abolished on 1 January 1948 by the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.Crown Proceedings Act 1947, s.23/ Sch.1(3) ==U.S. significance== Some American legal scholars have suggested that impeachment may not be the sole method to remove a federal judge from office, pointing to scire facias as an alternative. The actual writ of scire facias has been suspended in the federal district courts by Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but the rule still allows for granting relief formerly available through scire facias by prosecuting a civil action. Under the law of many states, Arkansas, Georgia, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas for example, an action in scire facias may be used to revive a dormant judgment if brought in a timely fashion. An action on debt, reciting that the dormant judgment remains unpaid, may be used for the same purpose. The defendant of the scire facias writ would generally need to prove that the debt was paid in order for the court to invalidate the writ.

Ex. Phil. & Med. D.\\" (; 1568‚Äì1622) was a German physician and counsellor to Rudolf II Habsburg. He was a learned alchemist, epigramist and amateur composer. == Early life == Maier was born in Rendsburg, Holstein, the son of a specialist in beadwork in embroidery named Peter Maier. He studied philosophy and medicine at Rostock (1587‚Äì1591), Frankfurt (Oder) (M.A. 1592), and Padua (1595‚Äì1596). Maier left Padua abruptly after getting involved in a fight, injuring the other party, and being arrested. He went on to the University of Basel, where he attained a doctorate in medicine in October 1596. His doctoral thesis, De epilepsia was dedicated to Matthias Carnarius. Maier then returned to Holstein to practice medicine. Around 1599, he became interested in alchemy and attempted to create an alchemical concordance, synthesizing the works of different authors. ==In the service of Rudolf II (1609-1611)== In 1608, he went to Prague, and on 19 September 1609, he formally entered the service of Rudolf II as his physician and imperial counsellor. Ten days later, Rudolf raised him to the hereditary nobility and gave him the title of Imperial Count Palatine. He was granted a coat of arms which depicted a bird, bonded together with a frog by a golden chain. Around this time, Maier published an extremely limited print run of De Medicina Regia et vere Heroica, Coelidonia (1609), including in it his autobiography. The interest of the emperor in the occult was the reason of his high esteem for Maier. However, by April 1611, Rudolf's political position had substantially deteriorated, and he was more or less imprisoned in his castle in Prague. Maier left the city that month. He corresponded with Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, and visited Hessen-Kassel's brother-in-law, Count Ernst III of Holstein-Schauenburg. He was also a guest of Christoph Reinhard, Doctor of Laws and town syndic of M√ºhlhausen, to whom he later dedicated his book Atalanta Fugiens. ==In England 1611-1616== First Maier visited the Netherlands where he stayed with Petrus Carpenterius in Rotterdam. Carpernterius had previously been the rector of a Walloon school in Norwich in 1598. From there he continued on to London arriving in 1611 or 1612. Whether he had arrived in person or not by Christmas 1611 is unknown, but he did send Christmas cards to both James I and his son Prince Henry. He composed a wedding song for the nuptials of Frederick V of the Palatinate to Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I. He was in London on 6 November 1612, attending the funeral of Prince Henry in the retinue of Frederick of the Palatinate. His first well-known book, Arcana arcanissima, was published in London in 1613 or 1614, and he dedicated copies to a number of notables, including the Bishop of Ely and Sir Thomas Smith of the East India Company. Image taken from the hermetic splendid book Atalanta Fugiens by Michael Maier. Maier returned to Germany in September 1616, settling in Frankfurt am Main. His Atalanta Fugiens, an alchemical emblem book, was published in 1617. Alongside images, poems, and discussion, it included fifty pieces of music in the form of fugues, the form itself being a pun on Atalanta \\"fleeing\\". In 1619, Maier became the physician of Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). In 1620, he moved to Magdeburg to practice medicine, where he died at the age of 54, leaving a noteworthy quantity of unpublished works. A devout Lutheran all his life, Michael Maier had a strong influence on Sir Isaac Newton. He was also involved in the Rosicrucian movement that appeared around this time, which afforded part of the matter of his Themis aurea.Hereward Tilton, The Quest for the Phoenix: Spiritual Alchemy and Rosicrucianism in the Work of Count Michael Maier (1569‚Äì1622) (de Gruyter) 2003:30ff \\"Spiritual alchemy, Rosicrucianism and the work of Count Michael Maier\\". ==Influence== The 1656 English translation of Themis Aurea appeared as Themis Aurea: The Laws of the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross, and was dedicated to Elias Ashmole.James Brown Craven, Count Michael Maier - Life and Writings Kirkwall, 1910 reprinted by photolithography Unwin Brothers 1968 SBN 7129 0335 6 pg 98 Under the initials N.L.T.S. and H.S. the dedicators justified their dedication over three pages; they are now identified as Nathaniel Hodges, and Thomas Hodges (either his father or his brother, both of that name).

Roosevelt to the position of Coordinator of Information (COI), a position that later transformed into the chairmanship of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Upon request by Donovan, Ian Fleming was contacted to write a lengthy memorandum describing the structure and functions of a secret service organisation. Parts of this memorandum were later used in the official charter for the OSS, which was later dissolved after World War II in 1945. For appreciation of Fleming's work Donovan presented Fleming with a .38 Police Positive Colt revolver with the inscription, \\"For Special Services.\\" In 1944, Donovan proposed to President Roosevelt the creation of a new agency, \\"which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies.\\" The OSS was disbanded in 1945; accordingly, the Central Intelligence Agency; formed in 1947 is a direct descendant of the OSS. ==Plot summary== Bond teams up with CIA agent Cedar Leiter, daughter of his old friend, Felix Leiter, to investigate one Markus Bismaquer, who is suspected of reviving the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which was believed to have been disbanded years earlier following the death of its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, at the hands of Bond (in You Only Live Twice). The British Secret Service learns that Bismaquer is an obsessive collector of rare prints, so Bond and Cedar visit the man's huge ranch in Amarillo, Texas posing as art dealers. Their true identities are soon revealed, but not until Bond holds his own both in an impromptu (and fixed) car race arranged by Bismaquer, and in the bed of Bismaquer's frustrated wife, Nena. Nena, who has only one breast, quickly wins Bond's heart and his sympathy and Bond is convinced that Bismaquer is the one now being referred to as the new Blofeld. Bond discovers that the revitalised SPECTRE plans to take over control of NORAD headquarters in order to gain control of America's military space satellite network. His true identity revealed, Bond is captured and brainwashed into believing he is an American general assigned to inspect NORAD. Although he has been set up to be killed in the ensuing attack by SPECTRE forces on the base, Bond regains his personality and his memory. Apparently Bismaquer, who is bisexual, has taken a liking to Bond and sabotaged the hypnosis. When Bond returns to Bismaquer's ranch, he witnesses Bismaquer being killed by Nena, who is in fact the mind behind the operation and the daughter of Blofeld, a fact she confesses to Bond just before falling into the crushing grip of her pet pythons. She is later put out of her misery by Felix Leiter, who arrives on the scene to help rescue his daughter. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Ann Reilly * Cedar Leiter * Felix Leiter * Markus Bismaquer: Bismaquer, married to Nena Bismaquer, is a collector of fine prints and the owner of an ice cream plant in Amarillo, Texas. He is believed to be either a direct descendant or a confidant of Ernst Stavro Blofeld and to have resurrected the evil organization SPECTRE Gardner alludes, on more than one occasion, that Bismaquer in truth is a homosexual and possibly had fallen for Bond. * Walter Luxor: Is Bismaquer's partner and a high-ranking member of SPECTRE. At one point he is believed to be a revived Ernst Stavro Blofeld. * Mike Mazzard: Is a member of SPECTRE tasked to bring Bond to Amarillo. After Bond objects this offer, Mazzard attempts to kill Bond in Washington D.C.. Mazzard also aids Luxor in infiltrating NORAD HQ. * Nena Bismaquer: Is the wife of Markus Bismaquer. She later turns out to be the daughter of Ernst Stavro Blofeld and the successor and leader of SPECTRE. ==Car== This is the second novel in Gardner's Bond series in which Bond drives a Saab 900 Turbo; however, this is the first book in which the car's colour is mentioned and it is referred to by its more popular nickname, the Silver Beast. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: September 1982 Jonathan Cape * U.S. first hardback edition: April 1982 Coward, McCann & Geoghegan * UK first paperback edition: 1982 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: April 1983 Berkley Books The U.S. hardcover had a first printing of 95,000 copies. Available online. ==Reviews== Many critics were scathing. Kingsley Amis, himself a former Bond author, was the harshest. His Times Literary Supplement review called the book \\"an unrelieved disaster\\", Gardner \\"not the most self- assured of writers\\", and said that the plot was \\"absurd\\" and \\"blundering\\". Amis said, \\"What makes Mr Gardner's book so hard to read is not so much its endlessly silly story as its desolateness, its lack of the slightest human interest or warmth. [...] But then to do anything like that the writer must be genuinely interested in his material.\\" Writing in The New Republic, Robin W. Winks wrote, \\"Bond is dead, and John Gardner's second effort to remove the nails from that coffin, though not so dreary nor so silly as the first, is nonetheless very thin gruel.\\" Winks further said the book was \\"exceptionally bad when read back-to-back with Ian Fleming's From a View to a Kill. The book is full of one sentence paragraphs ‚Äî did Fleming ever really write this way? ‚Äî and obligatory \\"who'll sleep in the one bedroom, who on the couch\\" scenes once calculated to titillate fourteen-year-olds.\\" New Statesman critic Lewis Jones dismissed it as \\"a real airport novel, unimaginative and badly written. Bond is as dated as Biggles. Gardner's attempts to update meet with partial success. He can manage the machines but not the people.\\" Jones summed the book up in one word: \\"Deadly.\\" Novelist Stanley Ellin's New York Times review asserted that the novel \\"was a dud, and for reasons having nothing to do with the author's well-proven talent. Ian Fleming was a dreadful writer, a creator of books for grown-up boys, a practitioner of tin-eared prose. As evidenced by his writings, he was also by nature a ferocious and humorless snob, a political primitive, a chauvinist in every possible area whose ideas about sexuality apparently were implanted by fevered readings of Lady Chatterley's Lover. John Gardner, creator of the inimitable and delightful Boysie Oakes among other characters, is the antithesis to all this, a writer of style and wit with a sharp-eyed, acidulous and yet appreciative view of humanity and its foibles. Fleming's shoes are simply too tight and misshapen for Mr. Gardner to wear comfortably. Fleming, however, did offer the reader one thing no imitator can possibly duplicate: total identification with and commitment to his hero and his works as the products of an uninhibited wish fulfillment.\\" Ellin believed that no writer \\"could have done better with this curious project than John Gardner, but it is simply a defeating project to start with.\\" Ellin did find several things to admire. \\"There are some good things among the zany proceedings: an automobile road race described to nerveracking effect; the amusing relationship between the aging Bond and the youthful Cedar Leiter; a climax where Bond is drugged into imagining he is the woolly-headed Gen. James A. Banker, U.S.A. - all pure John Gardner at his Boysie Oakes best. This still doesn't compensate for the awkwardness of the whole project. The reader will do better to head for anything by Mr. Gardner that isn't imitation Fleming. As pure Gardner, he is quite a writer.\\" Available online. Mystery novelist Reginald Hill, writing in Books and Bookmen, admitted \\"I was not pre-inclined to like John Gardner's second James Bond adventure For Special Services, and I didn't. Mr. Gardner is far too good a writer not to make a fair stab at the job. No mere arranger of other men's flowers, he is of course a thriller writer of the first water. All this is done with technical skill and some panache, but in the end Bond belongs so much to the 50s and early 60s that to translate him to the 80s without making him grow up is an almost impossible task. The result is very fair escapist stuff, but time and again I found myself asking the, I hope, not impertinent question, if this man wasn't called James Bond, how good a thriller would this be? And the answer, I'm afraid, is not half as good as what Mr Gardner is capable of giving us when he follows his own creative bent. Bring back Boysie Oakes!\\" People Magazine's anonymous reviewer complained that the novel \\"has the stripped-down feeling of a comic strip. Fleming had fun with James Bond, but he also seemed genuinely to admire 007's ridiculous, perfect-martini mannerisms. Gardner, while he's a better writer than Fleming, is a cynical pro. There is no joy in his Bond.\\" Available online. A handful of critics liked the book despite some reservations. The Globe and Mail crime critic Derrick Murdoch praised Gardner's vast research \\"on the state-of-the-art technology affecting satellite chasers, hydraulics, automobile and monorail engineering design, weaponry, optics and pyrostatics.\\" Murdoch also praised the novel's final scene set \\"in a mock-decrepit palace in the middle of the Louisiana swampland, is played out in maniacal fury, total illogic and superb idiocy to enchant the mind. In other words, John Gardner is having more fun with his rented character than he allowed himself to have in the earlier book.\\" Kirkus Reviews said Gardner's second Bond novel \\"is smooth enough - but a good deal less fun than License Renewed. Comic-strippy as ever, but without the freshness and Bond-persona detail of the first resurrection.\\" Available online. John Waite, writing in the Nursing Mirror, said Gardner managed to write in Fleming's style \\"beautifully\\". The plot, he said, was preposterous enough, the girls exotic enough and the villains superbly Satanic. ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:1982 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by John Gardner (British writer) Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:Novels set in Texas ","title":"For Special Services"},{"id":"1274369","text":"A condition precedent is an event or state of affairs that is required before something else will occur.

Antonucci is known for creating the Cartoon Network animated comedy series Ed, Edd n Eddy. He also created Lupo the Butcher, Cartoon Sushi, and The Brothers Grunt. Danny Antonucci dropped out of the Sheridan College of Visual Arts to take a job as an animator at Hanna- Barbera, where he worked on a number of series, including Fables of the Green Forest, The Flintstone Comedy Show, Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo, The Smurfs, and Richie Rich. He continued his career in Vancouver, where he worked on animated shorts and television commercials for International Rocketship Limited, and created his first solo work, the animated short Lupo the Butcher. At MTV, he worked on a number of commercials, his series The Brothers Grunt, and the animation showcase program Cartoon Sushi, which he co-created with Keith Alcorn. He went on to create Ed, Edd n Eddy for Cartoon Network. In 2008, Antonucci signed to WildBrain. Throughout his career, Antonucci won a number of awards. Many of his commercials for Converse, ESPN and Levi's won a number of awards. Lupo the Butcher was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic. ==Early life== Antonucci's parents were Italian immigrants to Canada. His experiences as a child in an immigrant family deeply influenced his later work, such as Lupo the Butcher. Antonucci attended the Sheridan College of Visual Arts but quit to take a job as an animator at Canimage Production, a division of Hanna-Barbera. ==Career== Starting his career as an animator, Antonucci worked on numerous shows, including The Flintstone Comedy Show, Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo, The Smurfs, and Richie Rich. Intending to move to Los Angeles in 1984 to find more work, Antonucci landed in Vancouver, British Columbia. He landed a job at International Rocketship Limited, animating short films and television commercials. His first effort was on the short film Hooray for Sandbox Land. ===International Rocketship Limited, foundation of a.k.a. Cartoon, and MTV work=== Antonucci's first solo work was Lupo the Butcher, produced by International Rocketship Limited, about a short- tempered butcher who swears at the meat he is cutting and gets extremely mad at the smallest mistakes. Antonucci says the short arose out of his own frustration at having to work in children's film for so long, and to try his hand at creating a full-fledged character on film. The short animated film screened at several film festivals, including Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in the United States. The 'Lupo' character was eventually licensed by the Converse athletic shoe company. This led to additional work, including animated commercials for Levi Strauss & Co. and MTV. He also originally created a mascot for Cartoon Network, known as the jester, as well as the mascot's bumpers. On April 1, 1994, Antonucci started an animation company named a.k.a. Cartoon, which produced the short-lived MTV series The Brothers Grunt, which began airing in 1994 and ended its run in 1995. Antonucci went on to work on MTV's Cartoon Sushi show in 1997, directing, writing and providing voices, in addition to being responsible for the title sequence of the show. ===Ed, Edd n Eddy=== Feeling confined to \\"gross\\" and \\"edgy\\" work, such as his series The Brothers Grunt, Antonucci decided to produce an animated children's television show again with his company a.k.a. Cartoon. He resolved, however, to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the cartoon styles from the 1940s to the 1970s. Antonucci spent months designing the show, before trying to sell it to Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon told him that they would take the show, if they also obtained creative control. Antonucci refused to give it, and instead took the show to Cartoon Network. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission the show, after they agreed to let Antonucci go in his own direction. Antonucci is a strong advocate of hand-drawn animation. The wobbling animation in Ed, Edd n Eddy is an homage to the hand-drawn cartoons with a style that harkens back to cartoons of the 1940s to the 1970s. To give the impression of movement, Ed, Edd n Eddy uses shimmering character outlines similar to Squigglevision. The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, but are still visible, and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s. According to Antonucci, the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons. The Eds also possess personality traits similar to The Three Stooges, whose money-making schemes and antics also invariably backfire. The cul-de-sac children and the Kanker Sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, stating that he \\"thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own\\" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first-generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living. Ed, Edd n Eddy is the only A.k.a. Cartoon show to have a movie based on the animated television series. The series' finale movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series. However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On March 30, 2012, the series received another opportunity to air re-runs on the revived block Cartoon Planet. ===WildBrain and upcoming series=== While Antonucci was working on Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, it was announced on September 4, 2008 that he signed to WildBrain; Antonucci stated that he was \\"already kicking around three different ideas for his first WildBrain project\\". On June 11, 2013, animator Joe Murray posted a short interview with Antonucci for his class on his website, and on the end wrote: \\"He's currently working on a new series, so rock on.\\" ==Awards and nominations== Antonucci's first solo work Lupo the Butcher was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic. Eric Fogel, creator of Celebrity Deathmatch, stated that Lupo the Butcher \\"opened [his] eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and inspired [him] to pursue a career path that was a bit more... twisted\\". Throughout his career, Antonucci received a number of awards. He worked on a number of award-winning commercials for Converse, ESPN and Levi's. In 1998, for his work on Cartoon Sushi, Antonucci received a National Cartoonists Society Division Award for Television Animation. His series Ed, Edd n Eddy received several awards and nominations; for his work on the series, Antonucci won a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation in 1999 and a Leo Award for Best Director in an Animated Production or Series in 2000. He became best known for Ed, Edd n Eddy, which with an almost 11-year run remains the longest running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date. It was also Cartoon Network's most popular series among boys ages 2‚Äì11. Bob Higgins, head of WildBrain, considered Ed, Edd n Eddy to be a \\"landmark in animation\\". Joe Murray, famous for creating the animated series Rocko's Modern Life and Camp Lazlo, called Antonucci \\"one of the founders and mainstays of modern animation\\". ==Filmography== ===Films=== { class=\\" mw-collapsible\\" - b0c4de; text- align:center;\\" !

A condition subsequent is often used in a legal context as a marker bringing an end to one's legal rights or duties. A condition subsequent may be either an event or a state of affairs that must either (1) occur or (2) fail to continue to occur. ==Examples== A condition subsequent may be either an event or a state of affairs that must either (1) occur or (2) fail to continue to occur. An example of the first, a condition that must occur to bring an end to something else: *\\"When I run out of fuel, the fire will die down.\\" An example of the second, a condition that must fail to occur to bring an end to something else: *\\"So long as I have fuel, the fire will continue.\\" In both cases, running out of fuel is a condition subsequent to the continuance of the fire. ==In law== A condition subsequent is noted for its common use in the law. ===In contract law=== In contract law: A contract may be frustrated on the occurrence of a condition subsequent: in a contract to provide a music hall for a musical performance, the burning down of the music hall may frustrate the contract and automatically bring it to an end.

Again, the right of entry is not automatic, but rather must be exercised to terminate the fee simple subject to condition subsequent. To exercise right of entry, the holder must take substantial steps to recover possession and title, for example, by filing a lawsuit. One of the languages used to create a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and a right of entry is \\"to A, but if A sells alcohol on the land, then grantor has the right of reentry.\\" Common uses include language such as \\"may\\", \\"but if\\", \\"however\\", or \\"provided that...\\" ==Compared to condition precedent== In comparison, a condition subsequent brings a duty to an end whereas a condition precedent initiates a duty. == See also == * Condition precedent * Necessary condition * Sufficient condition Category:Contract law Category:Property law ","title":"Condition subsequent"},{"id":"1274380","text":": For the New Zealand politician see Tom Seddon Thomas Seddon (London, 28 August 1821 ‚Äì Cairo, 23 November 1856) was an English landscape painter associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, who painted colourful and highly detailed scenes of Brittany, Egypt and Jerusalem. ==Life== The Citadel of Cairo, 1856 Jerusalem and the Valley of Jehoshaphat from the Hill of Evil Counsel, 1854. (Tate Gallery) Seddon was born on 28 August 1821 in Aldersgate Street in the City of London, the son of a well-known cabinet-maker of the same name. He was educated at a school conducted on the Pestalozzian system by the Rev. Joseph Barron at Stanmore, and then worked for his father until 1841, when he was sent to Paris to study ornamental art. He then returned to work in the family business. Although Seddon had already decided to become a painter, he continued to study design conscientiously, attending Thomas Leverton Donaldson's lectures on architecture and studying works in the British Museum. In 1848 his design for an ornamental sideboard won him a silver medal from the Society of Arts. Meanwhile, he took lessons at Charles Lucy's drawing school in Camden Town, and attended life classes held by the Artists' Society at Clipstone Street. In the summer of 1849, he went to North Wales, visiting Betws-y-Coed, then a popular destination for artists, where he made his first serious attempts at landscape painting. The next year he went to Barbizon in the forest of Fontainbleau, where he made some studies in oil. By the beginning of 1848 Seddon had come into contact with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, having met Ford Madox Brown, and during 1850 he worked on a copy of Chaucer at the Court of Edward III in Brown's studio. Around this time he was also involved in the setting up of the North London School of Drawing and Modelling, an art school for working men in Camden Town. At the end of 1850 he suffered a severe attack of rheumatic fever, during which ‚Äì apparently close to death ‚Äì he was reconciled with organised religion, having stopped attending church some years before; according to his brother's memoir \\"those that knew him best regard[ed] that sickness as the turning point in his spiritual history, and the commencement of his practical Christianity.\\" Just after this illness Seddon left his father's business, which was about to be relocated to Gray's Inn Road. He moved to rooms in Percy Street, off Tottenham Court Road, where he completed a painting of figure subject, Penelope, which was his first work to be shown at the Royal Academy. He visited Wales again in late 1851 and the following summer went to Dinan in Brittany where his sisters were staying; a landscape painted there was shown at the Royal Academy the next year. Seddon spent much of the early part of 1853 preparing for a journey to Egypt in the company of one of the Brotherhood's founders, William Holman Hunt. In June he went to Dinan again, where he painted a large and elaborate landscape showing the ruined monastery of L√©hon. Seddon left France for Egypt in November, arriving in Alexandria on 6 December, and moved on to Cairo, Hunt not having yet arrived. Seddon and Hunt set up camp near the Pyramids, with another Englishman called Nicholson, who was terminally ill, and died there. Then, in a change of plan, the two artists decided to move on to Jerusalem, sailing from the mouth of the Nile in late May. On arrival Seddon left Hunt in the city, and pitched a tent on a hill looking up the valley of Jehosophat, with a view of the biblical sites of the Garden of Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives, from where he painted much of the highly finished landscape Jerusalem and the Valley of Jehoshaphat from the Hill of Evil Counsel. He left the city for France in October 1854. Although the Valley of Jehosphat was exhibited with the subtitle Painted on the Spot during the Summer and Autumn Months, Seddon continued to work on it in Dinan, along with another oil painting and two watercolours also begun in Jerusalem,. He finally finished it, with some help from Hunt, following his return to London in January 1855 and showed it for the first time at an exhibition in his studio in Berners Street in March of the same year. His Eastern subjects were exhibited again the following year in Conduit Street. In October 1856 Seddon visited Cairo again, but died of dysentery there on 23 November. In 1857 his works were exhibited in the gallery of the Society of Arts, and Jerusalem and the Valley of Jehoshaphat, was purchased by subscription and presented to the National Gallery. John Ruskin pronounced Seddon's views of Egypt and Palestine to be \\"the first landscapes uniting perfect artistical skill with topographical accuracy; being directed, with stern self-restraint, to no other purpose than that of giving to persons who cannot travel trustworthy knowledge of the scenes which ought to be most interesting to them\\". A memoir of Seddon, by his brother, John Pollard Seddon, was published in 1859. ==See also== *List of Pre-Raphaelite paintings - including the works of Thomas Seddon. ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== *Thomas Seddon on ArtCyclopedia. *Thomas Seddon on Art Renewal Center. * Category:1821 births Category:1856 deaths Category:19th- century English painters Category:English male painters Category:People from the City of London Category:Landscape artists Category:Pre-Raphaelite artists ","title":"Thomas Seddon"},{"id":"1274382","text":"Edward Prior may refer to: *Edward Gawler Prior (1853‚Äì1920), Canadian politician *Edward Schroeder Prior (1857‚Äì1932), art professor at Cambridge University ==See also== *Ted Prior (disambiguation) ","title":"Edward Prior"},{"id":"1274384","text":"First Album, The First Album, or 1st Album may refer to: *The 1st Album (Modern Talking album), 1985 *First Album (Miss Kittin & The Hacker album), 2001 *First Album (The International Playboys album), 2002 *1st Album (5566 album), 2002 *First Album (Twelve album), 2003 *The First Album (183 Club album), 2006 *The Fugs First Album, a 1965 album by the Fugs *ZZ Top's First Album, a 1970 album by ZZ Top *James Taylor (album), a 1968 album by James Taylor; released in South Africa as First Album *Wild Horses (Wild Horses album), 1980; later reissued as The First Album *Madonna (Madonna album), 1983; later reissued as Madonna: The First Album *First Album, a 1992 album by Dive ==See also== *Debut (disambiguation) * * *All Wikipedia articles about debut albums ","title":"First Album"},{"id":"1274403","text":"The Ligbi (or Ligby) tribe speaks the Mande language spoken in Ghana in the north-west corner of the Brong-Ahafo Region.

Right-hand drive models were locally assembled in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa until 1969. For most of its run, the Canadian Parisienne was nearly mechanically identical to the American Chevrolet Impala. The Parisienne wagon continued under the Safari nameplate until 1989. Parisienne or La Parisienne means a grammatically female person or thing from Paris, France. ==Differences from US Pontiacs== 1958 Pontiac Parisienne Sport Coupe The Parisienne entered the production lineup as a sub- series within the Laurentian line in the 1958 model year. Parisienne became a separate model in 1959. For most of its life, the Parisienne was the Canadian nameplate for the top-of-the-line model sold in GM of Canada's Pontiac showrooms. Parisiennes were distinct from other Canadian Pontiac models by their standard features: the luxuriousness of upholstery fabrics; standard equipment such as courtesy interior and trunk lights; bright trim mouldings in the interior; distinct exterior accent chrome pieces; and availability of two- and four-door hardtops and convertibles. In particular, Canadian \\"full size\\" Pontiacs were actually closely related to Chevrolets, making use of the economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain, though with the American Pontiac- styled exterior body panels (They weren't the same as U.S. Pontiac panels since they had to fit the shorter-wheelbase 119-inch Chevrolet \\"X\\" frame. U.S. Pontiacs used a full perimeter frame.) and interior instrument panels. As Chevrolets under the skin, Canadian Pontiacs including the Parisienne used the same engines and transmissions as full-size Chevys, including the 230 and 250 cubic inch 6 cylinder and 283, 307, 327, 350, 396, 400, 409, 427 and 454 cu inch V8s. These engines were mated to the same transmissions as Chevrolet, including 3 and 4 speed manual and the 2 speed Powerglide and later the three- speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmissions. The first Parisienne, offered for the 1958 model year, was a super deluxe \\"halo\\" model in the Laurentian line, much like Chevrolet's Bel Air Impala of the same year. Chevrolet's Ramjet fuel injection system, introduced in 1957 in the U.S., was a Parisienne option as well. It was marketed as the \\"Power Chief\\" option, but it was identical to Chevy's Ramjet. Also available for the first year Parisienne was Chevrolet's Turboglide automatic transmission. Built in the same GM of Canada assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, Pontiacs had parallel model lineups as \\"full size\\" Chevrolets: the Pontiac \\"Strato Chief\\" had similar trim level and upholstery as Chevrolet's \\"Biscayne\\", the \\"Laurentian\\" matched the trim level of the Chevrolet \\"Bel Air\\" and while the Parisienne offered similar amenities as Chevrolet's \\"Impala\\", the Pontiac version had unique and more costly upholstery fabrics, and beginning in 1964 the \\"Custom Sport\\" (later rebadged the \\"2+2\\") two-door hardtop and convertible model line was in lock-step with Chevrolet's \\"Super Sport\\". Finally, starting in 1966 Pontiac offered the \\"Grande Parisienne\\", a two-door and four-door hardtop models parallel to Chevrolet's luxurious \\"Caprice,\\" although Grande Parisiennes through 1967 used the styling of the US-market Grand Prix. Also for 1967 and 1968 a Grande Parisienne wagon was offered. Through most of its life, the Parisienne resembled the US-market Bonneville despite its Chevrolet underpinnings. In contrast, the Pontiac Motor Division of GM in the US manufactured models with drivetrains, chassis and equipment unique from the other GM stablemates‚ÄîChevrolet, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Through much of the 1950s through 1970s, the American Pontiac model lineup included the \\"Catalina\\", \\"Ventura\\", \\"Executive\\", \\"Star Chief\\" and as the top of the line model, the \\"Bonneville\\". Additionally, unique to the US lineup until 1969 was the \\"Grand Prix\\", a distinct 2-door hardtop model with unique styling features and both luxury and \\"sporty\\" accoutrements such high output V8s, bucket seats, tachometers and flashy trim pieces. The mix of Pontiac exterior styling on an economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain at a price point marginally higher than Chevrolet, was a huge marketing success for GM of Canada. For decades \\"full-size\\" Pontiacs took third place behind Chevrolet and Ford in sales, typically 70,000 plus units annually. In contrast, heavier and bulkier American Pontiacs, with far higher sticker prices and higher operating costs due to large displacement V8s requiring high octane fuel, would have little appeal in the Canadian marketplace for a number of reasons: a population base one tenth the size of the US, a less stratified society with lower disposable incomes, more prudent spending and savings sensibilities and far higher taxes and gasoline prices. On the manufacturing side, maintaining unique part availability for a low sales vehicle along with import-export tariffs and barriers between the U.S. and Canada would make the sale of American Pontiacs unprofitable in Canada. European version of the Parisienne In 1977, GM had downsized its full-sized lineup. Pontiac continued with the Catalina and Bonneville nameplates it had used since 1973, but the cars failed to manage the sales volume of their divisional siblings and were dropped completely in 1981. However, the Bonneville name was then simply switched to the smaller G-body Pontiac (the cousin of the Chevrolet Malibu, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Regal) for 1982. Previously, those cars had been sold as the LeMans, but sales were poor and GM decided to swap nameplates on the grounds that Bonneville carried higher name recognition among customers. With the recession of 1979‚Äì82 lifting and gas prices beginning to drop, sales of larger cars began to pick up and so Pontiac dealers began demanding the return of the full-sized B-body line. However, the assembly plants used for the Catalina/Bonneville had been converted over to other uses, thus GM had to now source Pontiac B-bodies from Canada, where the line had not been discontinued. Even though the re-sized Bonneville was also sold in Canada, the full-size Parisienne continued for 1982, although its distinct Pontiac front- and rear- end treatments and interiors were largely replaced with Chevrolet components (described in detail below). At the request of US Pontiac dealerships who still wanted a full-size rear wheel drive car to replace the lost U.S. market share and gain back traditional Pontiac customers who longed for a large rear wheel drive car, the Parisienne was imported from Oshawa, Ontario, Canada and sold in the United States beginning in the 1983 model year, retaining the model name \\"Parisienne\\" and specs from the Canadian original. Externally, it was a rebadged Chevrolet Impala (1983-84 models (and 1982 in Canada) had the Impala rear taillight panel fitted with Pontiac-spec taillight lenses, whereas the nose was borrowed from the Chevrolet Caprice fitted with a Pontiac grille). The 1985 and 1986 models resumed use of the rear-end styling from the 1980 to 1981 Bonneville. Two Parisienne ranges were sold: a base model (similar to the former Catalina and the then-current Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale) in four-door sedan and Safari station wagon form, and a more-luxurious Brougham four-door sedan (with velour upholstery that featured loose-pillow fitted seats). The two-door version of the 1977-81 B-bodies did not return to the US market, although it persisted in Canada through 1983. ==First generation: 1959-60== File:1959 Pontiac Fall 1989 Right.jpg1959 Pontiac Parisienne Sport Coupe File:Pontiac Parisienne Convertible.jpg1960 Pontiac Parisienne 4 door, converted to convertible ==Second generation: 1961‚Äì1964== File:'62 Pontiac Parisienne Convertible (Auto classique Ste-Rose '11).JPG1962 Pontiac Parisienne convertible File:Pontiac Parisienne Coupe (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg1963 Pontiac Parisienne Sport Coupe.

Note Chevrolet type parallel wipers; U.S. market Pontiacs had \\"clapper\\" windshield wipers. ==Third generation: 1965‚Äì1970== In 1965 Pontiac Parisienne grille appeared as the Bonneville grille, with the exception of the Custom Sport grille which was taken from US 1965 Pontiac Grand Prix. Although the powertrain offerings paralleled the Chevrolet full size powertrain lineup, 1965 was an exception. The Canadian full size Pontiacs never came with a 396 in 1965 but continued with the 409 as an optional engine until the 1966 model year was introduced. 1967 brought new styling including new grills.http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---October/1967-Pontiac- Parisienne-Brochure-Aus/1967-Pontiac-Parisienne-Aus--04-05 There were also new safety features, such as a collapsible steering column and dual braking system.http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---October/1967-Pontiac- Parisienne-Brochure-Aus/1967-Pontiac-Parisienne-Aus--10-11 The 1968 model was the last model for right-hand-drive assembly in those markets as supplied by the Oshawa plant, following General Motors in the United States decision to cease all RHD exports in 1968. Nevertheless, the 1968 model continued to be locally assembled for a further year in Australia and New Zealand, and for two more years in South Africa.

During this generation, the Chevrolet engines were replaced for the first time with the same powerplants as U.S. market Pontiacs. Thus, the Pontiac 455 cubic-inch V8 was now offered as an option on all models. The Grande Parisienne name was no longer used after 1970 and the Parisienne became the Parisienne Brougham in 1971, which was virtually the same car as the American Catalina and its 123.5 inch wheelbase. The Canadian Laurentian model continued. In 1971 the Grand Ville and Bonneville models were introduced to Canada, with their 126 inch wheelbase, along with the Catalina model. The Grand Ville had a front bench seat with a center armrest or an optional 60/40 divided seat with armrest. The Bonneville and Parisienne Brougham had a front bench seat without an armrest. Starting with the 1972 model year, all V8-powered Canadian Pontiacs got the Turbo Hydra-Matic as the standard transmission. Six cylinder models (Laurentian only) got a 3-speed manual as standard. In 1973 all full-size Pontiac models were given a 124-inch wheelbase before being downsized for the 1977 model year. While the Bonneville remained for 1976, 1975 was the last year for the Grand Ville in both the U.S. and Canada, with the Bonneville Brougham replacing the Grand Ville in 1976.

This allowed for smaller displacement engines, which made these new cars more fuel-efficient. Pontiac of Canada continued to offer the Parisienne in this new size. Like before, Canadian Pontiacs were virtual clones of the Chevrolet Caprice, with a slightly different grille insert, and different taillight trim. The new Pontiacs featured V6 and V8 engines. Coupe, sedan and wagon models were available. These cars were available virtually unchanged (except for minor styling updates) through 1986. This is the only generation of the Parisienne that was available in the United States, and assumed the full-size role when the Pontiac Bonneville was downsized in 1982.

The '61-'64 models had the '61 Pontiac dash reversed for RHD (also shared with Chevrolets) and '65 to '68 used an adapted version of the 1965 Chevrolet Impala dash panel, again shared with Chevrolets. Oshawa plant assembly of RHD Chevrolets and Pontiacs ceased after 1968 at the behest of General Motors in the United States. ===Australia=== Parisiennes and Laurentians were shipped to Australia and assembled at GM's Holden plant in Dandenong, Victoria until 1969, using some domestic parts such as seats, heaters, opposing windscreen wipers and 2 speed ventilation systems. Australian cars were assembled from Complete Knock-down (CKD) kits (welded and painted locally.) As red rear turn signals were illegal in Australia, Australian cars had to have amber lenses drilled into the rear bumper or trunk lid (depending on the model) with the turn signals rewired to flash through them. The 1968 model was the last RHD model to be exported internationally, hence all Australian 1969 cars are 1968 models assembled for a further year. ===New Zealand=== Canadian Parisiennes, Laurentians, and Impalas were sent as Semi Knock-down (SKD) kit cars (completed body locally assembled to frame) to New Zealand and assembled at GM New Zealand's Petone plant until 1969. As with Australia, New Zealand 1969 models are 1968 models assembled for one more year. ===Europe=== Pontiac \\"kit cars\\" were also assembled by G.M. Continental, in Antwerp, Belgiumhttps://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/continental-bites-the-dust/ ===South Africa=== Canadian Pontiacs were assembled by General Motors South Africa in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The last 1968 Parisienne models were assembled in South Africa well into 1970.https://canadianponcho.activeboard.com/t29544547/the-last-right-hand- drive-cars/ ===Philippines=== The 3rd Generation Pontiac Parisienne was also built at the Philippines by Yutivo Sons Hardware Corporation.

A front wheel drive model with the Bonneville name had similar dimensions versus the 1982 mid-size model, classifying the car as a full-size by the EPA; however, the wagon model (known just as \\"Safari\\") continued until 1989. While the Parisienne name was retired in 1986, big Pontiac fans got a completely new, but full-sized, Bonneville for 1987. This car featured front- wheel drive and a V6 as standard, in line with the contemporary Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile big models. Rear-wheel drive sedans returned to the Pontiac lineup with the Holden-sourced Pontiac G8 in 2008. GM did retain the Parisienne name into the late 80's on exports to the Middle East which were re-badged Caprices. == References == Parisienne Category:Cars introduced in 1959 Category:1960s cars Category:1970s cars Category:1980s cars Category:Full-size vehicles Category:Coup√©s Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Police vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States ","title":"Pontiac Parisienne"},{"id":"1274426","text":"Sebastiano del Piombo (; c. 1485 ‚Äì 21 June 1547) was an Italian painter of the High Renaissance and early Mannerist periods famous as the only major artist of the period to combine the colouring of the Venetian school in which he was trained with the monumental forms of the Roman school. He belongs both to the painting school of his native city, Venice, where he made significant contributions before he left for Rome in 1511, and that of Rome, where he stayed for the rest of his life, and whose style he thoroughly adopted.Steer, 92‚Äì94 Born Sebastiano Luciani, after coming to Rome he became known as Sebastiano Veneziano or Viniziano (\\"Sebastian the Venetian\\"), until in 1531 he became the Keeper of the Seal to the Papacy, and so got the nickname del Piombo (\\"of the Lead\\") thereafter, from his new job title of piombatore.Gould, 241; Lucco Friends like Michelangelo and Ariosto called him Fra Bastiano (\\"Brother Bastian\\").Jones & Penny, 183 Never a very disciplined or productive painter, his artistic productivity fell still further after becoming piombatore, which committed him to attend on the pope most days, to travel with him and to take holy orders as a friar, despite having a wife and two children.Lucco He now painted mostly portraits, and relatively few works of his survive compared to his great contemporaries in Rome. This limited his involvement with the Mannerist style of his later years. Having achieved success as a lutenist in Venice when young, he turned to painting and trained with Giovanni Bellini and Giorgione. When he first went to Rome he worked alongside Raphael and then became one of the few painters to get on well with Michelangelo, who tried to promote his career by encouraging him to compete for commissions against Raphael. He painted portraits and religious subjects in oils, and once he was established avoided the large fresco schemes that took up so much of the time of Raphael and Michelangelo. His earlier career in both Venice and Rome was somewhat overshadowed by the presence of clearly greater painters in the same city, but after the death of Raphael in 1520 he became Rome's leading painter. His influence on other artists was limited by his lack of prominent pupils, and relatively little dissemination of his works in print copies. ==Venice== The Judgment of Solomon, 1508‚Äì10, now usually attributed to Sebastiano. Sebastiano del Piombo was probably born in Venice, though there is no certainty as to his background. His birthdate is extrapolated from Vasari's statement that he was 62 at his death in 1547.Hirst, 209; Lucco; Vasari That he was first known as a musician and singer may suggest an upper-middle-class background; the extent to which his playing on the lute and other instruments was professional is unclear.Lucco; Vasari Like his contemporary Raphael, his career was marked by his ability to get on well with both other artists and patrons. He began to train as a painter at a relatively late age, probably 18 or 20, so around 1503‚Äì05, becoming a pupil of Giovanni Bellini and probably afterwards of Giorgione, both of whose influence is apparent in his works; Vasari's mention of their relationship is rather vague: \\"si acconci√≤ con Giorgione\\".Freedburg, 141 No signed or firmly documented works survive from his period painting in Venice, and many attributions are disputed. As with other artists, some of Sebastiano's works have long been confused with Giorgione's. Like Titian, he may have completed work left unfinished at Giorgione's death in 1510; Marcantonio Michiel says he finished The Three Philosophers.Steer, 90; Gould, 242; New, 33 The earliest significant work attributed to him is a portrait of a girl in Budapest, of about 1505. Organ-shutters of San Bartolomeo, Venice, now displayed with outside pair at centre. He is now usually assigned the unfinished and reworked Judgement of Solomon now at Kingston Lacy. This dramatic and imposing picture, \\"one of the masterpieces of Venetian narrative painting\\", was also long attributed to Giorgione; it may have been abandoned about 1508, though the estimated dates vary in the period 1505‚Äì1510. After extensive restoration in the 1980s, removing later overpainting, the painting is now left with traces of the three different compositions visible; still more can be seen with infra-red reflectography. Still over 2 √ó 3 metres, it seems originally to have been even larger, with some 40 cm lost along the left edge. There are two versions of the elaborate architectural background, which was a recurrent interest of Sebastiano's Venetian period. The last setting is in a basilica, which may reflect a \\"more learned\\" picture intended for a building holding courts of justice. The figure at the front of the executioner, left without clothes or the baby, is clearly drawn from classical sculpture.Hirst, 210‚Äì211, 211 quoted; Lucco, giving dates different by a few years, \\" c. 1505. ... probably abandoned by Sebastiano some time before 1507\\"; Freedburg, 142‚Äì143, placing it in 1508. Four standing figures of saints in niches on the organ-shutters of San Bartolomeo, Venice, now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, date from c. 1508‚Äì09, and are \\"very Giorgionesque\\", especially the pair on the insides. They were painted at the same time as Giorgione's frescos for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (now lost) just by the church, which was the German's church in Venice, and at this time also held Albrecht D√ºrer's Madonna of the Rose-Garlands of 1506. The outside pair of shutters also show what Sebastiano had learnt from Bellini.Hirst, 210; Steer, 92 (quoted); Lucco Their technique has developed \\"from the earlier smooth surface to the application of paint in heavy brushstrokes\\", and the figure of Saint Sebastian shows awareness of classical sculpture.Lucco, quoted; Freedburg, 143 The main altarpiece for San Giovanni Crisostomo, Venice of 1510‚Äì11 shows the patron saint, Saint John Chrysostom reading aloud at a desk, a Mary Magdalene looking out at the viewer, and two other female and three male saints. The organ-shutters for the church were also painted. The style shows developments \\"towards a new fullness of form and breadth of movement\\" that may have been influenced by the Florentine painter Fra Bartolommeo, who was in Venice in 1508.Steer, 92‚Äì93, 93 quoted Aspects of the composition were also innovative, and later copied by Venetian painters, including even Titian.

Early in the year he was sent to Venice by Pope Julius II to buy Venetian support for the papacy in the War of the League of Cambrai. When he returned to Rome after a stay of some six months, he brought Sebastiano with him; Sebastiano was to remain based in Rome for the rest of his life. Sebastiano began by painting mythological subjects in lunettes in the Sala di Galatea in Chigi's Villa Farnesina, under a ceiling just done by Baldassarre Peruzzi. In these he already shows an adaption to Roman style, especially that of Michelangelo, whose Sistine Chapel ceiling had just been completed. Probably the next year, he added a large Polyphemus.Freedburg, 109‚Äì111 It is possible that Raphael's famous Galatea of 1514, which is in the next bay and now dominates the room, replaced a fresco by Sebastiano. A larger cycle on the lower walls was apparently intended, but abandoned, for reasons that are not clear.Lucco; for the rather uncertain sequence of these works, see Jones & Penny, 93. Vasari says that the Galatea was earlier than the Polyphemus, but this may be wrong. Sebastiano had also been producing easel paintings from soon after his arrival, showing the development of his new style.Lucco; Freedburg, 111 A Death of Adonis in the Uffizi dates to about 1512‚Äì13, and shows that he \\"had achieved a working dialectic of Roman and Venetian classical styles\\", in which he \\"enlarged the proportion of his figures into an almost bulking massiveness, ponderous and sensuously splendid: idealizations, but of sensuous existence\\".Freedburg, 111 By about 1515, Sebastiano had befriended and allied himself with Michelangelo, who recruited him \\"as a kind of deputy for him in painting\\", he having returned to his backlog of promised projects in sculpture. Michelangelo's intention was for Sebastiano to \\"contest Raphael's first place\\" in painting in Rome, using at least in part ideas and designs supplied by Michelangelo, whose rivalry with Raphael had become intense. The intention may have been for a closer relationship than actually resulted, as in 1516 Michelangelo returned to Florence, only returning occasionally to Rome for several years after. The first result of this collaboration was one of Sebastiano's most important paintings, a Piet√† in Viterbo. Here the composition is highly unusual for this common subject (which Michelangelo had famously sculpted in 1498‚Äì99), with Christ lying across the bottom of the picture space, at the feet of a Virgin looking up to Heaven, so that the two figures do not actually touch. Though no drawing survives, this was Michelangelo's conception, where \\"an idea of high tragic power is expressed with extreme simplicity in a structure of severe geometric rigour\\".Freedburg, 113, quoted; Vasari says there was a drawing. The back of the panels have large sketches in charcoal that seem to be by both artists.M&S;, 14 In 1516 he painted a similar subject, the Lamentation of Jesus (now Hermitage Museum) using his own composition, and showing his awareness of Raphael's handling of groups of figures.Freedburg, 113 These led a Florentine friend of Michelangelo, Pierfrancesco Borgherini, to commission Sebastiano to decorate a chapel in San Pietro in Montorio in Rome; he no doubt hoped to get significant input from Michelangelo. There is a Michelangelo drawing of 1516 for the Flagellation of Jesus in the British Museum, and other sketches; the final design survives only in a copy by Giulio Clovio after another Michelangelo drawing (Royal Collection).M&S;, 56‚Äì58 In the event there were a series of interruptions and Sebastiano did not complete the chapel until early 1524.Lucco; Freedburg, 115‚Äì116 The Flagellation is painted in oil on plaster. This was a method first practiced by Domenico Veneziano, and afterwards by other artists; but according to Vasari only Sebastiano succeeded in preventing the colours eventually blackening.Vasari; Lucco; M&S;, \\"Room 5\\" The last major work of the period was the Raising of Lazarus, now in the National Gallery, London, which was commissioned in 1516 by Cardinal Giulio de Medici, archbishop of Narbonne in southern France, and the future Pope Clement VII, in blatant competition, engineered by Michelangelo, with a painting of the same size by Raphael, the Transfiguration. Both were supposed to hang in Narbonne Cathedral. Michelangelo supplied at least drawings for the figure of Lazarus and the two men supporting him (British Museum), but probably did not do any work on the painting itself, if only because he was only briefly in Rome during the time it was painted. When the two paintings were hung together in the Vatican, just after Raphael's death in 1520, both were praised, but the Raphael generally preferred, as has remained the case ever since. In the early 1520s Sebastiano completed the Borgherini Chapel with a Transfiguration in the semi-dome above his Flagellation. The combination shows the influence of the Apocalipsis Nova, a contemporary text that prophesied the coming of an \\"Angelic Pastor\\" who would bring a new age of peace. Michelangelo was among many reformist Catholics interested in the text. The Flagellation represents \\"the current, corrupted state of Christianity and the Transfiguration the glorious future to come\\".M&S;, before 60; see further: J.

The death of Raphael in 1520, immediately before the exhibition of the two rival paintings intended for Narbonne, left Sebastiano clearly the leading painter operating in Rome.Freedburg, 116; Lucco As his letters show, he immediately attempted to secure for himself the \\"Sala dei Pontefici\\", Raphael's next Vatican project, but was frustrated by Raphael's workshop, armed with the master's drawings, and his own inability to enlist Michelangelo's help, as the pope had told him to work exclusively on the long-promised Tomb of Pope Julius II.Jones and Penny, 239; Lucco In the following years Sebastiano mostly avoided very large commissions for churches, and concentrated on portraits, where he had a considerable reputation, and religious easel paintings, such as his Visitation for France (1518‚Äì19, now Louvre),M&S;, 68, 69 and his Madonna of the Veil (c. 1525), a very successful adaptation of Raphael's Madonna di Loreto.Jones and Penny, 88 To both of these types he brought his refined monumental classicism. His career in the decade was greatly impacted by outside events. In 1522 there was plague in Rome, and he may have left Rome for a long period; there is little evidence of his activity for over a year. In 1523 Giulio de Medici became Pope Clement VII, and thereafter Sebastiano seems to have been a part of Vatican court life. He painted a number of portraits of the pope, and other paintings for him. In 1527 he seems to have remained with the pope all through the horrors of the Sack of Rome and his nervous retreat to Orvieto, though he seems to have spent time in Venice in 1528 and perhaps 1529, his first known return there since 1511. This catastrophe brought to an end the High Renaissance epoch in Rome, scattering Raphael's workshop and the emerging Roman Mannerists, and largely destroying the confidence of patrons.Lucco; Freedburg, 225‚Äì228 In 1531 the death of the previous holder allowed Sebastiano to press Pope Clement for the lucrative office of the \\"piombatore\\", which he obtained after promising to pay a fixed sum of 300 scudi annually to the other main contender, Giovanni da Udine, who was also a painter, from Raphael's workshop. To hold the position he had to take vows as a friar, despite having a wife and two children. After this his paintings, which are more often signed than dated, carry signatures such as \\"F(rater) Sebastianus Ven(etus)\\".Gould, 247; Lucco ===1532‚Äì1547=== Sebastiano's artistic output reduced after taking the court role, though possibly not by as much as Vasari suggests. Large projects, even of a single painting, could take many years to complete, as with a Pieta for Spain. This was the last piece where Michelangelo helped him with a drawing. Vasari, probably much influenced by Michelangelo, places great emphasis on Sebastiano's turning away from art for a comfortable life as a well-paid courtier from this point, but may overstate the reality.Vasari; Lucco The largest fragment of the Visitation Sebastiano left unfinished; probably one of his last works, 1540s. Alnwick Castle.M&S;, 72; Lucco His friendship with Michelangelo came to an end in 1534, after a disagreement over the latter's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel. Sebastiano encouraged the pope to insist that this picture should be executed in oil on plaster, the technique he had developed and used. The enormous wall was prepared with the smooth plaster needed for this, with Michelangelo apparently acquiescent. There may even have been the idea floated that Sebastiano might do the painting to Michelangelo's designs. Michelangelo may also have tried painting in oils on the smooth surface. It is clear that several months after the idea of using oils first appeared, Michelangelo finally and furiously rejected it, and insisted that the whole wall be re-plastered in the rough arriccio needed as a base for fresco.Sistine, 178; Vasari covers this in his life of Sebastiano It was on this occasion that he famously said that oil painting was \\"an art for women and for leisurely and idle people like Fra Sebastiano\\".Vasari, \\"Life of Sebastiano del Piombo\\" (near the end) Two late projects for churches were never finished by Sebastiano. A large altarpiece of the Birth of the Virgin, still in Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome, was begun in the late 1530s but had to be finished after his death by Francesco Salviati. Before his death in 1541, the executor of Agostino Chigi's estate commissioned a large Visitation as a memorial, in Santa Maria della Pace, Rome. It was still half-finished at Sebastiano's death in 1547, and was eventually removed in the 17th century. Fragments with some of the over life-size main figures are at Alnwick Castle, in a style of impressive simplicity, the end point of a \\"tendency to over-generalize appearances and pictorial structures so that they verged on an effect of geometrical abstraction\\" that had been increasing apparent in his work since his early years in Rome.Freedburg, 226; M&S;, 70‚Äì72; Lucco Vasari records that he died after a short illness on 14 June 1547, at the age of 62. His will directed that he be buried very simply in Santa Maria del Popolo, with the savings from not having an elaborate burial given to the poor.Vasari After efforts by Daniele da Volterra his remains were moved in 1561 to the predecessor of the Rome Accademia di San Luca.

Probably 1540s.Goluld, 247; Lucco ==Technique== Portrait of Clement VII on slate, c. 1531 Sebastiano was trained in the Venetian tradition of rich, subtly varying, colours in oil painting. In the Raising of Lazarus (1517‚Äì1519) he used a very wide range of pigments, often in complicated mixtures, and the painting can be seen as a display of Venetian skill for the Roman critics, attempting to achieve \\"the greatest and most subtly varied range of colours ever seen in a single painting\\".Dunkerton, J., Howard, H. \\"Sebastiano del Piombo's Raising of Lazarus: A History of Change\\", pp. 33‚Äì44, 36 quoted, 2009, National Gallery Technical Bulletin, Vol 30, pp 26‚Äì51, online text He became less interested in colour as his career progressed, and many later works are rather sombre, with touches of bright colour. His early works generally use the Venetian technique of freehand underdrawing on the surface to be painted, no doubt following a relatively approximate sketch, as was his technique for the Kingston Lacy Judgement of Solomon.M&S;, 8 But after some years in Rome he began to use full-size cartoons for frescos, which were pricked along the lines and then soot \\"pounced\\" through, to give dotted lines on the surface for the artist to follow. This technique, normal in Florence and Rome, was used in the fresco Transfiguration of the Borgherini Chapel, for which some pricked sheets survive. However, this was his last work in fresco.Lucco; M&S;, 61 From early on he was innovative and ready to experiment in compositional details as well as technique, with a special interest in painting in oils on new surfaces, whether plaster, stone, alabaster or slate. Though tending to be dark, several of his works with these unorthodox backings have survived well. Though he often covered the whole surface, leaving no indication of the support, some of his paintings on mineral sheets leave the background unpainted. This is the case with a small head of Clement VII in Naples, wearing the beard he always had as a penance after the Sack of Rome.M&S;, 35 He made excellent drawings, nearly all as compositional sketches. He continued to prefer to draw on light blue paper in black chalk with white highlights, a Venetian habit.Lucco; M&S;, 41, 42 etc. Few if any early ones survive, and he may have changed his methods to use more precise sketches under the influence of Michelangelo and Raphael. Few survive for his portraits. A British Museum \\"curator's comment\\" on one of their late drawings notes: \\"As so often with Sebastiano's drawings, the first impression is one of unrhythmic dryness; but the suggestion of atmosphere, the sensitively drawn contemplative faces and the subtle use of reflected lights and tonal transitions leave no doubt that [this] is from his own hand.British Museum collection database, 1935,0713.2, \\"Four standing women; one in foreground with a bowl balanced on her head, ....\\", a study for the late Visitation in Sta Maria della Pace. ==Pupils== Sebastiano seems to have followed Michelangelo in painting with \\"no more than merely mechanical assistance\\" from a studio, and had no significant pupils formed in his style.Freedburg, 116 Whether this was a cause or result of his avoidance of large compositions and his court office from the 1530s we cannot know. ==Personal life and relationship with Michelangelo== Christ Carrying the Cross, about 1513‚Äì14, showing \\"how rapidly he assimilated Michelangelo's monumental treatment of the figure\\", even before they became close.S&M;, 11 The main sources for his personality and habits are Vasari and surviving letters, mostly to and from Michelangelo. Vasari knew Sebastiano, but probably not very well; although he had been compiling material for some time, the first edition of his Lives did not appear until 1550, after Sebastiano's death, and it is not clear if he had specifically discussed the biography with Sebastiano. He knew Michelangelo rather better, and his description of Sebastiano is probably heavily influenced by the hostile attitude Michelangelo had towards Sebastiano after 1534. Vasari takes up much of his Life bemoaning Sebastiano's supposed indolence and neglect of his artistic talent for a comfortable and convivial life, at least after 1531. Vasari says that in later life he lived in a fine house near the Piazza del Popolo, keeping a very good table, and often entertaining regular friends as well as visitors. He says he was always cheerful and humorous, and very good company. He became red-faced and rather fat, as the bearded portrait in the Lives suggests. As described above, he had become close to Michelangelo by about 1515. Though they eventually fell out, few people were able to remain on good terms with Michelangelo for a period of nearly twenty years. In 1519 Michelangelo became godfather to Sebastiano's first son, Luciano, after which Sebastiano addressed his letters to \\"My dearest compare\\" (\\"godfather\\").M&S;, 29, 30 The relationship suffered a dip in 1520 when Sebastiano asked Michelangelo to write to Cardinal Bibbiena, a close friend of Pope Leo X, recommending Sebastiano for projects in the Vatican after Raphael's death. Michelangelo sent the letter a month or so later, which Sebastiano presented to the cardinal, without reading it. The letter was in very flippant terms, and Sebastianio complained that it became \\"practically the only topic of conversation at the Palace, and it makes everyone laugh\\".M&S;, 31, 32 quoted Nor did it work in getting Vatican commissions. In 1521 he acted as Michelangelo's agent in the installation of the Risen Christ or Cristo della Minerva in Rome, which was botched by the assistant Michelangelo had sent.M&S;, 55 From 1525 there is a draft for an emotional letter by Michelangelo passing on praise for Sebastiano by one \\"Captain Cuio\\", who he had dined with.M&S;, 66 In 1531 Sebastiano writes a despondent letter describing how \\"I still don't feel I am the same Bastiano that I was before the Sack; I still don't feel in my right mind.\\"M&S;, 67 The relationship never recovered from the argument over the Last Judgement in 1534, described above. ==Selected works== Portrait of \\"Dorotea\\", early years in Rome ;Venetian period *Judgement of Solomon, Kingston Lacy, c. 1505‚Äì10, unfinished *Altarpiece in San Giovanni Grisostomo, Venice (c. 1509) * Organ-shutters of San Bartolomeo, Venice, now Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice *Portrait of a Young Woman as a Wise Virgin (1510) National Gallery of Art, Washington *Salome or Judith, 1510, National Gallery, London ;Roman period *Polyphemus (1511) ‚Äì fresco, Villa Farnesina, Rome *The Metamorphosis (1511) ‚Äì fresco, Villa Farnesina, Rome *Christ Carrying the Cross, c. 1513‚Äì14, Prado *Martyrdom of St. Agatha ‚Äì Palazzo Pitti, Florence *Portrait of a Man (c. 1515) ‚Äì Oil on poplar, 115 x 94 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest *Portrait of a Girl (c. 1515) ‚Äì Oil on wood, 52,5 x 42,8 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest *Portrait of a Warrior (c. 1515) *Cardinal Bandinello Sauli, His Secretary, and Two Geographers (1516) National Gallery of Art, Washington *Christ descending into Limbo ‚Äì Prado Museum, Madrid , 1516 *Transfiguration, Flagellation, saints and prophets San Pietro in Montorio, Rome , 1516‚Äì24 *A Prophet Addressed by an Angel (1516‚Äì17) National Gallery of Art, Washington *Piet√† (c. 1517) ‚Äì Panel painting, Museo Civico, Viterbo, Italy *The Raising of Lazarus (1519) National Gallery, London *Hoy Family (c. 1520) Burgos Cathedral *Portrait of a Humanist (1520) National Gallery, Washington D.C. *Portrait of Andrea Doria (1526) Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome *Portrait of Pope Clement VII, (half- length, about 1526), Museo di Capodimonte, Naples *Portrait of Clement VII (with beard, c. 1531) ‚Äì Oil on Slate 105.4 x 87.6 cm Getty Museum, Los Angeles *Portrait head of Clement VII on slate, c. 1531, Museo di Capodimonte, Naples *Birth of the Virgin ‚Äì Oil on peperino, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome, never finished *Christ Carrying the Cross (1535‚Äì1540) ‚Äì Oil on slate, 157 x 118 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest *A Lady as Saint Agatha, after 1530, as signed with \\"F.\\" for \\"Frate\\".

The story is about a young pilot named Shin Kazama and his experiences at Area 88, a mercenary air force base secluded in the desert of a war-torn country. Shin goes from head of his class at a world-renowned aviation school, dating the beautiful daughter of an airline president, to a mercenary fighter pilot bound to Area 88 by a three-year contract that he was duped into signing by a jealous and competitive childhood friend. He is determined to earn $1.5 million to buy his way out of the obligation and return home, and killing becomes second nature to him as he quickly rises to the top rank at Area 88. Overwrought with shame and self-loathing for what he has become, Shin begins to question whether he is still fighting for survival, or, like his fellow mercenaries, for the sheer excitement and camaraderie of battle. Area 88 was among the first three manga to be translated into English and published in North America. It has been adapted into an OVA in 1985, a 12-episode anime television series in 2004, and a video game in 1989 (released in North America as U.N. Squadron in 1991). It is also a brand of model aircraft in Japan. While it appeals to aviation fans for its realistic depictions of aircraft and aerial combat, it has also been critically acclaimed for its strong character development and Shintani's poignant storytelling, combining action, tragedy, romance, and comedy. In 1985, the manga received the Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çnen. ==Story== Area 88 takes place between the late 1970s to early 1980s and is largely set in a war-embroiled Middle Eastern country called the Kingdom of Asran (alternatively transcribed as \\"Aslan\\" or \\"Arslan\\"). The war uses mercenary fighter pilots, with its headquarters at a secret desert air force base called Area 88. Up-and-coming airline pilot Shin Kazama gets tricked into signing up by his \\"friend\\" Satoru Kanzaki. Facing execution for deserting from Area 88, Shin reluctantly turns into a fighter pilot and attempts to serve his three-year contract. Area 88 attracts all kinds of people with all kinds of assorted and often sordid pasts. Among the other mercenaries are Mickey Simon, an American who previously served as a fighter pilot in the United States Navy and couldn't adjust to normal life after his tour of duty in the Vietnam War. Mickey becomes Shin's best friend at Area 88. Another familiar sight at Area 88 is McCoy, a greedy weapons dealer who sells everything the mercenaries need from toilet paper to their planes. The commander of Area 88 is Arslanian Prince Saki Vashutal, though his royal heritage means nothing there. Also prominent on the base are war photographer Go \\"Rocky\\" Mutsugi (presented as Makoto Shinjou in the 2004 anime), Danish pilot Greg Gates (later featured in the video game adaptation), and the numerous pilots with whom Shin flies (most of them die over the course of the series, often in the issue in which they were introduced). Though the series focuses mostly on Shin, other characters (notably Rocky and Mickey) did have their own individual storylines. There are only three ways to leave Area 88: Survive three years, pay off a USD 1.5-million contract in bounties, or desertion, which is a capital offense. With each enemy plane brought down, Shin faces his shifting acceptance of the violence and killing that fills every day, as well as suppressing his feelings of wrongdoing. ===Time setting=== Area 88 is usually placed during the late 1970s, or early 1980s, although evidence points towards the latter in the OVA's case. First, during Act 1 of the OVA when the calendar in Shin's room is first seen, Shin marks off the date Wednesday, April 11. Then, during the flashback where Shin unknowingly signs the contract from Kanzaki, the date on the contract reads 'le 29 avril 1979' or April 29, 1979. Based on the calendar marking, it is some point past 1979, and the nearest year where April 11 falls on a Wednesday is 1984. Secondly, the OVA featured the F/A-18 Hornet, which entered service in 1983. From the OVA's conclusion it is reasonable to suggest the end date is sometime in early 1986, given Shin's term in Arslan (two years, five months). However, this is directly contradicted by a scene in the third part of the OVA in which we see a calendar in Shin's room during his discharge, on Monday, Sept. 22, 1982. It is more likely that the animators were in error, both about the days of the week, and about the date of service of the F/A-18 (although its predecessor, the YF-17 could explain the date inconsistency, considering the similarity of design). They had made a similar error with the F-14 Tomcat in the second part of the OVA, depicting the F-14 in a bombing run over Vietnam, when the plane did not see actual combat and was not capable of air- to-ground attack until the 1990s (however, it did participate in the American withdrawal from Saigon by providing fighter escort to the helicopters carrying fleeing refugees). ===Variations=== Each version of the Area 88 told slightly different variations on the same basic premise, and often shared individual story arcs. However, there are several key differences between each version, especially in the endings. The original manga ending had Shin returning to Japan, but having lost all memory of Area 88. The English-language version published by Eclipse Comics was left unfinished and incomplete: Shin does not return to Japan. The rebels, operating unmanned fighter jets from a giant, mobile base - a \\"land-carrier\\" - have targeted Area-88 with a nuclear-armed, computer controlled drilling machine. Saki, meanwhile, has acquired an American B-1B bomber armed with nuclear weapons. The first three-episode OVA adaptation from 1985 had Shin return to Area 88 in his F-20 fighter while the Area was being overrun by a devastating massive force of anti-government Mig-21 jets. His fate and those of Saki, Mickey, Greg and some other pilots is left uncertain. The 2004 anime series truncated the story to just after Shin lost his F-5E, but in that continuity Shinjou, the photographer, manages to return to Japan just in time to derail Kanzaki's plot to marry Ryoko. The series also introduced the permanent characters of Kim, from the manga, and Saki's cousin Kitori, who appeared in the manga as Seilane Balnock. Despite the consistent use of existing aircraft, the manga - unlike the anime adaptations - introduced, as the series progressed, a number of elements that may have been considered science fiction at the time but at least used existing technology. Such devices include a land-based aircraft carrier with its fleet of AI-controlled F/A-18 fighters. A rebel weapon called the Grand Slam is basically a ballistic missile modified with a drill machine. There was also other exotic weaponry, none of which appeared in either anime adaptation. ==Media== ===Manga=== The original Japanese manga of Area 88 was serialized in 23 volumes between 1979 and 1986 by Shogakukan. Each volume was black and white with a painted color cover and contained several short stories called \\"missions.\\" In all, there were 172 such missions across the 23 volumes. Sh≈çnen Sunday later repackaged the 23 volumes into ten thick books under its Wide Volume product line. Area 88, along with Mai, the Psychic Girl and The Legend of Kamui, was one of the first three manga to be translated to English and published in North America by Eclipse Comics and VIZ Media in May 1987. It was published bi-weekly with each issue containing a single mission, of which the editors had planned to release all 172. The first 28 issues featured covers from the original manga plus some original artwork by Shintani, but as these resources were limited, the covers of issues #29-36 featured stills from the OVA film. With issue #37 in December 1988, VIZ Media took over the series, and in addition to featuring photographs of actual fighter jets on the cover, the publication went from bi-weekly to monthly and the price from $1.50 to $1.75. The series did not adjust well to the dramatic change, and with issue #42 in May 1989, without resolving the storyline, it was canceled. It was later run as a feature in Viz's Animerica Magazine, but only lasted until January 1995 without the series being completed. ===OVA films=== Area 88: Original OVA Series Between February 5, 1985, and August 15, 1986, Studio Pierrot produced a direct-to-video animated film trilogy for VHS and laserdisc. In 1992, Central Park Media's U.S. Manga Corps released the OVA series, subtitled in English, in North America for VHS and laserdisc, and re-released the first volume for DVD on 14 July 2000. After Central Park Media's films license lapsed, ADV Films published a two episode theatrical edit of the OVA trilogy for DVD on 25 July 2006. Although having one less episode, the episodes themselves are longer. They have been reedited so that episode II is divided and added onto the first and the last episode respectively. As such, nothing is actually missing from the ADV collection, despite having a smaller episode count. The 2006 ADV collection is a two-DVD set, and features the original Japanese soundtrack as well as the dubbed English track, performed by the same cast who voiced the English dub of the TV series. The DVD content also includes an interview with Kaoru Shintani, and an introduction to the fighter jets portrayed in the series. Discotek Media rereleased the OVA series on October 30, 2018. ====Media==== *Area 88: Act I: Blue Skies of Betrayal (1985, VHS/LD; 1992, VHS; July 14, 2000, DVD) *Area 88: Act II: The Requirements of Wolves (1985, VHS/LD; 1992, VHS) *Area 88: Act III: Burning Mirage (1986, VHS/LD; 1992, VHS) *Area 88: Original OVA Series (July 25, 2006, DVD) ===Anime television=== An updated 12-episode anime television series with CG graphics, produced by Animax, Group TAC and Media Factory, began production in 2003 and premiered across Japan on the anime satellite television network, Animax from 8 January 2004 ‚Äì 5 March 2004, who later aired the series across its other respective networks worldwide, including Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, South Asia, South Korea, Taiwan and other regions. The series featured the work of several prominent contemporary trance music artists during combat scenes, such as Rank 1, DJ Ti√´sto, and Svenson & Gielen. ADV Films licensed the series for North American distribution, releasing the series across the region, with the first DVD volume release being published on June 22, 2005 and the last volume being released on January 17, 2006. The DVD release notably removed the licensed trance music, replacing it with a handful of original compositions by Miyake Kazunori reused across the series. For the release of the English dub to English-speaking countries, the ADR team at ADV Films sought the assistance of Capt. Kevin \\"Dumpster\\" Divers, a USAF officer, to ensure that dialogue had proper Air Force jargon. ===Video games=== A shoot 'em up video game by Capcom was released in the arcades in 1989. It was released in the West as UN Squadron. Ports were released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Super NES and ZX Spectrum. In the game, the player could choose either Shin, Mickey, or Greg as the pilot to play. Each came with a different plane and various advantages; for example, Mickey could handle air-to-air dogfights well while Greg excelled at air-to-ground attacks. Each pilot also had special abilities; Shin mastered normal weaponry at the highest speed, Mickey inflicted extra damage with his armaments, and Greg recovered from attacks almost before they occurred. The Super NES release offered six fighter planes, with the F-8 Crusader as the default aircraft. The game also included various elements from the series, such as the land carrier. In 1995, Family Soft produced two Area 88 games for the PC-9801. An October 2014 crossover update for Ace Combat: Infinity added new aircraft used by the main characters of Area 88 in the game. ===Board Game=== Two special board games based on the franchise were released in the 1980s, but as so-called \\"Coterie\\" games, which are preordered editions and only go on limited sale at Japan's Game Market trade show. With mechanics based on the GDW board game Imperium, the Area 88 in Desert War and Peace in the Aslan Kingdom have the game counters, instructions and battle map (a fictional representation of the Sinai Peninsula) printed in standard bond paper, with players left to cut up the counters and attach them and the map in cardstock. ===Toys/Model Kits=== A line of Area 88 model kits was also produced, which are basically aircraft that are painted as they appeared in the series. Takara released a 1/100 line of aircraft kits, each with a 1/24 pilot figure in the early 1980s to coincide with the original manga stories. Kits included Shin's Crusader, F-5G Tiger II and F-20 Tigershark, Mickey's F-100 and F-14, Saki's Kfir, Greg's A-10 and two planes from the Counter-Governmental Air Force - a Yak-36 Forger and a Mig-27 Flogger-D. The first release of 1/144 kits by Hasegawa in the early 1990s consisted of Mickey's F-14, Shin's F-8 and F-5, Seilane Balnock's Harrier, and Saki Vashtar's Kfir. Each kit had a 1/12 scale figure of the pilot in resin while the 1/144 plane kits were styrene plastic tooled up by Dragon models in Hong Kong. The third wave, released by Hasegawa in 1996, featured 1/72 kits of the same jets, but this time Hasegawa's own kit moldings were used. They comprised Saki's Kfir, Gregg's A-10, Shin's F-8, F-20, X-29 and Draken, and Mickey's F-14. Hasegawa also produced a 1/48 two-pack set in line with the 2004 TV series, consisting of Shin's F-8 and Mickey's F-14, plus a DVD. From January 2004 to December 2005, trading figure company The Other Corp released a line of 1/144 gashapon miniatures of various modern military aircraft that are painted as according to their actual appearance in the series, despite one of the offerings - the Su-47 Berkut - never having appeared at all. ==Soundtracks== *Area 88 Opening Theme: Mission - Fuga ==Reception== Martin A. Stever reviewed Area 88 Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 83. Stever commented that \\"The art is impressive, especially the ability to render moving jet aircraft. True to real war, characters are killed with regularity but not without remorse.\\" Anime News Network praised Area 88's English dub released by ADV, especially with most of it done with the assistance of a consultant from the US Air Force. Freetype gave the series a 7.0 out of 10, citing \\"Intense, fast, adrenaline-pumping dogfight action\\", while criticizing it for being one- dimensional for lack of some character development, lack of emphasis on action with the morals and drama watered down. ==References== ==External links== * Area 88 Website from TV Asahi * Area 88 Website from ADV Films * Category:1979 manga Category:1985 anime OVAs Category:2004 anime television series Category:ADV Films Category:Animax original programming Category:Aviation comics Category:Japanese aviation films Category:Central Park Media Category:Discotek Media Category:Group TAC Category:Kaoru Shintani Category:Pierrot (company) Category:Shogakukan manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Viz Media manga Category:Winners of the Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çnen manga ","title":"Area 88"},{"id":"1274440","text":"There are two rivers of this name in Great Britain: *River Eye, Gloucestershire, England *River Eye, Leicestershire, England ==See also== *Eye Water, a river in the Scottish Borders *Eye Brook, a river in Rutland, England ","title":"River Eye"},{"id":"1274443","text":"UMH may refer to: * Miguel Hern√°ndez University of Elche, a Spanish university, located in the province of Alicante * Underwood-Memorial Hospital, a hospital in Woodbury, New Jersey, USA * The United Methodist Hymnal * University of Mons-Hainaut, a university in the French Community of Belgium * UMH group, an international multimedia group based in Ukraine ","title":"UMH"},{"id":"1274446","text":"The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) is the largest of the twelve graduate schools of Harvard University.GSAS is the largest of Harvard's twelve graduate and professional schools when measured by the number of degree- seeking students.

The Eye Water flows on the southern outskirts of Grantshouse as it again turns SE and runs in a valley between Horseley Hill and Dalks Law alongside the A1 road and the East Coast Main Line railway. The river keeps to the SW side of the A1 passing through the villages of Reston and Ayton where it flows through a pleasant wooded valley on the Ayton Castle estate. The estate was planted with parkland trees when the present Scottish baronial style castle was built in 1851 and many of these remain around the river banks although part of the park has since been planted with mixed woodland.Historic Scotland.

North American sales ended in 2009, but Chinese production continues. The minivans were divided into three generations, 1990‚Äì1996, 1997‚Äì2005 and 2005-current. The U-body was also used for General Motors' first generation crossovers from 2001-2005. Keeping with its EPA designation as a light truck, the fifth character in the VIN for a U-body is \\"U\\", instead of the fourth, as is standard for cars. ==Minivans== ===1st Generation=== 1994-1996 Chevrolet Lumina European Pontiac Trans Sport Released in the fall of 1989 for the 1990 model year, the U platform/GMT199 utilized a galvanized steel space frame underneath composite plastic dent resistant panels similar to those used in Saturn models and the Pontiac Fiero. The vans feature unconventional styling, which some commenters likened to a DustBuster vacuum cleaner. All models used a 120-hp, 3.1L V6 mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission. In 1992, the 3800 Series I V6 became available with a four speed automatic. Both were replaced by the LA1 3400 V6 in 1996. ====1990‚Äì1996==== The vehicles in this generation included: *Chevrolet Lumina APV (\\"APV\\" was dropped from the model name in 1994) *Oldsmobile Silhouette *Pontiac Trans Sport In 1994 The Lumina and Trans Sport received a facelift, which shortened the nose and gave them a more conventional look. The Silhouette however did not receive this update. ====International==== The Pontiac Trans Sport was sold in Europe as a rebadged Oldsmobile Silhouette with European safety specifications. European customers had grown accustomed to sleek minivans, thanks to vehicles such as the Renault Espace, and did not object to the Trans Sport's futuristic styling. In 1994, when the Trans Sport was updated, the European version retained the original shape, with the Oldsmobile Silhouette being sold badged as a Pontiac Trans Sport. The European Trans Sport was also available with two options that were never offered on a North American specification U-body: A four-cylinder engine (the LD2 Quad 4) and a 5-speed manual transmission. ===2nd Generation=== Pontiac Trans Sport Montana Opel Sintra 1996-1997 Vauxhall Sintra In 1997 the second U-body (platform) minivans arrived,http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_big_test_brand/index.html also known as the GMT200.The new minivans were of unibody steel construction and the styling was intentionally conventional to such an extent that contemporary reviewers remarked that without looking closely at the badging and grille treatments, these minivans could be mistaken for their primary competitors, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, which at the time commanded a 50% share of the minivan market.http://www.trucktrend.com/roadtests/chevrolet/112_9702_1997_chevy_venture_dodge_caravan/index.html Production of this generation was performed at GM's Doraville, Georgia facility, and later at GM Shanghai. ====1996‚Äì1999 (Europe)==== *Opel/Vauxhall Sintra ====1997‚Äì2005==== The vehicles in this generation included: * Chevrolet Venture * Oldsmobile Silhouette * Pontiac Trans Sport * Pontiac Montana (Montana was a trim level of the Trans Sport prior to 1999) ====2000‚Äì2005==== * Buick GL8 (China only) ====International==== * The Opel Sintra (badged as the Vauxhall Sintra in the United Kingdom) was an export built in the US alongside other vans for the European market. The Sintra used Opel engines instead of the LA1 3400 V6 engine, that the US vans used.http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_opel_sintra_offers/ * The Buick GL8 is sold by Buick only in China. * The Pontiac Trans Sport of this generation was also sold in Europe, badged as a Chevrolet Trans Sport. ===3rd Generation=== 2005-2008 Chevrolet Uplander The U-body was updated once again (GMT-201) in 2005. These vans were referred to as \\"Crossover Sport Vans\\" (CSV) by General Motors, in reference to their SUV-inspired styling. North American vans were built in GM's plant in Doraville, Georgia. General Motors stopped minivan sales in the United States as of 2008. The Pontiac Montana and Chevrolet Uplander continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico for 2009. Production of the Buick GL8 continues in Shanghai, China. ====2005‚Äì2009==== The vehicles in this generation include: * Buick GL8 (China only, produced until 2016) * Buick Terraza * Chevrolet Uplander * Pontiac Montana SV6 (2005-2006 in the US) * Saturn Relay ===4th Generation=== Buick GL8 In 2010, Shanghai GM introduced a new version of the Buick GL8 Luxury Business Edition. The previous generation remains on sale as the Business Edition. Prior to the car's release, a concept car called the Buick Business was shown at the 2009 Shanghai Auto Show. == Crossover SUVs == 2002-2005 Pontiac Aztek In 2001 General Motors decided to produce its first entry into the Crossover SUV category using a shortened U-body platform.http://wardsdealer.com/ar/auto_pontiacs_new_aztek/ Vehicles: * 2001‚Äì2005 Pontiac Aztek * 2002‚Äì2007 Buick Rendezvous ==See also== *GM GMT platform *Doraville Assembly ==References== ==External links== * Frontal Offset of the '97 minivans.

The term has multiple uses, such as a driver who competes in an event in a series below their level of expertise to finish high. In bracket drag racing and short track motor racing when a racer has a dial-in time / qualifying speed much slower than the car can actually perform. The term can also be used to describe a fast driver who holds back during a race until just before the end, when they suddenly pass up through the field to win the event. ==Drag racing== The function of sandbagging is to guarantee a win by outperforming the slower opponent at first, and then hitting the brakes near the finish line in time to just barely beat the opponent. However, sandbaggers run the risk of beating their dial-in time, thus disqualifying them from the race. Sandbaggers must be experienced in controlling this technique, and therefore, it should not be attempted by beginners. Sandbagging faces much criticism, as many argue that it is essentially cheating. Television shows such as Pinks and bracket racing rules discourage sandbagging by creating automatic disqualification for breakouts. However, if both cars run faster than their dial-in time, the car that runs faster by the least amount is the winner. ===Example=== Racer A has a car that consistently runs a quarter-mile drag race in 12 seconds. Racer A gives a dial-in time of 15 seconds, therefore claiming that the car is 3 seconds slower than it actually is. Racer A goes against Racer B in an E.T. bracket race. In bracket races, both racers are supposedly equal since both have similar times. However, Racer B has an accurate dial-in time of 15 seconds while Racer A has an inaccurate dial-in time that gives Racer A the advantage. During the race, Racer A gets a clear advantage off the starting line. But to not be disqualified by racing faster than the dial-in time, Racer A slows near the finish line to just barely beat Racer B. ==Short track racing== The term is frequently used in for deliberately qualifying poorly at short track racing events. Some tracks/series start the fastest qualifiers at the rear of the field and the slowest qualifiers at the front of the field. So faster cars sometimes deliberately qualify poorly so they have to pass fewer cars (and only slower cars). To counteract sandbagging, tracks and series often invert some of the fastest qualifiers and start slower cars behind them. The number of cars to be inverted are typically not known to the drivers as they qualify, and often the fastest qualifier (who wins a cash bonus) will typically participate in a random drawing to determine the number of inverted cars after qualifying has concluded. Other tracks give bonus points to the fastest qualifier(s), which can drastically affect end of season awards. Still other tracks use \\"passing points\\" to reward the most cars passed in a heat race with a better chance to advance to the feature. Usually, the sandbagging is used only in shorter races where a pit stop is not used, such as heat races and in feature races of fewer than 100 laps in a United States Auto Club or World of Outlaws event. In most races of 125 laps or greater where a pit stop is required, inversion of fields is impossible because pit strategy negates the need for the inversion. To prevent sandbagging in World of Outlaws sprint car races, the winner and runner-up in each heat race, along with the two fastest qualifiers who have qualified for the feature but are not one of the top two drivers, participate in a short heat race-length race that determines the starting order for the first ten (or twelve if there are five heat races) starting positions in the feature. ==Demolition derby== In demolition derby, a driver may hit other cars weakly or avoid contact with other cars to lessen the damage to their cars to ensure better odds of surviving to win the derby as the last car running. Events often require a car to hit another car within a certain time limit, usually every 120 seconds or less, or be disqualified. ==Rallying== In some rallying series such as the World Rally Championship, the starting order in each race leg is determined by the overall standings of the previous leg. Because some track surfaces are faster once a few cars have passed, leading drivers may slow down in the final meters of the last stage of the first (and sometimes second) leg of the race and therefore let others clean the track the next leg. ==BMX racing== USA: In BMX Racing, there are typically three levels of proficiency for amateur riders (ABA: Novice, Intermediate, Expert; NBL: Rookie, Novice, Expert). Generally, a racer is considered to be sandbagging when s/he deliberately avoids winning races, thus avoiding so-called \\"move up points\\" (which require a rider to race the next highest proficiency after a given number of races won). Sandbagging in BMX Racing is often practiced to ensure the rider stays at a lower proficiency long enough to compete in the NBL or ABA Grand National (held each year in September and November, respectively). This race is traditionally when year-end titles and awards are decided. Deliberate sandbagging is difficult to prove and, though track personnel have the authority to report such activity to their respective sanctioning body, disciplinary action or involuntary reclassification is seemingly quite rare. Sandbagging is a hotly debated issue in the BMX Racing community, and is such taboo that \\"call out threads\\" are sometimes started on message boards to publicly alert others in the community of a specific rider(s) conduct. ==Video games== Sandbagging is also prevalent in some racing games, particularly those that feature power-ups that either aid the user or hinder the opponent. In the Mario Kart video game series, players will sometimes sandbag to get powerful items such as the Star or Lightning in order to batter the other racers, take shortcuts or defend themselves from other oncoming items. Team Race Sandbagging has become infamous with players holding back and getting the Lightning Item, which only affects racers on the opposing team, allowing the user's team to get a clear advantage. In Sonic & Sega All- Stars Racing, players may sandbag in order to get the powerful All-Star Moves, just to use them on the other players. ==RC Car Racing== In radio controlled car racing, participants can usually choose the classes in which they want to compete. Many tracks have levels such as rookie, sportsman, intermediate, and expert, for the same type of vehicle. So a driver may claim to be at the sportsman level when in fact they are easily fast enough to be competitive in intermediate, but they know they will have a much easier time winning if they compete in the lower class. This may happen more often at larger races that award trophies and other prizes, compared with local club races that usually award the winner only with a podium photo. Sandbagging is frowned upon by track owners and fellow competitors since it is clearly not a fair way to compete, so some race directors will bump someone up or ask them to move up if they feel they are in the wrong class. Some tracks have explicit rules where you have to bump up if you have won a certain number of races in one class. Often apparent sandbagging is not intentional, and is actually the result of someone sincerely misjudging their own skill level. This can happen if someone is new to the track and doesn't know their level in comparison to others, or if they have not competed for some time and are not sure they can immediately regain their previous skill level. ==References== ==External links== * The Path to Drag Racing Righteousness * Sandbagger \\"Call out\\" thread on a BMX Racing message board Category:Drag racing Category:Motorsport terminology ","title":"Sandbagging (racing)"},{"id":"1274514","text":"Sir William Scroggs. Sir William Scroggs (c. 162325 October 1683) was Lord Chief Justice of England from 1678 to 1681. He is best remembered for presiding over the Popish Plot trials, where he was accused of showing bias against the accused. ==Youth and early career== Scroggs was the son of an Oxford landowner; the story of him being the son of a butcher of sufficient means to give his son a university education is merely a rumour, although one which was widely believed.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot 2nd Edition Phoenix Press London 2000 p.202 He spent his youth in Stifford.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63839 He went to Oriel College, and later to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1640, having acquired a fair knowledge of the classics. There is some evidence that he fought on the royalist side during the Civil War; certainly his loyalty to the Crown was never doubted in later years. In 1653 he was called to the bar, and soon gained a good practice in the courts. He was appointed a judge of the Common Pleas in 1676. Two years later he was promoted to the office of Lord Chief Justice on the recommendation of the Earl of Danby, the King's chief minister, who was his patron, and knew that he was both a good lawyer and a staunch supporter of the Crown. His hatred of Roman Catholic priests, which was to play so large a part in the Popish Plot trials, was not a fault in the eyes of Danby, who although he was the son of a Catholic mother, adhered strongly to his father's Protestant faith. The King, although he was himself in all but outward appearance a Catholic, also accepted the need to maintain a public appearance of conformity to the Church of England, and to favour staunchly Protestant office holders. Also, like Danby he was anxious that the High Court judges should be good \\"King's men\\". ===Scroggs on Roman Catholicism=== Scroggs was noted for his violent hatred of and public outbursts against Catholic priests, of which perhaps the most notorious was: \\"they eat their God, they kill their King, and saint the murderer!\\". His attitude towards Catholic laymen was far less hostile: even in 1678, at the height of the Plot fever, he admitted that there were hundreds of honest Catholic gentlemen in England who would never engage in any conspiracy against the King. Lay Catholics who gave evidence at the Plot trials were in general accorded more courtesy than were priests: at the trial of Sir George Wakeman, Ellen Rigby, the former housekeeper of the Benedictine order's house in London, was treated by Scroggs (who was reputed to be something of a misogynist) with the utmost respect. ==Lord Chief Justice and the Popish Plot== As Lord Chief Justice, Scroggs presided at the trial of the persons denounced by Titus Oates and other informers for complicity in the fabricated \\"Popish Plot\\", and he treated these prisoners with characteristic violence and brutality, overwhelming them with sarcasm and abuse while on their trial, and taunting them when sentencing them to death. So careless was he of the rights of the accused that at one trial he admitted to the jury during his summing-up that he had forgotten much of the evidence.Kenyon pp.184-5- Kenyon points out that a judge's summing-up was then something of an ordeal since there was no facility for taking notes, so that the judge had to rely entirely on his memory of the evidence. In fairness to Scroggs, he seems to have been a sincere believer in the existence of the Plot, as was much of the general public and Parliament, but he did nothing to test the credibility of witnesses like Oates, William Bedloe, Miles Prance and Thomas Dangerfield, even though he knew well that Bedloe and Dangerfield were leading figures in the criminal underworld. He also knew that Prance had made his confession only after a threat of torture. Another leading informer, Stephen Dugdale, was arguably a case apart as he was a person of good social standing, and was generally regarded as \\"a man of sense and temper\\", with \\"something in his manner which disposed people to believe him\\". Scroggs, like many others (even the King, who was in general a complete sceptic about the veracity of the Plot), can be excused for finding his evidence credible, at least in the early stages of the Plot. ===William Staley=== In November 1678 William Staley, a young Catholic banker, was executed for treason, the precise charge being that he had \\"imagined (i.e. threatened) the King's death\\". Gilbert Burnet later made a violent attack on the character and credibility of William Carstares,Carstares is a rather shadowy figure, but he was evidently not the clergyman William Carstares, who was a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle when his namesake encountered Staley in a London tavern. the Crown's chief witness, who testified that while dining in the Black Lion Pub in Convent Garden he had heard Staley say in French: \\"the King is a great heretic...this is the hand that shall kill him\\". His speaking French (this was confirmed by another witness) attracted suspicion, although in fact it was perfectly understandable since the guest he was dining with, one Monsieur Fromante, was a Frenchman. Despite Burnet's low opinion of Carstares, it is likely enough that Staley, who was a heavy drinker, had made this threat against the King when he was inebriated, but in less disturbed times he could have hoped to escape with a severe reprimand.Wild speeches by Roman Catholics were not uncommon during the reign of Charles II, but in normal times \\"most magistrates were sensibly content to bind the offenders over to keep the peace\\": Kenyon p.13 Scroggs in his summing up did tell the jury that in case of a man's life he would have no regard paid to \\"the rumours and disorders of the time\\" but the rest of his charge was wholly in favour of a guilty verdict, which the jury duly brought in without even leaving the box. Staley was hung, drawn and quartered, but as a gesture of clemency the Government released his body to his family for proper burial. The family unwisely had a series of requiem masses said for his soul, followed by a magnificent funeral at the Anglican St. Paul's Church, Convent Garden. The Government, infuriated, ordered that Staley's body be dug up and quartered, and his head cut off and placed on London Bridge.Kenyon pp.112-3 ===Edward Colman=== A week later Edward Colman, former private secretary to the Duke of York, was executed for his allegedly treasonable correspondence with Louis XIV of France. Again Scroggs drove hard for a conviction, despite Colman's standing as a Government official. Colman's letters, in which he urged Louis to press Charles II for a dissolution of Parliament, by bribery if necessary, showed a grave lack of political judgement, but it was straining the law very far to call them treasonable. The correspondence, which had apparently ended in 1674 or 1675, had no effect whatever on English foreign policy, and was of such little importance that Colman until he was confronted with the letters after his arrest had apparently forgotten writing them. Scroggs told Colman that he had been condemned on his own papers; this was fortunate for the Crown, since the evidence of Oates and Bedloe of overt acts of treason was so feeble that Scroggs in his summing-up simply ignored it.Kenyon pp.131-143 Scroggs later boasted that he had hanged Colman \\"against the will of the Court\\", but in fact it seems that the King was happy enough to sacrifice Colman, whom he had long regarded as a troublemaker. ===Berry, Green and Hill=== At the trial in February 1679 of the prisoners Henry Berry, Robert Green, and Lawrence Hill, accused of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, Scroggs gave a characteristic exhibition of his methods, indulging in a tirade against the Roman Catholic religion, and loudly proclaiming his belief in the guilt of the accused. When Lawrence Hill's wife boldly accused Miles Prance, the Crown's chief witness, of perjury in open court, Scroggs said incredulously \\"You cannot think that he will swear three men out of their lives for nothing?\\".Kenyon p. 166 All three defendants were put to death. As Mrs. Hill had correctly predicted, Prance later confessed that he had perjured himself under the threat of torture and that the three men executed were wholly innocent. ==Scroggs turns against the Plot== It was only when, in July of the same year, Oates's accusation against the Queen's physician, Sir George Wakeman, appeared likely to involve the Queen herself in the ramifications of the plot, that Scroggs began to think matters were going too far; he was probably also influenced by the discovery that the Court regarded the plot with disbelief and disfavour, and that the Country Party led by Lord Shaftesbury had less influence than he had supposed with the King. The Chief Justice on this occasion threw doubt on the trustworthiness of Bedloe and Oates as witnesses, and warned the jury to be careful in accepting their evidence. Wakeman and three priests, including the leading Benedictine Maurus Corker, who were tried with him, were duly acquitted. Scroggs for the first time observed that even a Catholic priest might be innocent of anything but being a priest (which was itself a capital crime under the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, although Corker and the others were spared the death penalty, and were all released after spending some time in jail).Kenyon pp. 192-201 This inflamed public opinion against Scroggs, for the popular belief in the plot was still strong. He was accused of taking bribes from the Portuguese Ambassador, the Marquis of Arronches, acting on behalf of the Portuguese-born Queen, to secure Wakeman's acquittal. In the circumstances, the decision of the Ambassador to call on Scroggs the day after the trial to thank him for securing an acquittal has been described as an act of \\"incredible folly'.Kenyon p.202 In August 1679 the King fell desperately ill at Windsor, and for some days his life was despaired of. Scroggs, fearing for his future, rushed to Windsor to find the King making a slow recovery: seeing Scroggs hovering anxiously in the background, the King told him that he had nothing to fear: \\"for we shall stand or fall together\\". Scroggs continued in his poor treatment of Catholic priests who came before him for trial, as he showed when he sentenced Andrew Bromwich to death at Stafford in the summer of 1679 (although it must be said that he recommended Bromwich for mercy, and he was duly reprieved). Nevertheless, his proposing the Duke of York's health at the Lord Mayor's dinner a few months later, in the presence of Shaftesbury, indicated his determination not to support the Exclusionists against the known wishes of the King. At the opening of the Michaelmas Term he delivered a speech on the need for judicial independence: \\"the people ought to be pleased with public justice and not justice seek to please the people... justice should flow like a mighty stream... neither for my part do I think we live in so corrupted an age that no man can with safety be just and follow his own conscience.\\" Kenyon remarks that whatever Scroggs's faults, this speech shows that he was far more than the \\"brainless bully\\" he is sometimes portrayed as.Kenyon p.212 ===Scroggs and Samuel Pepys=== When Samuel Pepys was accused of treason, Scroggs, no doubt mindful that both Charles II and his brother the Duke of York had a high regard for Pepys, treated him with the utmost courtesy, and he never actually stood trial. As a result, the picture of Scroggs in Pepys's third diary, the so-called King's Bench Journal, is surprisingly favourable.Knighton, C.S. Pepys's Later Diaries, Sutton Publishing Ltd. Gloucester 2004 p.46 Pepys was particularly impressed by a remark of Scroggs that Pepys and his co-accused Sir Anthony Deane were Englishmen and \\"should have the rights of Englishmen\\".Knighton p.55 Scroggs had already directed the acquittal of Pepys's clerk Samuel Atkins on the charge of having conspired to murder Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a charge which was clearly designed to damage Pepys himself. Scroggs conducted Atkins's trial with refreshing humanity and good humour. When Atkins's alibi witness, Captain Vittles, testified that Atkins had drunk so much wine on the night in question that he could not possibly have killed anyone, Scroggs, himself a notably heavy drinker, cheerfully said: \\"Do you both go out and share another bottle of wine\\".Kenyon p.168 ==Last years on the Bench== Acting in the assurance of popular sympathy, Oates and Bedloe now arraigned the Chief Justice before the Privy Council for having discredited their evidence and misdirected the jury in the Wakeman case, accusing him at the same time of several other misdemeanours on the bench, including a habit of excessive drinking and foul language (the charge of heavy drinking at least was probably true enough). In January 1680 the case was argued before the Council and Scroggs was acquitted. Scroggs repeated the attacks he had made on Oates' credibility at Wakeman's trial, and the King expressed his full confidence in him. At the trials of Elizabeth Cellier and of Lord Castlemaine in June of the same year, both of whom were acquitted, he discredited Dangerfield's evidence, calling him \\"a notorious villain ... he was in Chelmsford gaol\\", and on the former occasion committed the witness to prison. In the same month he discharged the grand jury of Middlesex before the end of term in order to save the Duke of York from indictment as a popish recusant, a proceeding which the House of Commons declared to be illegal, and which was made an article in the impeachment of Scroggs in January 1681. The dissolution of Parliament put an end to the impeachment, but the King now felt secure enough to dispense with his services, and in April Scroggs, much it seems to his own surprise, was removed from the bench, although with a generous pension. He retired to his country home at South Weald in Essex; he also had a town house at Chancery Lane in London, where he died on 25 October 1683. ==Family== Memorial of Elizabeth Scroggs, Lincoln Cathedral Scroggs married Anne Fettyplace (d.1689), daughter of Edmund Fettyplace of Berkshire: they had four children: *Sir William Scroggs junior (died 1695), who like his father was a barrister *Mary (died 1675) *Anne (d.1713), who married as his third wife Sir Robert Wright, who like her father became Lord Chief Justice of England but died in prison after the Glorious Revolution *Elizabeth (died 1724), who married firstly Anthony Gylby and secondly Charles Hatton, younger son of Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton. Little is known of Scrogg's family life, although given the frequent references, not all of them by his enemies, to his drunkenness and \\"debauched lifestyle\\", it is unlikely to have been happy. His opinion of his wife, and of women in general, may perhaps be inferred from an irritable remark he made at the trial for treason of the barrister Richard Langhorne in 1679. Despite objections from William Bedloe, Scroggs permitted female observers like Mary, Lady Worcester to take notes of the evidence, on the ground that \\"a woman's notes will not signify, truly - no more than her tongue\\". On the other hand, at Wakeman's trial he treated Ellen Rigby, housekeeper at the Benedictine house in London, with great respect, and told the jury to treat her evidence for the defence as credible, perhaps a tribute to her forceful personality. ==Personality and lifestyle== Scroggs was a judge at a time when many members of the High Court Bench were considered corrupt and unfair, and his temper and treatment of defendants were an example of the endemic problems with the judiciary, whose coarse and brutal manners shocked most educated laymen. He served on the bench during the same period as Judge Jeffreys who has been criticised for similarly poor treatment of defendants and witnesses. Kenyon notes that while their behaviour in Court seems \\"degrading and disgusting\\" by modern standards, at the time it was taken for granted: \\"the judges' manners were rough because they were a rough lot\\".Kenyon p.133 Scroggs was the subject of many contemporary satires; he was reputed to live a debauched lifestyle, he was undoubtedly a heavy drinker, and his manners during trials were considered 'coarse' and 'violent'.Kenyon pp. 133-4Roger North, who knew him well, described him as a man of great wit and fluency, but \\"scandalous, violent, intemperate and extreme\\". Forty years after his death, Jonathan Swift in his celebrated attack on William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, called him \\"as vile and profligate a villain as Scroggs\\". ==Legal writings== Scroggs was the author of a work on the Practice of Courts-Leet and Courts-Baron (published posthumously in London, 1701), and he edited reports of the state trials over which he presided. ==Authorities== *William Cobbett, Complete Collection of State Trials (vols. i.-x. of State Trials, 33 vols, London, 1809) *Roger North, Life of Lord Guilford, etc., edited by A Jessopp (3 vols, London, 1890), and Examen (London, 1740) *Narcissus Luttrell, A Brief Relation of State Affairs, 1678-1714 (6 vols, Oxford, 1857) *Anthony √† Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, edited by P Bliss (4 vols, London, 1813‚Äì1820) *Correspondence of the Family of Hatton, edited by Edward Maunde Thompson (2 vols, Camden Society 22, 23, London, 1878) *Lord Campbell, Lives of the Chief Justices of England (3 vols, London, 1849‚Äì1857) *Edward Foss, The Judges of England (9 vols, London, 1848‚Äì1864) *Sir JF Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England (3 vols, London, 1883) *Harry Brodribb Irving, Life of Judge Jeffreys (London, 1898). *John Philipps Kenyon The Popish Plot Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 ==See also== *Weald Hall ==References== * Category:1623 births Category:1683 deaths Category:Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales Category:Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:People associated with the Popish Plot Category:People from Stifford Category:Justices of the Common Pleas ","title":"William Scroggs"},{"id":"1274532","text":"Lewandowski (; feminine Lewandowska, plural Lewandowscy) is a Polish-language surname.

The name is derived from the personal name \\"Szymon\\" and the characteristic Slavic suffix \\"-ski\\", meaning \\"son of\\". Thus, the name Szyma≈Ñski means \\"son of Szymon\\". This surname was originally derived from the Hebrew personal name SHIMON, and in many vernacular versions of the Old Testament the name is usually rendered as SIMEON. In the New Testament, however, the name is normally rendered as Simon, partly as a result of an association with the Greek byname SIMOS, meaning snub-nosed. The name has spread to England, France, Germany, Holland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the U.S.A., and the name has been in use as a given name in Western Europe from the Middle Ages onwards. The name was no doubt popular because of its associations with the apostle Simon Peter, the brother of Andrew. In Britain, there was confusion from an early date with the Anglo-Scandinavian form of Sigmund, a name whose popularity was reinforced at the time of the Norman Conquest of 1066, by the Norman form of Simmund. ==Notable people== * Adam Szyma≈Ñski, Polish writer * Antoni Szyma≈Ñski, Polish Army general * Beata Szyma≈Ñska, Polish poet and writer * Boleslaw Szymanski, computer scientist * Damian Szyma≈Ñski, Polish footballer * Frank Szymanski, football player * Grzegorz Szyma≈Ñski, Polish volleyball player * Halina Szyma≈Ñska, Polish spy * Henry Szymanski, American wrestler * Ignacy Szyma≈Ñski, Polish soldier * Jake Toranzo Szymanski, film & TV actor * Jakub Szyma≈Ñski, Polish volleyball player * Jakub Szymanski, Czech handball player * Jan Szyma≈Ñski, Polish speed skater * Jan Szyma≈Ñski, Polish wrestler * J√≥zef Szyma≈Ñski, Polish bobsledder * Karol Szyma≈Ñski, Polish footballer * Konrad Szyma≈Ñski, Polish politician * Krystyna Szyma≈Ñska-Lara, Polish basketball player * Marcin Szyma≈Ñski, Polish footballer * Marija ≈†imanska, Latvian chemist * Pawe≈Ç Szyma≈Ñski, Polish composer * Roman Szyma≈Ñski, Polish political activist * Timothy Szymanski, a United States Navy Flag Officer ==References== Category:Polish-language surnames Category:Patronymic surnames ","title":"Szyma≈Ñski"},{"id":"1274545","text":"__NOTOC__ { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"  ==Deaths== * 26 Tom Haller * 26 Bill Alley * 17 Mikael Ljungberg * 17 Alexander Ragulin * 12 Mike Smith * 9 Emlyn Hughes * 8 Eddie Charlton * 6 Johnny Warren * 3 Sergei Zholtok * 2 Gerrie Knetemann } ==November 30, 2004== *College football: Notre Dame fires head coach Tyrone Willingham in the third year of a five-year contract.

His death was a homicide, although whether the killing was murder or manslaughter was a matter of considerable public debate at the time. ==Biography== Dangerfield was born about 1650 at Waltham Abbey, Essex, the son of a farmer. At the age of about 12 in about 1662, he ran away from home to London, and never returned to his home. He began his career of crime by robbing his father of both horses and money, and, after a rambling life, which brought him to Scotland, France, Spain and Portugal, took to coining counterfeit money, for which offence and numerous others he was many times imprisoned: it was said later that to describe his career one need simply list every capital crime known to English law. Kenyon, J. P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.216 Lord Chief Justice Scroggs later referred to him with contempt as \\"that fellow from Chelmsford gaol\\", and he also spent time in Newgate Prison.Kenyon p.227 He used a number of aliases, most commonly Willoughby.Kenyon p.216 ==Popish Plot== False to everyone, he first tried to involve James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth and others by concocting information about a Presbyterian plot against the throne, and this having been proved a lie, he pretended to have discovered a Catholic plot against Charles II. This was known as the Mealtub Plot, from the place where the incriminating documents were hidden at his suggestion, and found by the King's officers by his information.Kenyon p.216 Mrs Elizabeth Cellier, in whose house the meal tub was found, was a well- known Roman Catholic midwife and almoner to Elizabeth Herbert, Marchioness of Powis. She had rescued Dangerfield from a debtors' prison and befriended him when he posed as a Catholic. She was, with her patroness Lady Powis, tried for high treason but acquitted in 1680: with the general waning of hysteria, men as disreputable as Dangerfield were no longer considered to be credible witnesses. Kenyon p.228 For a time Dangerfield was used as a secondary witness in the Popish Plot trials to supplement the evidence of Titus Oates and William Bedloe. However his character was so unsavoury, even compared to that of the other informers, that Chief Justice William Scroggs, who knew his record of crime thoroughly, began instructing juries to disregard the evidence of \\"so notorious a villain.... I shall shake all such fellows before I am done\\". When Dangerfield protested that he had sincerely repented of his former crimes, Scroggs, who did not tolerate interruptions in his Court, roared: \\"What, do you with all the mischief that Hell hath in you, dare to brave it in a court of justice?\\" Kenyon pp.227-8 Dangerfield, when examined at the bar of the House of Commons, made other charges against prominent Roman Catholics, and attempted to defend his character by publishing, among other pamphlets, Dangerfield's Narrative. ==Murder== The publication of his Narrative led, once public opinion had turned against the informers, to his trial for libel, (Kenyon notes that he could not as the law stood be tried for perjury as no- one had actually been convicted on his evidence.)Kenyon p.295 Dangerfield went into hiding in 1684 as soon as he heard about the threatened trial, but when James succeeded as King on February 1685 the new Government made a determined search for him, and found him. On 20 June 1685 he received sentence to stand in the pillory on two consecutive days, be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate, and two days later from Newgate to Tyburn.Kenyon p.295 On his way back from the first whipping on 22 June Dangerfield, who rather surprisingly was travelling by coach, got into an argument at Hatton Garden with a barrister, Robert Francis, who made a jeering remark. Dangerfield in return spat on him, whereupon Francis struck Dangerfield in the eye with his cane: the cane apparently entered the brain, and Dangerfield died shortly afterwards from the blow.Howelll State Trials London 1811 Vol. XI p.505 Francis was tried and convicted for murder, and sentenced to death.State Trials p.506 Several witnesses testified that he had deliberately stabbed at Dangerfield's eye, and there was also evidence that he had said something to the effect that \\"he would save the hangman the trouble of killing Dangerfield\\".State Trials p.506 Nonetheless the verdict of murder came as something of a surprise to the public, the general view being that the death \\"could scarce be even called manslaughter\\". King James II was solicited strongly to give Francis a royal pardon, but, despite his low opinion of Dangerfield, he said that it would be wrong to let his murderer go unpunished, and Francis was duly executed.State Trials p.506 ==The Narrative- aftermath== In 1684 Sir William Williams, later Solicitor General, who as Speaker of the House of Commons had authorised the publication of Dangerfield's Narrative in 1680, was heavily fined for a libel on James II and another on Lord Peterborough as a result. James, with more magnaminity then he usually showed to political opponents, reduced both fines, and later restored Williams to royal favour and appointed him Solicitor General.Milne-Tyte, Robert Bloody Jeffreys-the Hanging Judge 1989 Andr√© Deutsch p.188 ==In fiction== He is the subject, and perhaps the author, of Don Tomazo, or The Juvenile Rambles of Thomas Dangerfield (1680), a comic, self- consciously literary novel that presents Dangerfield as a clever and resourceful rogue.

It describes a dystopian society with extremely limited freedoms tightly regulated by a totalitarian state in the name of saving society from the sexually transmitted diseases. The world's population is tightly segregated with the infected living somewhere on the \\"outside\\" presumably in deplorable conditions and left to their own devices. The presumed anarchy and privation will lead to the natural elimination of the diseases when all the human carriers are dead. Moral value has been placed on disease with the infected being treated as having brought the trouble onto themselves. The infected are condemned and are left to perish with no assistance offered from the \\"inside\\". Minimal detail is supplied about the \\"outside\\" world and it is referred to only indirectly and reflected in the fears of the healthy inside population. The \\"inside\\" presumably healthy population lives under extreme duress and gender roles appear to be breaking down. The veiled reference to a \\"turkey baster\\" as necessary ingredient to maintain a semblance of a marriage is provided toward the end of the story. The story supplies few details but succeeds in painting the mood and the context of the world in highly vivid colors. The sense of paranoia and anxiety and fear of the \\"healthy\\" population is omnipresent and overwhelming. Religious, totalitarian, radical evangelical currents run through the story and appear to question or perhaps mock the current system. ==Publication History== * Northern Suns: The New Anthology of Canadian Science Fiction == See also == * The Handmaid's Tale, a dystopian novel with related themes, by the same author Category:1986 short stories Category:Short stories by Margaret Atwood ","title":"Freeforall"},{"id":"1274556","text":"Christopher Daugherty (born August 29, 1970) is an American construction worker and reality TV personality known for winning Survivor: Vanuatu, the ninth season of the American series, Survivor. ==Early life== Daugherty was born August 29, 1970, and grew up in West Jefferson, Ohio. He attended Madison-Plains High School near London, Ohio, and then attended Kentucky Christian College for two years. Some of the first jobs he ever held include heavy equipment operator, for his father's drainage company, and sporting goods store employee. He eventually went to work for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) as a road builder. ==Survivor== In 2004, Daugherty competed on Survivor: Vanuatu, the ninth season of the American reality TV series Survivor. As part of the all-male Lopevi tribe, Daugherty endangered his position in the game in the first immunity challenge. Daugherty failed to cross the balance-beam in the challenge, which led to victory for the all- female Yasur tribe. The more athletic members of the Lopevi tribe campaigned for Daugherty to be the first to go, but he formed an alliance of unathletic men‚Äîsometimes referred to as the \\"Fat Five\\"‚Äîled by Lea \\"Sarge\\" Masters and also consisting of himself, Travis \\"Bubba\\" Sampson, Rory Freeman, and Chad Crittenden. This alliance controlled the numbers and targeted the younger players, voting out Brook Geraghty at the first Tribal Council. Lopevi then went on to win immunity in the second episode. In episode three, both tribes were informed they would be going to Tribal Council. When John Kenney won individual immunity, the \\"Fat Five\\" alliance targeted John \\"J.P.\\" Palyok and he was voted out. When Lopevi lost immunity in the next episode, the alliance once again got rid of another younger male, Brady Finta. In Episode Five, a tribal shuffle resulted in the \\"Fat Five\\" losing Sampson and Freeman to Yasur and gaining two women, Twila Tanner and Julie Berry. This new-Lopevi tribe won the next two immunity challenges. This, however, meant the loss of Sampson as the women of Yasur voted him out. When Lopevi lost immunity in Episode Seven, Daugherty, Masters, and Crittenden recruited Tanner and Berry to vote out the last younger male, Kenney (who, in his farewell speech, expressed his desire to see Daugherty win the game). The two tribes would eventually merge into the Alinta tribe. Daugherty, Crittenden, and Masters reunited with old ally Freeman. This four-man alliance believed that Tanner and Berry would side with them. However, those two ladies joined their old Yasur allies Ami Cusack, Leann Slaby, Scout Cloud Lee and Eliza Orlins to vote off Freeman, when Masters won immunity. The six-female alliance then targeted Masters voting him out next, with even Daugherty casting a vote for him to let the women know he was a team player. The female alliance stuck together once again and voted out Crittenden over Daugherty. At that point, it seemed like Daugherty's time in the game was over, as he was the only surviving male. However, his performance and determination in the immunity challenge caused Cusack and her alliance to keep him around one more episode while planning to vote out tribal annoyance Orlins. But Tanner and Lee, not happy with their positions in the game, hatched a new plan. Together they approached him about a new alliance. Daugherty, Tanner and Lee lured in Orlins, the next target, and this new alliance successfully eliminated Cusack's closest ally Slaby. The cross-tribal alliance targeted Slaby because Cusack would not surrender immunity. Cusack, knowing her days were numbered, tried to convince Orlins and Daugherty to join her and Berry in an alliance against Tanner and Lee. While it seemed as though Orlins might defect, in the end she stayed strong and the four voted out Cusack. Daugherty then struck a deal with Berry and Orlins to vote with them against Tanner. However, at Tribal Council, he sided with Tanner and Lee once again to vote Berry out instead, because she was too well liked by the female- dominated jury and because she had previously betrayed him at the merge by voting out Freeman. In the \\"final four\\" finale, Daugherty again convinced Orlins that he was in an alliance with her, despite his obvious alliance with Tanner and Lee. He decided she was a flip-flopper and too much of a risk, and voted her out. Then he won the final immunity, securing him a place in the Final Two. Comments by Lee at the challenge led him to believe that Tanner would not have been true to him and their Final Two pact, had she won. He confronted Lee about the issue, and she said she didn't have a Final Two alliance with Tanner, in the hopes that he would spare Lee instead of Tanner. At Tribal Council, Daugherty voted out Lee, choosing Tanner to join him in the Final Two. In the end, Daugherty beat out Tanner in a 5‚Äì2 vote to become the Sole Survivor. He gained the votes of Masters, Crittenden, Slaby, Berry and Orlins and only lost the votes of Lee and Cusack. Many of his votes came from female jury members who were able to look past his gender and recognize his strong gameplay against the unpopular and controversial Tanner, whom he was well-aware had made many enemies in the game. ==In other media== In 2007, Daugherty was mentioned by author Lamont Lindstrom in his essay about Vanuatuan life and culture. In it, Lindstrom suggests that Daugherty's victory, despite being outnumbered six-against-one at the Final Seven, has many parallels with particular myths of matriarchy in which women ruled ancient societies until the female ruling class tore itself apart, thus allowing the men to take power. ==Personal life== After his appearance on Survivor, Daugherty returned to his home in South Vienna, Ohio, and his construction job at ODOT. On February 13, 2005, he married his fianc√©e Lorie Groves (who made a brief appearance on the show during the \\"loved ones visit\\") in Victory Lane at Daytona International Speedway. That same year, Lorie was diagnosed with breast cancer. The Daughertys fought her disease together, and after her recovery, they became involved in various forms of charity work, helping out cancer patients and autistic children. Also in 2005, Daugherty asked for vacation time from ODOT to participate in a European promotional tour for Survivor. As he had too little vacation time left, he submitted a doctor's note that claimed Daugherty needed one month off from work due to anxiety and depression. He was suspended from work for 20 days without pay after investigators discovered it was just an excuse to appear at Survivor- related activities abroad. ODOT has offered to reduce the suspension to 15 days if he agreed not to file an appeal, but he refused. After disputing the suspension, an Ohio arbitrator ruled in Daugherty's favor and he was reimbursed his pay for the 20-day suspension. As of 2012, Daugherty was still working for ODOT, as a project inspector. ==References== ==External links== *Official CBS biography page Category:1970 births Category:American builders Category:Kentucky Christian University alumni Category:Living people Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:People from Clark County, Ohio Category:Survivor (American TV series) winners Category:People from West Jefferson, Ohio ","title":"Chris Daugherty"},{"id":"1274565","text":"Wojciechowski (; feminine: Wojciechowska ; plural Wojciechowscy ) is the 16th most common surname in Poland (66,879 people in 2009)Ministry of Interior (Poland).

He was probably the son of Isaac Bedloe, himself the son of an Irish Army officer, and a cousin of William Kemys (or Kemish), who became High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1678.Jeremy Knight, Civil War & Restoration in Monmouthshire, 2005, Logaston Press, , p.161 He appears to have been well educated; he was certainly clever, and after moving to London in 1670 he became acquainted with some Jesuits and was occasionally employed by them. Calling himself now Captain Williams, now Lord Gerard or Lord Newport or Lord Cornwallis, he travelled from one part of Europe to another, usually accompanied by his brother James. In the 1670s he was gaoled for fraudAlan Marshall, 'Bedloe, William (1650‚Äì1680)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004 and became an expert in all kinds of duplicity. The historian John Kenyon described him as \\"an experienced member of a London underworld of crime and vice of which we know almost nothing\\".Kenyon Popish Plot p.308 Then in 1678, following the lead of Titus Oates, he gave an account of a supposed Popish Plot to the English government, and his version of the details of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was rewarded with ¬£500. Kenyon concluded that while Bedloe probably had no direct knowledge about Godfrey's murder, he had learned enough about it from his extensive contacts in the criminal underworld to tell a convincing story.Kenyon p.152 His record as a confidence trickster was so notorious that he chose to dwell on it, explaining that it was his career as a criminal which enabled him to give first-hand evidence about the plotters. While some Government officials, like Henry Coventry, were wary of relying on the testimony of such a notorious criminal, the general view was that he was too valuable as a corroborative witness to Oates to be disregarded.Kenyon p.106 In the event his testimony was usually of little value, apart from the trial of Berry, Green and Hill for Godfrey's murder, of which he may have had some personal knowledge: as a witness he was rambling and incoherent, and had a habit of dragging in irrelevant grievances and private feuds. At most of the Plot trials, like that of Edward Colman, his evidence was so weak that the Court disregarded it.Kenyon p.134 Emboldened by his success he denounced various Roman Catholics, married an Irish lady, Anna Purefoy, and having become very popular lived in luxurious fashion. Afterwards his fortunes waned, and he died at Bristol on 20 August 1680. His dying depositions, which were taken by Sir Francis North, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, revealed nothing of importance. Bedloe wrote a Narrative and impartial discovery of the horrid Popish Plot (1679), but all his statements are untrustworthy. Lady Worcester, whose husband was an indirect target of Bedloe's accusations called him \\"a man whose whole life has been pageantry and villainy and whose word would not have been taken at sixpence\\". At Oates's trial for perjury, some years after Bedloe's death, Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, who had condemned innocent men on Bedloe's accusations, called him \\"infamous Bedloe\\".Kenyon p.292 ==References == ==Sources == *Pollock, John.

He attended Murrumbeena High School and was co-editor of the school magazine. ==Career== Trevorrow first came to prominence in the cabaret duo Globos with Wendy De Waal, and they scored two Australian Top 20 hits with quirky covers of \\"Tintarella di luna\\" (1982) and Sonny & Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\" (1983), both of which were produced by Red Symons. In 1984 he formed a comedy duo in with Cathy Armstrong, in which his flamboyant alter ego Bob Downe was born. \\"Bob Downe\\" is a cheesy, safari-suit-wearing lounge singer with dazzling teeth, and host of the fictional regional daytime TV show Good Morning Murwillumbah.http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/2001/bobvan.htm ABC TV: Bob Downe & Vanessa Wagner - guest programmer profiles The distinction between the two personae is often blurred: Trevorrow and the \\"Prince of Polyester\\" both appear at events and host television programs. In January 1987, Trevorrow went solo with the character at Sydney's Harold Park Hotel. In 1988 he took Bob Downe to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he was a huge and instant success. Bob Downe played throughout the 1990s to ever-larger British audiences, with Trevorrow in perpetual commute between London and Sydney, touring nationally in both countries. With a multitude of UK TV credits under his beige belt, Bob Downe made his twelfth Edinburgh Fringe appearance in 2002. Back in Australia, the first Bob Downe album, Greatest Hits, was released in Australia in 1996, with 1997's Jazzy! nominated for a Best Comedy Album ARIA music award. 1998 saw the Australian publication of his first book, All Bob Downe! (Penguin) and he hosted the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade broadcast for Network Ten. In 1999 and 2000, Bob Downe again hosted the Mardi Gras Parade, a consistent ratings winner for Network Ten, and also won the Cabaret Artiste of the Year at the Green Room Awards in Melbourne. He released his third album, Huge Hits, in 2001. His comedy/chat series, The Bob Downe Show (Foxtel/TV1), went to air in December 2000. Bob Downe's last three national theatre tours, Million Sellers (1999), Whiter! Brighter! (2000) and Cold August Night (2002) were sellouts everywhere, including the Sydney Opera House and the State Theatre. In 2001, Trevorrow made his first appearance as himself rather than his alter ego, opening a new show at the Black Cat cabaret in Melbourne. The show also appeared at the Sydney Opera House Studio in 2003, followed by a studio album It's About Time in 2004 (ABC Music/Universal). Trevorrow has appeared on the Australian series of Good News Week, often joining with host Paul McDermott in a sing-along of an Australian song at the end of the episode. He has collaborated several times with the Doug Anthony All Stars (which included McDermott), appearing in their TV series, DAAS Kapital, and their film The Edinburgh Years. He has also featured in episodes of the sitcom Kath & Kim, as well as hosting the series The Way We Were, and has appeared in the animated Australian/Canadian sitcom, Quads! as the voice of Spalding (SBS 2002). Trevorrow is a regular fill-in presenter on the \\"Evening Show\\" on 702 ABC Sydney. He has also been a contestant on the special Australia's Brainiest Comedian. == References == ==External links== * Official website Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Australian male comedians Category:Australian television personalities Category:Comedians from Melbourne Category:Gay entertainers Category:LGBT entertainers from Australia Category:LGBT comedians Category:LGBT broadcasters from Australia Category:People from the Northern Rivers ","title":"Mark Trevorrow"},{"id":"1274570","text":"Yarragon railway station is located on the Gippsland line, in Victoria, Australia.

Her father worked as a chartered accountant. She attended Sacr√© C≈ìur School with fellow comedian Jane Turner in Glen Iris, and then studied Arts/Law at the University of Melbourne, where she resided at Newman College. At university, she began to perform in university revues, and auditioned for performing arts courses at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, the Victorian College of the Arts and the University of Melbourne, but was not successful in gaining entry to any of them. ==Career== Downey first rose to prominence in the sketch comedy program The D-Generation on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in the late 1980s. She subsequently appeared in later sketch comedy series with other members of The D-Generation, including Fast Forward, Full Frontal and Something Stupid. In these, she was known for her portrayals of a news anchor, a stern SBS presenter and for her spot-on impression of current affairs host Jana Wendt. Her spoof of \\"The What's On SBS Presenter\\" satirised the eccentricity of SBS programming, displaying grim masochistic determination to \\"not miss a moment of this scintillating entertainment\\". Downey starred in the 2001 Network 10 comedy series Sit Down, Shut Up, playing the role of Principal Sue; American comedian Kenan Thompson repeated Downey's role in the 2009 American Fox television re-make of the original Australian series, produced and written by Mitch Hurwitz, of Arrested Development fame. In 2005, Downey was cast as a regular player in Seven's live comedy sketch show Let Loose Live, but the show was cancelled after just two episodes due to low ratings. The following year, she appeared in the sketch show Magda's Funny Bits alongside Magda Szubanski. In this show, she recreated her role as infomercial host Janelle, first developed on Fast Forward. In 2018, she voiced Stanley \\"Stan\\" Stinkleton and the narrator in the kids TV series, Kitty Is Not a Cat. ===Comedy style=== Downey's television roles are often authority figures or professional women with slightly eccentric personalities, such as Principal Sue in Sit Down, Shut Up and the \\"relationship-counselor\\" Marion seen in comedy series Kath & Kim. On Fast Forward, Marg Downey appeared in a lot of sketches with Steve Vizard, such as Eyeball News, The Midday Show, Candid Camera, The Cosby Show and Get Smart. Downey also played Clancy in the Skippy send-up, and appeared in send- ups of I Dream Of Jeannie, Mr Ed and Bewitched. ==Select filmography== * Open Slather (2015) ‚Äì various characters *Kath & Kimderella (2012) *Very Small Business (2008) *Magda's Funny Bits (2006) *Let Loose Live (2005) *Kath & Kim (2002‚Äì2004) *Under the Radar (2004) *The Real Thing (2002) *Blue Heelers (1995‚Äì2002) *Gloria's house (2000) *Queen of the Damned (Talamascan) (2002) *The Bob Downe Show (2001) *Sit Down Shut Up (2001) *The Late Report (1999) *Something Stupid (1998) *The Silver Brumby (1994-1998) *Economy Class (1994) *Full Frontal (1993) *Bligh (1992) *The D Generation Goes Commercial (1988‚Äì1989) *Fast Forward (1989) *The D-Generation (1986‚Äì1987) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Australian women comedians Category:Australian television actresses Category:Living people Category:1961 births Category:Comedians from Melbourne Category:University of Melbourne women Category:20th-century Australian actresses Category:20th-century Australian comedians Category:21st-century Australian actresses Category:21st-century Australian comedians ","title":"Marg Downey"},{"id":"1274595","text":"Kaczmarek ( ; archaic feminine: Kaczmarkowa, plural Kaczmarkowie) is the 18th most common surname in Poland (62,399 people in 2009)Ministry of Interior (Poland).

The modern chemist (also known as a pharmacist in American English) has taken over this role. In some languages and regions, the word \\"apothecary\\" is still used to refer to a retail pharmacy or a pharmacist who owns one. Apothecaries' investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients was a precursor to the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology. In addition to dispensing herbs and medicine, the apothecary offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed by other specialist practitioners, such as surgeons and obstetricians. Apothecary shops sold ingredients and the medicines they prepared wholesale to other medical practitioners, as well as dispensing them to patients. In seventeenth century England, they also controlled the trade of tobacco which was imported as a medicine. ==Etymology== Apothecary derives from the Ancient Greek word ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑ (apoth·∏ókƒì, \\"a repository, storehouse\\") via Latin apotheca (\\"repository, storehouse, warehouse\\", cf. bodega), Medieval Latin apothecarius (\\"storekeeper\\"), and eventually Old French apotecaire. In some languages the word \\"apothecary\\" is used to designate a pharmacist/chemist, such as German and Dutch Apotheker and Luxembourgish Apdikter. Likewise, \\"pharmacy\\" translates as apotek in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, apteekki in Finnish, apoteka in Bosnian, –∞–ø–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ in Serbian, –∞–ø—Ç–µ–∫–∞ in Russian, Bulgarian and Ukrainian, and apteka in Polish. The word in Indonesian is apoteker, which was borrowed from the Dutch apotheker. In Yiddish the word is ◊ê÷∑◊§÷º◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ß apteyk. Use of the term \\"apothecary\\" in the names of businesses varies with time and location. It is generally an Americanism, though some areas of the United States use it to invoke an experience of nostalgic revival and it has been used for a wide variety of businesses, while in other areas such as California its use is restricted to licensed pharmacies. ==History== French apothecary (15th century). Apothecary, as a profession, can be dated back at least to 2600 BC to ancient Babylon, which provides one of the earliest records of the practice of the apothecary. Clay tablets were found with medical texts recording symptoms, the prescriptions, and the directions for compounding it. The Papyrus Ebers from ancient Egypt, written around 1500 BC, contain a collection of more than 800 prescriptions, or ancient recipes for the apothecaries of the time. It mentions over 700 different drugs. The Shen-nung pen ts'ao ching, a Chinese book on agriculture and medicinal plants (3rd century AD),Pursell, J. (2015).

The book, which documented 365 treatments, had a focus on roots and grass. It had treatments which came from minerals, roots and grass, and animals. Many of the mentioned drugs and their uses are still followed today. Ginseng‚Äôs use as a sexual stimulant and aid for erectile dysfunction stems from this book. Ma huang, an herb first mentioned in the book, led to the introduction of the drug ephedrine into modern medicine. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, and S. Hadzovic, apothecary shops existed during the Middle Ages in Baghdad,Al-Ghazal, S.K. (2004). \\"The valuable contributions of Al-Razi (Rhazes) in the history of pharmacy during the Middle Ages\\", Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine, 3(6), pp. 9-11. operated by pharmacists in 754 during the Abbasid Caliphate, or Islamic Golden Age. Apothecaries were also active in Islamic Spain by the 11th century. By the end of the 14th century, Geoffrey Chaucer (1342‚Äì1400) was mentioning an English apothecary in the Canterbury Tales, specifically \\"The Nun's Priest's Tale\\" as Pertelote speaks to Chauntecleer (lines 181‚Äì184): > ... and for ye shal nat tarie, > Though in this toun is noon apothecarie, > I shal myself to herbes techen yow, > That shul been for youre hele and for youre prow. > In modern English, this can be translated as: > ... and you should not linger, > Though in this town there is no apothecary, > I shall teach you about herbs myself, > That will be for your health and for your pride. > In Renaissance Italy, Italian Nuns became a prominent source for medicinal needs. At first they used their knowledge in non-curative uses in the convents to solidify the sanctity of religion among their sisters. As they progressed in skill they started to expand their field to create profit. This profit they used towards their charitable goals. Because of their eventual spread to urban society, these religious women gained \\"roles of public significance beyond the spiritual realm (Strocchia 627). Later apothecaries led by nuns were spread across the Italian peninsula. Early Italian Pharmacy, 17th century. Gift of Fisher Scientific International, Science History Institute. From the 15th century to the 16th century, the apothecary gained the status of a skilled practitioner. In England, the apothecaries merited their own livery company, the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, founded in 1617. Its roots, however, go back much earlier to the Guild of Pepperers formed in London in 1180. Interior of an apothecary's shop.

The Lady Apothecary, by Alfred Jacob Miller (between 1825 and 1870). The Walters Art Museum. However, there were ongoing tensions between apothecaries and other medical professions, as is illustrated by the experiences of Susan Reeve Lyon and other women apothecaries in 17th century London. Often women (who were prohibited from entering medical school) became apothecaries which took away business from male physicians. In 1865 Elizabeth Garrett Anderson became the first woman to be licensed to practice medicine in Britain by passing the examination of the Society of Apothecaries. By the end of the 19th century, the medical professions had taken on their current institutional form, with defined roles for physicians and surgeons, and the role of the apothecary was more narrowly conceived, as that of pharmacist (dispensing chemist in British English). In German speaking countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, pharmacies or chemist stores are still called apothecaries or in German Apotheken. The Apotheke (\\"store\\") is legally obligated to be run at all times by at least one Apotheker (male) or Apothekerin (female), who actually has an academic degree as a pharmacist ‚Äî‚Äî in German Pharmazeut (male) or Pharmazeutin (female) ‚Äî and has obtained the professional title Apotheker by either working in the field for numerous years ‚Äî usually working in a pharmacy store ‚Äî or taking additional exams. Thus a Pharmazeut is not always an Apotheker. Magdalena Neff became the first woman to gain a medical qualification in Germany when she studied pharmacy at the Technical University of Kalsruhe and later passed the apothecary's examination in 1906. Apothecaries used their own measurement system, the apothecaries' system, to provide precise weighing of small quantities. Apothecaries dispensed vials of poisons as well as medicines, and as is still the case, medicines could be either beneficial or harmful if inappropriately used. Protective methods to prevent accidental ingestion of poisons included the use of specially shaped containers for potentially poisonous substances such as laudanum. === Apothecary work as gateway to women as healers === Apothecary businesses were typically family-run, and wives or other women of the family worked alongside their husbands in the shops, learning the trade themselves. Women were still not allowed to train and be educated in universities so this allowed them a chance to be trained in medical knowledge and healing. Previously, women had some influence in other women's healthcare, such as serving as midwives and other feminine care in a setting that was not considered appropriate for males. Though physicians gave medical advice, they did not make medicine, so they typically sent their patients to particular independent apothecaries, who did also provide some medical advice in particular remedies and healing. ==Methods== === Recipes === Many recipes included herbs, minerals, and pieces of animals (meats, fats, skins) that were ingested, made into paste for external use, or used as aromatherapy. Some of these are similar to natural remedies used today, including catnip, chamomile, fennel, mint, garlic, and witch hazel. Many other ingredients used in the past such as urine, fecal matter, earwax, human fat, and saliva, are no longer used and are generally considered ineffective or unsanitary. Trial and error were the main source or finding successful remedies, as little was known about the chemistry of why certain treatments worked. For instance, it was known that drinking coffee could help cure headaches, but the existence and properties of caffeine itself was still a mystery. ==Other mentions in literature and pop culture== * William Shakespeare's play \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" : A poor apothecary sells Romeo an Elixir of Death with which Romeo commits suicide to be with Juliet, whom he believes to be dead. * William Shakespeare's play \\"King Lear\\": King Lear exclaims: \\"Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination.\\" * The character of Mr Perry in Jane Austen's novel Emma performs many of the functions of a doctor. * William Faulkner's story \\"A Rose for Emily\\" : The main character, Miss Emily Grierson, goes to an \\"apothecary\\" and buys arsenic, supposedly to kill a rat.

Alternate spellings include Zelewski, Zaleski, Zeleski, Zalewska, Zalescy and Zaller The form Zalewski is the hypercorrect form of Zaleski. By analogy with other surnames, like Chotomowski (colloquially pronounced as if spelt \\"Chotomoski\\"), Olszewski (\\"Olszeski\\") etc., it may seem that the shorter spelling must reflect the popular pronunciation and not the older, etymological one, but this is not the case. The original form Zaleski was derived from a place called Zalesie or Zalas, which literally means \\"an area close to a forest, behind a forest\\". It is difficult to assess which regions were primarily connected with it, because of the significant number of villages by such names. (Another case of such hypercorrection is Dmowski, derived from Dmochy, not *Dm√≥w or *Dmowo). Another possible etymology for one of the forms of Zalewski surname comes from a topographic name for someone who lived by a flood plain, bay, or any other small body of water. Two locations that this may be connected to are Zalew in Sieradz voivodeship or Zalewo in Olsztyn voivodeship.Citation: Zalewski Name Meaning and History The Germanised version of this surname is Salewski and Saleski, usually found in the Silesia region. An early form of this surname was first noted in the year 1370. Many families from different classes and with different background used this surname.

When performed properly, it engages all the abdominal muscles but primarily it works the rectus abdominis muscle and the obliques. It allows both building six-pack abs, and tightening the belly. Crunches use the exerciser's own body weight to tone muscle, and are recommended as a low-cost exercise that can be performed at home. ==Form== In a crunch, the lower back does not lift off the floor Biomechanics professor Stuart McGill was quoted in The New York Times Health blog as stating: > An approved crunch begins with you lying down, one knee bent, and hands > positioned beneath your lower back for support. \\"Do not hollow your stomach > or press your back against the floor\\", McGill says.

The process of quickly advancing on an opponent and attempting a takedown is known as shooting for a takedown, or simply shooting. Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by amplitude and impact, with throws being a subset of takedown. Takedowns are featured in all forms of wrestling and stand-up grappling. ==Leg trip== The leg trip is a technique in which the combatant uses his or her own leg(s) to off-balance an opponent, hence causing the opponent to fall to the ground. Leg trips are often integrated into more complex takedown techniques, and are also important in many throws. Takedown techniques that are pure leg trips usually involve controlling the body of the opponent, and impeding or destabilizing one or both of the opponents legs. Leg trips are featured in for instance freestyle wrestling, judo, sumo, and shuai jiao while being an illegal technique in Greco-Roman wrestling.Gabrielson, Bruce. Freestyle Wrestling Rules. www.blackmagic.com. URL last accessed March 6, 2006. The scissor kick takes down an opponent by wrapping one's legs around the opponent. ==Single leg takedown== A single leg takedown attempt The single leg takedown (often shortened to single leg or single or single leg shot) involves grabbing one of the legs of the opponent, usually with both hands, and using the position to force the opponent to the ground. Typically, the lower part of the leg is pulled in one direction, while the torso or shoulder is used to press the body or upper part of the leg of the opponent in the other direction. There are several varieties of single leg takedowns. Some involve picking up and holding the leg by the ankle and are often known as ankle picks, while other varieties include the high crotch, in which the leg is held high up in the opponent's crotch area. The leg can be attacked either across the body (\\"inside\\") or from away from the body (\\"outside\\"). Single leg takedowns can also be executed in combination with a leg trip to the other leg, which additionally destabilizes the opponent. Single leg takedowns can be countered by sprawling or by hooking the lifted foot in the crotch of the aggressor (so it cannot be lifted further and to maintain a distance from the aggressor), and, where allowed, in combination with knee strikes to the head of the opponent.L√∏vstad, Jakob. The Mixed Martial Arts Primer. www.idi.ntnu.no. URL last accessed March 6, 2006. (DOC format) In judo and other martial arts, there are many classifications of different types of single leg takedowns. Variants of the high crotch correspond to sukui nage (Êé¨Êäï, \\"scoop throw\\"Ohlenkamp, Neil. The 67 Throws of Kodokan Judo. judoinfo.com.

Some techniques are more specific, for instance kibisu gaeshi (Ë∏µËøî, \\"heel trip reversal\\"), which is an ankle pick where the heel is grabbed, scooped up and the opponent is pushed and thrown immediately. In kuchiki taoshi (ÊúΩÊú®ËêΩ, \\"one hand drop\\"International Martial Arts Federation USA. An Outline of Kodokan Judo . www.imafusa.com.

The technique was banned in judo competition by the International Judo Federation in 2010 except as a counter or combination.Intojudo.eu. New rules 2010-2012 ==Double leg takedown== Double leg takedown The double leg takedown (colloquially known as a double leg or double) involves grabbing the opponent with both arms around the opponent's legs while keeping the chest close to the opponent, and using this position to force the opponent to the ground. There are several varieties of forcing the opponent to the ground, such as lifting and slamming, or pushing forward with the shoulder while pulling the opponent's legs. The double leg takedown can be countered similarly to a single leg takedown, by sprawling, moving away, and/or striking. The guillotine choke is also a good counter to a poorly performed double leg takedown.Green, Andrew The Double-Leg Take Down. www.budoseek.net. URL last accessed March 6, 2006. The double leg takedown is in judo also referred to as morote-gari, although some hold that a double leg takedown where the opponent is lifted into the air or swept sideways should be referred to as sukui-nage. Morote-gari, despite having been used by judokas for a very long time and being approved of by Jigoro Kano himself, was not accepted until 1982 by the Kodokan as an official judo technique. Being dismissed by certain traditionalists,Lewis, Bill. Bill Lewis Review: Pickups. www.bjj.org. URL last accessed March 6, 2006. the technique was banned in competition by the International Judo Federation in 2010 except as a counter or combination. Another form of a double leg takedown is the double leg and trip, in which the person shoots in and while holding both legs swings one of his legs around and pushes forward on the opponent while tripping the opponent's leg out from under him. ==Duckunder== In a duckunder, the wrestler pulls the opponent's elbow forward and away from the body, lowers his own head, and ducks under the opponent's arm in an effort to get behind or at least beside the opponent; from this position the opponent can be taken down by lifting and throwing or by a leg trip. ==Fireman's carry== The fireman's carry is a takedown technique that resembles a common method of carrying an injured victim by firefighters. When implemented on the right side of the opponent's body, the attacker's left hand pulls the opponent's right elbow forward so the attacker's head goes under the opponent's right arm. At the same time, the attacker's right hand grabs the inside of the opponent's right thigh and lifts, while the attacker rises and drives to his left, bringing the opponent down to the ground on his right side. ==Underhook== A single underhook involves putting an arm under the opponent's arm, and holding the back of the opponent's midsection or upper body, while a double underhook involves doing this with both arms. Either can be used as the basis for a takedown because underhooks offer the potential for control of the opponent's upper body. ==Overhook== A single overhook, or whizzer, involves putting an arm over the opponent's arm and encircling it. It can be used as a takedown maneuver by putting substantial weight on the targeted arm while pulling the opponent's other arm across his body, and eventually stepping over behind the opponent. ==Bear hug== In a bear hug, the arms are wrapped tightly around the opponent's midsection, sometimes with one or both of the opponent's arms pinned to the opponent's body, so that the opponent's chest is held tightly to the attacker's chest. From this position the opponent can be taken down, sometimes by lifting and tilting and sometimes with the aid of a leg trip. ==Spin-around== The spin-around is often used as a counter to an opponent's attempt at a single- or double-leg takedown. When the opponent shoots for the legs, the targeted wrestler sprawls his legs part way back and then quickly moves around behind the opponent. ===Snapdown=== In a snapdown, both hands are placed on the back of the opponent's neck, and when the opponent's head is held low or is becoming lower both hands pull down sharply, propelling the opponent's head and therefore body toward the ground. Simultaneously the attacker steps around behind the opponent. ==References== ==External links== * 42 Takedown Techniques * Double Leg Shoot vs. Right Cross * Kibisu Gaeshi (Heel Trip Reversal) * Kimarite.

The Act permits studies to be conducted using animals for procedures such as breeding genetically modified animals, medical and veterinary advances, education, environmental toxicology and includes procedures requiring vivisection, if certain criteria are met. Revised legislation came into force on 1 January 2013. The original act related to the 1986 EU Directive 86/609/EEC Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes which was updated and replaced by EU Directive 2010/63/EUDirective 2010/63/EU of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes In 2002, a Government select committee inquiry described the Act as the \\"...tightest system of regulation in the world\\" in relation to the regulation of using animals for research. == Background == Prior to ASPA, the use of animals in the UK was regulated by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, which enforced a licensing and inspection system for vivisection. Animal cruelty was previously regulated by the Protection of Animals Act 1911 (now largely repealed) and more recently by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, both of which outlaw the causing of \\"unnecessary suffering\\". Specific exemptions apply to experiments licensed under the 1986 Act. == History and scope == The 1986 Act defined regulated procedures as animal experiments that could potentially cause \\"pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm\\", to protected animals, which encompassed all living vertebrates other than humans, under the responsibility of humans. A 1993 amendment added a single invertebrate species, the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris), as a protected animal. The Act applied only to protected animals from halfway through their gestation or incubation periods (for mammals, birds and reptiles) or from when they became capable of independent feeding (for fish, amphibians, and the common octopuses). Primates, cats, dogs and horses had additional protection over other vertebrates under the Act. Revised legislation came into force on 1 January 2013. The Act has been expanded to protect - The definition of regulated procedures was expanded to - ASPA also regulates the modification of genes in protected animals if this causes the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. Other considerations in the Act include animal sources, housing conditions, identification methods and the humane killing of animals. This legislation is widely regarded as the strictest in the world protecting animals used in research. Those applying for a license must explain why such research cannot be done through non-animal or in-vitro methods. The project must also pass an ethical review panel which aims to decide if the potential benefits outweigh any suffering for the animals involved. ==Licences and certificates== ASPA involves three levels of regulation -- person, project, and place. The 'person' level is achieved by the granting of a \\"personal licence\\" (PIL, procedure personal licence) to a researcher wishing to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal. Having undergone a defined sequence of training, a researcher can apply for a PIL permitting specified techniques to be carried out on named species of animals. The 'project' level of regulation is governed by the granting of a \\"project licence\\" (PPL) to a suitably qualified senior researcher. The PPL details the scope of the work to be carried out, the likely benefits that may be realised by the work, and the costs involved in terms of the numbers and types of animals to be used, and the harm that might be caused to the animals. Typically a large and detailed document, the PPL precisely defines which techniques may be applied to particular animals and for what purpose. Finally, the 'place' where regulated procedures are carried out is controlled by the granting of a \\"establishment licence\\" (PEL) to a senior authority figure at the establishment, such as the Registrar or Vice-chancellor of a University, or the Chief executive officer of a commercial company. The PEL details which rooms in the establishment are permitted to be used for certain techniques and species, but may also apply to outdoors areas and even mobile areas (e.g. boats) if this is where the research is to be conducted. It is an offence under ASPA to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal unless authorised by a personal licence, a project licence, and an establishment licence. ==Opinion== A 2002 House of Lords select committee inquiry compared the Act to legislation from France, the U.S., and Japan. The report concluded that \\"virtually all witnesses agreed that the UK has the tightest system of regulation in the world\\" and that it is \\"the only country to require an explicit cost/benefit assessment of every application to conduct animal research.\\" Note that costs are explicitly in terms of adverse effects on animals, not the financial cost to the experimenters. This has since been re-named the harm/benefit analysis. In 2005, Patricia Hewitt, then British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, called the Act \\"[among] the strongest laws in the world to protect animals which are being used for medical research.\\" A 2006 report by Animal Aid called the Act a \\"vivisectors' charter\\", alleging that it allows researchers to do as they please and makes them practically immune from prosecution. The report said that licences to perform experiments are obtained on the basis of a \\"nod of approval\\" from the Home Office Inspectorate, and that the Home Office relies on the researchers' own cost-benefit analysis of the value of the experiment versus the suffering caused. Several of the bans called for by the report have since been enacted. ==See also== * Animal law * Pain in animals * Pain in invertebrates * Animal welfare in the United Kingdom == References == Category:1986 in science Category:Animal welfare and rights legislation in the United Kingdom Category:Cruelty to animals Category:Research in the United Kingdom Category:Toxicology in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1986 ","title":"Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986"},{"id":"1274622","text":"', officially the ' (), is a in the province of , .

Conference proceedings typically contain the contributions made by researchers at the conference. They are the written record of the work that is presented to fellow researchers. In many fields, they are published as supplements to academic journals; in some, they are considered the main dissemination route; in others they may be considered grey literature. They are usually distributed in printed or electronic volumes, either before the conference opens or after it has closed. A less common, broader meaning of proceedings are the acts and happenings of an academic field, a learned society. For example, the title of the Acta Crystallographica journals is New Latin for \\"Proceedings in Crystallography\\"; the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America is the main journal of that academy. Scientific journals whose ISO 4 title abbreviations start with Proc, Acta, or Trans are journals of the proceedings (transactions) of a field or of an organization concerned with it, in that secondary meaning of the word. ==Authorship and editorship== Selecting and collecting papers for conferences is organized by one or more persons, who form the editorial team. The quality of the papers is typically ensured by having external people read the papers before they are accepted in the proceedings. The level of quality control varies considerably from conference to conference: some have only a binary accept/reject decision, others go through more thorough feedback and revisions cycles (peer reviewing or refereeing). Depending on the level of the conference, this process can take up to a year. The editors decide about the composition of the proceedings, the order of the papers, and produce the preface and possibly other pieces of text. Although most changes in papers occur on basis of consensus between editors and authors, editors can also single-handedly make changes in papers. Since the collection of papers comes from individual researchers, the character of proceedings is distinctly different from an educational textbook. Each paper typically is quite isolated from the other papers in the proceedings. Mostly there is no general argument leading from one contribution to the next. In some cases, the editors of the proceedings may decide to further develop the proceedings into a textbook. This may even be a goal at the outset of the conference. ==Publication== Conference proceedings are published in-house by the organizing institution of the conference or via an academic publisher. For example, the Lecture Notes in Computer Science by Springer take much of their input from proceedings. Increasingly, proceedings are published in electronic format via the internet or on CD. In the sciences, the quality of publications in conference proceedings is usually not as high as that of international scientific journals. However, in computer science, papers published in conference proceedings are accorded a higher status than in other fields, due to the fast-moving nature of the field. A number of full-fledged academic journals unconnected to particular conferences also use the word \\"proceedings\\" as part of their name, for example, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. ==Format== Conference proceedings may be published as a book or book series, in a journal, or otherwise as a serial publication (see examples). In many cases, impact factors are not available, although other journal metrics (such as Google Scholar h-index and Scimago- metrics) might exist. Bibliographic indexing often is done in separate bibliographic databases and citation indexes, e.g., Conference Proceedings Citation Index instead of Science Citation Index. ==See also== *Serial (publishing) ==References== Category:Academic publishing Category:Publications by format Category:Grey literature ","title":"Conference proceeding"},{"id":"1274644","text":"Th√©r√®se Schwartze (20 December 185123 December 1918) was a Dutch portrait painter. ==Life== Th√©r√®se Schwartze at 16 by her father Th√©r√®se Schwartze was born on 20 December 1851 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of the painter Johan Georg Schwartze, who grew up in Philadelphia and trained in D√ºsseldorf. Schwartze received her first training from her father, before studying for a year at the Rijksacademie van Beeldende Kunsten. She then travelled to Munich and studied under Gabriel Max and Franz von Lenbach. In 1879 she went to Paris to continue her studies under Jean-Jacques Henner. When she returned to Amsterdam she became a member of Arti et Amicitiae. Schwartze exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. ==Death== Grave of Th√©r√®se by Georgine, today a rijksmonument On 22 July 1918 her husband, Anton van Duyl, died. As Schwartze was in bad health at that time (and tried to hide this), the death of her husband was a blow that she could not overcome easily. She died in Amsterdam on 23 December 1918 from a sudden illness. Schwartze was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam. Later she was reburied at the Nieuwe Ooster cemetery in Amsterdam, where her sister created a memorial to her, modelled after her death mask, which is now considered a rijksmonument. ==Works== Her home Her portraits, mostly of Amsterdam's elite, are remarkable for excellent character drawing, breadth and vigour of handling and rich quality of pigment. She signed her works \\"Th. Schwartze\\" and was married late in life in 1906 to Anton van Duyl, whereupon she signed works with \\"Th. v Duyl.Schwartze\\". She was one of the few women painters who had been honoured by an invitation to contribute their portraits to the hall of painters at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Some of her best pictures, notably a portrait of Piet J Joubert, and Three Inmates of the Orphanage at Amsterdam, are at the Rijksmuseum, and one entitled Five Amsterdam Orphans at the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam. Her niece Lizzy Ansingh, who she painted a few times, also became a painter. Her sister Georgine Schwartze became a sculptor.

Alt URL Due to declining enrollment and a lack of low- cost priests and nuns to teach in these schools, Bishop McGann closed Maria Regina, but in the face of parental protests, the school was acquired by the Marianist brothers who were already running Chaminade High School in nearby Mineola, and was reopened as Kellenberg Memorial in 1987. In September, 1987, the administration of Kellenberg Memorial High School announced the establishment of the Bro. Joseph C. Fox Latin School. The Latin School is named in honor of Marianist brother Bro. Joseph C. Fox, who taught for over fifty years in Catholic schools. This new division of KMHS provides a qualitative Catholic education to students from the public schools in grades six through eight.http://www.kellenberg.org/latinschool/about-latin-school ==Campus== Kellenberg is accessed through the main entrance across from RXR Plaza on Glenn Curtiss Blvd. Although the lobby was originally designed as the main entrance, the school is oriented toward its north entrance, which features a mural of the Holy Family designed by artist Yan Rieger in 1997 in honor of the school's tenth anniversary. The mural includes a depiction of Jesus as a teenager. Students and Marianists assisted the artist and his wife with the execution of the mural. Kellenberg Memorial has five athletic fields, four of which are named after the Four Evangelists. The fields are used for baseball, football, softball, and other sports. The school is also the caretaker of two Nassau County properties, one of which is located east of the school and one located west, which are also used for athletics. These properties are named Jerusalem and Jericho, after the two biblical cities. An artificial turf field was installed during the summer of 2010. This marks a series of campus improvements and expansions that was to take place throughout 2010 and 2011. Kellenberg's campus features three courtyards and four chapels. The main courtyard is located in the center of the building and contains a koi river, four bridges, and a central bell tower. Many interior classrooms overlook this courtyard, and students are permitted to pass through the courtyard between classes. ==Academics== 2013 Kellenberg Memorial High School graduation, held at Hofstra University's Hofstra Arena Kellenberg Memorial High School offers a rigorous college preparatory curriculum. Core liberal arts courses are supplemented with required courses in chorus, health, computer technology, music and art. Students in the Latin School are required to take Latin. Admission to the school is highly competitive, with many applicants enrolling in private exam preparation courses for the Catholic High School Entrance Exam (CHSEE/TACHS) in generalMolloy College and Kellenberg in particular.Molloy College advertisement targeted at Kellenberg applicants ==Latin School== The school also operates the Brother Joseph C. Fox Latin School on the same campus as the high school. Serving students from grades 6 through 8, it was originally designed for students who started in public school but wished to transfer into the Catholic school system; it now accepts students from both public and Catholic elementary schools. Admission to the program is highly competitive, with many applying over a year in advance. The nature of the program allows middle school students to take courses taught by high school teachers (often with high school material) and to take part in clubs, activities and services that would normally not be available at a regular middle school. Students in grades 7 and 8 are required to take Latin, with those who remain at Kellenberg for high school placed in accelerated classes. Students who graduate from the program are guaranteed admission to the high school; however, they are required to take the CHSEE for statistical and quality-assurance purposes. While the Latin School has a separate administration for academics, guidance and discipline, the schools are otherwise administered as one unit, sharing facilities and faculty. Most clubs and activities are run as one unit for grades 6-12. The administration of the Latin School is subsidiary to that of the greater school, with the Assistant Principal for the Latin School answerable to the Principal and President of Kellenberg Memorial High School. ==Faculty== As of April 2010, the faculty included 130 members, including three Marianist Priests and 12 Marianist Brothers. Many school administrators maintain teaching roles in the school. There is also a large school staff body consisting of about 70 members. Many members of the Society of Mary have canine companions that often follow them to the classroom or reside in their offices during the day, sometimes cited as a very likable trait of the school. Many of the faculty and school staff are alumni. Administrators have contributed articles to a diverse range of publications, from the religious Catalyst to the mainstream New York Times.NYTimes.com Room for Debate Current faculty include college faculty,William Mauser at Suffolk Community College published authorsAlex Basile's multiple books with Alba House are listed on their website. and professional musicians.Faculty member Ronnie D'Addario's diverse career (see bio) has included both touring and producing with Tommy Makem, performing at Carnegie Hall and the Lisner Auditorium, writing for The Carpenters and freelancing for the Long Island Press (see example).Greg Williams also serves on the faculty of the Long Island Conservatory. Former faculty members contributed to works still included in the school's curriculum, from history classesDuring her time as history department chair, Ellen Bizoza contributed information on Latin America to World Cultures: A Global Mosaic, still used by Grade 9. to faith-based clubs.https://www.amazon.com/Todd-A.-Lemieux/e/B002BMGT7I?_encoding=UTF8 Music produced by student organizations is sold at online music retailers.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RBAFHY ==Co-curricular and extracurricular activities== In the Marianist tradition, many students join sodality groups to mutually reinforce their Catholic faith. The groups meet weekly and participate in various religious activities. The school also operates Emmanuel, a Marianist Retreat House devoted to students' spiritual formation. A major co-curricular focus is music. Activities in this area include Band (four levels), Chorus (four levels), Guitar Club, Jazz Band, the Firebird Swing Jazz Choir, Orchestra, Pit Band, and Jubilee Choir, Gregorian Consortium (sometimes called St. Greg's). Publications include Blue and Gold (a yearbook), The Renaissance (a literary magazine), The Phoenix (a newspaper). Kellenberg also has an Academic Quiz Bowl team and a Science Olympiad team. The Academic Quiz Bowl team came in 11th place at the 2008 NAQT High School National Championship, and placed second in the 2010 season of the New York area TV show The Challenge. The team won the 2009 New York State NAQT tournament, placing first in the state with the JV team in fifth;2009 NAQT NYS Results at the state level, three of the top five players came from Kellenberg teams.NAQT 2009 NYS Indiv Results The Science Olympiad team has qualified for the New York State Science Olympiad Competition several times in recent years. A major activity for female students at Kellenberg is the annual Blue and Gold show. Students who participate are divided into two teams, a blue team and a gold team. The girls practice from February until May. The competition takes place on one night in May, and attracts a widespread Long Island audience. In 2006, the school received national attention when the principal, Kenneth Hoagland, canceled the Senior Prom. In a letter from late March 2006, he cited \\"booze cruises\\" sponsored by parents, cocktail parties, and the film American Pie as examples of \\"adolescent culture being formed and led by the media\\". The school received national attention from ABC, CNN, Fox News, MTV, The New York Times, and Comedy Central's The Colbert Report. In 2018, the school reestablished the varsity ice hockey program, as well as established a varsity crew program for both boys and girls. In 2019, a junior varsity ice hockey team was added. ==Notable alumni== * Donatella Arpaia 1989 ‚Äì restaurateur; television personality who appears on The Food Network * Jon Harris 1992 - 1st round draft pick #25 for the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles * Marc Forgione 1996 ‚Äì chef and owner of restaurant Marc Forgione; competed on The Next Iron Chef in 2010 and won; an Iron Chef on Iron Chef America * Reid Gorecki 1999 ‚Äì outfielder for Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves * Jason Michael Brescia 2004 ‚Äì film director and writerhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm3233782/ * Kevin McCarthy 2010 ‚Äì pitcher for the Kansas City Royals ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1987 Category:Catholic secondary schools in New York (state) Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre Category:Schools in Nassau County, New York Category:Private middle schools in New York (state) Category:Marianist schools Category:1987 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Kellenberg Memorial High School"},{"id":"1274648","text":"The basic step, basic figure, basic movement, basic pattern, or simply basic is the dance move that defines the character of a particular dance.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as the Ambassador of the United States to Russia from 2017 to 2019, to China from 2009 to 2011, and to Singapore from 1992 to 1993. Huntsman has served in nearly every presidential administration since the presidency of Ronald Reagan. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H. W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. He served as CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings, a private entity that held the stock the family owned in Huntsman Corporation. He has also served as a board member of Huntsman Corporation, and as chair of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. Huntsman is the only American ambassador to have served in both Russia and China. While governor of Utah, Huntsman was named chair of the Western Governors Association and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best-managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States. During his tenure, Huntsman was one of the most popular governors in the country, and won reelection in a landslide in 2008, winning every single county. He left office with approval ratings over 80 percent and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Gary Herbert. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. He ran for governor again in 2020, but lost in the Republican primary to Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox. ==Early life and education== Huntsman was born March 26, 1960, in Redwood City, California. His father, Jon Huntsman Sr., was a business executive who later became a billionaire through the company he founded, the Huntsman Corporation, which achieved breakthrough success in the 1970s manufacturing generic styrofoam cartons for McDonald's and other fast food companies and by the 1990s was one of the largest petrochemical companies in the United States. His mother is Karen (n√©e Haight) Huntsman, daughter of LDS Church apostle David B. Haight. Through his father, Huntsman is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt. In 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America. Huntsman attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City but dropped out before graduating to perform as a keyboard player in a rock band. Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became, like his father, a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Huntsman served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in international politics in 1987. ==Political career== ===Early career=== While young Huntsman was visiting the White House in 1971 during his father's service as special assistant to the president, Henry Kissinger confided to the 11-year-old that he was secretly traveling to China. He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan. During the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention. ===George H. W. Bush Administration=== Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990. He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991. In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. ambassador to Singapore, which he was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate in August. At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years. ===George W. Bush Administration=== In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as president, The Washington Post reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed to be the new United States Ambassador to China. In March, he reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia. On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States trade representatives in his administration; he served in this role from 2001 to 2003. ===Governor of Utah=== In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush Administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66‚Äì34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer. Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%. Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States. Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top-three state to do business in. The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of \\"B\\"; the institute gave him an \\"A\\" on tax policy and an \\"F\\" on spending policy. Depending on the methodology used, Utah was either the top-ranked state or fourth-ranked state in the nation for job growth during Huntsman's tenure, with a rate of either 5.9% or 4.8% between 2005 and 2009. The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that \\"tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million.\\" Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects. During Huntsman's administration, the state budget rose from $8.28 to 11.57 billion. Huntsman supported cap and trade policies, and as governor, signed the Western Climate Initiative. He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage. He also cut some regulations, including Utah's very strict alcohol laws. In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act, which he said was \\"the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program was open to all current public school children, as well as some children already in private school.\\" The voucher law was later repealed in a public referendum. Huntsman was one of John McCain's earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign. Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and other early primary states and went with him to Iraq twice including over Thanksgiving in 2007. At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party's nominee for vice president.Burns, Alexander (February 3, 2011) When Huntsman hearted Palin, Politico Huntsman also helped raise more than $500,000 for McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Of McCain's loss, Huntsman later observed, \\"We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America\\". ===Ambassador to China=== Huntsman's Ambassador to China official portrait Huntsman aboard Air Force One en route to Beijing President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009. On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman and he formally resigned as governor of Utah and was sworn in as ambassador to China on August 11, 2009. Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009, to begin his assignment, and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming. In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been unaware of the planned protest, and happened to be strolling through the area on a family outing. Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid. ===2012 presidential campaign=== Huntsman speaking at a political conference in Orlando, Florida in September, 2011. ====Background==== Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,Cheney says GOP presidential bench still strong, CNN June 29, 2009\\"The Rising: Jon Huntsman Jr.\\", The Washington Post, December 9, 2008 and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009. In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee called Horizon PAC. On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, stating that it \\"supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions\\". ====Campaign==== On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time. Huntsman's associates indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid. On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC. On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, Florida. Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background‚Äîthe same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980. Huntsman sought to establish himself as an anti-negative candidate and take the \\"high road\\". In his announcement, he also stated \\"I don't think you need to run down someone's reputation in order to run for the office of President.\\" Huntsman aggressively touted himself as a fiscal conservative, pledging considerable business and personal tax cuts as well as a foreign policy moderate, calling for a decrease in defense spending and withdrawal from Afghanistan, while increasing pressure on Iran and support for Israel. Huntsman focused his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary. On October 18, 2011, he boycotted the Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, out of deference to New Hampshire, which was locked in a political scheduling fight with Nevada. Huntsman eventually finished third in New Hampshire, and announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012. He endorsed Mitt Romney at that time. ===Post-campaign politics=== A month after dropping out of the 2012 race, Huntsman suggested there was a need for a third party in America, stating that \\"the real issues [were] not being addressed, and it's time that we put forward an alternative vision.\\" Huntsman said that he would not run as a third-party presidential candidate in 2012. In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984; he stated he would \\"not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States ‚Äî a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.\\" Shortly after Obama was re-elected as president, Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina suggested that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to face in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was \\"honest about our concerns about Huntsman\\" and that Huntsman \\"would have been a very tough candidate\\". In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council. Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election. In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump, but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the Access Hollywood controversy. However, Huntsman later defended Trump in interviews with FOX News and The New York Times after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process. Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump's decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump's nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China. Huntsman's official photograph during the Trump Administration In November 2016, Huntsman said he was considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, though ultimately he chose not to run for the seat. Huntsman was the co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, along with Dennis C. Blair. The Commission is an independent and bipartisan initiative from the public and private sectors. Its mission is to document and assess the extent of international intellectual property theft, particularly by China, and propose appropriate policy responses. According to the Commission's analysis, the U.S. has lost up to $600 billion in illicit technology transfers to China. According to Huntsman, === Ambassador to Russia === On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was under consideration by Donald Trump and the Trump transition team as a possible choice for United States Secretary of State in 2017, although Rex Tillerson was chosen 10 days later. It was reported on March 8, 2017, that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia. During his Senate confirmation hearings, Huntsman said, \\"There is no question that the Russian Government interfered in the U.S. election\\" in 2016. He also said the relationship between the two countries was \\"among the most consequential and complex foreign policy challenges we face.\\" Huntsman was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, via voice vote, on September 28, 2017. During his time as ambassador, Huntsman reported having access to senior Russian officials, which he stated was not always the case during his ambassadorship to China. He also expressed a desire to avoid repeating past mistakes in the relationship, stating: \\"In the years past, every new administration has tried to reset or redo of some sort. (...) Let's not repeat the cycles of the past, because in every case, (...) those resets could not be sustained. Let's not even begin with that thought in mind; no resets, no redos. Just take the relationship for what it is, clear-eyed and realistically.\\" Huntsman submitted his resignation as U.S. Ambassador to Russia to President Trump on August 6, 2019 with his resignation taking effect on October 3, 2019. === 2020 Utah gubernatorial campaign === Following his resignation as U.S. ambassador to Russia in August 2019, many speculated that Huntsman was considering another run for Utah governor. An October 2019 poll of likely Utah voters showed Huntsman as a favorite among several potential gubernatorial candidates. On November 14, 2019, Huntsman announced on KSL Radio that he will run for Governor of Utah in the 2020 election. In the six weeks between Huntsman's announcement and the end of 2019, Huntsman's campaign raised $520,000, and visited all 29 Utah counties. His daughter, Abby Huntsman, announced in January 2020 that she would leave her position on The View to join his gubernatorial campaign as a senior advisor. On February 7, 2020, Huntsman announced that Provo city mayor Michelle Kaufusi would be his gubernatorial running mate. A poll taken among likely voters in February showed Huntsman leading the race with 32% support, while 31% remain undecided. However, Cox ultimately won the primary with 36.4% of the vote against Huntsman's 34.6%. ==Political positions== Huntsman has been described as \\"a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama\\"Linkins, Jason (February 11, 2011) \\"Jon Huntsman Staff Choice Suggests The Direction His Campaign Will Take\\", The Huffington Post and identifies himself as a center-right conservative. During his first term as Utah governor, Huntsman listed economic development, healthcare reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast-growing population. ===Healthcare=== During his time as Utah governor, Huntsman proposed a plan to reform healthcare, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.Parker, Kathleen (July 26, 2009). \\"Reforming Health Care Utah's Way Under Gov. Huntsman\\". The Washington Post. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, \\"I'm comfortable with a requirement ‚Äì you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue\\". The healthcare plan that passed in Utah under Huntsman did not include a healthcare mandate.Smith, Ben (May 31, 2011) \\"Huntsman was 'comfortable' with mandate\\". Politico. ===Fiscal policy=== Huntsman speaking at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, in 2009 In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code. However, the report concluded that: \\"Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure.\\" He defines his taxation policy as \\"business friendly\\".Jon Huntsman, OnTheIssues As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that \\"our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes, and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with\\". The candidate called for \\"[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis\\".Parker, Ashley (August 31, 2011). \\"Huntsman Urges Stripping Deductions From Tax Code\\". The New York Times. In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday to encourage corporations to return profits from offshore tax havens. He favored eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.Huntsman 2012 website . Retrieved December 5, 2011. ===Social issues=== As the governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion. During the 2012 presidential race, and as governor of Utah, Huntsman supported civil unions for same-sex couples but not same-sex marriage.Gehrke, Robert (May 11, 2010). \\"Huntsman's civil-union stance may prove political liability\\". The Salt Lake Tribune. In a February 2013 op-ed published in The American Conservative, Huntsman updated his stance to one of support for same-sex marriage, stating: \\"All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience.\\" In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. ===Environment and energy=== In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases. He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, \\"Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution.\\" In 2011, in response to anti-science comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, Huntsman stated he \\"believe[s] in evolution and trust[s] scientists\\" on climate change. Commenting later on his statement, Huntsman remarked ‚ÄúI felt that it was important to remind a lot of Republican voters who care and a lot of independent voters who care, that there is a candidate who does believe in science.‚Äù Huntsman has stated a preference for international cooperation in handling climate change, stating \\"it‚Äôs a global issue. We can enact policies here [in the United States], but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country.\\" ===Foreign policy=== Huntsman meets with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in June 2016 Huntsman has repeatedly stated, \\"We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program\\". He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the \\"areas where we have differences with China\\" and vowed \\"robust engagement\\" as ambassador. Huntsman, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt \\"personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. In 2009, he said that then-current U.S. policy \\"support[ed] this objective, and [he was] encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions.\\" Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel. During his 2020 gubernatorial campaign, and after serving as Ambassador to Russia, Huntsman stated that ‚Äú[the Russians] want to see us divided. They want to drive a wedge into politics... The American people do not understand the expertise at their disposal to divide us, to prey on our divisions. They take both sides of an issue to deepen the political divide. They are active during mass shootings. They are active during racial tension. They take advantage of us. We think it‚Äôs fellow Americans who are taking extreme positions sometimes. It‚Äôs not.‚Äù ===Immigration=== In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to \\"driving-privilege cards\\", which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes. In a 2011 presidential debate, Huntsman defended the move, explaining that \\"[illegal immigrants] were given a driver's license before and they were using that for identification purposes. And I thought that was wrong. Instead we issued a driver privilege card, which in our state allowed our economy to continue to function. And it said in very bold letters, not to be used for identification purposes. It was a pragmatic local government driven fix and it proved that the Tenth Amendment works.\\" In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform. As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants. Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, \\"as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ‚Ä¶ but the situation is such that I don't think we have a choice\\".

After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly \\"livid.\\" As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs.

It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. After a long period of decline, the population has increased again in recent years. ==History== The name \\"Montrouge\\" means Red Mountain - from mont (mountain) and rouge (red) - because of the reddish colour of the earth in this area. The name of the community was first mentioned in monastery documents in 1194. Throughout the Middle Ages, the hamlet was home to monasteries and a number of religious orders, while in the 15th century it became the site of quarries used for the reconstruction of Paris. The late sixteenth century saw the plain of Montrouge named \\"reserve for royal hunts\\", and during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was known for its windmills, which have all now disappeared. On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, most of the commune of Montrouge was annexed to Paris, forming what is now called Petit-Montrouge, in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. The remainder of Montrouge was preserved as an independent town. In 1875, the town gained a few thousand square metres from the neighbouring communes of Ch√¢tillon and Bagneux (principally in the neighbourhood (le quartier) called Haut Mesnil). On 8 January 2015, Municipal Police officer Clarissa Jean- Philippe was shot and killed in the commune, purportedly by Amedy Coulibaly. Coulibaly was reported to be an accomplice of Sa√Ød and Ch√©rif Kouachi, the suspected perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. The next day, he was gunned down by police during a siege that left four hostages dead and several other people injured. ==Economy== Industrial development started in 1925 and soon, many printing factories were to be found in the town. Most of these have disappeared today. Since the early years of the twenty-first century, professional services and telecommunications have been the main business activities. * Aeronautical and electronic engineering, Alstom, Schlumberger, Siemens AG, ST Microelectronics * Banking, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank * Telecommunications, Orange * The Papier d'Arm√©nie (lit.

The Ch√¢tillon - Montrouge station is located at the border between the commune of Montrouge and the commune of Ch√¢tillon, on the Ch√¢tillon side of the border. The Mairie de Montrouge station was opened on 23 March 2013 as part of the extension of Metro Line 4 to the south. Two further stations (Verdun Sud on Montrouge southern border, and Bagneux) are due to open in 2020. Bus line 68 runs from Metro Ch√¢tillon Montrouge all the way up through Montparnasse, the Louvre, the Paris Opera and ends at the Place de Clichy, the site of the Moulin Rouge. Bus line 126 runs from Porte d'Orl√©ans to Boulogne-Billancourt, while line 128 goes from the same place to Robinson RER station. Bus line 323 runs on the southern border of Montrouge on its way between Issy-les-Moulineaux and Ivry- sur-Seine. Several lines (187, 188, 197, 297) use the Route nationale 20 that crosses eastern Montrouge to reach southern parts of the Parisian agglomeration. ==The Arts in Montrouge== Montrouge was the home of a number of well-known twentieth century artists, listed below. Currently the town is also well known for two contemporary art exhibitions: *The Montrouge Contemporary Art Show, which has existed for over 50 years *The JCE, that is European Young Artists exhibition. ==Education== Montrouge has seven public primary schools: Aristide Briand, Buffalo, Fran√ßois Rabelais, Nicolas Boileau, Raymond Queneau, Renaudel A, and Renaudel B.\\"Les √©coles du primaire.\\" Montrouge.

Mrs. Pollifax is a widow and senior citizen who decides one day to leave her comfortable apartment in New Brunswick, New Jersey and join the CIA. Through an initial misunderstanding, Mrs. Pollifax is given what is supposed to be a simple courier assignment by Operations Chief, Mr. Carstairs, and her ensuing adventure leads her to a career in espionage. The Emily Pollifax novels frequently employ comic relief and suspense. A consistent theme throughout the series is Mrs. Pollifax's tendency to take an interest in people who seem disconnected with her mission, but who either become part of the investigation and/or who prove to be of invaluable assistance to resolving the case. Recurring characters include Bishop, Carstairs' assistant; John Sebastian Farrell, an agent turned art dealer; and in later books, Cyrus Reed, a man with whom Mrs. Pollifax finds romance in the book Mrs. Pollifax on Safari. Most of the novels take place in existing countries and include authentic details; however, characters in the stories sometimes originate from fictional places that resemble groups of real-life countries. An example of this trait is evidenced by a character in A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax who is from Zabya, a fictional Middle Eastern monarchy described as one of \\"those Arabian oil-producing countries.\\" In addition, as is common in the spy fiction genre, many of the stories taking place in the Cold War era are set in Iron Curtain countries or include rival spies from communist countries. ==Books in the Mrs. Pollifax series== ===The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax (1966)=== Mrs. Pollifax is an elderly widow who has come to find life dull and is almost ready to end it all out of sheer boredom. Inspired by a newspaper profile of an actress who began her career in later life, she decides to fulfill a childhood ambition and apply for a job as a spy at the CIA. Meanwhile, Carstairs at the CIA is looking for an agent who can pass as a tourist in order to pick up an important microchip in Mexico. Due to a slight confusion, he thinks Mrs. Pollifax is one of the candidates and decides that Mrs. Pollifax is ideal; Carstairs decided this assignment carries so little danger that even one who is relatively untrained may be sent. So with minimum explanation, Pollifax is ushered off to Mexico City to meet a bookstore owner/secret agent, exchange code phrases, and leave with a book containing the microfilm. The courier mission does not go as planned, and Mrs. Pollifax finds herself imprisoned in the Socialist Republic of Albania, facing harsh questioning and possible torture. But she proves to be unusually resourceful, and with her companion's assistance, manages to outwit the enemy and save the day. ===The Amazing Mrs. Pollifax (1970)=== For this novel, Mrs. Pollifax is tasked by Mr. Carstairs, her CIA superior, to go to Turkey and contact Magda Ferenci-Sabo, a known Russian spy and secret double agent who is defecting to the Free World. Emily Pollifax is to give Magda money and a passport which will enable the former spy to leave Turkey. Although Carstairs gives Mrs. Pollifax only 30 minutes to get ready, the plucky widow is ready for another adventure. She flies to Turkey and sees Magda, but is unable to make personal contact before Magda flees. In pursuing her mission, Mrs. Pollifax embarks on a wild ride, matching wits with a diabolical double agent, traveling with Gypsies, Third News Section. and again surviving imprisonment. However, characteristically, she befriends unlikely allies along her way. ===The Elusive Mrs. Pollifax (1971)=== The Night-blooming cereus Mrs. Pollifax grows on her balcony Mrs. Pollifax is sent, as a tourist, on a routine assignment, to deliver the eight forged passports she is carrying, concealed in her hat, to the Bulgarian Underground. Unbeknownst to her, her boss, Carstairs, has been strong-armed into having her take other items along, sewn into her coat. On the way, she meets a group of back-packing college students at an airport, and offers to help when one of them is arrested by the secret police, upon arriving in Sofia. Mrs. Pollifax then leads both friends and foes on a merry chase, as she travels around Bulgaria, on a series of absorbing, and interwoven, adventures, including helping to rescue the student and several political prisoners from the seemingly impregnable Panchevsky Institute. ===A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax (1973)=== Mrs. Pollifax is dispatched to Switzerland to find some missing plutonium: Mr. Carstairs of the CIA suspects the contraband has been hidden in an upscale clinic in Switzerland. Mrs. Pollifax begins a careful investigation of the guests at the clinic and rapidly befriends a young British man, a Belgian woman, and a young boy and his grandmother from an Arab nation. She soon discovers that very few of the clinic patients are who they claim to be, and she becomes involved in intrigue with men who plan to overthrow the government of a small country. She, of course, displays the courage and ingenuity which Mr. Carstairs has learned to depend on, and she leads her outnumbered friends into the adventure of their lives. ===Mrs. Pollifax on Safari (1976)=== Mrs. Pollifax is called upon by the CIA to undertake another mission, this time to photograph members of a safari in Zambia, one of whom is an international assassin nicknamed Aristotle. She innocently posts an ad in the local newspaper trying to contact her old friend Farrell from the first book. This leads to major complications, as Farrell is involved with the freedom fighters across the border and has made some enemies. Another entertaining outing and with a bit of romance as a fellow traveler takes a fancy to Mrs. Pollifax. ===Mrs. Pollifax on the China Station (1983)=== Mrs. Pollifax is thrilled when Mr. Carstairs, her boss at the CIA, gives her an assignment in China to help rescue a prisoner from a labor camp. As luck would have it, she has recently completed a course in Chinese history, so she is primed and ready to go. She joins a tour group and is told that one of the other group members is actually a CIA agent who will become her partner later on. She tries unsuccessfully to detect her future partner and is very surprised when the agent's identity is revealed. As the action speeds up she finds the labor camp, rides a runaway horse, and encounters some rough stuff from a Russian spy. But she always comes through in the end. ===Mrs. Pollifax and the Hong Kong Buddha (1985)=== Mrs. Pollifax flies on a moment's notice to Hong Kong, to contact Sheng Ti, whom she met in an earlier book, and find out what is going on at Feng Imports where Sheng Ti is working for an agent named Detwiler. Detwiler's reports to the CIA have proved to be false, so he is suspected of being a counterspy and giving evidence to the enemy. Mrs. Pollifax meets some other interesting characters, including a psychic and another old friend, who is a reformed cat burglar, while in pursuit of the truth about Feng Imports. She is captured and tortured, but prevails as always. ===Mrs. Pollifax and the Golden Triangle (1988)=== This time Mrs. Pollifax's assignment seems simple: while she and her husband Cyrus Reed are vacationing in Thailand, she is to pick up some valuable information on drug smuggling from an informant called Ruamsak. Everything goes awry immediately: Ruamsak is murdered, Cyrus is kidnapped, and Emily joins forces with Bonchoo, an intriguing stranger with complex reasons of his own for wanting to find Cyrus. They meet the Akha people in the jungle. The usual phalanx of muddled but supportive CIA agents try to follow Emily through the jungles of Thailand and are seriously rattled when one of their directors abruptly vanishes, only to reappear in the Golden Triangle as the head of all illicit drug trafficking. Pollifax needs all her wiles and her considerable skills in the martial arts, not only to track her husband but also to put a serious dent in the heroin trade. She accomplishes everything with vigor and charm. ===Mrs. Pollifax and the Whirling Dervish (1990)=== Mrs. Pollifax is dispatched to Morocco to provide a cover for another of their agents, Max Janko. She will pose as Max's aunt to make the pair look like tourists, while in reality they will be trying to identify all seven Moroccan CIA operatives in order to ferret out the mole who has recently infiltrated the Atlas network, a secret branch of the CIA. Anticipating a relatively serene journey through picturesque Moroccan villages with an agreeable companion, Mrs. Pollifax is dismayed to find Janko insufferably hostile. Worse, he intends to kill her. By the time the real Janko shows up, a murder has occurred, and Mrs. Pollifax and her inexperienced companion are running for their lives from one dusty hamlet to the next, desperately trying to find the informer and save the rest of the network. ===Mrs. Pollifax and the Second Thief (1993)=== Mrs. Pollifax travels to Sicily in this adventure. Former colleague John Farrell, hired to crack a safe and lift a document signed by Julius Caesar sends an SOS while dodging a professional assassin whom he and Mrs. Pollifax jailed some years ago. Soon she too is ducking bullets and the old pals are forced to hole up in the Villa Franca‚Äîpart farm, part medieval fortress and full-time residence of young CIA agent Kate Rossiter's eccentric aunt. Ancient artifacts, hair-raising chases, art forgery, arms traffic, a nighttime assault on the villa, mysterious millionaires, spectacular scenery and unexpected romance are some of the ingredients simmering in the plot. ===Mrs. Pollifax Pursued (1995)=== The observant and unflappable Mrs. Pollifax discovers a young woman hiding in a closet of her Connecticut home on the same day that she observes a suspicious white van patrolling the neighborhood. Kadi Hopkirk says the men in the van have been following her ever since she met Sammy, a childhood friend from the African country of Ubangiba. Mrs. Pollifax hides Kadi in the car and takes to the highway but is unable to shake the van until she calls on her colleagues at the CIA, who send a helicopter to whisk them away to a traveling carnival in rural Maine. Mrs. Pollifax poses as a journalist, and Kadi becomes the lower half of the woman who is sawed in two, while the CIA pals find out who Sammy is and why he is being so heavily guarded. Mrs. Pollifax adroitly solves several mysteries, including a stabbing at the carnival, Kadi and Sammy's story and the abduction of a wealthy executive. ===Mrs. Pollifax and the Lion Killer (1996)=== The sequel to Mrs. Pollifax Pursued, in which we meet Kadi Hopkirk, the daughter of Ubangiba missionaries. Kadi's college friend Sammy is now trying to rule Ubangiba after many years of dictatorship. Sammy calls upon Kadi for help and Mrs. Pollifax decides to accompany her to Africa. There have been a series of violent deaths at the hands of a \\"lion killer\\", one who dons a lion costume, and Sammy's enemies have accused him of being behind the murders. When Kadi arrives in Ubangiba, she becomes the target of an old enemy, and Mrs. Pollifax does her best to protect the young girl. A potential archaeological dig and the hint of romance for Kadi combine with political intrigue and murder to create another satisfying story of Mrs. Pollifax. ===Mrs. Pollifax, Innocent Tourist (1997)=== Mrs. Pollifax travels to Jordan with former Company agent John Sebastian Farrell to receive a manuscript smuggled from Iraq, written by an executed dissident Iraqi novelist. As Farrell's cover, Mrs. Pollifax poses as his tourist cousin but immediately is up to her flowered straw hat in intrigue.

The topmost cylinder is the drive piston; it has an external force applied to it to pressurize the vessel.The six squares are cross-sections through three rings; the topmost (dark gray) one is a hard material, the middle one a softer one, and the bottom one a much softer one. Bridgman originally used hard steel, softer steel, and rubber. The rubber would actually protrude into a groove in the soft steel ring above, to help hold it in place (not shown). The upturned T shape is a horizontal disk on a vertical shaft; it compresses these rings when the pressure vessel is pressurized. The blue cylinder is the sample being compressed. A cylindrical driving piston is mounted within a cylindrical channel that is closed at its far end. This piston presses against a hard steel ring, followed by a softer steel ring, and then a ring of more viscous or elastic material such as rubber, copper or soap stone, all within the channel. These three intermediate stages provide an inner cylinder, and the third stage bears on a specially shaped final steel piston that applies the force to pressurize material held at the end of the outer, enclosing channel. The final piston consists of a wider portion that fills the main channel, and a narrower cylindrical extension that leads back through the inner channel formed by the three ring-shaped intermediate stages, ending within the hard steel ring without making direct contact with the driving piston. This arrangement ensures that higher pressures create tighter seals that resist any leakage from the material at the end, since the pressure within the last and softest ring is greater than that in the material at the end. This arrangement has much in common with the earlier de Bange breech obturator system used to prevent the escape of gasses from breech loading artillery, whether inspired by that or independently invented, with the important further feature that Bridgman's system does not merely resist the escape of material under pressure while stationary, it applies that pressure by movement within the pressurising equipment. Bridgman's previous pressurizing arrangement, a screw with a 2-m spanner, allowed him to get pressures of up to 400 MPa; the Bridgman seal allowed pressures up to 40,000 MPa. These are typical pressures expected in the Earth's internal structure. This advance allowed him to make many discoveries, including the high-pressure phases of ice (still known by the Bridgman nomenclature), high-pressure minerals, and novel high-pressure material properties. These discoveries were important in many fields of science and engineering. Bridgman won a Nobel Prize for his work. ==References== Category:Seals (mechanical) ","title":"Bridgman seal"},{"id":"1274746","text":"Le Plessis-Robinson is a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris. , it has 26,581 inhabitants.INSEE ==History== Plessis was first mentioned in 839 as Plessiacus apud Castanetum, meaning plessis near Castanetum. A plessis was a village surrounded by a fence made of branches. In 1112 the village church was founded, of which the romanesque tower still survives as the oldest monument of Le Plessis. At the end of the 12th the village was renamed Le Plessis-Raoul, after the local lord Raoul, chamberlain of king Philip II of France. In 1407 it came into the hands of Jean Piquet de La Haye, who built a castle in the village, now called Le Plessis-Piquet. In 1614 a monastery of the Congregation of the Feuillants was built in the village. In 1682 Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Minister of Finances under Louis XIV had a pond dug which fed the fountains of the nearby Ch√¢teau de Sceaux. Pierre de Montesquiou d'Artagnan purchased the estate in 1699, and expanded the gardens. In 1790, as a result of the French Revolution, Antoine Moull√© was elected the first mayor of Le Plessis. The commune was renamed Le Plessis-Libert√©. The monastery was nationalised and demolished.History of Le Plessis-Robinson (Middle Ages until Revolution) The commune was renamed back to Le Plessis-Piquet in 1801.History of Le Plessis-Robinson (19th century) In 1848, a guinguette (cabaret) was established in the area as a suite of interconnected tree houses. It was named Le grand Robinson after the tree house described in Swiss Family Robinson, a novel itself named after Robinson Crusoe. Several other popular establishments arose in the area, and remained popular until the 1960s. In 1909, the commune of Le Plessis-Piquet was officially renamed Le Plessis-Robinson, after Le grand Robinson.History of Le Plessis-Robinson (Guinguettes) In 1854, Louis Hachette bought the castle and the grounds. He later became the mayor of Le Plessis-Piquet and a city councillor. The village and the castle were ruined in the War of 1870, but the castle was rebuilt by the Hachette family. == New Urbanism == New Urbanism in Le Plessis-Robinson Today Le Plessis-Robinson is considered as the most significant project of New Urbanism in France. The mayor Philippe Pemezec is currently completely reshaping the city, in collaboration with the architects Marc & Nada Breitman, winners of the 2018 Driehaus Prize and part of the New Classical movement. ==Transport== Le Plessis-Robinson is not served by the Paris M√©tro, RER, or the suburban rail network. The closest station to Le Plessis-Robinson is Robinson station on Paris RER line B.

San Juan, that contributes substantially to the income and an economic activity that is anchored on agriculture. It has complied with Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (R.A. 9003) by constructing a Category-I Sanitary Landfill under LISCOP, considered as one of its kind on the municipal level in the Province of Laguna, which aims to put into practice the segregation and proper disposal of solid waste for the protection of environment. Kalayaan is roughly rectangular in shape, with a hilly terrain on most of its eastern side, while relatively flat on its western side. Its highest elevations are from 400 to 418 metres. These are found in Sitio Santo Angel, Malaking Pulo, and Cabuhayan in Barangay San Juan, and Sitio Lamao in Barangay San Antonio. Approximately three fourths of the total land area are with terrain 300 metres above sea level. Its lowest points are from 5 to 20 metres along the western sections of Barangays San Juan and Longos towards Laguna de Bay.

Babaye got its name when the Spaniards came and found women washing clothes in the brook. When the Spaniards continued their aim to conquer the land and a little north of Babaye, they saw a place where people dried abaca and named the place Abacao. The Spaniards claimed the mountains east of Babaye and named the village found there in honor of San Pablo. On March 30, 1946, Executive Order No. 127 which ordered the transfer of the seat of government from Longos to San Juan was signed by Pres. Manuel Roxas.

The unsuccessful attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with Lewis guns‚Äîleading the media to adopt the name \\"Emu War\\" when referring to the incident. While a number of the birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction. ==Background== Fallow caused by emus Following World War I, large numbers of discharged veterans who served in the war were given land by the Australian government to take up farming within Western Australia, often in marginal areas. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were encouraged to increase their wheat crops, with the government promising‚Äîand failing to deliver‚Äîassistance in the form of subsidies. In spite of the recommendations and the promised subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop while simultaneously threatening to refuse to deliver the wheat. The difficulties facing farmers were increased by the arrival of as many as 20,000 emus. Emus regularly migrate after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the inland regions. With the cleared land and additional water supplies being made available for livestock by the Western Australian farmers, the emus found that the cultivated lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into farm territory‚Äîin particular the marginal farming land around Chandler and Walgoolan. The emus consumed and spoiled the crops, as well as leaving large gaps in fences where rabbits could enter and cause further problems. Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent to meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. Having served in World War I, the soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they requested their deployment. The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition. Pearce also supported the deployment on the grounds that the birds would make good target practice, while it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed the operation as a way of being seen to be helping the Western Australian farmers, to stave off the secession movement that was brewing. Towards that end, a cinematographer from Fox Movietone was enlisted. == The \\"War\\" == Sir George Pearce, who ordered that the army cull the emu population. He was later referred to in Parliament as the \\"Minister of the Emu War\\" by Senator James Dunn. Military involvement was due to begin in October 1932. The \\"war\\" was conducted under the command of Major G. P. W. Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery, with Meredith commanding soldiers Sergeant S. McMurray and Gunner J. O'Halloran, armed with two Lewis guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The operation was delayed, however, by a period of rainfall that caused the emus to scatter over a wider area. The rain ceased by 2 November 1932, whereupon the troops were deployed with orders to assist the farmers and, according to a newspaper account, to collect 100 emu skins so that their feathers could be used to make hats for light horsemen. ===First attempt=== On 2 November the men travelled to Campion, where some 50 emus were sighted. As the birds were out of range of the guns, the local settlers attempted to herd the emus into an ambush, but the birds split into small groups and ran so that they were difficult to target. Nevertheless, while the first fusillade from the machine guns was ineffective due to the range, a second round of gunfire was able to kill \\"a number\\" of birds. Later the same day a small flock was encountered, and \\"perhaps a dozen\\" birds were killed. The next significant event was on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, and more than 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the birds were in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds were killed and the remainder scattered before any more could be shot. No more birds were sighted that day. In the days that followed, Meredith chose to move further south, where the birds were \\"reported to be fairly tame\\",West Australian, 4 March 1932, quoted in Johnson (2006), p152 but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers noted that \\"each pack seems to have its own leader now‚Äîa big black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach\\". At one stage Meredith even went so far as to mount one of the guns on a truck, a move that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account estimates that it was 50 birds, but other accounts range from 200 to 500, the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties. Summarising the culls, ornithologist Dominic Serventy commented: On 8 November, members in the Australian House of Representatives discussed the operation. Following the negative coverage of the events in the local media, that included claims that \\"only a few\\" emus had died, Pearce withdrew the military personnel and the guns on 8 November. After the withdrawal, Major Meredith compared the emus to Zulus and commented on the striking manoeuvrability of the emus, even while badly wounded. === Second attempt === After the withdrawal of the military, the emu attacks on crops continued. Farmers again asked for support, citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. James Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia lent his strong support to renewal of the military assistance. At the same time, a report from the Base Commander was issued that indicated 300 emus had been killed in the initial operation. Acting on the requests and the Base Commander's report, by 12 November the Minister of Defence approved a resumption of military efforts. He defended the decision in the Senate, explaining why the soldiers were necessary to combat the serious agricultural threat of the large emu population. Although the military had agreed to lend the guns to the Western Australian government on the expectation that they would provide the necessary people, Meredith was once again placed in the field due to an apparent lack of experienced machine gunners in the state. Taking to the field on 13 November 1932, the military found a degree of success over the first two days, with approximately 40 emus killed. The third day, 15 November, proved to be far less successful, but by 2 December the soldiers were killing approximately 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10 December, and in his report he claimed 986 kills with 9,860 rounds, at a rate of exactly 10 rounds per confirmed kill. In addition, Meredith claimed 2,500 wounded birds had died as a result of the injuries that they had sustained. In assessing the success of the cull, an article in the Coolgardie Miner on 23 August 1935 reported that although the use of machine guns had been \\"criticised in many quarters, the method proved effective and saved what remained of the wheat\\". == Aftermath == Despite the problems encountered with the cull, the farmers of the region once again requested military assistance in 1934, 1943, and 1948, only to be turned down by the government.Request to Use Bombs to Kill Emus, The (Adelaide) Mail, (Saturday, 3 July 1943), p.12. Instead, the bounty system that had been instigated in 1923 was continued, and this proved to be effective: 57,034 bounties were claimed over a six-month period in 1934. By December 1932, word of the Emu War had spread, reaching the United Kingdom. Some conservationists there protested the cull as \\"extermination of the rare emu\\". Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell, the eminent Australian ornithologists, described the \\"war\\" as \\"an attempt at the mass destruction of the birds\\".Crew, B., \\"The Great Emu War: In which some large, flightless birds unwittingly foiled the Australian Army\\", Scientific American Blogs, Monday, 4 August 2014. Throughout 1930 and onward, exclusion barrier fencing became a popular means of keeping emus out of agricultural areas (in addition to other vermin, such as dingoes and rabbits).New Strategy in a War on the Emu, The (Sydney) Sunday Herald, (Sunday, 5 July 1953), p13. In November 1950, Hugh Leslie raised the issues of emus in federal parliament and urged Army Minister Josiah Francis to release a quantity of .303 ammunition from the army for the use of farmers. The minister approved the release of 500,000 rounds of ammunition. == See also == *Four Pests Campaign *Rabbits in Australia *Brumby shooting == References == ==External links== * How we lost the \\"Emu War\\" * Plants & Animals: Emu * Category:1932 in Australia Category:1932 in military history Category:Agriculture in Western Australia Category:Dromaius Category:History of agriculture in Australia Category:Non-combat military operations involving Australia Category:November 1932 events Category:December 1932 events Category:1930s in Western Australia Category:Emus ","title":"Emu War"},{"id":"1274787","text":"Abj is an abbreviation for abject, abjunction, and abjuration.

The magazine was founded in 1914 by George Washington Ochs Oakes, brother of The New York Times publisher Adolph Ochs, in order to provide detailed coverage of World War I. Current History was published by The New York Times Company from its founding until 1936. Since 1942 it has been owned by members of the Redmond family; its current publisher is Daniel Mark Redmond.The Philadelphia Daily News, \\"Just a Little Behind the Times,\\" December 24, 1991. Current History, based in Philadelphia, maintains no institutional, political, or governmental affiliation. It is published monthly, from September through May. Seven issues each year are devoted to world regions (China and East Asia, Russia and Eurasia, the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, South Asia, and Africa); one issue covers current global trends; and one issue addresses a special theme such as climate change or global governance. The magazine has followed this practice of devoting each issue to a single region or theme since 1953. Each issue includes a chronology of major international events, and most contain a book review section and an article devoted to commentary. Contributors to Current History in the publication's early years included George Bernard Shaw, Winston Churchill, Charles A. Beard, Allan Nevins, and Henry Steele Commager. More recently, the journal has featured authors such as James Schlesinger, Francis Fukuyama, Jeffrey Sachs, Bruce Riedel, Leslie H. Gelb, Bruce Russett, Elizabeth Economy, Charles Kupchan, Ivo Daalder, Joseph Cirincione, Phebe Marr, Juan Cole, Bruce Gilley, and Marina Ottaway. Shortly after Current History began publishing in 1914, its editor, Ochs Oakes, decided that a magazine recording ‚Äúhistory in the making‚Äù should maintain as regular contributors a group of historians and social scientists. He enlisted the help of a Harvard historian, Albert Bushnell Hart, in organizing the journal‚Äôs initial group of contributing editors. Current Historys board of contributing editors today includes Catherine Boone (The London School of Economics and Political Science); Bruce Cumings (University of Chicago); Deborah Davis (Yale University); David B. H. Denoon (New York University); Larry Diamond (Stanford University); Michele Dunne (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace); Barry Eichengreen (University of California, Berkeley); C.

The publication's editor is Alan Sorensen. The magazine was linked to an international scandal in the run-up to World War II. The New York Times had sold Current History in 1936 to the editor Merle Tracy; in 1939 it was sold again, to an ownership group that included Joseph Hilton Smyth, who also acquired such magazines as The Living Age and The North American Review. Smyth's association with Current History ended the same year, but he and two associates, in connection with their publishing activities, were later convicted of acting as agents for the Japanese government without registering with the State Department. Current History addressed this episode in its October 1942 issue, maintaining that Smyth during the months that he held an ownership interest in the publication did not control editorial policies.\\"The New York Times, \\"3 Japanese Agents Get 7-Year Terms,\\" November 13, 1942.Current History, October 1942, pp. 137‚Äì138.

Kennedy on 25 May 1961. The Soviet government publicly denied participating in such a competition, but secretly pursued two programs in the 1960s: crewed lunar flyby missions using Soyuz 7K-L1 (Zond) spacecraft launched with the Proton-K rocket, and a crewed lunar landing using Soyuz 7K-LOK and LK spacecraft launched with the N1 rocket. Following the dual American successes of the first crewed lunar orbit on 24-25 December 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1 failures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end. The Proton-based Zond program was canceled in 1970, and the N1-L3 program was de facto terminated in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976. Details of both Soviet programs were kept secret until 1990 when the government allowed them to be published under the policy of glasnost. ==Early concepts== Artist's depiction of TMK-MAVR on a Venus flyby As early as 1961, the Soviet leadership had made public pronouncements about landing a man on the Moon and establishing a lunar base; however, serious plans were not made until several years later. Sergei Korolev, the senior Soviet rocket engineer, was more interested in launching a heavy orbital station and in crewed flights to Mars and Venus. With this in mind, Korolev began the development of the super-heavy N-1 rocket with a 75-ton payload. ===Soyuz-A-B-C and N1=== Soyuz 7K-9K-11K circumlunar concept. The drawing shows Soyuz 7K (right), Soyuz-B/Soyuz 9K booster, and Soyuz-V/Soyuz 11K tanker with twin whip antennas (left) In its preliminary Moon plans, Korolev's design bureau initially promoted the Soyuz A-B-C circumlunar complex (A-B-V in Russian) concept under which a two-crew spacecraft would rendezvous with other components in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar flyby excursion vehicle. The components would then be delivered by the proven middle-sized R-7 rocket. While developing the N1, since 1963, Korolev began to plan a Moon landing mission using two launches and docking. Later Korolev managed to increase the payload of the N1 to 92-93 tons (by switching to liquid hydrogen in the upper stage(s) and increasing the number of engines in its first stage from 24 to 30), providing enough power to accomplish the mission with a single launch. ===UR-500K / LK-1 and UR-700 / LK-3=== Another main space design bureau, headed by Vladimir Chelomei, proposed a competing cislunar orbiting mission using a heavy UR-500K rocket (later renamed the Proton rocket) and a two-crew LK-1 spacecraft. Later, Chelomei also proposed a Moon landing program with a super-heavy UR-700 rocket, an LK-700 lunar lander, and an LK-3 spacecraft. ===R-56=== The R-56 which was developed between April 1962 and June 1964 was considered for involvement with the lunar program. ==Reaction to Apollo== The Soviet government issued a response to the American Apollo challenge after three years. According to the first government decree about the Soviet crewed Moon programs (Decree 655-268, ' On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space '), adopted in August 1964, Chelomei was instructed to develop a Moon flyby program with a projected first flight by the end of 1966, and Korolev was instructed to develop the Moon landing program with a first flight by the end of 1967. Following the change from Nikita Khrushchev to Leonid Brezhnev in 1964, the Soviet government in September 1965 assigned the flyby program to Korolev, who redesigned the cislunar mission to use his own Soyuz 7K-L1 spacecraft and Chelomei's Proton rocket. Korolev organized full-scale development of both programs, but died after surgery in January 1966. According to a government decree of February 1967, the first crewed flyby was scheduled for mid-1967, and the first crewed landing for the end of 1968. === Moon flyby UR-500K(Proton)/L1(Zond) program === Zond (Soyuz 7K-L1) circumlunar spacecraft. Launched by a 3-staged Proton rocket, the L1(Zond) was a spacecraft from the Soyuz family and consisted of two or three modified modules of the main craft Soyuz 7K-OK with a total weight of 5.5 tons. The Apollo orbital spacecraft (command ship) for the lunar flyby also had two modules (command and service) but was five times heavier, carried a crew of three and entered lunar orbit, whereas the L1 (Zond) performed a flight around the Moon and came back on a return trajectory. Planned for 8 December 1968 for priority over the US, a first crewed mission of the L1 (Zond) was canceled due to the insufficient readiness of the capsule and rocket. After Apollo 8 won the first (lunar flyby) phase of the Moon Race at the end of 1968, the Soviet leadership lost political interest in the L1 (Zond) program. A few reserve units of L1 (Zond) made unpiloted flights, but by the end of 1970, this program was canceled. === Moon landing N1/L3 program === rendering. LK (Lunniy korabl‚Äî\\"lunar craft\\" or lunar ship). The crewed landing plan adopted a similar method to the single launch and lunar orbit rendezvous of the Apollo project. For mission safety, weeks before the crewed mission, an LK-R uncrewed L3 complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers would be sent to the Moon, to work as radio beacons for crewed LK, with the LK-R used as a reserve escape craft. The Lunokhods were also equipped with manual controls for the cosmonauts, both for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular research. The N1 rocket would then carry the L3 Moon expedition complex, with two spacecraft (LOK and LK) and two (Block G and Block D) boosters. A variant of the Soyuz craft, the \\"Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl\\" (LOK) command module, would carry two men, with three modules like the regular Soyuz 7K-OK, but was heavier by a few tons. The 7K-OK was half the mass of the three-crew Apollo orbital command ship. The \\"Lunniy Korabl\\" (LK) accommodated only one cosmonaut, so in the Soviet plan, only one cosmonaut would land on the Moon. The mass of the LK was 40% of the mass of the Apollo lunar lander. The L3 complex to be placed in LEO by the N1 was 93 tons (compared to Saturn V's 137 tons). The mass of the LOK and LK was 40% of the Apollo complex, but was equivalent to the L3 complex without Block G. The booster for the LEO toward the Moon for the Apollo vehicle was provided by the last stage of the Saturn V, while for the Block D, LOK and LK, this was to be provided by Block G of the same L3 complex. During the L3 complex's journey to the Moon, there would be no need to undock and re-dock the orbital and landing craft as was done in Apollo, because the cosmonaut would transfer from the LOK to LK by a 'spacewalk'. On the Apollo missions, the transfer was done using an internal passage. Block D was to slow the LOK and LK into lunar orbit, while with Apollo this phase was undertaken by firing the engine on the service module to slow the complex and enter lunar orbit since the Apollo complex traveled with the Command Module and Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) facing back towards the Earth. Once in orbit, the LK with Block D would separate from the LOK and descend toward the surface of the Moon using the Block D engine. After Block D exhausted its fuel, the LK was to separate and complete landing using its own engine. On the Moon, the cosmonaut would take Moon walks, use Lunokhods, collect rocks, and plant the Soviet flag. After a few hours on the lunar surface, the LK's engine would fire again using its landing structure as a launch pad, as with Apollo. To save weight, the engine used for landing would blast the LK back to lunar orbit for an automated docking with the LOK. The cosmonaut then would spacewalk back to the LOK carrying rock samples. The LK would then be cast off, after which the LOK would fire its rocket for the return to Earth. ===Launch schedules=== As of 1967, the L1/L3 launch schedules were: UR-500K(Proton)/L1(Zond) program :2P: Develop Block D stage (February or March 1967) :3P: Develop Block D stage (March 1967) :4L: Uncrewed lunar flyby (May 1967) :5L: Uncrewed lunar flyby (June 1967) :6L: Crewed lunar flyby (June or July 1967) :7L: Crewed lunar flybys (August 1967) :8L: Crewed lunar flybys (August 1967) :9L: Crewed lunar flybys (September 1967) :10L: Crewed lunar flybys (September 1967) :11L: Crewed lunar flybys (October 1967) :12L: Crewed lunar flybys (October 1967) :13L: Reserve spacecraft N1/L3 program :3L: Develop LV & Blocks G&D; (September 1967) :4L: Reserve :5L: LOK/LK uncrewed (December 1967) :6L: LOK/LK uncrewed (February 1968) :7L: Crewed LOK/uncrewed LK (April 1968) :8L: Crewed LOK/uncrewed LK (June 1968) :9L: Crewed LOK/uncrewed LK with LK lunar landing (August 1968) :10L: First crewed lunar landing (September 1968) :11L: Reserve :12L: Reserve Korolev's death in 1966, along with various technical and administrative reasons, as well as a lack of financial support, resulted in both programs being delayed. ===Cosmonauts=== In 1966, two cosmonaut training groups were formed. One group was commanded by Vladimir Komarov and included Yuri Gagarin, and was to prepare for qualification flights of the Soyuz in Earth orbit and a Proton-launched cis- lunar mission (Gagarin, Nikolayev, Komarov, Bykovsky, Khrunov; Engineer- Cosmonauts: Gorbatko, Grechko, Sevastyanov, Kubasov, Volkov). Komarov later died in the Soyuz 1 spaceflight when his parachute malfunctioned causing his capsule to smash into the earth at high speed. The second group was led by Alexei Leonov and concentrated on the landing mission (Commanders: Leonov, Popovich, Belyayev, Volynov, Klimuk; Engineer-cosmonauts: Makarov, Voronov, Rukavishnikov, Artyukhin). As a result, Leonov has the strongest claim to have been the Soviets' first choice for the first man on the Moon. After Komarov's death in Soyuz 1 in 1967, Gagarin was taken out of training and the groups were restructured. Despite the Soyuz 1 setback, the Soviets successfully rehearsed the automated docking of two uncrewed Soyuz craft in Earth orbit in 1968 and with the crewed Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 joint mission in early 1969 tested the other key mission elements. A total of 18 missions were related to the N1-L3 project. ==Later developments== After the US Moon landing in 1969, the justification for the Soviet lunar landing program largely evaporated, although development and testing continued into the early 1970s. In 1970‚Äì1971 the LK was ready after three uncrewed test flights in LEO (Kosmos 379, Kosmos 398, Kosmos 434). The LOK launched once (Kosmos 382 7K-L1E, a dummy of 7K-LOK). The Krechet lunar spacesuit and support systems were tested. Four N1 test launches in 1969 (twice), 1971, and 1972 were failures, despite improvements after each crash. The second launch, on 3 July 1969 (an attempt to upstage Apollo 11 by 13 days), resulted in the destruction of the rocket and the entire launch complex, which delayed the N1-L3 program for two years. In an automatic Moon flyby, these first two launches of the N1 carried the 7K-L1S spacecraft (modified 7K-L1). The dummy 7K-LOK (7K-L1E) and regular 7K-LOK with dummy LKs were used in the third and fourth launches. The complete L3 lunar expedition complex with the 7K-LOK and LK for the Moon flyby and landing was prepared for a fifth launch, using a modified N1 rocket in August 1974. If this mission and the next had been successful, it would have led to the decision to launch up to five Soviet crewed N1-L3 expeditions in 1976‚Äì1980. To gain technical and scientific interest in the program, the modified multi-launched N1F-L3M missions were planned to have significantly more time on the Moon's surface than Apollo. However, N1-L3 (as well as N1F-L3M) program was canceled in May 1974, and Soviet crewed space efforts subsequently concentrated on the development of space stations and on several designs and ground preparatory processes for a Mars mission, which continues to the present day, but has unclear objectives. A Moon base, Zvezda, that was proposed later, developed mockups of expedition vehiclesLEK Lunar Expeditionary Complex and surface modules,DLB Module and \\"Vulkan-LEK\\" project were not adopted for economic reasons. As some recompense and as a replacement for the crewed landing program, the Soviets fulfilled a program of automated delivery of lunar soil and Lunokhod automated Moon rovers. The launch pad and MIK of N1 were redesigned for the Energia-Buran shuttle program. Five LKs and three LOKs remain, at least, with some kept in the designer's and producer's company museums. Nearly 150 engines produced for first stages of N1F were kept by the manufacturer (Kuznetsov Design Bureau), then sold for use on other launchers beginning around 2000. ==Gallery== File:Sow.Mondraumschiff.jpg  LOK (Soyuz 7K-L3) Image:LOK R√ºckstart.jpg  LK Lander - Lunniy Korabl ascent from Moon Image:Apollo-LOK.jpg  Apollo CSM and LOK (Soyuz 7K-L3) (drawn to scale).

P. Morton in command. ==Pre-World War I== Flusser arrived at Charleston, South Carolina - her home port - on 17 December 1909, and began her participation in the regular operating schedule of the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet, an organization many times redesignated in the years that followed. She cruised from the Caribbean to the coast of New England until August 1916, when she began neutrality patrols off New York and in Long Island Sound. ==World War I== After a repair period at New Orleans, Louisiana early in 1917, Flusser had escort duty on the east coast until 30 July 1917, when she departed Charleston for two months of ocean escort and patrol duty based on Ponta Delgada, Azores. She had similar duty out of Brest, France, operating across the English Channel from 22 October-9 December 1918, returning to Charleston on 31 December.

This CPU design technique is also known as \\"interleaved\\" or \\"fine-grained\\" temporal multithreading. Unlike simultaneous multithreading in modern superscalar architectures, it generally does not allow execution of multiple instructions in one cycle. Like preemptive multitasking, each thread of execution is assigned its own program counter and other hardware registers (each thread's architectural state). A barrel processor can guarantee that each thread will execute one instruction every n cycles, unlike a preemptive multitasking machine, that typically runs one thread of execution for tens of millions of cycles, while all other threads wait their turn. A technique called C-slowing can automatically generate a corresponding barrel processor design from a single-tasking processor design. An n-way barrel processor generated this way acts much like n separate multiprocessing copies of the original single-tasking processor, each one running at roughly 1/n the original speed. ==History== One of the earliest examples of a barrel processor was the I/O processing system in the CDC 6000 series supercomputers. These executed one instruction (or a portion of an instruction) from each of 10 different virtual processors (called peripheral processors) before returning to the first processor.CDC Cyber 170 Computer Systems; Models 720, 730, 750, and 760; Model 176 (Level B); CPU Instruction Set; PPU Instruction Set -- See page 2-44 for an illustration of the rotating \\"barrel\\". One motivation for barrel processors was to reduce hardware costs. In the case of the CDC 6x00 PPUs, the digital logic of the processor was much faster than the core memory, so rather than having ten separate processors, there are ten separate core memory units for the PPUs, but they all share the single set of processor logic. Another example is the Honeywell 800, which had 8 groups of registers, allowing up to 8 concurrent programs. After each instruction, the processor would (in most cases) switch to the next active program in sequence. Barrel processors have also been used as large-scale central processors. The Tera MTA (1988) was a large-scale barrel processor design with 128 threads per core. The MTA architecture has seen continued development in successive products, such as the Cray Urika-GD, originally introduced in 2012 (as the YarcData uRiKA) and targeted at data-mining applications. Barrel processors are also found in embedded systems, where they are particularly useful for their deterministic real-time thread performance. An example is the XMOS XCore XS1 (2007), a four-stage barrel processor with eight threads per core. The XS1 is found in Ethernet, USB, audio, and control devices, and other applications where I/O performance is critical. Barrel processors have also been used in specialized devices such as the eight-thread Ubicom IP3023 network I/O processor (2004). Some 8-bit microcontrollers by Padauk Technology feature barrel processors with up to 8 threads per core. ==Comparison with single- threaded processors== ===Advantages=== A single-tasking processor spends a lot of time idle, not doing anything useful whenever a cache miss or pipeline stall occurs. Advantages to employing barrel processors over single-tasking processors include: * The ability to do useful work on the other threads while the stalled thread is waiting. * Designing an n-way barrel processor with an n-deep pipeline is much simpler than designing a single-tasking processor because a barrel processor never has a pipeline stall and doesn't need feed- forward circuits. * For real-time applications, a barrel processor can guarantee that a \\"real-time\\" thread can execute with precise timing, no matter what happens to the other threads, even if some other thread locks up in an infinite loop or is continuously interrupted by hardware interrupts. ===Disadvantages=== There are a few disadvantages to barrel processors. * The state of each thread must be kept on-chip, typically in registers, to avoid costly off-chip context switches. This requires a large number of registers compared to typical processors. * Either all threads must share the same cache, which slows overall system performance, or there must be one unit of cache for each execution thread, which can significantly increase the transistor count and thus the cost of such a CPU. However, in hard real-time embedded systems where barrel processors are often found, memory access costs are typically calculated assuming worst-case cache behavior, so this is a minor concern. Some barrel processors such as the XMOS XS1 do not have a cache at all. ==See also== * Super-threading * Computer multitasking * Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) * Hyper-threading * Vector processor * Cray XMT ==References== == External links == * Soft peripherals Embedded.com article examines Ubicom's IP3023 processor * An Evaluation of the Design of the Gamma 60 * Histoire et architecture du Gamma 60 (French and English) Category:Central processing unit Category:Instruction processing Category:Threads (computing) ","title":"Barrel processor"},{"id":"1274827","text":"Novak (in Serbian, Croatian and Slovene; Cyrillic: ), Nov√°k (in Hungarian, Czech and Slovak), Nowak or Novack (in German and Polish) is a surname and masculine given name, derived from the slavic word for \\"new\\" (e.g. , , / ), which depending on the exact language and usage, translates as \\"novice\\", \\"new man\\", \\"newcomer\\", or \\"stranger\\". It seems to originate, at least by common occurrence, in the province of Upper Silesia, when Germanic stock moved into the upper Oder river region, the slavs referred to the \\"new men\\" as \\"Nowaks\\". Another theory is that \\"new man\\" refers to a person who has converted to Christianity or to a new arrival in a city. It was also used for newcomers to an army and as an occupational surname for people who used the slash-and-burn method to create new arable land‚Äînovina.Izvori priimkov. Imenoslovec prof. Pavle Merku. Mladina.si. It is pronounced almost the same way in most languages, with the stress on the first syllable. The main exception is Slovene, which places the stress on the last syllable. It is the most common surname in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia, and the sixth most common in Croatia. It is also found in Romania and Moldova in the Novac form and among Ashkenazi Jews in various forms depending on their country of origin.Laurence Urdang. The Last Word: The English Language: Opinions and Prejudices. OmniData. 2008. p. 228. ==Spelling== The surname is usually spelled Nov√°k in Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian, Nowak in Polish and German, Novak () in Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, and Novac in Romanian. ==In specific countries== === Poland === As of 2009, Nowak ( ) is the most common surname in Poland, having surpassed Kowalski.Statystyka najpopularniejszych nazwisk wystƒôpujƒÖcych w Polsce in 2009 (\\"The most popular surnames in Poland in 2009\\"). Its plural is Nowakowie (). Nowak is used by both male and female individuals. The archaic feminine version is Nowakowa (). Related surnames include Nowakowski (feminine: Nowakowska; plural: Nowakowscy), Nowacki (feminine: Nowacka; plural: Nowaccy), Nowakowicz (gender- neutral), and Nowakiewicz (gender-neutral). Nowak is the most common surname in nine voivodeships (administrative units) of Poland, and second in another. It is ranked first in Greater Poland Voivodeship (35,011), Silesian Voivodeship (31,838), Lesser Poland Voivodeship (23,671), ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship (15,460), Lower Silesian Voivodeship (13,217), West Pomeranian Voivodeship (7,444), Opole Voivodeship (5,538), Lubusz Voivodeship (5,444), and ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship (5,538), and second in Subcarpathian Voivodeship (9,301). There are two noble families of Polish origin with the surname Nowak: * One family appeared in Silesia in the 15th century. It included Anatol Nowak (died 1456), Archbishop of Wroc≈Çaw. A branch of this family became barons in Bohemia in 1660. * One family appeared in Masovia around 1750. This family included Antoni and J√≥zef Nowak, generals in the Polish army that served Napoleon, and Aleksander Nowak, a general of the Polish forces during the November Uprising in 1831 against Russia. === Czech Republic and Slovakia === Nov√°k is widespread in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In both countries, the feminine form is Nov√°kov√°. It is the most common surname in the Czech Republic. === Slovenia === Novak is the most common surname in Slovenia with more than 11,000 sharing it. There are however significant variations between regions: it is very common in central Slovenia (in the regions around Ljubljana and Celje), as well as in parts of southern Slovenia and eastern Slovenia (Lower Carniola, Prekmurje). It is much less common in northern and western Slovenia; in the Gori≈°ka region on the border with Italy, it is quite rare. The rank of the surname Novak in the Slovenian statistical regions: 1st in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region (3,422) and Savinja Statistical Region (1,380); 2nd in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region (1,231) and Mura Statistical Region (1,040); 3rd in the Drava Statistical Region (1,732); 5th in the Upper Carniola Statistical Region (963) and Lower Sava Statistical Region (380); 6th in the Coastal‚ÄìKarst Statistical Region (228); 8th in the Central Sava Statistical Region (192); 10th in the Carinthia Statistical Region (238); 11th in the Inner Carniola‚ÄìKarst Statistical Region (228); 131st in the Gorizia Statistical Region (171). === Other countries === In Croatia, Novak is the sixth most common surname. In Serbia and Montenegro, Novak is a given name, while Novakoviƒá is found as a common surname. In Germany, Nowak is 159th (c. 31,000) and Noack is 270th (c. 22,000), together with different spellings (c. 64,000), with some concentration in the Ruhr area, around Salzgitter and L√ºchow-Dannenberg and as Noack in Lusatia. ==People== ===Novak and Nov√°k surname=== ====A‚ÄìJ==== * Alexander Novak (born 1971), Russian politician * Anatole Novak (born 1937), French bicycle racer * Andriy Novak (born 1988), Ukrainian footballer * Anthony Novak (born 1994), Canadian soccer player * Arne Nov√°k (1880‚Äì1939), Czech literary historian and critic * Augustin Nov√°k, a World War I flying ace * B.

ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this term differs from the term \\"side effect\\" because side effects can be beneficial as well as detrimental. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury. An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown. ADRs are only one type of medication-related harm, as harm can also be caused by omitting to take indicated medications. ==Classification== ADRs may be classified by e.g. cause and severity. ===Cause=== *Type A: Augmented pharmacologic effects - dose dependent and predictable :Type A reactions, which constitute approximately 80% of adverse drug reactions, are usually a consequence of the drug‚Äôs primary pharmacological effect (e.g. bleeding when using the anticoagulant warfarin) or a low therapeutic index of the drug (e.g. nausea from digoxin), and they are therefore predictable. They are dose- related and usually mild, although they may be serious or even fatal (e.g. intracranial bleeding from warfarin). Such reactions are usually due to inappropriate dosage, especially when drug elimination is impaired. The term ‚Äòside effects‚Äô is often applied to minor type A reactions. * Type B: Idiosyncratic Types A and B were proposed in the 1970s,Rawlins MD, Thompson JW. Pathogenesis of adverse drug reactions. In: Davies DM, ed. Textbook of adverse drug reactions. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977:10. and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify ADRs.Aronson JK. Drug therapy. In: Haslett C, Chilvers ER, Boon NA, Colledge NR, Hunter JAA, eds. Davidson's principles and practice of medicine 19th ed. Edinburgh: Elsevier Science, 2002:147- ===Seriousness=== The U.S Food and Drug Administration defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following: * Death * Life-threatening * Hospitalization (initial or prolonged) * Disability - significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities or quality of life. * Congenital abnormality * Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage Severity is a point on an arbitrary scale of intensity of the adverse event in question. The terms \\"severe\\" and \\"serious\\", when applied to adverse events, are technically very different. They are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably, requiring care in usage. A headache is severe if it causes intense pain. There are scales like \\"visual analog scale\\" that help clinicians assess the severity. On the other hand, a headache is not usually serious (but may be in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural bleed, even a migraine may temporally fit criteria), unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness listed above. ==Location== Adverse effects may be local, i.e. limited to a certain location, or systemic, where medication has caused adverse effects throughout the systemic circulation. For instance, some ocular antihypertensives cause systemic effects, Page 146 although they are administered locally as eye drops, since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation. ==Mechanisms== Adverse drug reaction leading to hepatitis (drug- induced hepatitis) with granulomata. Other causes were excluded with extensive investigations. Liver biopsy. H&E; stain. As research better explains the biochemistry of drug use, fewer ADRs are Type B and more are Type A. Common mechanisms are: * Abnormal pharmacokinetics due to ** genetic factors ** comorbid disease states * Synergistic effects between either ** a drug and a disease ** two drugs *Antagonism effects between either **a drug and a disease ** two drugs ===Abnormal pharmacokinetics=== ====Comorbid disease states==== Various diseases, especially those that cause renal or hepatic insufficiency, may alter drug metabolism. Resources are available that report changes in a drug's metabolism due to disease states. The Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health Conditions in Dementia (MATCH-D) criteria warns that people with dementia are more likely to experience adverse effects, and that they are less likely to be able to reliably report symptoms. ====Genetic factors==== Abnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either Phase I oxidation or Phase II conjugation. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the inherited basis for abnormal drug reactions. Phase I reactions Inheriting abnormal alleles of cytochrome P450 can alter drug metabolism. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions. Inheriting abnormal butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) may affect metabolism of drugs such as succinylcholine Phase II reactions Inheriting abnormal N-acetyltransferase which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine, and procainamide. Inheriting abnormal thiopurine S-methyltransferase may affect the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs mercaptopurine and azathioprine. ====Interactions with other drugs==== The risk of drug interactions is increased with polypharmacy. Protein binding These interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved.OVID full text summary table at OVID These are mainly for drugs without much first-pass liver metabolism. The principal plasma proteins for drug binding are: # albumin # Œ±1-acid glycoprotein # lipoproteins Some drug interactions with warfarin are due to changes in protein binding. Cytochrome P450 Patients have abnormal metabolism by cytochrome P450 due to either inheriting abnormal alleles or due to drug interactions. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions. ===Synergistic effects=== An example of synergism is two drugs that both prolong the QT interval. ==Assessing causality== Causality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the Naranjo algorithm, the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply. An ADR should not be labeled as 'certain' unless the ADR abates with a challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR. Assigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult, unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used. Both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error. Even in clinical studies some ADRs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find that adverse drug reaction. Psychiatric ADRs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population. ==Monitoring bodies== Many countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions. On an international level, the WHO runs the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, and the European Union runs the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring post-marketing studies. In Canada, the Marketed Health Products Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the surveillance of marketed health products. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) conducts postmarket monitoring of therapeutic products. In the UK the Yellow Card Scheme was established in 1963. ==Epidemiology== A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2011, sedatives and hypnotics were a leading source for adverse drug events seen in the hospital setting. Approximately 2.8% of all ADEs present on admission and 4.4% of ADEs that originated during a hospital stay were caused by a sedative or hypnotic drug. A second study by AHRQ found that in 2011, the most common specifically identified causes of adverse drug events that originated during hospital stays in the U.S. were steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants. Patients treated in urban teaching hospitals had higher rates of ADEs involving antibiotics and opiates/narcotics compared to those treated in urban nonteaching hospitals. Those treated in private, nonprofit hospitals had higher rates of most ADE causes compared to patients treated in public or private, for-profit hospitals. In the U.S., females had a higher rate of ADEs involving opiates and narcotics than males in 2011, while male patients had a higher rate of anticoagulant ADEs. Nearly 8 in 1,000 adults aged 65 years or older experienced one of the four most common ADEs (steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants) during hospitalization. A study showed that 48% of patients had an adverse drug reaction to at least one drug, and pharmacist involvement helps to pick up adverse drug reactions. In 2012 McKinsey &Co.; concluded that the cost of the 35 million preventable adverse drug events would be as high as US$115 billion.http://www.gs1.org/docs/healthcare/McKinsey_Healthcare_Report_Strength_in_Unity.pdf == See also == * Alleged problems in the drug approval process * Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals * Drug therapy problems * EudraVigilance (European Union) * History of pharmacy * Iatrogenesis * Lethal dose * List of withdrawn drugs * Paradoxical reaction * Polypharmacy * Toxicity * Toxicology * The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics * Yellow Card Scheme (UK) == References == == Further reading == *Incidence of adverse drug reactions in human immune deficiency virus-positive patients using highly active antiretroviral therapy == External links == Category:Pharmacy Category:Clinical pharmacology Category:Drug safety ","title":"Adverse drug reaction"},{"id":"1274844","text":"F√≠or Sc√©al is an Irish language documentary series broadcast on Irish language television channel TG4 about aspects of world current affairs and other topics.

V. Woodward in temporary command. ==Pre-World War I== Assigned to the Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla, an organization redesignated many times in the years which followed, Reid operated along the east coast - primarily engaged in training exercises and drills - until the United States entered World War I. ==World War I== On 6 April 1917, Reid was attached to the Southern Patrol Force, operating out of Key West, Florida. On the 14th, she moved north and on the 18th joined Squadron 1, Patrol Force at Boston, Massachusetts. Transferred to Squadron 2 in early May, she patrolled the northeast coast of the United States until detached from the Patrol Force on 15 May and assigned to the Destroyer Force. Reporting on the 17th, she escorted coastal traffic and patrolled the approaches to New York City until ordered to Charleston, South Carolina to prepare for distant service on 5 July. Reid sailed east on 21 July, and from 1 August-30 September provided escort and patrol services in the vicinity of the Azores. Detached in October, she proceeded to Brest, whence she resumed her patrol and escort mission. On the 23rd, she was rammed and damaged above the waterline by . Repairs were completed quickly at Brest, and she continued her work without further interruption until the end of the war. During that period, she made several attacks on submarines, most notably against UB-55 on 18 March 1918 and U-86 on 1 July, but she failed to sink any. ==Inter-war period== Relieved after the Armistice, Reid departed Brest for Charleston and inactivation on 11 December. Arriving on the 31st, she later shifted to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where she was decommissioned on 31 July 1919. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September and was sold to T. A.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. In the episode, a massive heatwave causes the residents of Springfield to install large air conditioning devices in their homes. This leads the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to overload, causing two town-wide blackouts to occur. The Springfield Police Department are powerless to the riots that follow, prompting Homer, dissatisfied with the police's incompetence, to start his own security company called SpringShield. \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" was directed by Pete Michels and written by Dana Gould, who also pitched the idea for the episode. It features American actor Joe Mantegna as recurring character Fat Tony, and includes references to Dragnet, High Noon and The Sopranos. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 5.3 million viewers, finishing in 53rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release on August 24, 2010, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The episode was dedicated to the memory of Stephen Jay Gould who died two days before it aired. He had voiced himself in the ninth-season episode \\"Lisa the Skeptic\\". ==Plot== Springfield is in the midst of a massive heat wave. Every building in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. After Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store with no active alarm and decide to loot it, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave. The next day, Springfield has been devastated by the crime wave. Mayor Quimby decides to take action by forming a Blue Ribbon Committee. At the Simpsons' house, someone steals Lisa's Malibu Stacy collection. Homer decides to take action by looking for it. He finds the culprit, Jimbo Jones, and later foils a robbery by Snake Jailbird at the Kwik-E-Mart. He goes through a very long list of his previous jobs (during which Marge puts curlers in her hair offscreen) and decides that he likes the idea of combining his love of helping and hurting people. Homer forms his own security company called \\"SpringShield\\". Although it only has Homer, Lenny, and Carl, it is more efficient and more successful than the Springfield Police Department. When Quimby sees Chief Wiggum trying to shoot a Pi√±ata with a shotgun while blindfolded, he dismisses Wiggum and (in a fit of rage) makes Homer the chief of police. After stopping one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer unless he leaves town. Homer is unable to get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives with a few of his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle‚Äîthe characters of the Sopranos series. Just before they are about to kill Homer, an unseen sniper shoots the mobsters; injuring them and causing them to flee. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle. ==Production== Joe Mantegna portrayed Fat Tony in the episode. \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" was written by Dana Gould and directed by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, \\"the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you.\\"Gould, Dana. (2010). Commentary for \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes the owner of a security company, which then became \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge.\\" Although current showrunner Al Jean found it \\"very funny,\\" the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers.Jean, Al. (2010). Commentary for \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was \\"somewhat obsessed\\" with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said \\"I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels.\\" While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa \\"Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?\\" Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.Mantegna, Joe. (2010). Commentary for \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In another scene in the episode, Homer shows his family an advertisement for his security company. In it, a monster is seen breaking into an elderly woman's house. When the woman screams, the screen freezes and Homer is composited to the screen, instructing the audience about SpringShield's telephone number. In order to composite Homer into the screen, director Michels made use of a greenscreen. The advertisement resumes and the monster is subdued by Homer, Lenny and Carl. Confused, the monster turns to Homer and asks, \\"friend?\\" to which Homer replies \\"the only friend you need is SpringShield,\\" and holds a business card in front of the camera. The monster then puts the card in his wallet and says \\"monster put in wallet.\\" The monster's last line was written during one of the episode's rewrites, but none of the writers on The Simpsons' writing staff has taken credit for it. The line has since become very popular with the series' writing staff; Jean said that it was \\"very funny and unusual for a television show,\\" and Gould considers it to be his favourite joke in any episode he has ever written. At the end of the episode, Maggie saves Homer by shooting Fat Tony's gang members with a rifle, as a reference to the two-part episode Who Shot Mr. Burns? from seasons 6 and 7, in which it is ultimately revealed that Maggie shot Burns after his gun fell into her hands. The scene was conceived by series co-creator and executive producer James L. Brooks while writing notes during the episode's first table-read. While \\"The Frying Game\\" was originally thought to be the last episode of the season, \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" was later revealed to be the real season finale. Although new episodes of The Simpsons usually air on Sundays, \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" aired on Wednesday, May 22, 2002. On August 24, 2010, \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" was released as part of The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Matt Selman, Carolyn Omine, Dana Gould, Joe Mantegna and Pete Michels participated in the audio commentary of the episode. ==Cultural references== In a scene in the episode, Homer tells Marge about all the jobs he has had, referencing several episodes of the series. According to Jean, the scene was added during a rewrite of the episode's script. In another scene, Homer, in the Springfield church, attempts to recruit companions for his security company. The scene is a reference to the 1952 American western film High Noon, although the line \\"You all know me\\" was taken from the American horror/thriller film Jaws. When visiting the clothing store Wooly Bully, Homer has a rapid, monotone conversation with the cashier. The two speak in a similar manner to the characters in the American 1950's television crime drama Dragnet, of which Gould was a \\"big fan\\". When noticing that one of his ferrets is wearing a wire, Fat Tony tells it \\"you're not a pet, and you're not a friend. You're nothing to me.\\" The line parodies a similar conversation between Michael and Fredo Corleone in the American gangster film The Godfather Part II. Near the end of the episode, Fat Tony drives to the Simpsons house in what seems to be a white Dodge Caravan, while shots of Springfield are shown on the way. The scene parodies the title sequence of the American television drama series The Sopranos, and features Alabama 3's song \\"Woke Up This Morning,\\" which is also used in The Sopranos' title sequence. Michels stated that the parody was \\"very fun\\" to animate; \\"Being from New Jersey, it was a labor of love,\\" he said in the episode's DVD commentary.Michels, Pete. (2010). Commentary for \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode title is a reference to the James Brown song \\"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\\". The monster of SpringShield commercial is a parody of the The New Woody Woodpecker Show Badger character, including a quote \\"Hey buddy\\". ==Reception== In its original American broadcast, \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" received a 5.0 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 5.3 million viewers. The episode finished in 53rd place in the ratings for the week of May 20‚Äì26, 2002. Together with the first half-hour of Celebrity Boxing, the shows averaged a 3.9 rating among adults between ages 18 and 49, pushing Fox to number two for the night, just behind NBC. Some listings do not name this show as the Season 13 finale because it aired outside of the series' regular Sunday 8PM EST timeslot; those listings name this episode as a \\"special airing\\" and list The Frying Game as the S13 finale instead. Following its home video release, \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Writing for 411Mania, Ron Martin gave the episode a mixed review, calling it \\"passable.\\" He wrote that \\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" is \\"far from memorable as season finales should be.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote \\"Like many S13 episodes, ‚ÄúBadge‚Äù feels more than a little derivative,\\" describing the episode as a combination of the season 4 episode \\"Mr. Plow\\" and the season 5 episode \\"Homer the Vigilante\\". He continued by writing \\"That doesn‚Äôt mean the show lacks amusement, but it‚Äôs too rehashed to end the year with a real winner.\\" Nate Boss of Project-Blu described it as \\"A random episode, without many laughs,\\" however, he added that it \\"could have been worse.\\" Giving the episode a positive review, Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave it a B+, billing \\"Homer's 'You know I've had a lot of jobs' list\\" as the episode's \\"highlight\\". Writing for Screen Jabber, Stuart O'Connor was favorable as well, describing it as a \\"first-rate ep[isode]\\". Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 13th season. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge\\" at The Simpsons.com * * * Category:The Simpsons (season 13) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes Category:The Sopranos ","title":"Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge"},{"id":"1274912","text":"Terak may refer to: * King Terak, a minor Star Wars character * Terak 8510/a, a 1970s personal computer compatible with PDP-11 * Terak Township (), a township of Wuqia County in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.

The Vancouver Canucks, a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL), currently use a lumberjack rendition of Johnny Canuck as one of their team logos. ==Political cartoon== Johnny Canuck is a fictional lumberjack and a national personification of Canada. He first appeared in early political cartoons dating to 1869 where he was portrayed as a younger cousin of the United States' Uncle Sam and Britain's John Bull. Dressed as a habitant, farmer, logger, rancher or soldier, he was characterized as wholesome and simple-minded and was often depicted resisting the bullying of John Bull or Uncle Sam. He appeared regularly in editorial cartoons for 30 years before declining in usage in the early twentieth century. ==Comic book hero== The character re-emerged during World War II in the February 1942 issue of Bell Features' Dime Comics #1. Cartoonist Leo Bachle created the character as a teenager, apparently on a challenge from a Bell executive. Initially, Johnny Canuck had no superpowers. Johnny Canuck's cartoon exploits helped Canada fight against Nazism. Like Captain America, he met Adolf Hitler and almost single-handedly ended the war. The use of such stock figures diminished in popularity after World War II. However, in 1975, a new comic book character, Captain Canuck, emerged. Created by Richard Comely (who at the time was unaware of the earlier Johnny Canuck character), Captain Canuck was a costumed superhero rather than just a hero, and he wore red and white tights and bore a red maple leaf emblazoned on the forehead of his mask. In 1995, Canada Post issued a series of Canadian postage stamps celebrating Canada's comic-book superheroes. Johnny Canuck is depicted as he appeared in the comic books, dressed in flight jacket, goggles, leather headgear and boots. Johnny Canuck is linked to a tradition of stalwart, honest, upstanding Canadian heroes. Ty Templeton and Moonstone Books resurrected the character in a comic originally called Johnny Canuck and the Guardians of the Northern Lights and then re-titled The Northern Guard, which published two issues in December 2010 and March 2011. ==Vancouver Canucks== In the mid-20th century, the Vancouver Canucks, a major professional ice hockey team of the Pacific Coast Hockey League and later Western Hockey League, used a lumberjack rendition of Johnny Canuck as their logo. When the Canucks moved to the National Hockey League in 1970, they discontinued the Johnny Canuck logo in favour of the \\"Stick-in- Rink\\" logo. In 2006, a vintage-inspired goaltender mask worn by Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo once again featured Johnny Canuck. In the 2007 off- season, it was announced that the Canucks were designing a new uniform and it was speculated among fans and media that Johnny Canuck would officially return as a logo in some capacity. Although the character was ultimately not included, the following season, in 2007‚Äì08, Luongo's new mask once again featured Johnny Canuck, but more prominently than his previous design. Then, beginning in 2008‚Äì09, the Canucks reintroduced their retro Johnny Canuck WHL logo as a decal worn on their third helmets, as well as a stylized version of ‚Äì Johnny Canuck's face overtop a \\"V\\" ‚Äì as a shoulder patch on their third jersey. ==See also== * Captain Canuck * Canuck ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== *Canadian Encyclopedia \\"Johnny Canuck.\\" *Johnny Canuck *Vancouver Canucks logos Category:Fictional lumberjacks Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Category:Canadian comics Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Canuck, Johnny Category:National symbols of Canada Canuck, Johnny ","title":"Johnny Canuck"},{"id":"1274917","text":"Samuel Chester Reid (24 August 1783 - 28 January 1861) was an officer in the United States Navy who commanded a privateer during the War of 1812. He is also noted for having helped design the 1818 version of the flag of the United States, which first established the rule of keeping thirteen stripes and adding one star for each U.S. state. == Early life and family == Reid was born in Norwich, Connecticut, to John and Rebecca (Chester) Reid. John Reid, a lieutenant in the British Navy, was captured during the American Revolutionary War before resigning and joining the American side. Rebecca Chester's father, John Chester, was among the soldiers at Bunker Hill, and afterward a member of the Connecticut convention that ratified the United States constitution.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography (p.p97) == Naval career == Reid commanded General Armstrong during the battle off Fayal in 1814 Reid entered the Navy in 1794. He served in Constellation with Commodore Thomas Truxtun and in 1803 became master of the brig Merchant. During the War of 1812 he commanded the privateer General Armstrong. One notable capture was that of the British merchantman , notable because of the legal cases that arose from her capture and recapture. At the Battle of Fayal Reid inflicted severe casualties on boats from a British force en route to Jamaica and New Orleans, Louisiana. In the end, Reid had to scuttle his ship and he and his crew made it to shore. Reid was wounded along with one other man, while the British sustained over 100 killed or wounded. Andrew Jackson credited Reid's action with delaying the British squadron and so aiding General Jackson's defense of New Orleans. The battle was the subject of many popular prints. == Flag design == In January 1817, Reid was asked by Representative Peter H. Wendover for advice in the design of a new U.S. flag. The flag then in use had fifteen stars and fifteen stripes; it had not been updated to reflect the five new states which had joined the union since that version of the flag was implemented in 1795. Wendover was the head of a congressional committee tasked with investigating possible alterations to the flag. Together, Wendover and Reid decided that the best way to honor all twenty states was to restore the number of stripes to the original thirteen, have twenty stars on the canton, and add a new star each time a new state joined the union. Reid sketched three flag designs, one for general use which featured the twenty stars arranged in the shape of a larger star, one for use on government vessels and buildings which featured an eagle on the canton instead of stars, and one for use on ceremonial occasions which featured a different element (stars, stripes, the Great Seal, and the Goddess of Liberty) on each of the flag's four quarters. Wendover and his congressional committee adopted Reid's general-use flag, but never seriously considered his other two designs. Wendover drafted a bill which stipulated that the thirteen-stripe, twenty-star design become the new official flag of the United States. The bill passed and was signed into law as the Flag Act of 1818 by President James Monroe on April 4, 1818. The pattern of the stars was later changed from Reid's \\"great star\\" design to four rows of five stars each.

This is the traditional way farms and gardens were maintained for the last 12,000 years.See First agricultural revolution. In recent decades, beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, there has been a major shift to purchasing seed annually from commercial seed suppliers. Much of the grassroots seed-saving activity today is the work of home gardeners. ==Method== To be successful at seed saving, new skills need to be developed to ensure that desired characteristics are retained in the landraces of the plant variety. Important considerations are the separation distance needed from plants of the same species to ensure that cross-pollination with another variety does not occur, and the minimum number of plants to be grown which will preserve inherent genetic diversity. It is also necessary to recognize the preferred characteristics of the cultivar being grown so that plants that are not breeding true are selected against, and to understand the breeding of improvements to the cultivar. Diseases that are seed-borne must be recognized so that they can be eliminated. Seed storage methods must be good enough to maintain viability of the seed. Germination requirements must be known so that periodic tests can be made. Care must be taken, as training materials regarding seed production, cleaning, storage, and maintenance often focus on making landraces more uniform, distinct and stable (usually for commercial application) which can result in the loss of valuable adaptive traits unique to local varieties.Jarvis, D., B. Sthapit, and L. Sears (eds.). 2000. Conserving agricultural biodiversity in situ: a scientific basis for sustainable agriculture. Proceedings of a workshop. Rome, Italy: IPGRI Additionally, there is a matter of localized nature to be considered. In the upper northern hemisphere, and lower southern, one sees a seasonal change in terms of a cooler winter. Many plants go-to-seed and then go dormant. These seeds must hibernate until their respective spring season. ==Open pollination== Open pollination is an important aspect of seed saving. Plants that reproduce through natural means tend to adapt to local conditions over time, and evolve as reliable performers, particularly in their localities, known as landraces or \\"folk varieties.\\" ==Legality== While saving seed and even exchanging seed with other farmers for biodiversity purposes has been a traditional practice, these practices have become illegal for the plant varieties that are patented or otherwise owned by some entity (often a corporation). Under Article 28 of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement), \\"planting, harvesting, saving, re-planting, and exchanging seeds of patented plants, or of plants containing patented cells and genes, constitutes use\\" and can in some cases be prohibited by the intellectual property laws of WTO Members. Significantly, farmers in developing countries are particularly affected by prohibitions on seed saving. There are some protections for re-use, called \\"farmer's privilege\\", in the 1991 International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention), but seed exchange remains prohibited. === United States === Originally the farmer's privilege to save seeds to grow subsequent crops was considered protected by the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970. American farmers, it was thought, could sell seed up to the amount saved for replanting their own acreage.The PVPA permits farmers to save seeds and grow crops from them without liability under the PVPA. But if the seeds are also protected by a utility patent, that conduct is now patent infringement. See Bowman v. Monsanto Co. That view came to an end in the latter part of the 20th century and early part of the 21st century, with changes in technology and law. First, in 1981 Diamond v. Chakrabarty established that companies may obtain patents for life-forms‚Äîoriginally genetically engineered unicellular bacteria. The genetically engineered bacteria ate oil, as in oil spills. In 2002 J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer established that valid utility patents could be issued on sexually reproduced plants, such as seed crops (e.g., corn).http://neuro.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=patent&url;=/supct/html/99-1996.ZS.htmlIn that case J.E.M. was held liable because it resold purchased corn in violation of a \\"label license\\" forbidding resale or any use except planting a corn crop. In 2013 Bowman v. Monsanto Co. established that it was patent infringement for farmers to save crop seeds (soybeans in that case) and grow subsequent crops from them, if the seeds or plants were patented. Seed corporations are able to earn massive profits from this control over commercial seed supplies, and consequently further loss of control has been taken from US farmers over their farm production process. == Seed Sovereignty == Seed sovereignty can be defined as the right ‚Äúto breed and exchange diverse open-sourced seeds.‚Äù It focuses largely on the rights of individuals to be able to save seed, and be independent from major seed companies. Seed sovereignty activists point to seed saving as an important practice in building food security, as well as restoring agricultural biodiversity.LaDuke, Winona. (2012). Seeds of Our Ancestors, Seeds of Life, TEDxTC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHNlel72eQc Activists also draw attention to the cultural importance of seed saving practices, especially their role in maintaining traditional plant varieties.White, Rowen.

It is considered to be a trendy high-end center. The center is near downtown Salt Lake City and the UTA TRAX light-rail system. ==History== ===Description=== Trolley Square is composed of barns that were built in 1908 to house Salt Lake City's streetcars. The streetcar system was dismantled in 1945, and the barns were converted into a two-story shopping center in 1972. The center is noted for its unusual architecture consisting of winding hallways, brick and wooden floors, fountains, old-trees, and wrought-iron balconies. Prominent tenants include Weller Book Works, Pottery Barn, Cabin Fever (a popular card store), Williams Sonoma, Old Spaghetti Factory, The Desert Edge Brewery at the Pub, The Spectacle, and local boutiques. The Trolley Square water tower is covered in red and blue neon lights, and it is a prominent feature of the Salt Lake City skyline, able to be spotted from miles away at night. For many years, the tower was a weather beacon, giving the local weather forecast based on the colors of lights, with solid blue being fair weather, flashing blue being cloudy weather, solid red being rain, and flashing red being snow. The Trolley Square water tower was renovated in fall 2014. Another prominent feature of Trolley Square is the sky bridge that connects the main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged ore conveyor bridge formerly in use at the International Smelting and Refining Company facility in Tooele, Utah. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped in the form of a trolley. ===2007 shooting=== The Trolley Square shooting was a mass shooting that occurred on the evening of February 12, 2007 at the mall. A lone gunman, identified as Sulejman Taloviƒá, killed five bystanders and wounded four others before being shot dead by several members of the Salt Lake City Police Department.

In conjunction with various radio stations in the country, the band wrote Razom nas bahato, nas ne podolaty to support the protest against the electoral fraud that took place during the Ukrainian presidential election. The song became widely known in Ukraine, and was frequently played on many radio and TV stations. The song has been downloaded millions of times on the Internet. GreenJolly won the nomination to represent Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 by the interactive vote held among TV viewers, after Razom nas bahato was controversially put in contention as a last minute 'wild-card' addition to the final of the national pre-selection competition, which had already gone through fifteen semi-finals, dating back to before the Orange Revolution. This success came as a surprise even for the band performers who in the immediate aftermath vowed to represent Ukraine competitively in the contest. However, the lyrics of the song have had to be substantially reworked in order to be consistent with the rules laid down by the European Broadcasting Union. In the finals, which were held in Ukraine after Ruslana's win in the 2004 contest, GreenJolly finished 20th despite picking up full points from the Polish televote, thanks to media exposure to a Polish reworking of the song made by the country's biggest hiphop stars in support of Ukraine's Orange Revolution. They also received 8 points from Moldova, 7 from Portugal, 2 from Russia and 1 point from Spain. Since their Eurovision appearance, the band has fallen apart, with members going their separate ways in Ivano-Frankivsk. Both own music production studios.

On the latter date, most of its churches joined the Evangelical and Reformed Church in a merger to become the United Church of Christ. Others created the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches or joined the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference that formed earlier in 1945. During the forementioned period, its churches were organized nationally into a General Council, with parallel state conferences, sectional associations, and missionary instrumentalities. Congregations, however, retained their local autonomy and these groups were legally separate from the congregations. The body came into being in Seattle, Washington in 1931 by the merger of two American bodies that practiced congregational church governance, the National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States and the General Convention of the Christian Church. Initially using the word \\"and\\" between the words \\"Congregational\\" and \\"Christian,\\" the new denomination decided to combine the predecessor churches' identities into one nationally, while its constituent churches remained free to either retain their original names or adopt the new usage. ==Heritages== ===Congregationalism=== Established by settlers in present-day New England fleeing religious persecution in their native England, the Congregational churches were identified with the Puritan theological and political perspective within Anglo-Saxon Protestantism during the 17th century. Many American historians have viewed their semi-democratic practices as laying the foundation for the representative nature of the U.S. political tradition. Although they were originally strongly Calvinist in the 18th century, eventually, by the 19th century, Congregationalists had accepted their peculiar vocation in U.S. religious life, maintaining a broadly orthodox faith while cultivating a passion for freedom, equality, and justice. These ethical convictions would propel the Congregational churches into the forefront of social reform movements during the next 150 years or so. Most notable of these was strong support for the abolition of slavery among African-Americans in the Southern U.S. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, numerous pastors and female schoolteacher missionaries, working under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, established academies, colleges, and churches for the freedpeople; six of the colleges are still in existence. Later generations became involved in causes such as temperance, women's suffrage, and the Social Gospel. In the midst of this political involvement, Congregationalists held firmly to the notion that each local church was ruled directly by Jesus Christ, as testified to in the Bible and preached to those convicted by the Holy Spirit. Each thus constituted a spiritual republic unto itself, needing no authorization from outside ecclesiastical forces. On the homefront, Congregationalism became primarily a grouping found among townspeople and affluent urban residents of New England, New York state, the Great Lakes region, portions of the Great Plains, and the Pacific Coast; roughly speaking, the Northern United States, a region strongly influenced by migrants from New England and New York. By the turn of the 20th century, the churches had begun to attract worshippers from outside their original base constituency of English-speaking Anglo-Americans. Immigrant groups that formed Congregational churches included Volga Germans, Swedes, Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Japanese, and Hawaiians. The Congregational churches also acquired two smaller church bodies: several Congregational Methodist churches in Alabama and Georgia, during the 1890s, and the Evangelical Protestant Churches in 1925, a German-immigrant group located primarily in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cincinnati, Ohio. Theologically, during the 19th century the Congregationalists shifted gradually from adherence to orthodox Reformed concepts and teachings (e.g., total depravity, limited atonement) toward a decidedly more liberal orientation, facilitated by a group of Yale University-educated pastors in and around the time of the Civil War. Led by the likes of Horace Bushnell and Nathaniel Taylor, the New Divinity men broke, some would say irrevocably, with the older pessimistic views of human nature espoused by classical Congregationalist divines such as Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, declaring instead a more sanguine view of possibilities for the individual and society. Even as this grand shift may have attracted individuals weary of overbearing, harsh harangues from generations of revivalist preachers, numerous others deplored what they felt was an abandonment of the true faith. Such conservatives, especially outside New England, increasingly sought refuge in churches that held to more rigid doctrine, such as the Baptists and the Presbyterians. Congregationalist losses to Presbyterianism increased greatly in the decades in which the Plan of Union, was in effect. Although it was designed by Connecticut Congregationalists and the Presbyterian General Assembly to avoid duplication of effort in evangelizing the frontier regions, this plan resulted in numerous Congregational-founded parishes being annexed to presbyteries, usually through the pastor's affiliation and often without the local church's assent. The need to dissolve that failed attempt at inter-denominationalism, which had already taken place among the Presbyterians, prompted a national gathering of Congregationalists in 1865 at Boston, Massachusetts. This was the first national meeting in more than 200 years, since the 1648 synod that produced the Cambridge Platform, a confession of faith similar to the Presbyterians' Westminster Confession. It was not until 1870, though, that a sufficient number of Congregationalists responded to a related call to organize nationally. This was not the first time American Congregationalism had been shaken to its foundations by theological change; the Great Awakenings of the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century had also left indelible marks upon the churches. Some churches openly embraced revivalism at the time, while others, particularly in the Boston area, reacted negatively to the developments by adopting Arminian viewpoints in opposition to the intensified Calvinism espoused by such preachers as Edwards and George Whitefield. Following the Great Awakening, many of the liberalized congregations would eventually depart the Congregational fellowship in 1825 to form the American Unitarian Association; this body is now known as the Unitarian Universalist Association. Meanwhile, despite the cherished commitments to independence and freedom, Congregationalists increasingly began to espouse the main aims of the ecumenical movement within American (and world) Protestantism. This movement had gathered much energy from the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during the first third of the 20th century, and a perceived decline in that period of religious life among Americans. Congregational leaders pursued close relations with numerous Protestant groups, but one group emerged as a prime candidate for actual organizational union: the Christian Churches. ===The Christian Churches (\\"Connection\\")=== While Puritans were consolidating their domination of religious, political and intellectual life in New England, elsewhere in America, during the period immediately before the American Revolution, many newly arrived settlers became dissatisfied with theology, preaching, liturgy, and ecclesiology inherited from Europe. Many of these people had turned to revivalist faiths such as the Methodists and the Baptists, and most found spiritual homes within those groups, or others deriving from the ferment started by the Great Awakenings. However, in different parts of the country, several preachers led dissenting movements against the leadership of some of those churches. In the 1790s, James O'Kelly, a Methodist pastor serving churches in central North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, took exception to the development of an episcopacy within his church. He believed that the rise of bishops, strongly advocated by the likes of Francis Asbury, would approximate the powers of the recently disestablished Anglican church and thus unduly control the ministry, particularly through the practice of itinerancy. When leaders ignored O'Kelly's protests, he and some sympathizers withdrew from the Methodist Church to form a body originally known as the \\"Republican Methodist Church.\\" Upon extensive discussion and prayer, O'Kelly began to hold that the name implied a sectarianism that was quite at odds with what he felt were prescriptions from the New Testament prohibiting churches from identifying with mere human opinions. Thus, he and others arrived at the notion that their churches should bear simply the name of \\"Christian.\\" Several hundred miles to the north in Vermont, a Baptist preacher by the name of Abner Jones began to refute the then-prevalent Calvinist dogmas within his fellowship. He led some of his followers out of his congregation into a new fellowship founded upon a platform similar to O'Kelly's, with a strong emphasis upon open communion and freedom of conscience. Later in the first decade of the 19th century, he and a New Hampshire pastor began publishing a newspaper for the movement, Herald of Gospel Liberty, reputed by some historians to have been the first general- interest religious periodical in the U.S. The movement progressed throughout New England, especially within those two states, as well as Maine and Massachusetts. Adherents of the Congregational \\"Standing Order\\" treated the new churches in a generally hostile fashion. Both movements were restorationist in outlook, and influenced the later Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. That later movement produced several larger groups that continue to operate today: the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ. The geographically disparate Northern and Southern wings of the Christian movement did eventually discover each other, and they formed a convention in 1820. At that time, they agreed on a general list of five (some scholars have claimed six) principles unifying the otherwise diverse congregations. The unity did not survive engrossing controversies over slavery and the ensuing Civil War. The \\"Christian Connection,\\" as was also the case with American Protestant groups such as the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists, split once again into Northern and Southern factions. The Northern group catalyzed the split, as many of its leaders, much like those of the Congregationalists, strongly denounced slavery. The Northerners used the schism as an occasion to legally take denominational form, in 1850. Despite the bitterness of the split, Christians in both sections reunited much sooner than did the other separated groups, forming the General Convention of the Christian Church in 1890. Many Southern/O'Kelly Christians owned slaves, some of whom formed churches of their own in that tradition after the Emancipation Proclamation. Centered in central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, African-American Christian congregations formed a convention of their own in the 1890s. This convention existed until 1950, well after the Congregational Christian merger; that year it joined the Convention of the South, heretofore composed of Congregational churches founded by the American Missionary Association. Theologically, the Christian Churches did not encourage a highly elaborate system of doctrine or Biblical interpretation. Relatively few of their ministers were educated past the elementary grades, a characteristic that persisted well into the early 20th century. Their leanings were toward revivalist Wesleyanism, emphasizing traditional evangelical themes such as regeneration, acceptance of personal salvation, and the performance of good works of charity. Few if any of their members were inherently predisposed toward polemical attacks upon other traditions, although some pastors and churches would eventually identify with the emerging fundamentalist movement in later decades. By the time that the Congregationalists had approached Christian leaders about possible union, some disaffected adherents of the wing of Restoration Movement led by Barton Stone and Alexander Campbell had joined the Christian Connection. This group gave the movement a geographical complexion that entailed pockets of strength in New England, upstate New York, southeastern Virginia, central and eastern North Carolina, western Georgia, eastern Alabama, southwestern Ohio, and eastern Indiana, with dispersed congregations in parts of the Great Plains. Most of the membership was rural, outside major cities, usually engaged in farming or similar occupations. The Christians founded schools such as Ohio's Defiance College and Antioch College and North Carolina's Elon University; during the early 20th century, an academy and seminary for African-Americans operated in Franklinton, North Carolina. Defiance continues to relate to the United Church of Christ today. ==Early post-merger years== After the 1931 merger, relatively few practices and customs changed drastically within either of the uniting traditions, largely because its members, like most Americans, were overwhelmed by, first, the Great Depression, and, later, World War II. It would not be until after the latter concluded that the CC churches would embark on anything like a major church extension program; this was the case, of course, with most U.S. denominations during this period, as their churches often struggled to merely stay open, with little or nothing left over for mission work. Congregationalists constituted about 85-90% of the membership of the new denomination; this caused few if any resentments or conflicts because, by and large, the two groups did not overlap each other geographically, except in parts of New England, upstate New York, Ohio, and among African-American churches in North Carolina. Regional judicatories and national domestic and foreign mission agencies merged quite smoothly, often continuing to use varying terminologies (e.g., \\"convention,\\" \\"conference,\\" \\"association\\"), depending on custom. On the domestic front, most of the new church planting efforts were concentrated in newly developing areas such as southern California, Arizona, Florida, and suburbs of major Midwestern cities (e.g., Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis). Abroad, many CC missionary efforts shifted their emphases toward medical and social services, particularly after many of the churches Congregationalists had founded in earlier decades had formed autonomous bodies of their own. One distinguishing trait of the new fellowship, aside from its unusually tolerant attitude regarding subscription to ancient doctrines, was its bold enthusiasm for ecumenical adventures, especially those growing out of the \\"Faith and Order\\" and \\"Life and Work\\" inter-church initiatives in Great Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. These developments and others led to the founding of the World Council of Churches in 1948, of which the Congregational Christian Churches was a charter member. In the U.S., the Congregational Christians made several overtures to other Protestant groups toward federative unions and/or organic mergers in the years before World War II. But the main legacy of those discussions was what became the United Church of Christ in 1957. ==UCC merger talks== The Rev. Dr. Truman Douglass, pastor of St. Louis' Pilgrim Congregational Church, met with the Rev. Dr. Samuel Press, president of Eden Theological Seminary in that city, a seminary of the Evangelical and Reformed Church, a denomination predominantly of German origin and itself a merger of two previously separated traditions, as part of an informal interchurch discussion group in 1937. Douglass' and Press' talks led to the involvement of both bodies in proposals to consider organic union, work that eventually culminated in the Basis of Union in 1943, which both national bodies approved after a five-year period of revising. The Rev. Dr. Douglas Horton, a former Harvard Divinity School dean, had become the CC general minister and president by this point, and became the prime figure in the CC union efforts. ===\\"Continuing Congregationalism\\"=== However, a small but vocal minority of ministers and laymen protested the developments, charging that any merger with a confessional, presbyterial body such as the E&R; Church would destroy the heritage and structure of American Congregationalism. These opponents formed groups that published pamphlets and attempted to persuade churches to reject the proposed merger. An anti-merger congregation in Brooklyn filed suit against the CC moderator, Helen Kenyon, in 1949 to legally stop the merger proceedings; the major legal contention made by the church and the anti-union advocates was that the CC General Council possessed no authority to enter into a merger as a national entity. After some initial victories in lower courts, a New York state Court of Appeals declined jurisdiction and judged in favor of Ms. Kenyon and the CC Churches in 1953. With this defeat, the anti-merger forces turned instead toward forming a new denomination, which became the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, founded in 1955; a preponderance of these churches were located in non-metropolitan New England, southeastern Michigan, parts of Wisconsin and Illinois, and southern California. Some years before that, motivated by different concerns, chiefly doctrine, a group of evangelical- leaning congregations formed the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, in 1948. ===Union approved=== The final vote on participation by the General Council of Congregational Christian ChurchesConstitution of the United Church of Christin the UCC merger took place at the 1956 General Council, meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Eighty-eight (88) percent of the delegates approved the motion to unite with the Evangelical and Reformed Church, and the latter body's General Synod approved by an even wider margin. This set the stage for the Uniting General Synod, which took place in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 25, 1957; the General Council of Congregationalism Christian Churches were represented by the Rev. Fred Hoskins, who had succeeded Horton some years earlier as general minister and president. Hoskins would become, along with E&R; President James Wagner, one of the co-presidents of the UCC. The actual consummation of the UCC, however, did not occur until 1961, when a sufficient number of CC congregations voted to approve the denomination's new constitution. The CC Churches brought into the new UCC approximately 1.4 million members, about 60 percent of the total number of members in the new denomination. In order to attend to necessary legal business continuing from years past, the General Council remained incorporated until 1984, when it finally dissolved. ==See also== * S.

The male flowers are removed so that all seeds are hybrids sired from the second variety. \\"Open pollination\\" and \\"open pollinated\\" refer to a variety of concepts in the context of the sexual reproduction of plants. Generally speaking, the term refers to plants pollinated naturally by birds, insects, wind, or human hands. ==True-breeding definition== \\"Open pollinated\\" generally refers to seeds that will \\"breed true\\". When the plants of an open-pollinated variety self-pollinate, or are pollinated by another representative of the same variety, the resulting seeds will produce plants roughly identical to their parents. This is in contrast to the seeds produced by plants that are the result of a recent cross (such as, but not confined to, an F1 hybrid), which are likely to show a wide variety of differing characteristics. Open-pollinated varieties are also often referred to as standard varieties or, when the seeds have been saved across generations or across several decades, heirloom varieties. While heirlooms are usually open-pollinated, open-pollinated seeds are not necessarily heirlooms; open- pollinated varieties are still being developed. One of the challenges in maintaining an open-pollinated variety is avoiding introduction of pollen from other strains. Based on how broadly the pollen for the plant tends to disperse, it can be controlled to varying degrees by greenhouses, tall wall enclosures, field isolation, or other techniques. Because they breed true, the seeds of open-pollinated plants are often saved by home gardeners and farmers. Popular examples of open-pollinated plants include heirloom tomatoes, beans, peas, and many other garden vegetables. ==Uncontrolled pollination definition== A second use of the term \\"open pollination\\" refers to pollination by insects, birds, wind, or other natural mechanisms. This can be contrasted with cleistogamy, closed pollination, which is one of the many types of self pollination.Kearns, C.A.; Inouye, D.W. 1993. Techniques for pollination biologists. University Press of Colorado, Niwot, CO. When used in this sense, open pollination may contrast with controlled pollination, a procedure used to ensure that all seeds of a crop are descended from parents with known traits, and are therefore more likely to have the desired traits. The seeds of open- pollinated plants will produce new generations of those plants; however, because breeding is uncontrolled and the pollen (male parent) source is unknown, open pollination may result in plants that vary widely in genetic traits. Open pollination may increase biodiversity. Some plants (such as many crops) are primarily self pollenizing and also breed true, so that even under open pollination conditions the next generation will be (almost) the same. Even among true breeding organisms, some variation due to genetic recombination or to mutation can produce a few \\"off types\\". ==Relationship to hybridization== Hybrid pollination, a type of controlled pollination in which the pollen comes from a different strain (or species), can be used to increase crop suitability, especially through heterosis. The resulting hybrid strain can sometimes be inbred and selected for desired traits until a strain that breeds true by open pollination is achieved. The result is referred to as a inbred hybrid strain. To add some confusion, the term hybrid inbred applies to hybrids that are made from selected inbred lines that have certain desired characteristics (see inbreeding). The latter type of hybrid is sometimes designated F1 hybrid, i.e. the first hybrid (filial) generation whose parents were (different) inbred lines. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Pollination ","title":"Open pollination"},{"id":"1274967","text":"Tiberius Claudius Nero (85‚Äì33 BC) was a politician who lived in the last century of the Roman Republic. He was the first husband of Livia, but was forced to divorce her in 38 BC so that she could marry the future emperor Augustus. Nero was the father of the second Roman emperor Tiberius, (who became the stepson of the emperor Augustus and was adopted by Augustus as his heir), and Roman general Nero Claudius Drusus. He was also the paternal grandfather of Emperor Claudius, General Germanicus, and Consul Drusus Julius Caesar, paternal great-grandfather of Emperor Caligula and Empresses Agrippina the Younger and Claudia Octavia and maternal great-great-grandfather of Emperor Nero. ==Ancestry== Nero was a member of the republican Claudian gens of Rome. He was a descendant of the first named Tiberius Claudius Nero, a son of Appius Claudius Caecus (censor in 312 BC). Nero was the son of Tiberius Claudius Nero and his mother was a descendant of the Claudian gens. Nero had a sister called Claudia, who married the prefect Quintus Volusius. ==Life== Nero had served as a quaestor to Julius Caesar in 48 BC, commanding his fleet in the Alexandrian War. Having achieved victory over the Egyptian navy, he was rewarded with a priesthood. Julius Caesar had sent Nero to create Roman colonies in Gaul and in other provinces. Despite his service with Julius Caesar, Nero was an Optimate at heart. After the murder of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, when it seemed that the assassins were triumphant, he suggested that they be rewarded for their services to the state. However, due to his previous alliance with the Roman dictator, Nero was allowed to be elected praetor in 42 BC. Around this time Nero married his relative Livia Drusilla, whose father Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus was from the same gens. His son of the same name was born November 16, 42 BC, at Fondi Italy. Shortly afterwards, the Second Triumvirate began to break down, causing a dangerous situation in Rome as the triumvirs went to battle with each other. Nero was forced to choose sides and in his distrust of Octavian, he cast his lot with Mark Antony. In 41 BC, he fled Rome with Livia and Tiberius in tow, joining Antony's brother Lucius in Perusia. Perusia was besieged by Octavian's men by the time Nero arrived, and when the town fell in 40 BC, he was forced to flee first to Praeneste, and then Naples. In 40 BC, Octavian and Mark Antony finally reconciled. In Naples, Nero tried in vain to raise a slave battalion against Octavian and then took refuge with Sextus Pompey, who was then acting as a pirate leader in Sicily. Nero with his family joined Mark Antony soon after in Achaea. After three years of fleeing from Octavian, Nero returned to Rome with Livia and the younger Tiberius, aged 3. Octavian immediately after catching sight of Livia, fell in love with her, despite the fact that she was still married. Octavian was married to Scribonia, with whom he had a daughter called Julia, now known as Julia the Elder. Octavian and Scribonia divorced. Around this time Livia was also pregnant and despite this, Nero was persuaded or forced by Octavian to divorce Livia. Nero and Livia‚Äôs second son was born in early 38 BC and he was named Decimus Claudius Drusus, which was later changed to Nero Claudius Drusus. Octavian and Livia married on January 17, waiving the traditional waiting period. Nero was present at their wedding, giving Livia away \\"just as a father would\\". As agreed, Nero took his sons to his home, where they were raised and educated. ==Death== Nero died in 33 BC. After his death, his sons went to live with their mother and stepfather. The younger Tiberius, aged 9, delivered his funeral eulogy on the Rostra in Rome. When the future Roman emperor Tiberius celebrated his coming of age, he staged two gladiatorial contests; one was held at the Forum in memory of his father and the other at the amphitheatre in memory of his grandfather Drusus. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== *Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Tiberius & Claudius *Tiberius Claudius Nero no. 7 article at ancient library *Tiberius Claudius Nero no. 8 article at ancient library Category:85 BC births Category:33 BC deaths Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Ancient Roman politicians Tiberius (father of Tiberius Caesar) Category:Roman Republican praetors ","title":"Tiberius Claudius Nero (father of Tiberius Caesar)"},{"id":"1274972","text":"The Foreign Service Journal is a monthly publication of the American Foreign Service Association.

In 1849, 22-year-old Londoner Alfred Lamb, son of wine and spirits merchant William Lamb, blended 18 different rums from Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad to produce Lamb's Navy Rum. His company was to take the name of Alfred Lamb & Son.http://www.lambsnavyrum.com/lambs-story/ The use of the term \\"navy rum\\" dates back to the Royal Navy issuing a daily ration of rum to its sailors. It had previously given its sailors French brandy, but the 1655 conquest of Jamaica gave it access to rum, which it quickly exploited. The 1970 decision of the British Royal Navy to end issuing a daily rum rations to its sailors inspired the brand that year to adopt the advertising campaign, \\"Join the Lamb‚Äôs Navy.\\" Alfred Lamb & Son was bombed out of its London premises on Great Tower Street in World War II. Its competitor, White Keeling Rum Merchants, was bombed out of its premises, too.

Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case ruling in 1983 that the one-house legislative veto violated the constitutional separation of powers.. ==Background== Section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, , authorized the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to suspend deportation of an alien continually residing in the United States for at least seven years where the U.S. Attorney General, in his discretion, found that deportation would result in \\"extreme hardship\\". After making such a finding, the Attorney General would transmit a report to Congress pursuant to ¬ß 244(c)(1) and either house of Congress had the power to veto the Attorney General's determination pursuant to ¬ß 244(c)(2). ===Facts=== Respondent Jagdish Rai Chadha was born in the British colony of Kenya to Indian parents. Chadha was a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies and entered the United States on a British passport when studying in Ohio as a foreign exchange student. After Kenya's declaration of independence from Britain in 1963 he was not recognized as a legitimate citizen or resident of Kenya (as his parents were Indian) or India (as he was born in Kenya). Furthermore, his right of abode in the United Kingdom was stripped under the Immigration Act 1971 due to his lack of connection with the United Kingdom. After his non-immigrant student visa expired in 1972, none of the three countries would accept him onto their territory, rendering him de facto stateless. The INS initiated deportation proceedings against Chadha. Chadha sought to suspend his deportation, and the INS accommodated his request according to ¬ß 244(a)(1), and transmitted a report of the suspension to Congress according to ¬ß 244(c)(2). The House of Representatives vetoed the suspension of Chadha's deportation, and the INS resumed deportation proceedings. Chadha raised constitutional objections to ¬ß 244(c)(2), but the immigration judge found he lacked any authority to rule on such claims and ordered Chadha deported. Chadha then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which also found it lacked any authority to consider constitutional objections to ¬ß 244(c)(2). Chadha appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for review of the deportation order, and the INS supported his challenge to the constitutionality of ¬ß 244(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit found ¬ß 244(c)(2) unconstitutional and ordered the Attorney General to suspend deportation proceedings. The INS appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in order to obtain a final judgment on the constitutionality of ¬ß 244(c)(2). The House and Senate, as amici curiae, argued that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid. It asked the United States Supreme Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision. Congress argued that: (1) Chadha lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of ¬ß 244(c)(2) because that section is not severable from ¬ß 244(a)(1). Therefore, if Chadha were to succeed in invalidating ¬ß 244(c)(2), his means of remedy in ¬ß 244(a)(1) would also be destroyed, and there would be no relief possible; (2) the Court did not have jurisdiction over the issue because the Attorney General and INS enforced the challenged statute and thereby effectively waived their right to challenge it; (3) the action was not a genuine case or controversy, as both the original plaintiff and defendant challenged the statute without real opposition; (4) the action was a non- justiciable political question. ==Holding== The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment. In an opinion by Chief Justice Burger, the Court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Congress may not promulgate a statute granting to itself a legislative veto over actions of the executive branch inconsistent with the bicameralism principle and Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court rebutted Congress's assertions as follows: (1) ¬ß 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is severable from the rest of the act pursuant to the express severability clause ¬ß 406. The legislative history of ¬ß 244 supports the proposition that Congress, frustrated with the process of passing private laws to provide relief for deportable individuals, would likely not have been willing to retain the private law mechanism rather than ceding all power to the Attorney General. (2) The Attorney General and INS did not waive their right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by enforcing the statute. (3) The action is a genuine case with adequate representation in favor of sustaining the act provided by the houses of Congress as amici curiae. (4) The case is a judicable question, not exempted by the political question doctrine; the constitutionality of a statute is a question for the courts. The Court then presented its affirmative reasoning: (5) When the Constitution provides express procedures, such procedures must be strictly observed. Two such provisions are bicameralism and presentment in the enactment of law. (6) The presentment process‚Äîespecially the President's veto power‚Äîwas intended by the Framers to provide a mechanism by which the executive branch could defend itself against legislative encroachment and could prevent ill-conceived policies. (7) Similarly, the bicameralism requirement was formulated in order to hinder congressional action and thereby prevent legislative encroachment. (8) The action of the House of Representatives is legislative in nature because (a) it modifies rights and duties of individuals outside the legislative branch; (b) the enactment would otherwise have required a private law, which is a legislative function; and (c) the nature of the action is inherently legislative. (9) When the Framers intended to authorize Congress to exercise power outside of the bicameral and presentment principles, it provided alternate procedures explicitly; other procedures cannot be admitted. (10) Because the action of the House of Representatives was legislative, but did not conform to the mode of action specifically stated by the Constitution for legislative action, it is therefore invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. ===Concurrence=== Justice Powell, in a concurring opinion, argued that to invalidate all legislative veto provisions is a serious matter, as Congress views the legislative veto as essential to controlling the executive branch, and should therefore be undertaken with caution. However, Congress's action in this case is nonetheless unconstitutional. Contrary to the views of the majority, Congress's action is not legislative in character but adjudicative, and it therefore violates the principle (called the anti-aggrandizement principle) that Congress may not expand its own power into the areas of competence of the other branches. The Constitution specifically attempted to prevent this form of aggrandizement in the Bill of Attainder Clause, Art. I, ¬ß 9, cl. 3, which prohibits Congress from undertaking legislative trials that lack the safeguards and accountability of judicial trials. For a house of Congress to force the deportation of Chadha would amount to such a legislative trial. ===Dissents=== Justice White, dissenting, argued that (1) the legislative veto power is absolutely necessary to modern government, as exemplified by the legislative veto powers granted in the War Powers Act of 1973. (2) The absence of constitutional provisions for alternate methods of action does not imply their prohibition by the Constitution, and the Court has consistently read the Constitution to respond to contemporary needs with flexibility. (3) The legislative veto power does not involve the ability of Congress to enact new legislation without bicameral consensus or presentation to the president, but instead involves the ability of Congress to veto suggestions by the executive, a power that both houses of Congress already possess. (4) The Court has allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive agencies; lawmaking does not always require bicameralism or presentation. (5) The bicameralism and presentation provisions of the Constitution serve to ensure that no departure from the status quo takes place without consensus from both houses of Congress and the President or by a super-majority vote of both houses of Congress. In this case, the deportation of Chadha is the status quo situation, and the veto by House of Representatives of an alternative suggestion of the executive branch is reasonable given the purposes of bicameralism and the Presentment Clause. Justice Rehnquist, in a dissent joined by White, argued that it is unlikely that Congress would have promulgated ¬ß 244(a)(1) without the corresponding provisions of ¬ß¬ß 244(c)(1‚Äì2). Therefore, the provisions are not severable from one another, and holding one unconstitutional requires invalidating the other. ==Aftermath== Chadha became a citizen of the United States and was living in Albany, California, as of October 2015. Chadha increased the power of the Executive Branch. Legislative vetoes continued to be enacted after Chadha, although various presidents have issued executive signing statements disclaiming the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions. The consultation provisions of the War Powers Act, for example, while contested by every president since Richard M. Nixon, are usually grudgingly obeyed. Some laws, such as the National Emergencies Act were amended to replace the legislative veto with a joint resolution requiring a Presidential signature and can be vetoed, requiring a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to override. Joint resolutions have proven difficult to pass over a veto, and in cases where that process was chosen the power of the President has increased greatly. Other processes, such as fast-track legislation or sunset clauses, have taken the place of the legislative veto in other laws with greater success in obtaining similar results to the original legislative vetoes. The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. Sections 801-808, allowed Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations; the effect of Chadha is that any such legislative disapproval can be vetoed by the sitting President, and is not a true legislative veto. Instead, its practical use is limited to the initial days of a new President's term following a change in Administration. Such a veto had been exercised only once, in March 2001, until 2017, when the 115th Congress under President Donald Trump passed fifteen such vetoes, overturning various rules issued under the Obama administration.Senate Joint Resolution 6, Pub L.

It is the alternate road for U.S. Route 1-9 (US 1-9) that trucks must use because they are prohibited from using the Pulaski Skyway, which carries the main routes of US 1-9. It also serves traffic accessing the New Jersey Turnpike, Route 440, and Route 7. The route is a four- to six-lane road its entire length, with portions of it being a divided highway that runs through urban areas. From its south end to about halfway through Kearny, US 1-9 Truck is freeway-standard, with access to other roads controlled by interchanges. While the US 1-9 Truck designation was first used in 1953, the roadway comprising the route was originally designated as an extension of pre-1927 Route 1 in 1922, a route that in its full length stretched from Trenton to Jersey City. US 1-9 was designated along the road in 1926 and one year later, in 1927, this portion of pre-1927 Route 1 was replaced with Route 25 as well as with a portion of Route 1 north of the Communipaw Avenue intersection. Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US 1-9 and Route 25 were realigned to the new skyway. After trucks were banned from the skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In 1953, US 1-9 Truck was designated in favor of Route 25T and Route 1 along this segment of road. The portion of the truck route north of Route 7 is being rebuilt as part of a $271.9 million project to construct new approach roads to connect US 1-9 Truck, Route 7, the Pulaski Skyway, Route 139, and US 1-9 north of Tonnele Circle and local streets in Jersey City. Construction, which started in late 2008, was completed in late 2012. The highway is designated by NJDOT, and posted on reassurance shields as a north-south route. Recently updated mile posts erroneously designated the route as an east-west route, with west for southbound traffic and east for northbound traffic. ==Route description== Passaic River Bridge US 1-9 Truck begins at an interchange with access to and from the southbound direction US 1-9, the Pulaski Skyway, in the Ironbound section of the city of Newark in Essex County. The truck route is meant to bypass the portion of US 1-9 along the Pulaski Skyway, which trucks are restricted from. It merges onto Raymond Boulevard, which continues west from the US 1-9 and US 1-9 Truck interchange into downtown Newark. The truck restriction on Route 1-9 is for the \\"safety and welfare of the public\\" according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, not a specific bridge defect. At this point, the truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading to the east. A short distance later, the road comes to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and Doremus Avenue before crossing over the Passaic River on a vertical lift bridge. Here, the route enters Kearny in Hudson County and continues east into industrial areas as the Lincoln Highway. The road has a right-in/right-out in both directions that provides access to Jacobus Avenue before it comes to an interchange with County Route 659. From here, US 1-9 Truck passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and becomes a six-lane divided highway, coming to an at-grade intersection with Hackensack Avenue. Past this intersection, the road crosses the Hackensack River on a vertical lift bridge and enters Jersey City. Upon entering Jersey City, the road becomes Communipaw Avenue and intersects the northern terminus of Route 440 near the Hudson Mall. View north along US 1-9 Truck approaching the Hackensack River Bridge in Kearny At this intersection, Communipaw Avenue continues to the east and US 1-9 Truck turns to the north, becoming an unnamed four-lane undivided road. bisecting Lincoln Park before coming to an intersection with County Route 605. Here, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway again, passing some urban business areas before running between wetlands to the west and Holy Name Cemetery to the east. The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences, coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway. Here, US 1-9 Truck turns east on Broadway, running through a business district. A short distance later, it turns north onto an unnamed road with County Route 642 continuing east on Broadway. The route passes under PATH's Newark‚ÄìWorld Trade Center line and Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Northern Branch line before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway. Immediately after, US 1-9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and turns to the east, with County Route 645 continuing north at this intersection. The truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway called the St. Paul's Viaduct that runs to the north of the Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors, crossing over the Northern Branch line and County Route 646. A short distance later, US 1-9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US 1-9 and Route 139, where it ends. The East Coast Greenway runs along the north side of the highway. ==History== Route 25T (1934-1953) US 1-9 northbound at the beginning of US 1-9 Truck in Newark, with sign noting \\"No Trucks\\" on the approach to the Pulaski Skyway What is now US 1-9 Truck between Newark and Jersey City was originally chartered as part of Ferry Road by the New Jersey Colonial legislature in 1765. The road stretched from Newark to Jersey City along Ferry Street, US 1-9 Truck, Communipaw Avenue, and Grand Street. In 1828, the road became maintained by the Passaic and Hackensack Ferry and Road Company, and then by the Newark Plank Road and Ferry beginning 1849 (not to be confused with the similarly named Newark Plank Road). Though the company's contract was to be extended for fifty years in 1900, this was overturned by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1913 the road west of Lincoln Park became the first segment of the Lincoln Highway. The current route of US 1-9 Truck was designated to be an extension of pre-1927 Route 1 in 1922, a route that was to run from Trenton to Jersey City.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1922, Chapter 253. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, the current truck route became a part of the US 1-9 concurrency. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 25 was designated to run along the entire length of the route along with US 1-9 as part of its journey from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City, while Route 1 was also designated along the portion north of Communipaw Avenue in Jersey City as a part of its routing from Bayonne to Rockleigh.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US 1-9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge. After trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US 1-9 Truck was designated to replace all of Route 25T as well as the portion of Route 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle.1953 renumbering Beginning in 2009 the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) replaced the viaduct that carries the route over St. Paul's Avenue and Conrail line. The St. Paul's Viaduct was built in 1928 and determined structurally deficient. The $271.9 million replacement was completed in September 2011. In addition to replacing the St. Paul's Avenue viaduct, the approaches to US 1-9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved. In anticipation of a general increase of activity in Port of New York and New Jersey and new development on West Side and Hackensack Riverfront studies are being conducted to make the intersection with Route 440 a multi-level traffic circle and northern and southern (Route 440) approaches to it into a multi-use urban boulevard that includes grade separations and additional medians. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Route 1&9T St. Paul's Viaduct Replacement 01 Truck New Jersey Jersey City 01 Truck Jersey City Category:Limited-access roads in New Jersey U.S. Route 001 9 Truck 1 9 1 9 ","title":"U.S. Route 1/9 Truck"},{"id":"1275059","text":"Mike Mitchell,1999) The Pier Luigi Nervi International Award for Cancer Research that DeVita received in 1985 Vincent Theodore DeVita Jr. (born March 7, 1935) is the Amy and Joseph Perella Professor of Medicine at Yale Cancer Center, and a Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health. He directed the Yale Cancer Center from 1993 to 2003. He has been president of the American Cancer Society (2012-2013). He is internationally recognized as a pioneer in the field of oncology for his work on combination-chemotherapy treatments. ==Early life and education== Vincent DeVita was born in The Bronx, New York. DeVita attended the College of William and Mary, receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1957. In 1961 he earned his MD degree with distinction from the George Washington University School of Medicine. ==Career== DeVita joined the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1963 as a clinical fellow, working with Emil \\"Tom\\" Frei, Emil J. Freireich and others. He returned as a senior investigator in 1966 after completing his training at Yale-New Haven Medical Center in 1965. At NCI, DeVita held the following posts: Senior Investigator in the Solid Tumor Service, Head of the Solid Tumor Service, Chief of the Medicine Branch, Director of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Clinical Director of NCI (as of 1975). While at NCI, he helped to develop MOPP, a four- drug combination that was the first successful combination chemotherapy program. At the time, many oncologists believed such an approach was too toxic and would do more harm than good. MOPP was used to treat Hodgkin's disease and diffuse large cell lymphomas, reducing the likelihood of dying from Hodgkin's disease from nearly 100% to around 30%. DeVita's results, presented in 1965 and 1970 were initially viewed with considerable disbelief. By demonstrating that a combination-chemotherapy regimen could be successful, DeVita established the basis for further combination therapies, which became a mainstay of cancer treatment. In addition, in collaboration with George Canellos, DeVita developed the combination chemotherapy CMF, which still remains a useful therapy for breast cancer. From 1977 to 1978, DeVita was the president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). In 1980, DeVita was appointed Director of the NCI and the National Cancer Program by President Jimmy Carter, a position he held until 1988. From January 1989 to 1993, DeVita was Physician-in-Chief and Attending Physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center where he was part of the program for Molecular Pharmacology. In 1993 he returned to Yale, where he became Director of Yale Cancer Center, serving from 1993 to 2003. In 2004, he was named as the Amy and Joseph Perella Professor of Medicine at Yale University, a position to be renamed the Vincent T. DeVita Professor of Medicine after his tenure. He is currently the chair of the Yale Cancer Center advisory board and is professor of internal medicine and of epidemiology and public health at Yale's medical school. From 2012-2013, DeVita served as president of the board of directors of the American Cancer Society. DeVita currently serves on the editorial boards of numerous scientific journals and has authored over 450 scientific articles. He is a co-editor of the textbook Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology, in its 10th edition, and serves as the co-editor-in-chief of The Cancer Journal. He is also the co-author, with his daughter Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, of the autobiographical book, The Death of Cancer: After Fifty Years on the Front Lines of Medicine, a Pioneering Oncologist Reveals Why the War on Cancer Is Winnable‚Äîand How We Can Get There. He was a participant in Ken Burns' 2015 PBS documentary Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies, which was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Siddhartha Mukherjee. == Personal == Vincent DeVita married Mary Kay Bush, with whom he has had two children, Ted and Elizabeth. Vincent DeVita diagnosed his son Ted as a child with aplastic anemia. Ted thereafter was placed in a sterile environment for his safety, and died in 1980 at the age of 17. Ted's situation, and that of David Vetter, inspired the 1976 TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble starring John Travolta. His daughter Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn has written about the experience of losing her brother in The Empty Room. Vincent DeVita has been treated for prostate cancer. ==Awards== * 1972, Albert Lasker Clinical Research Award * 2007, Statesman Award, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) * 2007, FREDDIE Special Award for Public Service * 2009, Distinguished Medical Science Award, Friends of the National Library of Medicine * 2014, fellow, American Association for Cancer Research ==Bibliography== * * == See also == * Cancer (2015 PBS film) * History of cancer * History of cancer chemotherapy ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:American oncologists Category:Cancer researchers Category:George Washington University Medical School alumni Category:College of William & Mary alumni Category:Recipients of the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award ","title":"Vincent T.

This species is sometimes placed in the subfamily Cricetinae due to similarities in appearance between the white-tailed rat and hamsters, but molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed that the two groups are not closely related. The subfamily Mystromyinae is sometimes placed within the family Muridae along with all other subfamilies of muroids. The white-tailed rat is restricted to shrubby areas and grasslands of South Africa and Lesotho. This is an uncommon species, and populations are thought to be declining because of conversion of scrubland to pasture. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being an \\"endangered species\\". ==Description== The white-tailed rat is a fairly large species with a head- and-body length of for males and for females, with a short tail of about . The fur is soft, woolly and dense. The head is broad, and the face is mostly grey, with pale spots above the eye and behind the ear in some individuals. The whiskers are long and the ear is rounded and dark-coloured. The upper parts of head and body are greyish-brown flecked with buff; each hair has a grey base and shaft, and a buff or blackish tip. The underparts are whitish-grey, each individual hair having a grey base and shaft and a cream or whitish tip. The tail is colourless and is clad in short white fur. The fore feet have four digits and the hind feet five. The upper surfaces of the fore feet have white hair, as do the sides and upper surfaces of the hind feet. ==Distribution and habitat== The white-tailed rat is endemic to South Africa and Lesotho where it is found in grasslands and shrubby areas. It tends to inhabit burrows of meerkats and cracks in the soil during the day and venture out at night. It eats vegetable matter such as seeds and has been known to take insects. The stomach has a ruminant-like digestive action and there are bacteria in the hind gut that ferment the food. Unlike hamsters, white-tailed rats do not have cheek pouches. ==References== *Nowak, R.

He bats and throws right-handed. Mohr attended the University of Alabama, and in 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the ninth round of the draft. He signed with the Minnesota Twins as a free agent on April 1, . Starting midway through the season, the Twins used a platoon of Mohr and Bobby Kielty in right field, causing fans to dub the duo \\"Dusty Kielmohr\\". This platoon persisted on and off for two years. After four seasons in the Twins organization, Mohr was traded to the San Francisco Giants before the season. Mohr struggled during the first few months before catching fire in early June. His aggressive defense and clutch hitting made him a favorite among Giants fans. The Giants closed in on the division leading Los Angeles Dodgers in the last month of the season. In the second to last series of the season, against the San Diego Padres, Mohr was injured as he tracked down a foul ball in right field. He tripped over the bullpen mound as the ball tailed towards the stands. He held on to the ball, and the Padres scored the game's winning run. He did not play during the season's final series against the Dodgers. As a member of the Boston Red Sox, Dustan Mohr filled in occasionally in outfield, either replacing Trot Nixon or Coco Crisp. While Crisp was out, Mohr had a spot on the major league roster, but he struggled with the big league club hitting: .175 with 2 home runs and 3 RBI. His stint with the Red Sox was short as Mohr was demoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox where he continued to struggle at the plate.

A. Allen, was an American Pentecostal evangelist known for his faith healing and deliverance ministry. He was, for a time, associated with the \\"Voice of Healing\\" movement founded by Gordon Lindsay. Allen died at the age of 59 in San Francisco, California, and was buried at his ministry headquarters in Miracle Valley, Arizona. == Early life == A. A. Allen's early life was lived in an often unpleasant environment. Having been born of mixed race to white and Native American parents, his family was very poor and his father was an alcoholic. At the age of 23, Allen became a Christian at the Onward Methodist Church in Miller, Missouri. Later, he learned of the Baptism with the Holy Spirit from a Pentecostal preacher who was conducting meetings in his home. Allen soon felt the call to preach and affiliated himself with the Assemblies of God, subsequently obtaining ordination from them in 1936. He then began to pastor a small church in Colorado. By 1947, Allen was pastoring a large Assemblies of God church in Corpus Christi, Texas. After attending a tent revival meeting hosted by Oral Roberts in 1949, Allen testified that as he left that meeting he hoped to form a divine healing ministry. Allen asked his church board to allow him to start a radio program, but they refused. Allen soon resigned from his church and began holding healing revival meetings. == Revivalist == Stemming in part from many reported healings, Allen established a large following. He became one of the first ministers to develop a national television ministry, which frequently included excerpts from his \\"healing line\\" ministry. By the late 1960s, however, music formed an increasingly dominant part of Allen's programs, which was generally performed by African- American singer and choir leader Gene Martin. In 1955, Allen purchased a large tent for $8,500. He was soon one of the major healing evangelists on the healing revival circuit. Allen's revival meetings were similar to the other leading evangelists of the time (such as Roberts, Jack Coe, and William Branham) in that meetings were typically characterized by preaching, testimony, music, and praying for the sick. As was the case with other ministers of the time, Allen's healing ministry was facilitated by the use of \\"prayer cards\\" obtained in advance by those requesting prayer for healing. In 1955, Allen was arrested for suspicion of drunk driving after a controversial incident in Knoxville, Tennessee. He resigned from the Assemblies of God shortly afterward. After paying a fine without contest in order to avoid terminating his Knoxville meetings which were then in progress, Allen was re- ordained by his \\"Miracle Revival Fellowship.\\" His associate Don Stewart claimed that Allen was occasionally drunk after Knoxville, and that his staff covered for him. Allen continued on the revival circuit, and in 1958 he purchased a tent previously used by Coe that could seat over 22,000. He became one of the first evangelists to propagate the prosperity gospel, calling poverty a \\"spirit\\" and expounding God's ability to perform miracles financially. At his peak, Allen appeared on fifty-eight radio stations daily, as well as forty-three television stations. At the time of his death, his headquarters in Miracle Valley, Arizona was with its own airfield. At that time, A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. was publishing \\"well over\\" 60 million pieces of literature a year. The circulation of Miracle Magazine, published monthly by the Allen ministry, was 450,000 at the time of his death. The magazine included, at times, accounts of healings, but gave a disclaimer that the magazine does not \\"assume legal responsibility\\" of its accuracy. Gerald W. King, the business manager of Miracle Valley, was quoted in 1969, shortly before Allen's death, as saying, \\"We take in $2 million a year, and our expenses are $2 million a year.\\" He added that Miracle Valley's annual payroll was $84,000. Few of Allen's supposed miracles ever underwent \\"scrutiny of physicians\\" and at his revivals in small print his disclaimer read: \\"A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. assumes no legal responsibility for the veracity of any such report.\\" One source, The Encyclopedia of American Religions, claims that Allen did not like press coverage, which \\"resulted in his hiring of 'goon squads' to punch out anyone who showed up for Allen's tent revivals with a notepad or camera.\\" > Eventually, most of the evangelists had wheelchairs available for people who > had bad backs and couldn't stand in a healing line for hours. But when the > evangelist got to them and pulled them up out of the wheelchair, some in the > audience thought they were walking for the first time or that they had come > to the revival in that wheelchair. In his television programs, Allen or his ministry associates made frequent mention of the fact that his meetings were racially integrated. African- Americans sat alongside whites in the choir, the ministers' section, and the congregation. African-American musical talent was frequently highlighted in Allen's television programs, especially in the 1960s. This racial attitude also found its expression in Allen's sermon record album titled, Did God Call the Apostle Paul to Preach the Gospel to the Black Man? The album cover refers to Allen as \\"no doubt the first evangelist on a great national or international scale to preach integration to huge crowds in the North and the South...\\"Did God Call the Apostle Paul to Preach the Gospel to the Black Man? (album cover) This was something of an exaggeration, though perhaps in keeping with Allen's personality. Mainstream revivalist Billy Graham, while not always consistent, had desegregated many of his revivals as early as 1953 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and integrated all his revivals following the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. Another major theme in Allen's ministry was his unrelenting attacks on what he characterized as dead, formal, denominational religion. This was a theme of a number of his televised messages and of such Miracle Valley publications as Allen's book titled Let My People Go!A.A. Allen, Let My People Go (digital text) This was also the theme of a book authored by Clarence G. Mitchell and published by Allen's ministry, titled Starving Sheep and Overfed Shepherds (1963). Allen regarded \\"denominationalism\\" as a sin. This is reflected in the subtitle of Mitchell's book: \\"Takes the Cover Off! Brings the Sin of Denominationalism Out into the Open!\\" At a revival meeting on January 1, 1958, in Phoenix, Arizona, recent convert Urbane Leiendecker approached Allen and offered him of land. This property, later expanded, was then named \\"Miracle Valley.\\" As such, it served as the ministry headquarters for A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. This location housed Miracle Valley Bible College and its dorms and classrooms; a domed church; administrative buildings; a large warehouse; a residential neighborhood called Miracle Valley Estates; a publishing and printing plant; a four-press phonograph record plant; and Miracle Valley Fellowship, which served as a ministerial fellowship with about 10,000 ministers as members. In spite of the presence of its own print shop, however, Miracle Valley business manager Gerald King said in 1969 that the ministry spent $27,000 per month \\"farming out\\" jobs to other print shops that could not be handled on site. In 1963, A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. successfully sued the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in an attempt to get the government to refund collections of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes for 1958‚Äì59. In 1967, Allen and his wife, Lexie E. (Scriven) Allen, were divorced. They had four children. One of them, Paul Asa Allen, is the author of In the Shadow of Greatness ‚Äì Growing Up Allen. == Death == Allen died at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco, California, on June 11, 1970, at the age of 59. He died after a heavy drinking binge. Don Stewart, his successor, was accused of attempting \\"to clean up evidence of his mentor's alcoholic binge in a San Francisco hotel before the police arrived\\". Stewart says he was not trying to cover up anything but was trying to protect Allen. Nonetheless, police found his body in a \\"room strewn with pills and empty liquor bottles\\". However, following a twelve-day investigation and an autopsy, the coroner's report concluded Allen died from liver failure brought on by acute alcoholism. The coroner reported that when Allen died, he had a blood alcohol content of .36 which was \\"enough to ensure a deep coma\\". Stewart says that Allen's problems with alcohol followed his problems with depression associated with extreme pain from arthritic bone spurs for which he was reluctant to seek medical attention because of his faith in divine healing and preaching that relying on doctors was a failure to trust in God. Allen was buried at Miracle Valley, Arizona, on June 15, 1970. == Legacy and property == After Allen's death, Stewart gained possession of Allen's organization, including his Miracle Valley property, which he renamed the Don Stewart Evangelistic Association (and later the Don Stewart Association). Stewart \\"went from pounding tent stakes at Allen's revivals to driving a truck to preaching\\". In addition, Stewart \\"was hit with allegations of embezzlement by Allen's brother-in-law, of pocketing offerings from the revivals\\" in the wake of Allen's death. Nonetheless, the activities of the Don Stewart Association were moved to Phoenix, and the Bible college continued to operate in Miracle Valley until 1975. Stewart then leased the campus to the Hispanic Assemblies by a twenty-year lease agreement for merely $1 per year. They opened the Spanish-speaking Southern Arizona Bible College. Between 1979 and early 1983, the Christ Miracle Healing Center and Church (CMHCC) operated on the subdivision property on the north side of Highway 92 across from the bible church. CMHCC, which consisted of approximately 300 African-American members, was led by Allen followers Frances Thomas and her son \\"Bishop\\" William Thomas, Jr. Initially relations between locals and CMHCC members relocated from Mississippi - both of whom were followers of Allen - were peaceful and in keeping with Allen's theme of racial harmony and integration; however, once the Thomases and the Chicago-based followers moved to Arizona, relations quickly deteriorated, and church members began to isolate themselves and started professing what locals said was an \\"anti-white doctrine.\\" CMHCC's doctrine of exclusive use of faith healing resulted in the death of six-year- old Therial Davis, and as many as four additional children. In 1979, Miracle Valley closed after bankruptcy hearings. In September 1982, the Southern Arizona Bible College's main administration building and vast warehouse were destroyed by arson. The main building was valued at $2 million. Stewart sent multiple donation requests to some people on his 100,000 person mailing list \\"even though his ministry is not associated with the college and the fire damage was insured.\\" According to the press, one of his letters \\"gave the impression ... the fire had crippled Stewart's ministry\\" and another purported to include the building's ashes with a request for $200 donations. Stewart's church had issues over his financing and \\"questioned Stewart's fundraising techniques\\" before. In addition, Stewart was accused by his church of arson, something he denies. The insurance company offered to either pay $1.5 million for the reconstruction of the administration building or $1 million for a \\"cash-out.\\" Stewart was not interested in rebuilding and intended to take the cash-out; however, the Spanish Assemblies of God (Central Latin American District Council of the Assemblies of God) wanted the facilities to be rebuilt. Subsequently, Stewart accepted the insurance money of $1 million for Miracle Valley, and the Assemblies of God would receive the Miracle Valley campus consisting of fifteen buildings and nearly of land for $6 which equated to $1 per year for the previous six years. However, Stewart forced the Assemblies of God to maintain a Bible college for a minimum of twenty years, or the property would revert to his ministry. In 1995, exactly twenty years later, the Assemblies of God closed Southern Arizona Bible College and put the campus up for sale. In 1982, the group had several confrontations with utility workers, neighbors, and eventually law enforcement, culminating in what became known as the Miracle Valley shootout in October 1982, during which two members of the church were killed and multiple sheriff's deputies were injured. Miracle Valley Bible College was purchased by Harter Ministries in August 1999, and the school continued under the administration of Melvin Harter. As the Miracle Valley Bible College and Seminary, the institution taught students in classical Pentecostal theology. However, in January 2009 a Phoenix-based mortgage firm foreclosed on the property, which currently contains several dilapidated buildings. Before the previous owner left the property, the entire north section of Sanctuary roof was removed. On December 20, 2011, the purchase of the property by the Langevin family was approved by the State of Arizona. The Langevins operate a non-denominational ministry called Miracle Valley Arizona Ministries. In 2014, another group purchased the property with plans to re-establish a Bible college.Miracle Valley Today webpage. Retrieved 2015-03-05 == Selected bibliography == === By A. A.

Somatic cells (of the body) develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. August Weismann proposed the germ plasm theory in the 19th century, before the foundation of modern genetics. Germ plasm () is a biological concept developed in the 19th century by the German biologist August Weismann. It states that heritable information is transmitted only by germ cells in the gonads (ovaries and testes), not by somatic cells. The related idea that information cannot pass from somatic cells to the germ line, contrary to Lamarckism, is called the Weismann barrier. The theory to some extent anticipated the development of modern genetics. ==History== The term Keimplasma (germ plasm) was first used by the German biologist August Weismann (1834‚Äì1914), and described in his 1892 book Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung (The Germ Plasm: a theory of inheritance). His theory states that multicellular organisms consist of germ cells that contain and transmit heritable information, and somatic cells which carry out ordinary bodily functions. In the germ plasm theory, inheritance in a multicellular organism only takes place by means of the germ cells: the gametes, such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the body do not function as agents of heredity. The effect is one-way: germ cells produce somatic cells, and more germ cells; the germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life. Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation. This is referred to as the Weismann barrier.Germ-Plasm, a theory of heredity (1893) This idea, if true, rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and implied by Charles Darwin's pangenesis theory of inheritance. However, a careful reading of Weismann's work over the span of his entire career shows that he had more nuanced views, insisting, like Darwin, that a variable environment was necessary to cause variation in the hereditary material. The part of Weismann's theory which proved most vulnerable was his notion that the germ plasm (effectively, genes) were successively reduced during division of somatic cells. As modern genetics developed, it became clear that this idea was in most cases wrong.For example, by studies of polytene chromosomes in salivary glands (i.e. somatic cells) of larval Drosophila. Cases such as Dolly (the famous cloned ewe) which, via somatic cell nuclear transfer, proved that adult cells retain a complete set of information ‚Äì as opposed to Weismann's increasingly determined gradual loss of genetic information ‚Äì putting this aspect of Weismann's theory to rest as a general rule of metazoan development. However, genetic information is readily lost by somatic cells in some groups of animals through somatic genome processing. The best known example are the nematodes, in which the phenomenon of chromatin diminution was first described by Theodor Boveri in 1887. The idea was to some extent anticipated in an 1865 article by Francis Galton, published in Macmillan's Magazine, which set out a weak version of the concept. In 1889 Weismann wrote to acknowledge that \\"You have exposed in your paper an idea which is in one essential point nearly allied to the main idea contained in my theory of the continuity of germ- plasm\\".The Rough Guide to Evolution: Galton or Weismann first to continuity of the germ-plasm? ==Modern view== The idea of the Weismann barrier, namely that changes acquired during an organism's life cannot affect its offspring, is still broadly accepted. This has been extended into molecular terms as the central dogma of molecular biology, which asserts that information written in the form of proteins cannot be fed back into genetically transmissible information encoded in nucleic acids. The Weismannian notion that the germ cells are unaffected by somatic cells or their environment is however proving not to be absolute. Chemical modification of the nucleotide bases that constitute the genetic code such as methylation of cytosines as well as modifications of the histones around which DNA is organized into higher-order structures are influenced by the metabolic and physiologic state of the organism and in some cases can be heritable. Such changes are called epigenetic because they do not alter the nucleotide sequence. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Germ cells Category:Cytogenetics Category:History of biology ","title":"Germ plasm"},{"id":"1275121","text":"Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble is an action puzzle video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color handheld video game console. It was released in Japan on August 23, 2000 and in North America on April 11, 2001. Due to the cartridge having a built-in accelerometer, it has a unique shape, as well as a unique transparent pink color in reference to Kirby. == Plot == The game begins with Kirby napping on a cloud, when he is awakened as a Waddle Dee walks by, carrying a round pinball-like bumper. He then sees King Dedede, carrying a long bumper. Suspicious of the King's intentions, Kirby hops on a warp star and follows him, determined to find out what he is up to. Soon, Kirby discovers that Dream Land has lost its stars and sets off to get them back. == Gameplay == Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble uses a series of accelerometers to control Kirby. The goal of the game is to guide Kirby to the level's goal within the allotted time by tilting the Game Boy in the direction in which the player wishes to move him. The game registers a \\"pop\\" action when the player quickly jerks the Game Boy, rotating the game toward the user (as if flipping a pancake); doing so will fling Kirby into the air. The game revolves around the collection of the numerous stars strewn about the levels. To beat the game entirely, the player must collect each level's red star. This will unlock the bonus worlds, where they are slightly harder versions, and players start with less time. The timer counts down until the player has reached the level's end. The player can increase the timer by rolling Kirby over clock tiles, stopping the roulette on the timer, picking up clocks that add ten seconds, or by passing checkpoints. When the timer drops below 50 seconds, an alarm sounds, warning the player to hurry up and finish the level, and the music that was previously playing changes to a more fast- paced version. If the time limit reaches zero, Kirby will lose a life. == Development == Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble was released in Japan on August 23, 2000. It was then released in North America on April 11, 2001. It was not released outside Japan and North America. == Reception == Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. It debuted at number four by the American market research company NPD TRSTS for the month of April 2001. Game Informer wrote that while the game's concept \\"sounds simple enough, it actually results in one of the most dramatic, high-tension game scenarios seen on any system.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40. It was listed as one of the best games for the Game Boy by Game Informer in 2014. Ranking the Kirby games for its 25th anniversary, the USGamer staff ranked it as the worst spin-off game in the series. Staff writer Caty McCarthy opined it as \\"kinda awful\\", adding that this wasn't one of the enjoyable games in the series released for the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. It was the sixth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 563,914 copies sold. == Cancelled sequel == A planned sequel to the original game, titled Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble 2, was shown at Nintendo Space World 2001, which was being developed for the GameCube. Similar tot was planned to require the Game Boy Advance connectivity. Video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto demonstrated the gameplay, showing Kirby falling off a ledge on the television screen to the Game Boy Advance screen. He also mentioned that the player could write \\"programs\\", such as minigames, into the game cartridge. Originally planned for release in May 2002, the game was retitled as Roll-O-Rama, replacing Kirby with a marble ball. While shown at E3 2002, it was not released. == See also == *Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu! *WarioWare: Twisted! *Yoshi's Universal Gravitation == Notes == == References == == External links == * Category:2000 video games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Kirby (series) video games Category:Nintendo Research & Development 2 games Category:Game Boy Color-only games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble"},{"id":"1275128","text":"The Goin' Band from Raiderland is the 450-member marching band of Texas Tech University. ==History== Loyola Parade in 1934 The Goin' Band from Raiderland, originally known as The Matador Band, is nearly as old as Texas Tech itself. Under the direction of W. Waghorne, it performed at the opening football game in October 1925, fielding between 21 and 25 members.The Southwest Collection's Texas Tech in Retrospect In 1926, Harry Lemaire (1862‚Äì1963) was appointed director of the marching band. Following his service in the British Army, Lemaire had been bandmaster under Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and was a friend and colleague of John Philip Sousa. Under his leadership, the band earned its name when it became the first college band to travel to an away game. Also during Lemaire's tenure, the band became the first one to have its halftime show broadcast over the radio. American humorist Will Rogers once aided in financing a trip to Fort Worth, Texas, so the band could perform at a game against the TCU Horned Frogs, becoming the first band to travel to an away game. He also helped purchase new uniforms.RedRaiders.com In 1934, Dewey O. \\"Prof\\" Wiley (1898‚Äì1980) became director and expanded the band from sixty members to more than two hundred over the next few years. In 1938 Texas Tech became the first university in Texas to house a chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. Kappa Kappa Psi's \\"sister\\" organization, Tau Beta Sigma, originated at Texas Tech in 1937. However, due to legal complications, the sorority could not apply for a national charter. The Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was given to the band club at Oklahoma A&M; University (now Oklahoma State University), with Texas Tech accepting the Beta chapter.TAU BETA SIGMA ‚Äì National Honorary Band Sorority Alpha History Dean Killion (1926‚Äì1997) came to the Goin' Band in 1959. As his predecessor had done, Killion generated another expansion, this time doubling the ranks to over four hundred members. To ensure that an individual listener would hear the same quality performance no matter where they sat in the stadium, Killion arranged shows so that equal instrumentation was always on both sides of the 50-yard line, and that the band played more or less equally to both halves of the stadium. In 1981, Keith Bearden became the first Texas Tech alumnus to become director of the Goin' Band. He continued the style and traditions of previous directors as well as leading the band to the prestigious Sudler Trophy in 1999. Bearden also opened new venues for the Goin' Band, such as when the band traveled to Ireland in 1998 to take part in Saint Patrick's Day parades in both Dublin and Limerick. The Goin' Band also received another honor when one of its members, Armen Williams, became the first homecoming king representing the Goin' Band and Kappa Kappa Psi in the fall of 2004. Dr. Keith Dye and Duane Hill served as Interim Co-Directors of the Goin' Band from Raiderland while Director Christopher M. Anderson was on temporary leave. He was expected to return for the 2011‚Äì12 season but has since resigned his position and has accepted the position of Director of Bands at Arkansas Tech University. Hill subsequently took on the role of Goin' Band director, and remained in that role until his departure in 2018. On March 19th, 2018, Duane Hill resigned as associate Directors of Bands.http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/music-school-faculty-announce- resignation-of-duane-hill-associate- director/article_52fea60e-2c57-11e8-8d9b-8f45f3785bf5.html On April 26th, 2018, the School of Music announced that Dr. Eric Allen, Joel Pagan, and Dr. Ryan Smith would be filling the role as interim Goin' Band directors in Fall 2018. ==The Goin' Band Today== Texas Tech's Goin' Band from Raiderland on the field at a football game vs. Baylor in 2006 In keeping with the campus' Spanish Renaissance architecture, the uniforms of the Goin' Band are styled after the trajes of matadors, complete with cape and a flat-brimmed \\"gaucho\\" hat. The traditional style of these uniforms has been in place for nearly twenty years. The Goin' Band, through many generous private gifts, along with the help of the University and the Goin' Band Association, received brand new uniforms in the fall of 2008. The Goin' Band's repertoire of performance music varies widely, ranging from traditional marches to jazz pieces to the works of Elton John and Carlos Santana. The Goin' Band makes use of both traditional- style marching (formations moving goal-line to goal-line) and corps-style (formations while playing to the sidelines) in its performances. The Goin' Band also incorporates some of the tactics of scramble bands. Like most other schools' bands, the Goin' Band is open to all Texas Tech students, regardless of major or course of study. In fact, a significant portion of the band's membership are not music majors. Practically every single department and course of study available at Texas tech University is represented in the Goin' Band's membership. For this reason, the Goin' Band implements a fast but efficient method of learning new performances that often does not require practices outside of normal class time (\\"Marching Band\\" is an actual course at Texas Tech). This allows a wide variety of students to participate without putting extra strain on their other obligations. SIx, and sometimes seven different shows are performed by the Goin' Band over the course of a season. It is not unusual for the band to learn a new show from scratch in only five days, and have it ready for performance on Saturday, then start again with a new drill the following Monday. ==Traditional music of Texas Tech University== A band member plays a sousaphone. *\\"Cotton Fields\\" Huddie Ledbetter (1940) Arranged by Joel Leach *\\"Fight On For Texas Tech\\" Thornton W.

A formal principle tends to be texts or revered leaders of the religion, while a material principle is its central teaching.

He invented a shape note system in 1851 for the Harmonia Sacra. Funk was born April 6, 1778 (though his gravestone states March 9, 1777), in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the son of Henry and Barbara (Showalter) Funk, and a grandson of Bishop Heinrich Funck, a German Palatine settler of Bernese Swiss descent. Bishop Funck came to America in 1719, and was the first Mennonite bishop in America. As a boy, Joseph moved with his parents to Rockingham County, Virginia, and spent the rest of his life there. In 1804, Funk married Elizabeth Rhodes, and they had five children. After her death, he married Rachel Britton, and they raised nine children. He was a member of the Mennonite Church. In 1847, he established the first Mennonite printing house in the United States, at Mountain Valley, Virginia (renamed Singers Glen in 1860).

While Arias Navarro was a moderate leader in the last phase of Francoism and the beginning of the transition to democracy, he was in fact a hard-line politician who had been involved in the White Terror, signing thousands of death warrants at the time of the dismantling of the Spanish Republic.Ignacio Fontes; Manuel √Ångel Men√©ndez: El parlamento de papel: La mirada gr√°fica, el enfoque literario, 2004, p. 126 ==Biography== Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco in 1975 Arias Navarro was born in Madrid on 11 December 1908. He served in the Ministry of Justice since 1929 as attorney in M√°laga and Madrid. Arias was close to the right-wing sectors and joined the Francoist side during the Spanish Civil War. He was public prosecutor in the trials set up by the triumphant rightists in M√°laga after the conquest of the city. There he earned the nickname \\"The Butcher of M√°laga\\" (Carnicero de M√°laga) for his role in the imposition of the death penalty to true or perceived sympathizers of the Republican side, in one of the harshest repressions following Francoist victory with an estimated total of 17,000 people summarily executed. He married Mar√≠a de la Luz del Valle y Men√©ndez, without issue. After serving in various positions, including Mayor of Madrid from 1965 to June 1973, Arias became Minister of Government (Minister of the Interior) in June 1973. After the assassination of Prime Minister (Presidente del Gobierno) Luis Carrero Blanco he was appointed his successor on 31 December 1973, a position he continued to hold after the death of Franco. Arias Navarro had the support of the Franco family, most notably Carmen Polo, and retained the post during the transition to democracy. However, the garroting of the Catalan anarchist Salvador Puig Antich in March 1974 had already shown his aversion to political liberalization, while other events, including the executions in September 1974, the organization of the Green March in November 1975 by King Hassan II of Morocco, and the illness and death of Franco (which Arias announced on television), displayed his weaknesses and further eroded his authority. Franco's successor as head of state, King Juan Carlos I, continued his appointment, so that it was his government (which included Manuel Fraga Iribarne and Jos√© Mar√≠a de Areilza) that instituted the first reforms, however unwillingly. He tried to continue Franco's late policies, opposing any change. After a lengthy power struggle, Juan Carlos forced his resignation on 1 July 1976. The next day, the King granted him the hereditary title of marqu√©s de Arias Navarro (English: Marquis of Arias Navarro), together with the dignity Grande de Espa√±a (English: Grandee of Spain). Since he had no heirs, his title became extinct after he died. Arias was succeeded by Adolfo Su√°rez, named general secretary of the Francoist official party Movimiento Nacional in December 1975. In June 1977, during the first free general elections held since 1936, Arias joined the Alianza Popular, a right-wing party created by Manuel Fraga. He then led the B√∫nker group of hard-liners opposed to any reforms, along with the leader of the Francoist party Fuerza Nueva, Blas Pi√±ar. Arias, however, never again occupied a relevant position in the later Spanish government. Both left and extreme right attacked him, calling him by the nickname \\"The Old \\". ==Later years== In his first democratic election the party joined Popular Alliance (AP), led by Manuel Fraga, being senate candidate Madrid, but was not elected. He died on 27 November 1989 when he was 80 years of age from an infarction, and was buried at Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo. His wife died in 1997. ==Spain and Portugal== According to the Spanish daily El Pa√≠s,El Pa√≠s 3 November 2008 files released by the US National Archives and Records Administration show that, following the left-wing Carnation Revolution coup in Portugal on 25 April 1974, Arias met with the United States Deputy Secretary of State Robert S. Ingersoll in March 1975 and offered to invade Portugal in order to stop the spread of communism. The report Ingersoll forwarded to the then-Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on 18 March, stated that \\"appropriate steps\\" were being taken to ensure that \\"the events in Portugal did not cross the border into Spain.\\" Ingersoll went on to add that Spain wanted Washington to support Spain in the event of war, precisely at a time when the US was renegotiating the status of its military bases, and Arias wanted Washington to support Spain's future membership of NATO. ==References== Category:Prime Ministers of Spain Category:Mayors of Madrid Category:1908 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Grandees of Spain Category:FET y de las JONS politicians Category:Government ministers during the Francoist dictatorship ","title":"Carlos Arias Navarro"},{"id":"1275157","text":"Fernando Poe is the name of: *Fernando Poe Sr. (1916‚Äì1951), Filipino actor *Fernando Poe Jr. (1939‚Äì2004), his son, actor and former candidate for President of the Philippines ==See also== *Fernando Po (disambiguation) ","title":"Fernando Poe"},{"id":"1275158","text":"The Washington Quarterly (abbreviated as TWQ) is a magazine of international affairs covering topics and issues concerning global security, diplomatic relations, and policy implications.

The Werkst√§tte brought together architects, artists and designers working in ceramics, fashion, silver, furniture and the graphic arts. It is regarded as a pioneer of modern design, and its influence can be seen in later styles such as Bauhaus and Art Deco.Pevsner, Nikolaus (2005). Pioneers of Modern Design: From William Morris to Walter Gropius. 4th ed. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 164. . Following World War I, the workshop was beset by financial troubles and material shortages. Attempts to expand the workshop's base were unsuccessful, and ultimately it was forced to close in 1932. ==Origins== The enterprise evolved from the Vienna Secession, founded in 1897 as a progressive alliance of artists and designers. From the start, the Secession had placed special emphasis on the applied arts, and its 1900 exhibition surveying the work of contemporary European design workshops prompted the young architect Josef Hoffmann and his artist friend Koloman Moser to consider establishing a similar enterprise. Finally in 1903, with backing from the industrialist Fritz W√§rndorfer, the Wiener Werkst√§tte began operations in three small rooms; it soon expanded to fill a three-story building with separate, specially designed facilities for metalwork, leatherwork, bookbinding, woodworking and a paint shop. The range of product lines also included; leather goods, enamel, jewellery, postcards and ceramics. The Wiener Werkst√§tte even had a millinery department. ==Style== Beginning with the 14th Exhibition of the Vienna Sezession in 1902, the radical distinctiveness of certain Viennese artists began to emerge, setting a foundation for the widespread Modernist movement; this became known as Wiener-Werkst√§tte-Stil (literally, the Vienna Workshops Style). Among the innovators were the Austrian designers Gisela Falke von Lilienstein and Else Unger, and the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann. The latter's cubist sculpture created in 1902 marked a break into independence for many Viennese artists. His works from this period are especially remarkable when one considers that the term \\"cubism\\" only found its way into the art lexicon around 1907 to describe the work of Pablo Picasso. ==Production== Most of the objects produced in the Wiener Werkstatte were stamped with a number of different marks: the trademark of the Wiener Werkstatte, the monogram of the designer and that of the craftsman, who created it. The Wiener Werkstatte had about 100 employees in 1905, of whom 37 were masters of their trade. The seat of the venture was in Neustiftgasse 32‚Äì34, where a new building was adapted to their requirements. Eventually the project exhausted W√§rndorfer's fortune. The circle of customers of the Wiener Werkstatte and Josef Hoffmann mainly consisted of artists and Jewish upper middle class supporters of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. Several branches of the workshop were opened in Karlsbad 1909, Marienbad, Z√ºrich 1916/17, New York 1922, Berlin 1929. In architectural commissions such as the Sanatorium Purkersdorf and the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, the Wiener Werkst√§tte was able to realize its ideal of the Gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork), a coordinated environment in which everything down to the last detail was consciously designed as an integral part of the whole project. For several years, beginning in 1904, the Wiener Werkst√§tte had its own carpentry workshop. Josef Hoffmann designed a furniture line noted for its simple forms for the firm of Jacob & Josef Kohn. But only few pieces of furniture were made there. Most of the furniture known as Wiener Werkst√§tte Furniture were made by cabinet-makers as: Portois & Fix, Johann Soulek, Anton Herrgesell, Anton Pospisil, Friedrich Otto Schmidt and Johann Niedermoser. Some historians now believe that there are no existing original products of the Wiener Werkst√§tte Furniture division. From 1905, the Wiener Werkstatte produced handpainted and printed silks. The Backhausen firm was responsible for the machine-printed and woven textiles. In 1907, the Wiener Werkst√§tte took over distribution for the Wiener Keramik, a ceramics workshop headed by Michael Powolny and Berthold L√∂ffler. And in the same year Moser, embittered by the financial squabbling, left the Wiener Werkst√§tte, which subsequently entered a new phase, both stylistically and economically. ==Expansion== Wiener Werkst√§tte Museum at the textile company Backhausen in Vienna (2009) Palais Stoclet in Brussels, a Gesamtkunstwerk example of the Wiener Werkst√§tte The founding of textile and fashion divisions in 1909 and 1910 brought a further shift in the Wiener Werkst√§tte's emphasis‚Äîaway from the architectural and toward the ephemeral. After a close brush with bankruptcy in 1913, W√§rndorfer left to America and the following year Otto Primavesi, a banker from Moravia, took over as chief financier and patron. During and immediately following the First World War the Wiener Werkstatte was influenced by a new generation of artists and craftsmen, especially Dagobert Peche, who became creative director in 1915, and the director of the Z√ºrich branch in 1917. Peche's playfully theatrical aesthetic reimagined decorative motifs of the Baroque and Rococo in a modern way.\\"Dagobert Peche\\". Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. collections.cooperhewitt.org. Retrieved 25 December 2019. After the war, material shortages encouraged experimentation with less durable, less expensive materials such as wood, ceramics and papier-m√¢ch√©. One of the ceramics contributors was Walter Bosse.Schreyer-Hartmann, Cherica, and Hans- Hagen and Johanna Hottenroth. Walter Bosse Leben Kunstund Handwerk 1904‚Äì1979. Vienna: Verlag Christian Brandst√§tter, 2000. The original, grand Gesamtkunstwerk vision became diluted and submerged by the Kunstgewerbliches‚Äîthe artsy-craftsy. At the beginning of the 1920s, Philipp Hausler attempted to eliminate the \\"bad habits\\" and \\"extravagances\\" which devoured so much money by broadening the workshop's base. The WW artists, however, insisted upon their accustomed exclusivity, and Hausler left in 1925.\\"Vienna Museum of Applied Arts Attempts to expand the workshop's scope‚Äîadding such items as wallpaper to its limited program of industrial licenses, and establishing branches in Berlin, New York and Zurich‚Äîwere not particularly successful. The Werkst√§tte's financial situation grew desperate due to the effects of the war and the onset of the worldwide Depression in 1929. In the 1932 it was compelled to declare bankruptcy and closed. ==Legacy== With its avant-garde, artistic, yet timeless designs, the Wiener- Werkstaette-Stil influenced generations of architects and designers in the 20th century. The Bauhaus in Germany, Art Deco in America from 1920 to 1940, Scandinavian design from 1940-1960 (see for example Arne Jacobsen), as well as Italian design (see Mario Bellini) between 1960 and 1980, were all strongly influenced by the Wiener Werkst√§tte. A work representative is the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, which is considered a Gesamtkunstwerk of the company. The chocolate company Altmann & K√ºhne uses many of the designs of the company for its chocolate boxes, as does Demel. == Literature == * √úner, Stefan: Wiener Werkst√§tte, in: Wagner, Hoffmann, Loos und das M√∂beldesign der Wiener Moderne.

They were part of the wider Scythian cultures. The Massagetae are known primarily from the writings of Herodotus who described the Massagetae as living on a sizeable portion of the great plain east of the Caspian Sea.Herodotus, The Histories, 1.204. He several times refers to them as living \\"beyond the River Araxes\\", which flows through the Caucasus and into the west Caspian.Herodotus, The Histories, 1.202. Scholars have offered various explanations for this anomaly. For example, Herodotus may have confused two or more rivers, as he had limited and frequently indirect knowledge of geography.Herodotus, The Histories, translation by Robin Waterfield, with notes by Carolyn Deward (1998), p. 613, notes on 1.201-16. According to Greek and Roman scholars, the Massagetae were neighboured by the Aspasioi (possibly the A≈õvaka) to the north, the Scythians and the Dahae to the west, and the Issedones (possibly the Wusun) to the east. Sogdia (Khorasan) lay to the south.Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus: Books 11-12, Volume 1, Marcus Junianus Justinus, John Yardley, & Waldemar Heckel == Possible connections to other ancient peoples== ===Ancient writers=== Herodotus stated the Massagetae were great and warlike nation, dwelling beyond the river Araxes and that they are regarded as a Scythian race. Ammianus Marcellinus considered the Alans to be the former Massagetae.Ammianus Marcellinus: \\"iuxtaque Massagetae Halani et Sargetae\\"; \\"per Albanos et Massagetas, quos Alanos nunc appellamus\\"; \\"Halanos pervenit, veteres Massagetas\\". At the close of the 4th century CE, Claudian (the court poet of Emperor Honorius and Stilicho) wrote of Alans and Massagetae in the same breath: \\"the Massagetes who cruelly wound their horses that they may drink their blood, the Alans who break the ice and drink the waters of Maeotis' lake\\" (In Rufinem). ===Medieval writers=== Procopius writes in History of the Wars Book III: The Vandalic War:Procopius: History of the Wars. http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Wars/Book_III \\"the Massagetae whom they now call Huns\\" (XI. 37.), \\"there was a certain man among the Massagetae, well gifted with courage and strength of body, the leader of a few men; this man had the privilege handed down from his fathers and ancestors to be the first in all the Hunnic armies to attack the enemy\\" (XVIII. 54.). Queen Tomyris of the Massagetae, receiving the head of Cyrus the Great, circa 530 BCE (18th century painting). Evagrius Scholasticus (Ecclesiastical History. Book 3. Ch. II.): \\"and in Thrace, by the inroads of the Huns, formerly known by the name of Massagetae, who crossed the Ister without opposition\\".Ecclesiastical History. Book 3. http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/evagrius_3_book3.htm A 9th century work by Rabanus Maurus, De Universo, states: \\"The Massagetae are in origin from the tribe of the Scythians, and are called Massagetae, as if heavy, that is, strong Getae.\\" In Central Asian languages such as Middle Persian and Avestan, the prefix massa means \\"great\\", \\"heavy\\", or \\"strong\\". ===Modern writers=== Some authors, such as Alexander Cunningham, James P. Mallory, Victor H. Mair, and Edgar Knobloch have proposed relating the Massagetae to the Gutians of 2000 BC Mesopotamia, and/or a people known in ancient China as the \\"Da Yuezhi\\" or \\"Great Yuezhi\\" (who founded the Kushan Empire in South Asia). Mallory and Mair suggest that Da Yuezhi may at one time have been pronounced d'ad-ngiwat- tieg, connecting them to the Massagetae.Mallory, J. P.; Mair, Victor H. (2000), The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West, London: Thames & Hudson. pages 98-99THE STRONGEST TRIBE, Yu. A. Zuev, page 33: \\"Massagets of the earliest ancient authors... are the Yuezhis of the Chinese sources\\" These theories are not widely accepted, however. Many scholars have suggested that the Massagetae were related to the Getae of ancient Eastern Europe. Tadeusz Sulimirski notes that the Sacae also invaded parts of Northern India. Weer Rajendra Rishi, an Indian linguistIndian Institute of Romani Studies has identified linguistic affinities between Indian and Central Asian languages, which further lends credence to the possibility of historical Sacae influence in Northern India. According to Guive Mirfendereski at the Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies (CAIS), the Massagetae are synonymous with the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ of South Asian historiography. R√ºdiger Schmitt, notes Ptolemy's conflicting reports concerning the Massagetae. First, localizing them near Margiana, then later Ptolemy calls them a tribe of the Saka in the vicinity of the Hindu Kush. Schmitt, who states these terms are not relevant for ancient times, also notes that Byzantine authors used the word Massagetae as an antiquated term for Huns, Turks and Tatars. ==Culture== The original language of the Massagetae is little-known. While it appears to have had similarities to the Eastern Iranian languages, these may have resulted from interactions with neighbouring peoples, such as language contact or sprachbund-type assimilation. According to Herodotus: ==History== Queen Tomyris of the Massagetae receiving the head of Cyrus the Great. 1670-1672 painting.

It was released in Ireland on 23 May 2003, in the United Kingdom and Europe on 26 May 2003, and reissued on 17 November 2003 through Polydor. Girls Aloud worked with a variety of musicians and producers on Sound of the Underground, which was largely inspired by 1980s music. Comparisons were made with artists such as Bananarama, The Bangles, Blondie and Spice Girls. Sound of the Underground debuted to generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics, who noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. The album was certified platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It yielded four singles, including the title track, which topped the UK Singles Chart for a month. The album has sold 368,000 copies in the United Kingdom alone. == Background and recording == Girls Aloud were formed through the ITV1 programme Popstars: The Rivals by a public vote on 30 November 2002. Their debut single \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was one of sixty songs that Brian Higgins and Miranda Cooper had written with the aim of launching their own girl group. The song was originally recorded in 2001 by London girl group Orchid, who disbanded before gaining a firm record deal. It was produced by Xenomania and chosen by Girls Aloud's manager Louis Walsh as their debut single. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was 2002's Christmas number one single and spent a further three weeks at number one. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and another Xenomania production, Sugababes' \\"Round Round\\", have been called \\"two huge groundbreaking hits\\", credited with reshaping British pop music for the 2000s. Following the single's success, Girls Aloud proceeded to begin recording their debut album, which shares its title with the single. As the team grew, their music began to take over the nation. Girls Aloud worked with a variety of mostly British musicians and producers, such as Betty Boo, the Beatmasters, Graham Stack, Steve Anderson and Tim Kellett, and reunited with Higgins and Xenomania. Girls Aloud deliberately waited five months after the release of \\"Sound of the Underground\\" in order to ensure they would have a strong second single. Referring to their second single \\"No Good Advice\\", Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially did not like the song ‚Äì \\"we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day.\\" Sound of the Underground remains Girls Aloud's only studio album not to be entirely written and produced by Higgins and Xenomania, who had initially only created two songs for the album, \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and \\"No Good Advice\\". When Higgins heard the remaining ten tracks that Girls Aloud had recorded for the album, he promptly called Polydor to complain about the lack of creative content. Higgins said, \\"They'd sent them off to these other Swedish guys and different people in the UK [...] I said, 'There are two completely separate groups on this record. We need to get rid of six tracks and I'll replace them'. We did that and allowed the album to stand up as a body of work.\\" This last-minute decision resulted in Girls Aloud returning to the studio to record a further four tracks with Xenomania - \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\", \\"Life Got Cold\\", \\"Stop\\" and \\"Love/Hate\\". The album was completed in April 2003 and described as a mix of \\"Blondie and Bananarama, with a smattering of the Spice Girls at their best thrown in.\\" During the summer of 2003, Girls Aloud would again work with Higgins and Xenomania, recording a further three tracks - a cover version of the Duran Duran hit \\"Girls on Film\\", which would become the B-side of \\"Life Got Cold\\", \\"You Freak Me Out\\" for the film Freaky Friday and a cover version of The Pointer Sisters song \\"Jump\\" for the film Love Actually. They also re-recorded \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\", which was originally intended to be the fourth single from the album before it was scrapped in favour of \\"Jump\\". These four tracks, alongside an altered mix of \\"Life Got Cold\\", would eventually surface on a reissued version of Sound of the Underground, which was released on 17 November 2003. == Music and lyrics == Sound of the Underground takes influence from a number of 1980s genres, such as synthpop, power pop, and new wave, and 1990s styles like big beat, drum and bass, and garage. The album received comparisons to girl groups such as Bananarama, The Bangles and Spice Girls. Similarities to Kylie Minogue and Madonna were also noted. A majority of the songs make use of guitars and electronic beats. The rise of indie rock also inspired Brian Higgins to \\"blur the edges between commercial music and so-called \\"indie\\" music.\\" He continued, \\"pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise, through The Strokes and everything else. We were an independent company and we were as indie as the other bands around us. The guitar riff on \\"No Good Advice\\" is very very similar to the riff on the track \\"Michael\\" by Franz Ferdinand.\\" It was said that the album's \\"lyrics [were] curiously insistent upon Girls Aloud's musical credibility and autonomy of thought.\\" Higgins said that \\"No Good Advice\\" reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. \\"Life Got Cold\\" was labelled \\"surprisingly poignant.\\" == Songs == \\"Sound of the Underground\\", which opens the album, drew comparisons to Fatboy Slim. It was labelled \\"an enticing blend of spiky guitars and Fatboy Slim beats topped off with an irresistibly catchy chorus.\\" \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was further described as \\"a mechanistic sashay of twangy surf guitar and sultry gang vocals ‚Äì Girls Aloud explodes like a five- headed Kylie Minogue.\\" \\"No Good Advice\\" was labelled \\"a disco track with guitar ‚Äì a cross between Blondie and The Bangles.\\" Unlike many other songs, it was said to be \\"not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together\\" that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\", which is \\"a breezy summer pop song about trying to bag a guy\\", follows. The Xenomania production had \\"layered vocals with its slow tempo despite being more formulaic.\\" The song was compared to \\"a 21st century Bangles\\", as well as former Spice Girls member and Popstars: The Rivals judge Geri Halliwell. \\"All I Need (All I Don't)\\" was described as \\"a Kylie-type tune set to squelchy techno\\", as well as \\"a disco- funk workout with traces of Cameo and Bedtime Stories vintage Madonna\\". \\"Life Got Cold\\", the album's first ballad and third single, was a late addition to the album, completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of \\"Life Got Cold\\" and that of the Oasis hit \\"Wonderwall\\" (1995). Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. The song was called a \\"charming ballad\\" that was \\"a sweet but slightly sad pop song\\". The song begins with a rap. \\"Mars Attack\\", produced by Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, \\"is hip hop-referencing surf punk.\\" \\"Stop\\", a Xenomania production sung entirely by Nadine Coyle apart from the chorus, \\"starts like the Skids' \\"Into the Valley\\" but gets sultry instead of surreal.\\" The album's eighth track, \\"Girls Allowed\\", was co-written by Westlife member Brian McFadden. It was described as both \\"Basement Jaxx meets Spice Girls\\" and \\"Donna Summer meets Dannii Minogue\\". \\"Forever and a Night\\" was described as \\"a soppy love song earmarked as a Christmas single\\", but slated for sounding like \\"every girl- group slushy song ever written.\\" \\"Love/Hate\\", another song crafted by Xenomania, \\"lays vocals over garage beats.\\" A second contribution from Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, \\"Boogie Down Love\\", follows. It was said that it \\"mixes the hook of Blondie's \\"Call Me\\" with the bells from \\"Rapture\\"\\", as well as being deemed \\"electro stomping\\". \\"Don't Want You Back\\" was co-written by Anders Bagge, who also wrote Samantha Mumba's \\"Gotta Tell You\\", which bears similarities. It was labelled as \\"love song\\" in which Girls Aloud are \\"swooning over bois [sic]\\". \\"White Lies\\" was co-written and produced by Tim Kellett, a former member of The Durutti Column, Simply Red, and Olive. The original UK edition of the album featured two bonus tracks. \\"Love Bomb\\", another Betty Boo collaboration, was compared to Boo's \\"Where Are You Baby?\\". \\"Everything You Ever Wanted\\" borrows its opening line from The Rolling Stones. In December 2003, the album was re-released with the omission of \\"Don't Want You Back\\" and the bonus tracks. Three new songs appeared instead. \\"Jump\\", a cover of song \\"Jump (for My Love)\\" by The Pointer Sisters, was recorded for the soundtrack to Love Actually (2003). Cheryl Cole noted in Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams That Glitter ‚Äì Our Story (2008) that the single \\"was the point when we realized everything we'd been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that's not what people wanted.\\" \\"You Freak Me Out\\" is a pop-rock song that was written and recorded specifically for the Disney film Freaky Friday (2003), Also included was Girls Aloud's cover of \\"Girls on Film\\", originally a Duran Duran classic, that originally appeared as a B-side to \\"Life Got Cold\\". ==Release and promotion== Sound of the Underground was released in Ireland on 23 May 2003 and in the United Kingdom and European countries three days later, through Polydor Records and Universal Music Group. The international versions of the album exclude the bonus tracks \\"Love Bomb\\" and \\"Everything You Ever Wanted\\". A reissue of Sound of the Underground was released on 17 November 2003. It replaced the original bonus tracks and \\"Don't Want You Back\\" with three new songs: \\"Jump\\", \\"You Freak Me Out\\", and \\"Girls on Film\\". The radio edit of \\"Life Got Cold\\" and a remix of \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\" replaced the original versions. Originally, the album would be promoted with a tour with their fellow Popstars: The Rivals contestants; however, the tour was cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Instead, the group promoted the album on their What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour (2005) along with their second studio album What Will the Neighbours Say? (2004). Sound of the Underground and other Girls Aloud releases were made available for sale on the US iTunes Store on 26 June 2007 through Interscope Records. == Singles == \\"Sound of the Underground\\", Girls Aloud's debut single, was released on 16 December 2002. Competing against the Popstars: The Rivals boyband, One True Voice, they used a combative \\"Buy girls, bye boys\\" slogan to persuade the public to buy their single. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" received a positive response from most music critics. The music video was shot in a London warehouse just days after Girls Aloud's formation in the last week of competition of Popstars: The Rivals. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and spent four consecutive weeks at number one, earning a platinum certification in March 2003. \\"No Good Advice\\" was released five months later in May 2003. In 2003, the song won the Popjustice ¬£20 Music Prize, awarded to the best British pop single of the past year. The video for \\"No Good Advice\\" features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits which can also be seen on the cover of this album. The song debuted at number two. The third single was intended to be \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\", but was changed to fan favourite \\"Life Got Cold\\". The music video depicts the band members in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. The song failed to achieve the success of Girls Aloud's first two singles, peaking at number three. \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\" was replaced again, this time with their cover of \\"Jump\\", recorded for the Love Actually soundtrack. The music video for \\"Jump\\" was made to appear like it was intertwined with Love Actually. The song debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. \\"You Freak Me Out\\" was due for release, with Girls Aloud even performing it on television; however, Girls Aloud proceeded to record their second studio album What Will the Neighbours Say?. ==Critical reception== Sound of the Underground received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. The Times noted that Sound of the Underground \\"is packed with everything you want from a pop record ‚Äì attitude, aggression, guitars, disco beats and steals from Phil Spector.\\" Yahoo! Music said that Girls Aloud \\"have made a seriously fine debut album. OK, so it's not Blonde on Blonde, Innervisions or OK Computer, but it may well be another Spice.\\" A number of reviews noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. It was said that \\"Girls Aloud are on the better end of the commercial pop scale.\\" Ian Youngs of BBC News bluntly stated, \\"Reality pop is not supposed to be this good.\\" BBC Music said \\"time will tell if they are set to take the mantle as the new Spice Girls or slip rapidly down pops dumper as the new Hear'Say. But their debut album is sure to shut up at least some of their cynics, myself included.\\" However, many reviewers agreed that the album's quality declined towards the end. RT√â.ie wrote, \\"After a while it does start sounding a bit samey but for a manufactured pop album, this is a fairly standard fault.\\" The ballads featured on Sound of the Underground were slated. Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie said that \\"the ill-advised attempt to show off their sensitive side results in some truly dismal ballads.\\" ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart behind Justin Timberlake's debut studio album Justified (2002).

A southerly buster is the colloquial name1850, B. C. Peck, Recollections of Sydney, quoted in 1978, G. A. Wilkes, A Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms, of an abrupt southerly wind change in the southern regions of New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, which approaches from the southeast, mainly on a hot day, bringing in cool, usually bringing severe weather and a dramatic temperature drop, thus ultimately replacing and relieving the prior hot conditions. Marking the boundary between hot and cool air masses, a southerly buster is sometimes represented by a roll-up cloud perpendicular to the coast, which appears from the south and coexists with the wind change, though sometimes there is little visual signal of the southerly's arrival.Southerly Busters Explained. The Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology. Accessed 21 February 2012. Southerly busters occur about 32 times each year on the coast of southeastern Australia, with variable strength, usually in spring and summer. Although southerly busters are often associated with NSW and Victoria, they also occur on the east coast of Tasmania, New Zealand, and in Argentina and Chile. They are known as ‚Äòbackdoor fronts‚Äô in North America, and ‚ÄòSpanish plumes‚Äô in Western Europe.Cassiily, M. 1945. The frontology of sub-tropical Australia. RAAF Met. Services Weather Development and Res. Bulletin. 1. 5‚Äì28. ==History== ===19th century=== Warning signal showing southerly buster at Wollongong Garden Island. Schnapper Island with signal staff behind. From the early days of settlement at Sydney Cove, sudden southerly squalls had been a problem for boats in the harbour. In 1829, a brickfielder as these squalls as were now called, laid the boat carrying Governor Ralph Darling and his family on its beam ends. Later the term 'southerly buster' would also be used. During the early days of the European settlement, Sydney's summer storms were accompanied by rolling red dust from the colony's brickworks.Arthur Phillip Chapter of Fellowship of First Fleeters ‚Äì WEATHER SECRETS OF THE FIRST FLEET VOYAGE In 1869, following the connection of lighthouses and signal stations on the east coast of NSW to the electric telegraph network, a system was instituted to give shipping warning of approaching gales. It would give boats in Port Jackson warning of approaching busters. The new signals were included in Gowland's amendments to the NSW Sailing DirectoryAdditions and Corrections to the present Admiralty Sailing Directory for the Coast of New South Wales, Navigating Lieut. J.T.Gowlland R.N., Sydney, Thomas Richards Govt. Printer 1870 The signal was a diamond shape (see Day shapes) on the southern yard-arm of the signal mast to indicate a squall approaching from the south, and numeral pendants per John Nicholson's Code of Signalshttps://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/archive/curio/exhibit/1318/storiesc049.html?from_collection=2&page;=4 flying on the masthead to show the location of the squall. The numbers were those already in use from 1842 for identifying ports, e.g. Jervis Bay was 46 and Wollongong, added in 1854, was 82. The signal masts were at South Head Signal Station https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/south_head_signal_station and Fort Phillip. These masts had two yard-arms at right angles aligned north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest. From 1876 signals would be displayed at two additional places - the new flagstaff at Bradley's Head and the Floating Light Vessel at the entrance to the Harbour. This direction specified that a cone signal on the flagstaff would indicate the approach of a southerly squall. This signal, \\"A cone, with the point downwards, shows that a gale is probable; at Ô¨Årst from the southward.\\"The Weather Book : A Manual of Practical Meteorology, Rear Admiral FITZROY. - London : Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green. 1 8 6 3.- p. 347, was introduced in England 1861Jim Burton. ‚ÄúRobert FitzRoy and the Early History of the Meteorological Office.‚Äù The British Journal for the History of Science, vol. 19, no. 2, 1986, p 161. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4026590. Accessed 11 June 2020 by Robert Fitzroy, but this appears to be the first time it was used in Port Jackson. In 1879, George Herbert Gibson published a book called Southerly Busters, where a buster wreaks havoc near Hyde Park, Sydney. In November 1898, the Postmaster General, Varney Parkes,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/parkes-varney-7959 announced that that a white flag with the letters E, J.B. or W would be flown from the flagstaff on the clock tower of the General Post Office, Sydney to signal the approach of a southerly buster. As the wind reached Eden, Jervis Bay or Wollongong the relevant flag would be hoisted. The J.B. flag was hoisted for the first time on 10 February 1899 but the wind did not travel beyond Kiama. The day had been hot and oppressive and the much anticipated cool change didn't eventuate. The original intention was to change the flags as the change moved north but this didn't always happen. It was possibly later reduced to just two flags, JB and W. H.O Publication No. 169, Australia Pilot, Volume III, 2nd Edition 1930, United States Govt Printing Office ===20th century=== On the night of 16 December 1908 a new signal, also on the GPO clock tower, made its debut. For warnings at night a red light had been installed in the lantern - the glass enclosed room below the flagstaff. It continued until 1940. Capsizes still occurred, but fishing boats did heed the warnings. In 1931, with the addition of signals for southerly busters, the practice of displaying the Bureau of Meteorology weather forecast with flags was extended, with the cooperation of the Royal Australian Navy, to the signal staff on Garden Island. The weather flags had been flown since 1912 from the flagstaffs on prominent buildings but as well, at Garden Island, a diamond shape would be hoisted for warnings during the day and a red light at night when a southerly buster was expected. In 1932 Navy League sea cadets flew the same signals as at Garden Island at their station on Snapper Island (New South Wales). The Weather beacon on the top of MLC Building, North Sydney, built in 1957, could also warn of 'southerly busters'. Generally, the forecasts displayed by the lights were updated three times a day but could be changed at anytime if a sudden change was imminent. If a 'buster' was expected the red lights at the bottom of the beacon would flash at half second intervals., This signal, indicating strong winds and rain, was not specific to 'southerly busters', but as the jingle advised:http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/1340.html > Flashes short, prepare for gales, Gather the washing, furl the sails.\\" Author Ruth Park makes a reference to the southerly buster in her novel Poor Man's Orange (1949): > After an unbearably hot day, the old men on the balconies were sniffing the > air and saying, 'Here she comes!' The Southerly Buster, the genie of Sydney, > flapped its coarse wing over the city ... The women undid the fronts of > their frocks and the little children lifted up their shirts and let it blow > on their sweaty bottoms. ==Formation== For a southerly buster to occur, a cold front approaching the southeast of Australia should lie between two high pressure systems; one in the Tasman Sea and the other in the Great Australian Bight.Helen J. Reid and Lance M. Leslie School of Mathematics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia On a hot day, a strong offsea gale develops from the south usually in the late afternoon and early evening, causing a rapid fall in temperature as it arrives, and sometimes a short rain and/or thunderstorm may accompany, especially if it is affiliated with a cold front coming from the south and a trough, with the strongest winds being at the leading edge of the buster. However, the southerly buster does not always create precipitation, aside from light drizzle and light rain, which tend to occur a day after the southerly buster's arrival as its effects may still persist for 24 hours. It is proposed that the southerly buster is basically a coastal gravity current that is held against the mountains by the Coriolis force and in transverse geostrophic balance, and is generated when a cold front is obstructed, experiencing anticyclonic distortion near the Great Dividing Range, spreading northward as a coastal trapped orographic jet. The southerly buster is caused by its interaction with the Great Dividing Range, as the cool air becomes trapped against the ranges, oftentimes in the Gippsland area of Victoria, where the mountains create a channelling effect as the southerly winds move across the New South Wales coast. When the inland portion of the cold front is held against the mountains, the part over the sea proceeds to move along the shore, twisting the front into an 'S' shape. This activity continues on the southern New South Wales coast, while areas leading the front are still experiencing hot northwesterly winds.The Big Bust - Southerly Busters Explained! - The Bureau of Meteorology ===Characteristics=== The main distinguishing feature of a southerly buster is the sudden, squally southerly change in wind direction which replace the continental northwesterly winds.1997, Peter Baines, Kathy McInnes, 24. The southerly buster, Eric Kenneth Webb (editor), Windows on Meteorology: Australian Perspective, This is accompanied by a marked temperature drop and sea level pressure rise. Wind gusts in excess of 40 knots (74 km/hour) near ground level averages about three per year, which usually come about after very hot days and would tremendously ease within 30 to 60 minutes after the Buster's arrival, becoming rather light within a few hours. A regular southerly buster is between 20 and 60 nautical miles wide, with the heavier winds concentrated on the seaward strip, with its depth being around 1000m, restricted by the height of the mountains to west.Berson, F.A., bid, D.G. and Troup, A.J. 1957.

An orographic jet, the southerly buster is clearly a mesoscale phenomenon, developing on about one day. Because busters seldom keep a staunch speed while advancing along the coast, its arrival has always been difficult to foretell, though meteorologists nowadays have the gain of satellite imagery and weather radar to foresee it, with wind warning issued by the Bureau of Meteorology. Temperature changes can be dramatic, with falls of 10 ¬∞C (18 ¬∞F) to 15 ¬∞C (27 ¬∞F) often occurring in a few minutes.THE DYNAMICS OF THE SOUTHERLY BUSTER P.G.

Southerly busters rarely pass beyond the Mid North Coast or Port Macquarie ‚Äì When they do they are usually strengthened by the presence of a tropical cyclone off the north coast of the state. Moreover, they are less pronounced in that region with narrower temperature changes. Not restricted to the immediate coast, southerly busters do generally impinge upon the inland regions of NSW as well, namely the regions in the southeastern block of the state, such as, the Greater Western Sydney area, eastern portion of the Central Tablelands region going eastwards from Bathurst, the lower Hunter Valley region, Albury in the South West Slopes in a few occasions, Cooma in the Monaro (New South Wales) to the south, Canberra in the ACT, Goulburn in the Southern Tablelands and the Snowy Mountains, with the latter regions having the most dramatic cool changes due to their southerly vicinity. ‚Äì page 25 lines 15 ‚Äì 29... regarding the prevalence of the Southerly Buster in a widespread area of south-east Australia, and not confined to Sydney. Sydney receives an average of about five Southerly Busters a year, mostly in late spring and early summer, with the stronger ones generally reaching the city in the late afternoon or early evening on a hot day, though at times it would arrive after several days of hot weather. It is a crucial weather feature in the Sydney area, particularly for yachtsmen. *In Victoria, most notably in Melbourne, southerly busters occur during the afternoons where the domineering heat, brought on by north- westerly winds from central Australia, suddenly gives way to a rapid drop in temperature, followed by rain, thunderstorms and a relatively cool night. They would reach as far inland as Swan Hill in the north and Omeo to the east, but would be less pronounced and intense as one moves more inland to the north. Temperature drops in these parts of Victoria are more dramatic than those in the east coast of New South Wales, where a 10 ¬∞C (18 ¬∞F) drop can occur within half an hour (part of the easily changeable weather).Melbourne weather: Quick change sees temperature slip from sticky to chilly by Emily Woods, Ebony Bowden. 27 March 2017. The Age Southerly busters most emerge in spring, as the landmass northbound of Melbourne starts to warm up. Meanwhile, though, the Southern Ocean, which provides cool breezes to Victoria from the west, does not warm up as swiftly as the mainland. As such, the temperature difference between hot air from the north and cold from the ocean would be very great, thus providing good conditions for the formation of thunderstorms.Melbourne weather: How winds from the north and west create 'change days' by Belinda Smith, Tuesday 13 November 2018 *In South Australia, Mount Gambier would the most affected by southerly busters in the state due to its southeasterly location.

According to the , it has a population of people. Locals call the town Little Baguio of Laguna because of its high elevation and cool climate like the City of Baguio. ==History== During the 17th century, there was an area of land in Laguna known as Terreno de Nasonog (Lupa√≠n ng Nasonog in Tagalog). In 1678, Terreno de Nas√∫nog was divided into three parts: Nas√∫nog de Lucban, Nasonog de Cavinti, and Nas√∫nog de Majayjay. Nasonog de Majayjay later became the town of Luisiana. It was only on April 3, 1854 that ecclesiastical independence was granted to Nasonog by the Governor-General (the Marqu√©s de Novaliches) with the corresponding approval from the Archbishop of Manila, having Don Marcos Bartolom√© as its first interim parish priest. Because of the role of Don Luis Bern√°rdo, which was then regarded as the Father of Luisiana, and his wife Do√±a Ana, the town was named 'Luis y Ana', later changed to 'Luisiana'. In 1948, Visita de Luisiana gained civil independence from Majayjay. In 1903, the towns of Cavinti and Luisiana were combined, Pedro Villanueva of Cavinti was elected mayor and it was during his term that the Aglipay Church was founded in April, 1904. The Romana family funded the construction of a couple of Protestant churches. However, on November 12, 1907 under the leadership of Don Blas Oraci√≥n, through the Civil Commission, Cavinti and Luisiana became independent towns. ==Geography== away from Manila and away from the provincial capital, Santa Cr√∫z, the town of Luisiana is bounded on the north by Pags√°njan and Cavinti, on the west by Magdalena and Majayjay, on the south by Lucban, Quezon, and Sampaloc in the east. Luisiana occupies on a plateau atop the Sierra Madre mountains. ==Barangays== Luisiana is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. * De La Paz * Barangay Zone I (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone II (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone III (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone IV (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone V (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone VI (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone VII (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone VIII (Poblacion) * San Antonio * San Buenaventura * San Diego * San Isidro * San Jos√© * San Juan * San Luis * San Pablo * San Pedro * San Rafa√©l * San Roque * San Salvador * Santo Domingo * Santo Tom√°s ===Climate=== The climate is cold, humid, and tropical. The average yearly temperature is around 26 ¬∞C (78.8 ¬∞F). ==Demographics== In the , the population of Luisiana, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Economy== Luisiana is basically an agricultural town. At the poblaci√≥n, there are only a few commercial establishments which cater to the basic services of the people. Most of them still go to Santa Cr√∫z to do their shopping or marketing and to avail themselves of other services not available in their town. Sources of income of the people of Luisiana are mainly focused on agriculture such as copra, pandan, palay, bamboo and bunliw, with light industry base and service- sector economy. Piggery and poultry farming are also an additional income. ==Transportation== Going to Luisiana by private transportation from Manila, you will pass by the South Superhighway and enter the province via the Calamba exit. Another way is through the Manila East Road(Route 601, Route 602, Route 603 and Route 605)‚Äì Pags√°njan route or coming from Quezon, the Lucb√°n, Tayabas City, Lucena City and Pagbilao, Quezon Route Even from Bicol Region. Luisiana is also accessible by public transportation taking the same routes as mentioned above. However, whichever route you take, a trip to Luisiana will still be long since it is one of the inner towns in Laguna. From Manila via Calamb√¢, a bus will take you to Santa Cruz, Laguna. In Santa Cruz, jeepneys going to Luisiana can be found at the jeepney terminal. Just ask a tricycle driver to take you to the terminal of jeepneys going to Luisiana. Via Santa Cr√∫z, you will pass by the town of Pagsanj√°n before reaching Luisiana. You will easily know it when you have reached the town because the roads become zigzagged with many sharp twists and turns. This is one of the reasons why Luisiana is called the 'little Baguio of Laguna.' ==Sites and events== A candidate in Miss Luisiana beauty pageant wearing pandan costume At the centre of the town, some of the sites are the Roman Catholic Church, the monument of Don Luis Bern√°rdo (town‚Äôs founder) and a monument of Dr. Jos√© Protacio Rizal. But one interesting site in town is the \\"guard dogs\\" at the stairs in front of the municipal building. Instead of lions which are common sites or designs in stairs of other buildings, the municipal building of Luisiana has two dogs, which look like Dalmatians, one in each side of the building. However, no one can tell why they are there or what is the story behind the presence of the dogs in the building. Some of them believe that the dogs might have been a part of the town‚Äôs history which is yet to be discovered. Aside from the man- made attractions, Luisiana is also home to natural attractions like falls (such as Hulugan,Hulugan Waterfalls Bumb√≥ngan, Malaog, Maapon, Limbun-limb√≥n, Aliw,Aliw Waterfalls Lagasl√°s and Botoc√°n-Tiklingan) and caves (such as the caves of Simbahang Bato and But√°s Kabag). Although most of these attractions are not yet fully developed commercially, they are open for the public to see in their natural state. Town feast is celebrated on October 9 for the feast of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. Another celebration in town is held every 3 April, which is in commemoration of the town‚Äôs establishment as a separate entity from Maj√°yjay. Luisiana also celebrates the Pand√°n Festival during this month and also the annual Miss Luisiana beauty pageant to select representative for Miss Laguna beauty pageant. Luisiana has 2 Miss Laguna crowns so far, in 1998 and in 2002. == Education == === Secondary === * Liceo de Luisiana * San Buenaventura Integrated National High School (main- BarangaySan Buenaventura) * San Buenaventura Integrated National High School (annex-Town of Luisiana) * Luis Bernardo Memorial High School Inc. === Primary === *Luisiana Central Elementary School *Bonifacio Elementary School *San Antonio Elementary School *San Isidro Elementary School *San Buenaventura Elementary School *Santo Domingo Elementary School *San Salvador Elementary School *De La Paz-San Pablo Elementary School *San Rafael-San Roque Elementary School *Luisiana Adventist Elementary School *Saint Dominic Savio School (Closed) ==Sister cities== * Makati City * Malaybalay City * Guipos, Zamboanga del Sur * Baguio ==Gallery== File:Luisiana,Lagunajf8321 12.JPGPlaza with Municipal Hall in background File:Luisiana,LagunaChurchjf8615 04.JPGLuisiana Roman Catholic Church File:Liceo_de_Luisiana.jpgLiceo de Luisiana File:Bonifacio_Elem_School.jpgBonifacio Elementary School File:Miss_Luisiana_2005.jpgMiss Luisiana 2005 ==References== ==External links== * Luisiana Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Laguna (province) ","title":"Luisiana, Laguna"},{"id":"1275208","text":"Sardinian refers to anything related to the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.
