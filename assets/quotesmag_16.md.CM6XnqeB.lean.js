It has mostly smooth, light grey to pinkish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical to barrel-shaped fruit.flower budsfruit ==Description== Eucalyptus fasciculosa is a tree with a single stem, rarely a mallee, and typically grows to a height of and a width of . It has smooth, off-white to slaty blue bark that is shed in flakes, sometimes with rough flaky bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped, petiolate leaves long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, the same glossy green to blue-green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of stems on a branching peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months between March and December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. The seeds are grey to red-brown , irregularly shaped and slightly flattened. ==Taxonomy and naming== Eucalyptus fasciculosa was first formally described in 1855 by Ferdinand von Mueller in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. The specific epithet (fasciculosa) is derived from the Latin word fascis meaning \\"bundle\\", \\"packet\\" or \\"sheaf\\", possibly referring to the flower bundles on the ends of the stems. ==Distribution and habitat== Pink gum grows in woodland or as an emergent low shrubland on soil of low fertility. It is mainly found in the south-east of South Australia, in the Mount Lofty Ranges, Barossa Valley and on Kangaroo Island. It also occurs in the far south west of Victoria. The canopy is not dense and other plants are able to grow in the dappled shade provided by the tree. The species is very similar in appearance to Eucalyptus leucoxylon. ==Use in horticulture== This eucalypt has a moderate growth rate and is able to tolerate low rainfall, moderate wind, including second-line salt wind and light frost. It is planted for as an ornamental tree in gardens, parks and as a street tree. ==See also== *List of Eucalyptus species ==References== Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Trees of Australia fasciculosa Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1855 Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Eucalyptus fasciculosa"},{"id":"35900936","text":"The Russian Ministry of Sports (Russian: –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏, often abbreviated as –ú–∏–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç or Minisport) is a Federal Ministry in Russia.

It was built in 1829 by Samuel Alsop, Jr. (1776‚Äì1859) for his daughter Ann Eliza and her husband, John M. Anderson. The home bears the same name as the home of Fielding and Betty Lewis (Betty was the sister of George Washington) in nearby Fredericksburg, Virginia. To distinguish the houses, Kenmore in Spotsylvania County was renamed Kenmore Woods. Samuel Alsop, Jr. designed a number of homes in Spotsylvania County. In addition to Kenmore, he also designed and built \\"Oakley\\" for another daughter as well as his own home, \\"Fairview\\". In all, Alsop designed and built 10 homes. ==Design== Begun in 1828 and finished in 1829, the design of the home is Federal-style. The house was built on that Alsop purchased in 1821. The relatively modest-sized Kenmore is unusual for Alsop in that it was designed with a narrow central hallway and a spiral staircase. Another unusual aspect of the house is the brickwork. On the front and south sides, bricks are laid in Flemish bond pattern while the other sides are common bond. The present owners of the house suggest that the reason for this might be that the house sits on an intersection of two roads and thus visible from two sides. The kitchen was originally an outbuilding ‚Äì a structure built apart from the main house. It was common in Colonial times to separate the kitchen from the rest of the house because the kitchen was the working area of the household's slaves. ==History== The house was sold in 1832 to Dr. Hubbard Minor who, in 1836, added an ell to the rear of the home and a gable end shed roof. The ell is now a sitting room. The character of the additions was Greek Revival. The house was located at the intersection of major roads near Spotsylvania Courthouse. During the American civil war, the house was used by Colonel Walker of the Army of Northern Virginia as a headquarters during the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse in 1864. Dr. Maxwell Harbin and his wife purchased the house in 1935 and changed the name of the home to Kenmore Woods because of the confusion with the home of George Washington's sister, Betty, in nearby Fredericksburg, Virginia. Sometime during the 1930s, a screened porch was added to the south side of the home. To create a passage from the house onto the porch, it was necessary to cut through four courses of brick. It was around this time that electricity and plumbing were added to the house. Kenmore was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1993. ==ReferencesFurther reading== National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Kenmore Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Federal architecture in Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1829 Category:Houses in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Spotsylvania County, Virginia ","title":"Kenmore (Spotsylvania County, Virginia)"},{"id":"35901011","text":"Charaxes antiquus is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Starting in 1992, it has been organised by Oph√©lie Renouard as a couture event by invitation. The young women don gowns from haute couture and couture designers, as well as foreign fashion houses. They all wear jewelry from the same jeweler. The d√©butantes usually come from famous families. The event raises money for charity; the most recent editions have supported two organizations. Since 2009, le Bal has supported Enfants d'Asie, which provides education for girls in Southeast Asia. Since 2015 it has also supported Seleni, a non-profit that finances research in healthcare for adolescent mothers. In 2005, Forbes cited it as one of the world's 10 \\"hottest parties\\". == Fashion houses == In 1993, the International Herald Tribune stated that \\"the show itself was central casting's idea of Paris couture ‚Äì all unswept Carita chignons, solid makeup and the girls plodding out in drop-dead gowns. Yet all seemed as thrilled as Cinderella that someone had waved a mascara wand to give them old-fashioned glamour.\\" For many of the d√©butantes, le Bal is their introduction to the world of high fashion. For example, in 2008, French actor Jean Rochefort's daughter Cl√©mence, who wore Nina Ricci, said that it was her first time in haute couture. Anna Cleveland van Ravenstein, on the other hand, had been modeling for Chanel for years before \\"Uncle Karl [Lagerfeld]\\" helped her pick out a vintage gown for le Bal. Some couture houses have produced special gowns for the event, for instance Carolina Herrera in 2003 for Diana Mellon, and, in 2014, Danish designer Jesper Hovring for Viola Mikkelsen. In 2018, the Indo- French fashion house Lecoanet Hemant made a gown for HRH Princess Ananya Raje Scindia of Gwalior. Jet Li's daughter Jane Li was dressed by Dior in 2019. == The Event == Deb Sokhna N'dour dressing for le Bal in 2008 Planning and preparations include inviting the d√©butantes and their cavaliers and meetings with the debs and their families. From 1992 to 2012, le Bal was organized at the H√¥tel de Crillon. The H√¥tel Raphael was the hotel of le Bal in 2013 and 2014 and the event was held in the Palais de Chaillot in 2015, overlooking the Eiffel Tower. Le Bal was held at the hotel The Peninsula Paris in 2016 and 2017, and in 2018 and 2019 at the Shangri La Hotel in Paris. Friday, or the eve of le Bal, is when the d√©butantes come together for the first time. The makeup and hair styling sessions start at 9:00am. Then, the d√©butantes don their dresses, shoes, and jewels, and the individual and group photo sessions last for the rest of the day. On Friday evening, the d√©butantes' fathers and cavaliers take part in a waltz class with two teachers. The d√©butantes have sessions with By Terry for makeup and Alexandre de Paris for hair. Debs dance and talk at the 2009 Ball at the H√¥tel de Crillon. The d√©butantes are introduced in alphabetical order on the arms of their cavaliers by journalist and author St√©phane Bern. Then the dinner is served. After dinner, the d√©butantes who are the most followed by the media open le Bal, followed by all of the fathers with their daughters. ===Opening dance=== Each year since 2005, there has been a d√©butante who opens the dancing with a waltz. * 2005: Bianca Brandolini d'Adda with the master of ceremony, Prince Charles-Philippe d'Orl√©ans * 2006: Xiaodan Chen with St√©phane Bern * 2007: Maria Abou Nader with St√©phane Bern * 2008: Bruce Willis and Alain Delon launched le Bal together, leading Scout Larue Willis in Lacroix Haute Couture and Anouchka Delon in Elie Saab Haute Couture, with the waltz from Luchino Visconti's film Il Gattopardo * 2009: Autumn Whitaker with Forest Whitaker, and Jasmine Li with St√©phane Bern * 2011: Tallulah Willis with Bruce Willis * 2012: Sophia Rose Stallone in Elie Saab Haute Couture with Sylvester Stallone * 2013: Kyra Kennedy in Dior Haute Couture with Robert Kennedy * 2014: HRH Princess Elizabeth de Bourbon Parme in Alexis Mabille Haute Couture with HRH Prince Charles-Emmanuel de Bourbon Parme * 2015: Iman Perez with Vincent Perez and Countess Gloria de Limburg Stirum with Count Thierry de Limburg Stirum * 2016: Countess Ang√©lique de Limburg-Stirum and her father Thierry de Limburg-Stirum opened the ball, followed by Yu Hang and Elle Beatty. * 2017: Ava Philippe in Giambattista Valli haute couture danced with her escort, Maharaja Padmanabh Singh of Jaipur. The two danced to a song from the film La La Land.http://people.com/celebrity/ava-phillippe-paris-debutante-debut/ *2018: True Whitaker and her father Forest Whitaker opened le Bal, along with then Annabel Yao and her cavalier Jean de Cro√ø-Solre and Gabrielle de Pourtal√®s and St√©phane Bern. *2019: French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo's daughter Stella Belmondo opened le Bal with St√©phane Bern, followed by Shanaya Kapoor and Iglesias twins Victoria and Cristina. This opening dance is followed by a waltz with all of the fathers and d√©butantes. The fathers then cede their daughters to the cavaliers, and the waltz is replaced with contemporary music with a live band. The debs then return their dresses and their jewels. The d√©butantes and their cavaliers finish the evening out clubbing. == The debutantes == The criteria for invitation are looks, brains, and famous parents. They often come from families known in entertainment, business, or politics. As le Bal is also a couture event, the gowns are fashion show dresses and le Bal's team endeavors to find the most suitable ones. From 2000 to 2003, le Bal welcomed a winner from a contest held by the French magazine Jalouse each year. Each one was chosen based on a submitted application. The majority of the participants must undergo a bit of a transition in wearing haute couture dresses. Rory Ross of The Daily Telegraph described the d√©butantes' transformations as: \\"Trading fashionably frayed jeans, trainers and fruit-scented lip gloss for heels, tiaras and haute couture gowns worth up to ¬£30,000 each, they undergo a semi-Cinderella transformation ('semi' because most of these girls already have a head-and-shoulders start on Cinderella).\\" In interviews, the d√©butantes usually speak of the pleasure of wearing couture dresses, the charity aspect of the event, and the opportunity to meet girls from different countries. == The cavaliers == Each d√©butante is escorted by a cavalier. He may be by a young man of her own choosing, such as a brother, cousin, friend, or boyfriend. However, nearly half of the d√©butantes, particularly those travelling from abroad don't bring their own cavaliers; they rely instead on the organizers of le Bal to find a cavalier. The organizer, Renouard, told Malaysia Tatler, \\" When a deb wants us to find her a cavalier, we look at the ages, the language they speak, their heights and possibly their backgrounds and usually it works. == Media coverage == The 2011 Debs photographed at le Bal Coverage often emphasizes the cachet of the event and its elegance. It has been claimed that \\"Le Bal has really maintained its exclusivity; all the top designers participate, and there have never been any sleazy photographs of the d√©butantes.\\" == References  External links == * Category:Fashion events in France Category:Annual events in France Category:Recurring events established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in France Category:Events in Paris Category:Debutante balls Category:Balls in France ","title":"Bal des d√©butantes"},{"id":"35901308","text":"Ana Peleteiro Bri√≥n (born 2 December 1995 in Ribeira, Galicia, Spain) is a Spanish triple jumper and the current national record holder.

His research contributions lead to the finding that the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle is an open process.Singh et al.,1985. Photorespiratory nitrogen cycle-A critical evaluation. Physiologia Plantarum 66: 169-176 He discovered that nitrate reductase enzyme derives its reducing power from photorespiration, considered a wasteful process by many plant physiologists.Kumar et al., 1988, Glycine supports in vivo reduction of nitrate in barley leaves. Plant Physiology 88: 1486-1488 Kumar acquired Ph.D degree in plant physiology for his research on photorespiratory ammonia assimilation in crop species. Kumar worked as Alexander von Humboldt Fellow in the University of Hannover, Germany in 1991 and 1992. Chloroplast targeting of cyanobacterial nitrate reducase was achieved in order to link nitrate reduction to photosynthetic electron transport.Kumar et al., 1993. Integration of a cyanobacterial protein involved in nitrate reduction into isolated Synechococcus but not into pea thylakoid membranes. European Journal of Biochemistry 214: 533-537 ===Biotechnology=== Having acquired experience in molecular biology, Kumar started working on transgenic crops for insect resistance at Biotechnology Centre of IARI.Bt brinjal: http://www.livemint.com/Politics/vaCgPllEBDAnLEM8dR0GVL/Genetic- history.htmlPioneer of Bt brinjal: http://www.environmentportal.in/files/Bt%20Brinjal_2.pdf He developed Bt brinjal and field-tested it in 1995.Bt brinjal: Kumar et al.,1998 Insect- resistant transgenic brinjal plants.

He represented the Pinellas County area in the Florida Senate from 1994 to 2002, and again from 2010 to 2018. Latvala was also a candidate for Governor of Florida in 2018, but withdrew from the race and resigned from his position in the state Senate following allegations of sexual harassment and public corruption. ==Early life and education== Latvala was born in Oxford, Mississippi, and moved to Florida in 1961, where he later attended Stetson University. He graduated in 1973 and later became the CEO of GCI Printing Services, which is based in Largo. ==Florida SenateElections=== In 1994, Latvala ran for the Florida Senate from the 19th District, which included northern Pinellas and western Pasco Counties, defeating Democratic nominee Chuck Lehr 59.7 to 40.3%. In 1996, he won reelection over Sue Humphreys by a similar margin, and was reelected without opposition in 2000. Latvala could not run for reelection in 2002 due to term limits. In 2010, when Democratic State Senator Charlie Justice decided to run for Congress rather than reelection to his 16th District, Latvala opted to run in the Pinellas and Hillsborough County seat. He defeated Pinellas County School Board member Nina Hayden in the general election. After the 2012 decennial redistricting, Latvala ran in the 20th District, which was based exclusively in northern Pinellas County. Latvala defeated business owner Zahid Roy in the Republican primary, and deaf child welfare advocate Ashley Rhodes-Courter in the general election. The Tampa Bay Times endorsed Latvala for reelection, calling him \\"the most powerful independent voice among the Republicans,\\" citing several instances in which he vocally opposed his own party. Latvala won nearly 58% of the vote in the general election. After court-ordered redistricting in 2016, Latvala's district was reconfigured to include northern Pinellas and southwestern Pasco Counties, and was renumbered the 16th. === Issues and positions === While serving in the Senate, Latvala strongly supported legislation that would give manufacturers a sales tax break for any equipment they purchased, declaring, \\"We're going to be able to bring back manufacturing in north Pinellas County\\" through the legislation. Controversially, he sponsored legislation that aimed to speed up the foreclosure process in Florida, with the purpose of clearing up the foreclosure backlog and benefiting the local economy. Latvala joined with Democrats in the Senate to vote against a proposal advocated for by the Florida House of Representatives that would prevent new state workers from joining the state's publicly funded pension program, noting, \\"One of the reasons they work for the government is not for the salary. They haven't had raises in six or seven years. It's for the pension and if we want to continue to have the quality of employees that we have, we need to continue to offer that pension.\\" Additionally, he joined with several other Senators, including Eleanor Sobel, to lead the opposition to Public Service Commissioner Lisa Edgar's renomination, asserting that \\"she does not do an adequate job of representing the ratepayers and consumers of the State of Florida,\\" specifically calling attention to what he felt was her coziness with utility companies. === Senate presidency === Beginning almost immediately after his return to the Senate in 2010, Latvala sought the support of his Republican colleagues to become Senate president for the 2016‚Äì2018 legislative term. In the following years, Latvala lobbied for pledges while rival conservative Republican Senator Joe Negron did the same. The leadership fight proved contentious and divided the Republican caucus, particularly during a court-ordered redistricting of the chamber's lines in 2015. While Negron declared he had support from a majority of the caucus in August 2015, Latvala refused to concede. Latvala eventually conceded in November 2015, at the close of the special session to redraw the Senate districts. He endorsed Negron, who announced that Latvala would chair the Appropriations Committee during his presidency. ===Sexual harassment accusations and resignation=== In November 2017, six women accused Latvala of sexually harassing them. These accusations came from female staffers from both parties, as well as lobbyists. Photos also surfaced from a private investigator of Latvala kissing a lobbyist on the lips. The women's complaints describe repeated encroachment by Latvala onto their bodies. One of the women, a legislative staffer, filed a complaint with the Senate. In December 2017, a special master found probable cause that Latvala had inappropriate physical contact with the staffer. The report also found that Latvala may have violated public corruption laws by demanding physical intimacy in exchange for support for lobbyists' legislative initiatives. A separate report by a different investigator found evidence for similar allegations. On December 20, 2017, Latvala resigned from the Senate, effective January 5, 2018. ==References *Latvala for Governor - - - Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Florida Republicans Category:Florida state senators Category:People from Pinellas County, Florida Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Stetson University alumni Category:People from Oxford, Mississippi Category:State and local political sex scandals in the United States ","title":"Jack Latvala"},{"id":"35901370","text":"Calloctenus pulcher is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Calloctenus.Bezark, Larry G.

Ellis made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in the 1948 County Championship, against Leicestershire and Worcestershire, with both matches played at Trent Bridge. Against Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 176/6 declared, with Ellis not required to bat. Leicestershire responded in their first-innings by making 169/6, at which point the match, heavily impacted by adverse weather, was declared a draw. In his second match, Worcestershire won the toss and elected to bat, making 200 all out. In response, Nottinghamshire made 334 all out in their first-innings, with Ellis being dismissed for 29 by Peter Jackson. Worcestershire reached 295/3 in their second-innings, with Ellis taking a single wicket, that of centurion Roly Jenkins for 109, to finish with figures of 1/49 from fifteen overs.

She currently represents the 27th district, which includes part of Lee County. She was a candidate in the 2014 special election for Florida's 19th congressional district. ==History== Benacquisto was born in Rockville Centre, New York in 1967 and moved to Florida in 1978, where she attended Palm Beach Atlantic University and worked as a realtor and marketing consultant. She served as a Wellington Village Councilwoman from 2002 to 2010. ==Florida Senate== In 2010, incumbent Democratic State Senator Dave Aronberg opted against seeking another term in the State Senate, instead choosing to run for Attorney General of Florida. Benacquisto ran to succeed him, and narrowly defeated State Representative Sharon J. Merchant and Mike Lameyer in the Republican primary. In the general election, Benacquisto faced off against Kevin J. Rader, a State Representative and the Democratic nominee. The district spanned from West Palm Beach on the Gold Coast to Cape Coral on the Sun Coast. Rader accused Benacquisto of committing 105 election law violations in a television advertisement, a claim which Politifact rated as a true statement. Benacquisto was further attacked for opposing a woman's right to choose, in cases of \\"rape, incest, even to save a woman's life,\\" which Benacquisto responded to by noting that she had been raped years earlier and that Rader \\"crossed the line\\" with his advertisement. The Rader campaign, however, stood by the advertisement. In the end, following a toughly-fought campaign, Benacquisto defeated her opponent by a surprisingly wide margin, winning 54% of the vote to pick up the seat for the Republican Party. When Florida Senate districts were reconfigured in 2012, Benacquisto ran for re-election in the 30th District. It included most of the old 27th, but not her home in Wellington, which had been drawn out of the district along with the rest of the old 27th's share of Palm Beach County. She moved to Fort Myers in the new 30th, won her party's nomination unopposed, and faced off against Democratic nominee Debbie Jordan in the general election. The Naples Daily News endorsed Benacquisto for re-election, praising her for the fact that she \\"sponsored the Andrew Widman Act to better track dangerous criminals and the Silver Alert Program to protect seniors astray.\\" In the end, she was overwhelmingly re-elected, receiving 62% of the vote. While serving in the Senate, Benacquisto voted for the controversial \\"parent trigger\\" legislation that would allow parents to turn failing public schools into charter schools, but, ultimately, the bill did not pass. She also supported legislation that would exempt \\"certain manufacturing equipment from the state's sales tax,\\" so as to potentially allow manufacturing companies to expand operations within the state. Following the controversy regarding the Westboro Baptist Church's decision to protest certain funerals, Benacquisto sponsored legislation that would make it a crime \\"to protest within 500 feet of a funeral,\\" noting, \\"We've seen these types of protests occur all across the country and it is very disappointing that folks would use the moment of grief to make a political statement. So we wanted to make a strong stand here in Florida and let everyone know that we were going to protect the time of burial and the time of grieving and the time for goodbye.\\" Benacquisto was elected the Majority Leader of the Florida State Senate for the 2012-2014 legislative session. Recently, following the resignation of Lieutenant Governor of Florida Jennifer Carroll, she has been floated as a potential replacement. Benacquisto's district was reconfigured and renumbered after court-ordered redistricting in 2016. ==Congressional campaign== On February 3, 2014, Benacquisto announced her candidacy for the United States Congress in the 19th District of Florida. Benacquisto was endorsed by former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin in March 2014.Joseph, Cameron. Palin's bark bigger than her bite?, The Hill, March 29, 2014.

A Republican, he served in the Florida Senate from 2010 to 2016, representing parts of Miami, Coral Gables, and the surrounding area. Prior to that, he was a member of the Miami-Dade County Commission from 1993 to 2000. ==Early life and education== D√≠az de la Portilla's great- grandfather served in the Cuban Senate, while two of his great-uncles served simultaneously in the Cuban House of Representatives. A graduate of Miami‚Äôs Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, D√≠az de la Portilla went on to earn his bachelor's and law degrees at the University of Miami. D√≠az de la Portilla's two brothers, Alex and Renier, are also Miami-Dade politicians. Alex preceded Miguel in the Florida Senate (2000‚Äì2010), and previously served in the Florida House of Representatives (1993‚Äì2000). Renier served two stints on the Miami- Dade County School Board (1996‚Äì1998 and 2006‚Äì2012), and one term in the Florida House (2000‚Äì2002). Diaz de la Portilla has two sons and three daughters. He lives in Coral Gables, Florida with his wife, Elinette Ruiz-Diaz de la Portilla, also a Land Use and Zoning Attorney, and the couple‚Äôs two daughters. He has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. ==Miami-Dade County Commission== D√≠az de la Portilla's career in public service began in 1993 when he was elected to the Miami-Dade County Commission from a new Hispanic- majority district. The district was created after a federal court ruled in 1992 that the county's system of electing its nine commissioners at-large violated the Voting Rights Act, and ordered special elections to elect a new, 13-member commission elected from single-member districts. On the County Commission, D√≠az de la Portilla chaired the transportation committee, and also served as the commission's chair. Among his legislative initiatives were the creation of the county's Office of the Inspector General, the establishment of the Miami-Dade County Expressway Authority, and reforms to land use policy and the zoning process. In 2000, D√≠az de la Portilla opted to run for Miami-Dade County Mayor rather than re-election. He lost to incumbent Mayor Alex Penelas in the first-round nonpartisan primary, 51.6 to 20.9%. == Florida Senate == In 2010, D√≠az de la Portilla was elected to the Florida Senate from the 36th district, which encompassed parts of Miami, Coral Gables, and the surrounding area, without general election opposition. Decennial redistricting renumbered his seat the 37th, and he was re-elected unopposed in 2012 and 2014. When the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission signed off on controversial limits for toxic compounds that can go into Florida‚Äôs surface waters, D√≠az de la Portilla called on Governor Scott to do a do-over and reconsider their position.http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2016/07/30/anger-suspicions- remain-after-water-vote/87749528/ Tallahassee Democrat In 2014, D√≠az de la Portilla was downgraded to a \\"F rating\\" by the National Rifle Association. On February 19, 2016, USF Executive Director and NRA Past President Marion P. Hammer sent a \\"Florida Alert!\\" to USF & NRA Members and Friends regarding de la Portilla's actions. Portilla rejected several key gun bills including HB4001, HB163, and SB68. When dealing with campus carry, D√≠az de la Portilla took meetings with university presidents, college police chiefs, faculty members, and students from around the state. All of them voiced their opposition to the bill. It‚Äôs not clear whether the bills would have passed had D√≠az de la Portilla allowed them to come up for vote, but there were 26 Republicans and 14 Democrats in the Senate, and approval for either measure would have required only a simple majority. In an interview with Sun Sentinel reporter Dan Sweeney, D√≠az de la Portilla stated, \\"I don't think I'm an anti- gun guy. I'm a pro-common sense guy.\\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-guns- halted-in-senate-20160219-story.html Sun Sentinel In April 2016, D√≠az de la Portilla was recognized nationally by the American Psychiatric Association for championing efforts to address the need to improve mental health services in the Criminal Justice system in the state of Florida.https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/orange-is-the-new- black-among-first-recipients-of-the-apex-awards American Psychiatry Association 2016 Apex Awards Court-ordered redistricting in 2015 significantly altered the 37th district, making it more Democratic.

He served as a member of the Florida Senate from 2008 to 2016, representing parts of Collier and Lee Counties in Southwest Florida. Prior to being elected to the Senate, Richter served one term in the Florida House of Representatives, representing a Naples-based district from 2006 to 2008. ==History== Richter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and served in the United States Army from 1969 to 1971, earning a Bronze Star Medal and a Combat Infantry Badge in the process. He then served in the United States Air Force Reserves from 1979 to 1981. Richter attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with his bachelor's degree in 1981, and then completed a graduate program at the Graduate School of Banking at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1987, Richter moved to Florida, where he served on the Greater Naples Chamber of Commerce, the Collier County Education Foundation, the Economic Development Council of Collier County, and Leadership Florida. He was a founding director of the First National Bank of Naples until 1997, when it was acquired by the FNB Corporation. Richter was a founder of and executive at the First National Bank of Florida prior to its acquisition by Fifth Third Bank in 2005. Since 2007, he has worked as the President of the First Florida Integrity Bank. ==Florida House of Representatives== Incumbent State Representative J. Dudley Goodlette was unable to seek re-election in 2006 due to term limits. Richter ran to succeed him in the 76th District, which stretched from North Naples to Marco Island in western Collier County. Richter was unopposed in the Republican primary, and faced Ken McPherson, the Constitution Party nominee. He was endorsed by the Naples Daily News, which praised his focus on \\"affordable housing and insurance as the big issues facing Florida and the Legislature,\\" though they noted that \\"[s]ome of his goals and positions on key issues could use a tuneup.\\" Ultimately, Richter defeated MacPherson handily, winning 78% of the vote to MacPherson's 22%. Following Richter's election to the House, he initially started campaigning to be Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2012-2014 legislative term, but he withdrew as fellow State Representative Will Weatherford solidified support. During the 2008 legislative session, Richter sponsored legislation with State Senator Michael S. Bennett that would have allowed business owners to purchase commercial property insurance without the threat of assessments from the state. ==Florida Senate== In 2008, incumbent State Senator Burt Saunders was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, instead opting to launch a congressional campaign against Congressman Connie Mack IV. Richter ran to succeed him in the 37th District, which included Cape Coral and Fort Myers in Collier and Lee Counties. He was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election, and won his first term entirely uncontested. When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Richter opted to run for re-election in the 23rd District, which contained much of the territory that he had previously represented. As was the case in 2008, Richter did not face an opponent in the primary or general elections and was re-elected without opposition. Upon being re-elected, Richter noted, \\"I'm looking forward to continuing my service to the Legislature by advancing sound fiscal policy and continuing to support Governor Scott's agenda for economic growth and private sector job growth.\\" During the 2016 legislative session, Richter sponsored legislation that would create a regulatory mechanism for allowing hydraulic fracturing and that would pre-empt local county and municipality bans on fracking. ==External links== *Florida House of Representatives - Garrett Richter *First Florida Integrity Bank, TGR Executives - Garrett Richter ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Florida state senators Category:Florida Republicans Category:Politicians from Pittsburgh ","title":"Garrett Richter"},{"id":"35901520","text":"Orthomegas is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

A native of India, Murthy and her husband, photographer and media specialist Vasant Nayak, established the MurthyNayak Foundation to channel their philanthropic contributions to nonprofits that serve the needs of women, children, and immigrants, particularly in education and health care. Murthy has repeatedly been recognized for her philanthropic work. She also serves on the boards of several nonprofits in the Baltimore-Washington area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States. She is a frequent speaker on immigration law, and on entrepreneurship and motivation, leadership, and women's issues. ==Early life== Murthy was born in Baroda (now known as Vadodara), India in 1961, the second of three daughters. Her father, HMS (Srinivas) Murthy, was an officer in the Indian Defense Forces. The family lived in modest circumstances, especially in her early years, and moved often as her father was posted to new assignments throughout India. Although Sheela's father was adamantly against the idea of her pursuing a career in law, she now credits her father's constant reminders about her responsibility to help the less fortunate for sparking her interest in law, social justice, and philanthropy. ==Education== Murthy was admitted to Stella Maris College in Chennai, where she majored in history and minored in political science. She graduated in 1982. During college at Stella Maris, Murthy says her interest in social justice led to her involvement in anti-dowry marches and other work to secure the rights of women and girls. It also strongly influenced her academic and career choices. Against her parents' wishes, Murthy enrolled in the Bachelor of Laws program at the University Law College at Bangalore University. As a law student, she competed in the Jessup International Moot Court competition and was all-India champion, and her team subsequently placed second in the world at the Jessup Moot Court competition in New York. Murthy graduated from law school in 1985 at the top of her class of 1,500 students. While in New York for the moot court competition, Murthy decided to apply for the Master of Laws (LLM) program at Harvard Law School. She spent the next year teaching French at the Alliance Fran√ßaise and the Institute of Hotel Management in Bangalore, while she awaited the results of her Harvard application. Around the same time, she met her future husband, Vasant Nayak, when she attended his photo exhibition at the Alliance Fran√ßaise. Murthy was admitted to Harvard, where she worked nights as a security guard to help cover her living expenses. She went on to graduate from Harvard's LLM program in 1987. ==Early career== After Harvard, Murthy practiced real estate and corporate law at White & Case, a major law firm in New York City. There she lived the life of a young associate attorney, working \\"12 to 14 hours a day, often seven days a week.\\" As Murthy explained, she found working in Manhattan to be \\"emotionally draining,\\" and disliked working at a big law firm because \\"you're nothing but a billable-hour machine.\\" In 1989, Murthy and her husband Vasant moved to Baltimore, where she continued to practice real estate and business law at a medium-sized law firm. At the same time, Murthy was developing expertise in immigration law, forced to learn it as she went through the protracted bureaucratic process‚Äîfour years, in her case‚Äîto secure green cards for herself and her husband. Murthy helped her employer to set up an immigration law practice, and did the same when she moved to another firm in 1992, where she began in earnest to build up an immigration law practice of her own. Murthy attributes her interest in immigration law, in part, to the difficulties she faced during her own immigration process. Murthy found the process time-consuming, expensive, and discouraging. As she explained in a 2009 interview, \\"my [immigration] lawyer never really communicated with me‚Ä¶except the one instance when he had to tell me he was hiking his fee! I thought that if a lawyer treats a fellow-lawyer like this, I dread to think how he'll treat others. I said I bet I can make an impact if I get in.\\" ==Murthy Law Firm== In May 1994, Murthy left her employer to start her own, solo practice immigration law firm: The Law Office of Sheela Murthy. For the first several months, she worked from the dining room table of her home. Eventually she moved to a tiny office in Owings Mills, Maryland that included a photocopier and receptionist that she shared with several other businesses. The Murthy.com website was launched by Murthy's husband, Vasant Nayak, who, at the time, ran the new graduate program in digital arts at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Murthy was initially skeptical about the value of online communication, but she credits her husband for convincing her to grow her business via the Internet. As Murthy explained, \\"He kept following me around, saying, 'It's the wave of the future! I'll do the work!' And finally I thought, fine, if it's free, I guess I can live with it. I've got nothing to lose.\\" The website went online in the fall of 1994. The firm's website is now the most viewed legal website in the United States. Murthy's firm grew quickly, in part because of her early adoption of using the Internet for promotional and outreach efforts. Murthy established a significant presence on the web, sharing news and information about the immigration process, and building her name and reputation in the process. Beyond her online presence, Murthy further raised her stature by writing about immigration law and serving frequently as a commentator for professional publications and seminars. In 1999, Murthy became actively involved with the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), and has taken several leadership roles in that organization over the years. She admits that, when she first launched her firm, she struggle with employee retention because she was too demanding, expecting her employees to work fourteen-to-fifteen hour days every day of the week. But, as time went on, she recognized that this was unreasonable, and that her employees \\"...had all the right to go back to their kids and families.\\" By 2005, The Law Office of Sheela Murthy had expanded to the point that the firm became known as the Murthy Law Firm. As of 2012, the firm has over 80 employees at its office in Owings Mills, Maryland, and another 15 at its affiliate, Murthy Private Limited, in Chennai and Hyderabad, India. According to Chambers Global, an international law-firm rating agency, the firm is now one of the world's leading U.S. immigration law firms. In 2009, Murthy was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young. ==Philanthropy== In 2001, Murthy and her husband established the MurthyNayak Foundation to channel their financial resources into socially transformative projects designed to improve the lives of women, children, and immigrants in their native India and in their adopted homeland, the United States. Education, health care, nutrition, and the rights of women and children are among the main focal points of these efforts. The MurthyNayak Foundation also provides free media for nonprofits through its production company, Site2Sight, producing websites, documentary films, and other promotional materials for free to the nonprofits it serves. Murthy serves on boards for a number of organizations, including Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Girl Scouts of Central Maryland, Maryland Chamber of Commerce, Stevenson University, and the Harvard Law School Alumni Board of Visitors, among others. She also serves on the boards of United Way International and the United Way of Central Maryland, which named her the 2009 Philanthropist of the Year. In December 2017, Murthy was named the president of the Washington, D.C. chapter of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE). ==Awards and honors== The 2013 edition of Corporate Immigration recognized Murthy as one of the world's top corporate immigration attorneys. Among her other honors, she was named to the 2011 Top 50 Most Influential Marylanders and the Maryland Top 100 Women's Circle of Excellence by The Daily Record, a Maryland Business publication. Murthy's firm was among the 2012 Top 100 Minority Business Enterprises, and Murthy received the 2010 Business Philanthropy Award from the Baltimore Business Journal. She also received the 2010 Small Business of the Year Award from the Maryland Chamber of Commerce. In 2008, Sheela Murthy was the first woman to become a member of the United Way of Central Maryland's Million Dollar Roundtable. In 2012, The Daily Record recognized Murthy as one of \\"Maryland's Most Admired CEOs,\\" and the Maryland Entrepreneur Quarterly named her Business Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2012, The Children's Guild, a nonprofit school for children with special needs, presented Murthy with the Sadie Award for her philanthropy and humanitarianism. During the awards ceremony, the children and staff of the school performed an original musical production showcasing Murthy's life. ==References Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Indian emigrants to the United States Category:Indian women lawyers Category:20th-century Indian lawyers Category:Businesswomen from Gujarat Category:Maryland lawyers Category:Indian philanthropists Category:People from Owings Mills, Maryland Category:Stella Maris College, Chennai alumni Category:20th-century women lawyers ","title":"Sheela Murthy"},{"id":"35901570","text":"And Other Stories is an independent British book publisher founded in 2009, notable for being the first UK publisher of literary fiction to make direct, advance subscriptions a major part of its business model as well as for its use of foreign language reading groups to choose the books that it publishes.

It was released as the lead single from the album on May 28, 2012. The song leaked on to Spotify earlier in May, but was quickly removed, and on May 22, 2012 Agnes officially confirmed its release on her Facebook fan page. The single became a massive success in Sweden, selling over 40,000 copies and being certified with platinum. It peaked at 1 at the official download chart and at 33 at the official chart. ==Background== According to the Swedish tabloid Expressen, Agnes fourth album was to be released within the first six months of 2011, but has since been delayed for over a year. The first official single was \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" which premiered on August 5, 2011. This was later seen as a promotional single released in Sweden only, and would not serve as the lead single for her fourth studio album. In April 2012 Agnes revealed that she had now chosen which song from her forthcoming album that would be the lead single, though without revealing any details about it. Almost two months later, the single leaked on Spotify, but was later dispersed, just a few days after on May 22, 2012 Agnes officially confirmed the single and release date. In an interview with Sveriges Radio Agnes said that the inspiration for the song came from a nightmare that she had one night, where she had \\"fucked up everything\\" regarding her relationship. She has also stated that \\"This is the most emotional song I have ever written. When you write a song that means a lot to you, it becomes a part of yourself. Thats the case with \\"One Last Time.\\" I hope I can touch people with it.\\" ==Critical reception== Camilla Gervide of Nyheter24.se writes about the song and questions Agnes' direction with her music. \\"\\"'...this is good but if it is Agnes, I do not know. What is Agnes, I wonder if she even knows it herself.\\" She continues by saying that she really likes the song and that she would probably view it in a different way if this had been the first thing she had done, but instead she is confused. The British music blog \\"Theprophetblog\\" stated that they had underestimated Agnes as some generic pop singer who belong in gay nightclubs and that she deserves more recognition. \\"The producer Quant serves up a cunning surprise on the song‚Äôs bridge, fooling you for a split second into thinking a dubstep breakdown is about to take place, right before dropping a thundering drum line that leads into Agnes screaming, her voice distorted and twisted until she sounds like an android dying of a broken heart..\\" American blogger Perez Hilton homaged Agnes and the song \\"One Last Time\\" on his webisite, calling the song \\"heart crushingly sweet\\" and a \\"power ballad to the core\\" while he continues with saluting her vocals and the lyrics. \\"We are MEGA digging on this Swedish IDOL alum's newest ode to fractured love, One Last Time. Agnes thumps and bumps the base like a heartbeat, her vocals are like liquid gold filling our ears, AND the lyrics are simplistic yet VERY poignant.\\" ==Chart performance== On June 10, the song entered the Swedish download chart at six and later peaked at one. It entered the official chart at 33, and peaked at the same spot. In August the song was awarded a gold certification in Sweden from over 20,000 sold copies. It later was certified platinum for more than 40,000 copies sold in Sweden. ==Music video== The music video for \\"One Last Time\\" was shot on May 17, 2012 in Stockholm, Sweden, and was released on May 30, 2012 on Agnes' official YouTube channel and on Aftonbladet's website. It was directed by Amir Chamdin. The idea behind the video is to describe how it feels when you have wrecked something that means a lot to you. The tears that Agnes shed during the music video were real, in an interview with Sveriges Radio she revealed that she couldn't stop crying during the filming of the video. ===Synopsis=== 250px The music video is in black-and-white and starts with Agnes walking through the woods, and by the beach, and continues with her sitting on the floor; singing. Between the different scenes, Agnes is together with a man who is standing alone with light behind his face, showing only his silhouette. The next scene is Agnes lying on a parking lot together with the man, holding hands. He then leaves, and parking stripes on the ground form a cross, making Agnes depicted as crucified. The video continues with Agnes sitting on the floor again, crying until it ends with the same scene it started with. ==Track listings== ;Digital Download/Streaming (Released: May 28, 2012) (Roxy/Universal) #\\"One Last Time \\" ‚Äî 4:00 ;The Remixes (Digital Download/Streaming) (Released: June 27, 2012) (Roxy/Universal) #\\"One Last Time - Remix \\" ‚Äî 3:27 #\\"One Last Time - Remix Extended \\" ‚Äî 3:42 ;The Remixes 2 (Digital Download/Streaming) (Released: August 27, 2012) (Roxy/Universal) #\\"One Last Time - Orion Remix \\" ‚Äî 6:36 #\\"One Last Time - John Dahlb√§ck Remix \\" ‚Äî 5:31 == Charts and certificationsCharts=== - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2012) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - - -  Swedish Singles Chart (Downloads)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1 - } ===Sales and certifications===  Sweden (IFPI)  Platinum  40,000 == Release history == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Region ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label - rowspan=\\"2\\"Sweden  May 28, 2012  Digital download/streaming & airplay  rowspan=\\"2\\"Roxy/Universal Music -  June 27, 2012  Remixes (Digital download/streaming) - rowspan=\\"2\\"Denmark  June, 2012  Airplay  rowspan=\\"2\\"Copenhagen Records -  June 25, 2012  Digital download/streaming - rowspan=\\"1\\"Finland  August 22, 2012  Digital download/streaming  rowspan=\\"1\\"Universal Music -  Belgium  November 19, 2012  Digital download  BIP Records } ==References== Category:2012 singles Category:2012 songs Category:Agnes (singer) songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by Agnes (singer) Category:Songs written by Jonas Quant Category:Synth-pop ballads Category:Black-and-white music videos ","title":"One Last Time (Agnes song)"},{"id":"35901641","text":"Lupinus elegans is a species of flowering plant in the legume family known by the common names elegant lupine and Mexican lupine.

The Film and Media Studies program used to be known as Communications and Media Studies (CMS). FMS is the largest interdisciplinary minor program at Tufts University, offering undergraduate major and minors in Film and Media Studies. Since awarding its first minor degrees to four students in 1997 as CMS, FMS has awarded minors to nearly 1,000 students. In addition to its academic programs, FMS supports experiential student internships for academic credit in various media companies around the globe. FMS also sponsors several awards and events to honor excellence in the media industry, including The Edward R. Murrow Forum on Issues in Journalism, The Eliot-Pearson Awards for Excellence in Children‚Äôs Media, and the P.T. Barnum Awards for Excellence in Entertainment. == About FMS == The curriculum encompasses narrative, documentary, and avant-garde modes in live action and animated images as well as sound and text-based platforms. In keeping with Tufts' liberal arts tradition, core courses in film and media analysis, history, theory, and production are supplemented by electives in a variety of academic departments and programs. FMS students are required to take three core courses during their undergraduate career. FMS also offers courses in television, journalism, advertising and social media. Alternatively, they may concentrate their electives in film studies, or in filmmaking or media practice. The internship program and the capstone requirement provide further opportunities for students to explore different areas of interest and pursue their own goals. The FMS major and minor can be used as stepping stones for graduate studies/professional programs, and for career opportunities in film, television, advertising, public relations, journalism and digital media. Students have also gone on to work in health and environmental communication, as well as other fields in which critical thinking skills, a background in film and media, and extensive writing experience are required. == Major requirements == The Film and Media Studies major requires the completion of twelve courses: three mandatory core courses, seven or eight elective courses and either a two or one course capstone. Students may concentrate their electives in film studies, film and media production, or communications and media studies. Students must take courses from at least three different departments or programs in addition to FMS designated courses. No more than 4 practice electives may be counted toward the FMS major. == Internship program == The internship program grants academic credit for internships in film, media and communications (FMS 99). One internship done for credit may be counted toward the FMS major or minor. Students can arrange to work at newspapers, magazines, film companies, advertising and public relations firms, television stations, radio stations, and publishing houses. Interns are required to work a minimum of 150 hours (approximately 12 to 15 hours each week), complete written requirements, and meet regularly with the faculty advisor. === Winternships === The Film and Media Studies program at Tufts offers one week internships during winter break for students interested in getting experience in their desired media field. Internships are located in New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, and Yakima, Washington. The internships are typically offered and early January, and require an application to be selected. All Tufts undergraduates are eligible to apply, though the application process is competitive. === Events === The FMS program hosts numerous events for students to get more acquainted with careers in media-related fields. Each fall semester, FMS and the Tufts Career Center jointly sponsor a \\"Media Internship Panel\\" featuring Tufts students who have completed various high-profile internships. The event provides other students with an opportunity to network with accomplished peers, who in turn offer advice on how to land a media internship. FMS and the Tufts Career Center also collaborate on \\"Jobs in Media.\\" This event features a panel of media professionals who are assembled to provide insight and tips for students on the media job market, along with interviewing and resume strategies, advice on what skills students should be mastering, and what it takes to land that first position after graduation.

The racecar has many developments that have been inspired by and developed further from its predecessors, the BMW M235i Racing, and the BMW M240i Racing, along with its \\"bigger brother\\" racecar, the BMW M4 GT4. The racecar gets power from a race-prepped 3-liter twin-turbo inline-6 that can generate anywhere from 280 hp (205 kW) to 365 hp (268 kW) depending on the configuration of the power stick, which is in turn controlled by the need to have a balance of performance or from regulations of a Permit B classification. The BMW M2 CS Racing also features a full FIA-approved roll cage, along with many motorsport-specific components, such as the rear wing, including ABS systems specifically tailored to the car by BMW M Motorsport.

It was released in November 1985 on EMI America Records in the US and Polydor Records throughout the rest of the world, and produced by Maurice Gibb and Tom Dowd. The two singles from the album, \\"Like a Fool\\" and \\"Toys\\", did not chart in the US and UK. Gibb did not release a solo album in eighteen years until 2003 with Magnet. Unlike Secret Agent which contains dance numbers, this album contains mostly ballads. ==BackgroundWriting credits=== Barry Gibb co-wrote eight of the ten songs, and contributed a part lead vocal to \\"Toys\\". The credits for the songs are precisely stated as R. B. & M. Gibb in most cases, and B. R. & M. Gibb in others. Although the songs all have Robin's signature simplicity of form, Barry's hand is evident in the melody lines, especially in the verses. ===Recording=== Like the previous album Secret Agent, it was recorded in Criteria Studios rather than the Middle Ear Studio which was owned by the Bee Gees. The only regulars from previous Gibb recordings was George Terry on guitar with Steve Farris of Mr. Mister. Session musician Phil Chen was credited as the bass player on the song \\"Gone with the Wind\\". The album was produced by Atlantic Records engineer and producer Tom Dowd. The copyright registrations on the songs span only between 28 August to 16 September 1985, and a period of just a few weeks keys in with what Dowd recalled a tight budget. On the sessions, there was one outtake, \\"Modern Girls\\"; Gibb later said that this \\"did not fit\\". ===Reception=== The album did not chart as well as the lead single \\"Like a Fool\\". However, Like a Fool was a smash hit in Brazil and the single \\"Toys\\" did reach #27 on the Canada Adult Contemporary chart. Walls Have Eyes is rare on compact disc giving its distinction as the last solo album recorded by any of the Gibb brothers issued on vinyl until Barry's In the Now in 2016. Polydor copies of the album which were converted onto CD were found, but because of low sales, it was not later reissued on CD internationally.

Most AN/MSQ-77s ware replaced by solid- state equipment near the end of the Cold War. ==History== Ground radar systems for automated guidance of aircraft to a predetermined point (e.g., for bomb release using a bombsight or avionics radar) included the July 1951 AN/MPQ-14 Radar Course Directing Central. By 1954 the MARC (Matador Airborne Radio Control) used the AN/MSQ-1A for missile guidance to the terminal dive point, and SAGE GCI provided computer-controlled guidance of aircraft to continuously-computed interception points (1958 AN/FSQ-7 Bomarc missile guidance and the later Ground to Air Data Link Subsystem for fighters). Despite the availability of solid-state military guidance computers in 1961, planning for a USAF vacuum-tube trajectory computer/radar system began in early 1965. In October 1965, F-100s tested the AN/MSQ-77 at Matagorda Island General Bombing and Gunnery Range on the Texas Gulf Coast. In March 1966, AN/MSQ-77 operations using the \\"reverse MSQ method\\" began and continued through August 1973 for guiding B-52s and tactical fighters and bombers (\\"chiefly flown by F-100's\\"). By March 1967, 15,000 Skyspot sorties had been flown, and raids controlled by AN/MSQ-77s included those of Operation Menu from Bien Hoa Air Base, Operation Niagara, and Operation Arc Light. Additional AN/MSQ-77 missions included those with MC-130 Commando Vault aircraft to clear landing zones and at least 1 helicopter evacuation of wounded on August 13, 1966. (partial transcription at 1stCombatEvaluationGroup.com) ;Commando Club: To allow command guidance bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong targets out of range of the initial Skyspot AN/MSQ-77 sites, the \\"1st CEVG began \\"Combat Keel\\" tests using F-4s guided by an MSQ-77 on the USS Thomas J. Gary\\" in the Gulf of Tonkin during late 1967 after the March 1967 \\"Combat Target\\" task force recommended a closer site. By 1 November 1967, the USAF Heavy Green operation had prepared a Laos mountaintop site and installed an MSQ-77 variant in rugged shelters without trailer frames, wheels, etc. for helicopter transport. Although the central's range was limited by the UHF radio reliability for A/C commands during the bomb run, \\"Commando Club\\" used a relay aircraft to retransmit communications between Lima Site 85 and the bomber. LS-85's operations ended with the 1968 Battle of Lima Site 85 defeat by sappers after North Vietnam had correlated bombings were occurring during LS-85 transmissions (the site's central and other buildings were destroyed by a later U.S. air raid.) Additional casualties of AN/MSQ-77 personnel included 1 killed in an enemy rocket attack and 6 Skyspot personnel killed in a 1966 ambush on a survey mission. Following -77 modifications in 1968, subsequent changes included a solid-state digital printer for RBS (\\"Digital Data System\\") and implementation of a USAF suggestion for RBS to use a late-1970s programmable calculator to supersede the Bomb Trajectory Group, eliminating alignment procedures for its amplifiers. In 1989, remains of an F-4C Weapon System Officer shot down during a November 10, 1967, AN/MSQ-77 bomb run were recovered in Southeast Asia. Lieutenant Honeycutt and Lieutenant Colonel Cook parachuted alive from their aircraft and reached the ground seriously wounded. Both were later reported to have died.\\" Developed from the AN/MSQ-77 and also used in Vietnam was the monopulse India-band Reeves AN/TSQ-96 Bomb Directing Central with a solid state Univac 1219B ballistic computer (Mark 152 fire control computer), and the AN/MSQ-77/96 systems for GDB were replaced by the US Dynamics AN/TPQ-43 Radar Bomb Scoring Set (\\"Seek Score\\"). There were 5 MSQ-77s at Nellis Air Force Base in 1994, and the \\"MSQ-77 or equivalent\\" was still listed in 2005 as support equipment for airdrops from Ground Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS) aircraft. The AN/MSQ-77 antenna at the \\"Combat Skyspot Memorial\\" on Andersen Air Force Base was destroyed by a typhoon . ===Locations=== Initial AN/MSQ-77 sites were the production plant Reeves-Ely had built in 1958 at Roosevelt Field on East Gate Blvd in Garden City, New York; and the Matagorda Island test site also used for \\"Busy Skyspot\\" training of Vietnam crews (moved to Bergstrom AFB in 1970). Deployment sites were the Vietnam War operating locations, the wartime site at the Nellis Range, and post-war CONUS RBS and overseas sites (e.g., Korea). The last AN/MSQ-77 locations (e.g., at museums after retirements) included the Ellsworth Air Force Base Museum (near the Antelope Butte, Belle Fourche, Conner, & Horman RBS sites) and: *Serial Number 1: ‚Ä¶ * Serial Number ?

Upon decommissioning of Havre, MT Serial Number 7 went to Detachment 18, Forsyth, Montana for SAC Bomb-Comp 1987 and then to Detachment 20, 1CEVG Conrad, Montana in early 1988. Was later modified by replacing the Cassegrain antenna with a Fresnel lens antenna, as was used on the MSQ-46. After the antenna (and associated equipment) modification, S/N 7 was used by the HQ 1CEVG \\"Bug\\" team to validate new site locations. *Serial number 10: Eighth Air Force Museum (Barksdale AFB) after use at Hawthorne Bomb Plot (), Guam, and Vietnam War OL 24 Served as \\"Secondary\\" radar at Mobile Duty Location (MDL) 35 Climax, KS from Jan - Jun 1982 *Serial Number 11: ‚Ä¶ *Serial Number 12:https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/an-msq-77.htm TBD after use at Vietnam War OL-27 (BROMO), and initial testing at Bryan Field, Texas (1st AN/TSQ-81: variant of AN/MSQ-77) *Serial Number 13: destroyed Lima Site 85 variant previously used at Vietnam War OL-23 NOTE: \\"Teepee\\" equipment \\"moved from Quangtri to Mukdahan in 68-69\\" and Mukdahan equipment was moved to NKP.

MSQ-77 S/N 10 served as \\"Secondary\\" for the ORI/BUY NONE missions at MDL 35 during that timeframe. ==Equipment and functions== In addition to the communication and maintenance van, other AN/MSQ-77 trailers were the radar van with roof-mounted Cassegrain antenna, \\"control and plotting van, two diesel generator vans, [and] an administrative and supply van\\" which were emplaced as a military installation at the surveyed site. The primary modification for the AN/MSQ-77 was the control equipment for aircraft guidance (ballistic computer, guidance/release circuitry, and UHF command equipment). The central also had an added beacon tracking capability used when the aircraft had a receiver/transmitter (e.g., Motorola SST-181 X Band Beacon Transponder) to increase the range so the radar site could be located farther from the hostile region of bombing targets. Beacon track upgrades included radar circuitry to switch the heterodyne receiver to demodulate the transponder frequency, compensation for the transponder delay, and modification of the central's plotting board circuitry to allow display for increased ranges. The plots were of tracks calculated by the computer's Aircraft Coordinates and Plotting Group which converted radar spherical data to plotting board cartesian coordinates (non-inertial east, north, up coordinate system) using sine/cosine voltages and radar-estimated range respectively from the Antenna Group (azimuth/elevation resolvers) and from the Track Range Computer. Additional A/C Coordinates amplifiers computed the velocity components (not plotted) which along with the track position components were provided as initial bomb conditions to the ballistic computer (Bomb Trajectory Group). ===Bomb Trajectory Group=== The Bomb Trajectory Group (BTG) was the AN/MSQ-77's analog ballistic computer using 3-dimensional double-integration to continually predict the bomb impact point from an aircraft track during a bomb run. The Cartesian aircraft data were propagated by the BTG mathematical modeling which included aerodynamics for different bombs, Earth \\"curvature and Coriolis corrections\\", and vacuum tube integrating amplifiers. The integration was based on the varying aircraft position and velocity prior to the bomb release, so as with the use of the Norden bombsight analog computer in World War II, a nearly steady bomb run was required for the AN/MSQ-77 to provide sufficient bombing accuracy. As in the 1950s Nike missile guidance system(s), electro-mechanical servos controlled sine/cosine resolvers in a feedback loop for computing the simulated bomb's horizontal velocity and along with the drop rate, the simulated bomb's airspeed and dive angle (\\"Pitch Servo\\"). Likewise, a \\"Z servo\\" allowed the Air Resistance Circuits to adjust for altitude-varying air density, and the drag aerodynamics were vectorized by a servo operating potentiometers to pick-off 3 bomb-specific deceleration voltages based on each cartesian velocity voltage. ===Ground directed bombing=== The AN/MSQ-77 radar track began after the aircraft (A/C) arrived near the Initial Point (IP) on a heading toward the target. When the computer's groundspeed and elevation rate servos had stabilized to the A/C cartesian velocity from the differentiating amplifiers, an operator placed the central into \\"computer track\\" to provide rate-aided tracking signals to the radar. With the computer track and the central having target position, A/C heading, & bomb type information; and with the Bomb Trajectory Group's servos tracking the bomb-in-aircraft course and pitch, the operator then activated the BTG integrators for the computer simulation to begin integrating a bomb trajectory from the A/C coordinates at that integration start point. Acceleration voltages from the BTG dynamic models were double-integrated by the 6 computer amplifiers which generated 3 voltages for the simulated bomb displacement (altitude, north, & east deltas) which were summed to the A/C position (simulated bomb release point, BRP). Use of the continually-changing current A/C position as the simulated BRP ensured a more accurate Earth Curvature Correction (ECC) was generated for the simulated bomb's horizontal range from the radar. When the simulated bomb's altitude (simulated BRP altitude - integrated altitude delta + altitude ECC) equalled the target height, the integration automatically stopped and the integrated displacements were held as constant altitude, north, and east delta voltages. Subsequent summing of more current simulated bomb release points (A/C bomb run positions after the integration ended) with the integrator deltas generated a path of simulated bomb impact (SBI) points that moved relative to the A/C position throughout the remainder of the bomb run. The latest SBI was the AN/MSQ-77's best estimate of the impact position if bomb release was from the current A/C position: The AN/MSQ-77 control algorithm continually commanded the A/C so the BTG simulated bomb impact point, which was plotted separately from the A/C track, would move toward the target. While the A/C was being guided, an AN/MSQ-77 bomb release algorithm used a model for the future path of simulated bomb impact points to predict the nearest impact to the target (a No Go condition aborted before effecting an outlying bomb release). Instead of releasing from the A/C position corresponding to the nearest predicted impact point, the AN/MSQ-77 began the bomb release sequence just prior, which accounted for the delay in generating the radio command, in transmitting the command, and in the A/C effecting the mechanical release. The delay time was based on calibration testing of the AN/MSQ-77 with A/C bomb release circuity (e.g., mean bomb release time for salvo drops from B-52s). ===Accuracy=== Although the 1967 Commando Club missions against North Vietnam by the 7th Air Force were temporarily suspended due to successful enemy defenses on November 18, the AN/MSQ-77 variant at LS-85 had effected a direct hit (zero miss distance) as well as a miss‚Äîits Commando Club CEP through November 16 for \\"14 runs was 867 feet\\". The suspension period for modifying attack tactics was used to reduce GDB errors of LS-85 since other Skyspot sites had been more accurate. AN/MSQ-77 errors included the typical automatic tracking radar errors such as the antenna lag due to the conical scan tracking, Track Range Computer error, any inaccuracy of the A/C transponder delay value used by the central, and the range offset of the A/C transponder antenna from the actual position of the bomb release point(s) on the A/C (particularly negligible when the radar was tracking from the side of the A/C). The AN/MSQ-77 compensation for antenna lag during rate-aided computer track used a telescopic CCTV system with operator's joystick to aim the antenna axis toward the A/C (e.g., bomb bay section of the fuselage). Additional AN/MSQ-77 errors were in the bomb trajectory algorithm (e.g., different simulation rates for each of 6 integrating amplifiers) and in the bomb release algorithm. ==References== Category:1965 in military history Category:1990 in military history Category:1990 disestablishments Category:Analog computers Category:Aviation ground support equipment Category:Cold War military computer systems of the United States Category:Ballistics Category:Ground radars Category:History of the United States Air Force Category:Military equipment of the Vietnam War Category:Radars of the United States Air Force ","title":"Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central"},{"id":"35901937","text":"Bernarr \\"Bill\\" Notley (31 August 1918 ‚Äì 22 January 2019) was an English cricketer.

Mobilization of forces from occupied territories was illegal. The USSR considered the forcibly occupied Baltics to be Soviet territory and its inhabitants Soviet citizens. Deserting or defecting was treated as an act of treason. From that moment on he spent more than 50 years hiding from the authorities and strangers. Only his brothers and sister knew he was even alive. At first he lived in the forest, but with cold weather setting in, he fitted out a hidden underground bunker for himself on the farm of some relatives. In the 1950s, these relatives built a new house, leaving their old one derelict, that becoming another sanctuary for hiding from strangers. He came out into the yard during the day only when his neighbors couldn't see him. He also helped his brothers with farm work, as well as picking mushrooms and berries in the forest‚Äîall of which he did only by the cover of night, having constructed a number of bunkers in the forest to help him stay hidden. Once he accidentally wandered into the parish center and met a man at the bus stop who said that he knew Pƒ´nups, but couldn't remember his name. Pƒ´nups fled immediately--the incident made him even more cautious because, after a quarter of a century, he had been convinced no one would remember him. As late as the 1980s, when Pƒ´nups dislocated his ankle, he sought medical assistance under an assumed name. He spent his last two decades in hiding being particularly cautious. Remaining in hiding became increasingly difficult after his brothers died and only his sister Veronika was left alive. Nor was he able to continue to assist or stay with her after her curious neighbors inquired as to who it was that was visiting her. == Independence == Aware that Latvia had regained its independence in 1991, Pƒ´nups nevertheless remained in hiding because of the former Soviet, now Russian, occupational forces which still remained in Latvia. Only six months after Russian forces evacuated Latvian territory could Pƒ´nups finally raze his forest bunkers and, at the age of 70, appear at the Pelƒìƒçi parish police station to announce that he had been hiding from the government in the surrounding woods for the last 50 years. He was officially granted his Latvian citizenship and moved in to live with his sister, who had no other family. Initially he was only awarded social welfare (approximately 25 lats per month) as the Ministry of Welfare considered him ineligible for a pension, however, this was later changed to recognize his service to the Latvian nation.

With Chengdu as his capital, he ruled for 12 years before dying in battle on 24 December 36. His empire surrendered to Eastern Han forces the next day. == Early life and career == Gongsun Shu was born into a family of officials in Youfufeng (Âè≥Êâ∂È¢®, present day Xingping) during the Western Han dynasty; his precise year of birth is unknown. His courtesy name was Ziyang (). His father, Gongsun Ren, served as an imperial clerk in the Censorate in the court of Emperor Ai of Han, and was later appointed Governor of Henan Commandery (modern Luoyang). His father's high position entitled Shu to entry into officialdom as a gentleman cadet. When Gongsun Shu was appointed magistrate of Qingshui County in Tianshui Commandery, his father was worried about his inexperience and sent one of his subordinates to advise him, but the officer returned only a month later, saying Shu did not need help. His capability was recognized by his superior, the Governor of Tianshui, who made him the head of four more counties. His ability to maintain order earned him a reputation throughout the commandery. After Wang Mang usurped the Han throne and established the Xin dynasty, in about 15 AD he appointed Gongsun Shu the Governor of Daojiang (Â∞éÊ±ü, the former Shu Commandery of Han), with its capital at Linqiong, near Chengdu. Gongsun held the position until the forces of the Gengshi Emperor overthrew the Xin dynasty in 23 AD. == As Emperor of Chengjia == As the Xin dynasty was facing a large number of rebellions, Gongsun proclaimed himself to be the King of Shu () and in 25 asserted independence by adopting the title of Emperor of Chengjia while adopting the era name of Longxing (ÈæçËàà, \\"Dragon Rising). As ruler of Chengjia, Gongsun Shu built an imperial palace and created a bureaucracy to oversee the administration of his new empire. He controlled the entirety of the former Yi Province, an economically prosperous region that allowed Gongsun Shu to build and supply a large military force. In 26, Gongsun Shu sent general Hou Dan to conquer the region of Hanzhong north of Sichuan in southern Shaanxi along the Han River. In 33 Gongsun Shu sent generals Tian Rong () and Yan Cen () down the Three Gorges of the Yangtze to conquer the Nan Commandery in modern Hubei but did not advance far. == Death == In 35, Emperor Guangwu ordered an army to conquer Chengjia. When the Han forces entered Sichuan, Guangwu offered Gongsun Shu terms of surrender, which Gongsun refused. The campaign was slow and difficult and lasted more than a year. In December 36, Han forces under generals Wu Han and Zang Gong reached Chengdu with only a week's supplies left. They were on the verge of accepting failure and withdrawing, when Gongsun Shu personally led an attack on the Han forces on 24 December. Wounded in the battle, he died in the night, and the defenders of Chengdu under general Yan Cen surrendered the following day, marking the end of Chengjia. After entering Chengdu, Wu Han ordered the massacre of Gongsun Shu's wife, children, and other relatives, as well as Yan Cen and his family. == See also == * Baidicheng == References  Further reading == * Category:Han dynasty warlords Category:36 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Chinese emperors Category:Politicians from Shaanxi Category:Xin dynasty Category:Political office-holders in Sichuan Category:1st-century Chinese monarchs ","title":"Gongsun Shu"},{"id":"35902178","text":"Louden Coal Camp was an unincorporated community and coal town located in Whitley County, Kentucky, United States. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Whitley County, Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky Category:Coal towns in Kentucky ","title":"Louden Coal Camp, Kentucky"},{"id":"35902185","text":"Isidore Charles \\"Toby\\" Nollet (November 18, 1898 - April 29, 1988) was an American-born rancher and political figure in Saskatchewan.

It often causes temperature evolution's and deep burials. Tectonic burial is usually the result of continental collisions or subduction in a region. An increase in burial depth leads to a weakened basin and basement but creates better preservation structure within the basement. == Geologic Processes  Sedimentary Burial === Sedimentary burial diagram Sedimentary burial is more typical when thinking of burial processes. Sedimentary burial is the deposition of sediments on and area of interest such as a sedimentary basin, oceans, or other locations typically leading to Diagenesis. === Tectonic Burial === Tectonic Burial specifically refers to burial of material on a area of interest as a result of tectonic processes such as a Thrust fault or other processes of crustal thickening. Tectonic burial is common in orogenic systems such as mountain belts or collisional zones. This is a critical part of the rock cycle and can lead to burial metamorphism and heating. == Evidence for tectonic burial  Radiometric Dating === One way of identifying a tectonic burial event is through radiometric dating. Burial events may be radiometric dated by looking at the cooling of the event and its impact on the minerals within the formation. === Metamorphism === When rocks or sediments get buried they begin to increase in temperature and pressure as the mass above accumulates. Metamorphism occurs at temperatures greater than 200 ¬∞C and pressures greater than 300 MPa. Burial metamorphism overlaps with diagenesis with an increase in pressure and temperature. Sedimentary rocks buried at depths of a couple kilo meters will begin generating temperatures above 300 ¬∞C without differential stress. === Thermochronology === Tectonic burial events can be distinguished by Thermochronology. During a tectonic burial event rocks increase in heat until they reach their Closure temperature . These closure temperatures are an indication of burial depth history and are used by thermochronogists in dating a tectonic burial event. === Vitrinite Reflectance === Sediment deposition over a basin with organic material can create a primary component of coal, Vitrinite. High temperatures and pressures associated with Tectonic burial could produce vitrinite from woody organic material thus the presence of vitrinite may be a good indicator for a tectonic burial event. == Effects  Coalification === It has been debated that burial depth may play a role into the advancement of coalification. Early in the 19th century it was thought to be caused purely by the pressure caused by burial, in some coal fields high ranking coal was found that made some geologists think that burial pressure increased the coalification rate. === Oil === Oil can be another product of tectonic burial. Oil is created in this fashion over a series of steps starting with the deposition of carbonate sediments followed by cracking and multiple stages of filling of oil like inclusions. === Pressure- Temperature-Time paths === One of the largest effects that tectonic burial has is a change in the pressure-temperature time paths, this can be identified by looking for metamorphism or by using thermochronology. Burial of greater depths have the ability to reset fission track dates. == Examples  Tectonic burial in southern Apennines. === In the southern Apennines fold and thrust belts, indicators record timing of exhumation of sedimentary units. === Tectonic burial in the Persian Gulf. === Evidence for the timing of diagenesis and oil migration. === Tectonic burial and Coal production. === Tectonic burial and its relationship to the advancement of coalification. ==References== Category:Tectonics ","title":"Tectonic burial"},{"id":"35902410","text":"Sir Stanley James Gunn Fingland (19 December 1919 ‚Äì 20 January 2003) was a British diplomat who was High Commissioner to Sierra Leone, Ambassador to Cuba and High Commissioner to Kenya. ==Career== Stanley James Gunn Fingland was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh.

The tornado damaged many towns along its path, but its most significant destructive effect occurred at the town of Hallam. The Hallam tornado is recognized by NOAA as the second-largest tornado on record, peaking at wide at Hallam. ==Tornado sequence== Path of the Hallam tornado. Damage near Norris School. The Hallam tornado formed west and northwest of Daykin at 7:30 pm CDT as an F1 on the Fujita Scale (the EF scale had not been established yet in 2004). One satellite tornado, rated an F1 in intensity, formed and quickly dissipated northeast of town. The main storm turned and traveled east- northeast from Daykin to a point south-southeast of Western and then to about north of Swanton. During this time, the tornado fluctuated between an F0/1 and intensified. The only damage reported in the area was to farmhouses and silos. The tornado remained confined within the F0-1 range until it hit southern Wilber, where it became an F2. The damage here was slight, with only roofs blown off. The tornado continued east-northeast, grazing the east side of Wilber as it moved towards Clatonia. Here it is estimated that the tornado was an F3. After passing just northwest of Clatonia, the tornado moved through Hallam at 8:35 pm CDT, where damage reached a high-end F4 in intensity. At Hallam, the tornado was a record-breaking wide (the widest tornado ever recorded at the time). Most houses in Hallam were completely demolished, along with farming equipment and structures. A coal train was tossed off its tracks on the west side of town. Hallam escaped the most intense winds of the storm though, which were to the south. East of Hallam, the tornado was rated a F2-3 as it turned east and began to cycle. It decreased in size to just about a mile wide as it passed north of Cortland, where it turned northeast and passed north of Firth. Norris School District 160 suffered severe damage, with the middle school being hit the worst. The auditorium roof and other walls within the school caved in. Buses were tossed and homes northeast of the school were flattened. At this point, the storm regained intensity, reaching F4 status. Damage continued northeast to Holland and to a point north-northwest of Panama. Here, tornado damage was light ‚Äì F2 at best. The tornado then tracked north-northeast to Bennet, where some houses received F3 tornadic damage. At Bennet, the twister turned east-northeast and began to thin out. Damage east- northeast of Bennet was within the F0/1 scale. The tornado finally dissipated a mile west-southwest of Palmyra at 9:10 pm Central Daylight Time. ==Damage== The storm was long-lived, having been on the ground for more than 100 minutes. It was also a long-track tornado, covering .NOAA, May 2004 Hallam NE Tornado Damage Survey Although it damaged towns and demolished many buildings, there were no damage-cost estimates available.

Retrieved on 22 May 2012. and it is the largest species of beetle in Chile. The beetle is endemic to central Chile and can be found from IV Coquimbo Region to IX La Araucan√≠a Region. ==Range== The species is endemic to Chile, and can be found from the south of the Region of Coquimbo to the Malleco Province in the Region of Araucan√≠a. It can be found from sea level to the Precordillera hills. ==Conservation== In its native habitat in Chile the insect is vulnerable to habitat destruction from logging and construction. Due to its large size, the beetle is also vulnerable to being caught and killed by people, exacerbating the danger of extinction. ==Description== The male (left) is smaller and lighter colored than the female. The species has a particularly marked sexual dimorphism, which originally led naturalists to classify the male and female as distinct species. The male measures 5-6 cm, is light brown and clearly differs from the female. The female is black and measures between 8-9 cm on average, although specimens exceeding 12 cm in length have also been found. The male is nocturnal and can fly, but the female is diurnal and does not fly. ==Life cycle== The life cycle of A. cumingii has been little studied. The females lay more than 100 white eggs resembling grains of rice in the dry trunks of trees and in decomposing vegetation. The length of time between eggs and adulthood can take six years, depending on humidity and food availability. Larva can reach sizes as large as 13 cm in length. For this reason the common name of the insect is \\"the mother of the snake\\" in Spanish. The insect plays an important ecosystem role in decomposition of dead wood. The larval stage has been found living in approximately 30 species of trees, both indigenous and invasive. This includes Eucalyptus which is an invasive tree in Chile. The insects are occasionally preyed upon by mammalian carnivores, such as foxes. However, the strong jaws of the insect, used for eating wood, may provide a defense. ==Synonyms== *Acanthinodera cumigii Jeni≈°, *Acanthinodera cumingi Bleuzen, *Acanthinodera cumingii Elgueta & Cerda, *Acanthinodera cummingi Barriga & al., 1993 *Acanthinodera cummingii Arias, 2000 *Amallopodes scabrosus Blanchard, 1851 *Ancistrotus cumingi Angulo & Weigart, 1974 *Ancistrotus cummingi Cekalovic, 1967 *Malloderes microcephalus Berge, 1844 *Malloderus microcephalus Drapiez, 1841 *Prionus cumingii Hope, 1833 *Prionus mercurius Berge, 1844 ==References * Category:Prioninae Category:Invertebrates of Chile Category:Beetles described in 1833 Category:Monotypic beetle genera ","title":"Acanthinodera"},{"id":"35902736","text":"Ancistrotus is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

Graduating with a degree in mechanical sciences from Cambridge University in 1936, Crosfield was working on electrical lifts for ASEA in Sweden when war was declared. He joined the Admiralty, where with a team of mathematicians and engineers he was charged with developing sonar, to detect midget submarines, and new types of mines. In 1947, Crosfield founded J F Crosfield Ltd. (later Crosfield Electronics Ltd.) to develop press control equipment, beginning with the Autotron, that enabled magazines to print economically in colour. Following this, the company played a leading role in the introduction of colour scanning in 1958, phototypesetting and later the automated composition of pages incorporating pictures and text, a 1970s precursor to Photoshop. He founded Crosfield Business Machines Ltd in 1966 to develop and produce banknote inspection, counting and sorting machines. The companies won 4 Queens Awards for Technology and Exports. De La Rue acquired the Crosfield businesses in 1975. In 1971, Crosfield was appointed a CBE for Services to Industry. Though he was a board member of De La Rue, Baker Perkins and the Scientific Instruments Research Association until 1985, Crosfield found time to research and write The Crosfield Family, The Cadbury Family and, in 1991, Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947 to 1975. He installed an electron-microscope in his studio, using it to scan and image microscopic insect and plant life from his garden. He used these images as the inspiration for surreal but fascinating paintings. Crosfield was noted for his generosity, giving away most of the fruits of his success in his lifetime. He was widely read, a good conversationalist and always interested in the exploits of his large, extended family and his many friends and their offspring. After a short illness, he died at his home at the age of 96. ==Early life, family and education== Self- portrait by John Crosfield 1931, aged 15. Oil on canvas. Crosfield was the third child and second son of a family of prominent Quakers. His father, Bertram Fothergill Crosfield (1882‚Äì1951), was managing director and co- proprietor of the liberal dailies The News Chronicle and The Star, president of the Mid-Bucks Liberal Association and Clerk of the Meeting at Jordans Meeting House. John Crosfield's mother, Eleanor Cadbury (1885‚Äì1959), was a daughter of the chocolate manufacturer and Quaker George Cadbury. She was well known locally as a magistrate, elected as a Liberal to Bucks County Council, and for her work in local charities and political associations. John Crosfield was born at Grove Lodge in Hampstead, London in 1915, the third of six children. As the house was too small for his growing family, his father sold Grove Lodge to the novelist John Galsworthy in 1918 and they moved to Buckinghamshire, on the outskirts of Beaconsfield. From a very young age, he had a passion for making things. In the family workshop he made boats, steam engines, jigsaw puzzles and a cannon that he tested on the garage door. The shot went straight through the door and through his father's beloved Daimler. At prep school he and his friends built a model railway through the school grounds. At public school he built an O gauge model railway with a friend and with another friend linked two of the houses with a telephone line and exchanges for their respective studies. He played second violin for the school orchestra, but dropped music in favour of painting and model making. While his early schooling was idyllic, he was bullied and hated the bad food and harsh discipline at the Downs School, where he was sent as a border at the age of nine. The boys slept in three-sided huts with the fourth side open to the elements and here he contracted pneumonia followed by pleural empyema. He was ten years old and spent nearly a year recuperating at the Cadbury holiday home, Winds Point, high in the Malvern Hills. At thirteen, Crosfield went to Leighton Park School, a Quaker school in Reading, where his father had been head boy. He liked physics and maths and Crosfield chose to study engineering. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father had also read mechanical sciences. Crosfield was a founder member of the University's Gliding Club, where the flyers developed what they believed to be the first successful winch launch, using an old Buick they adapted for that purpose. Although Crosfield enjoyed Cambridge to the full, with parties, sports (rowing, squash, golf and gliding) and high jinks, he worked hard, noting he had 27 hours of lectures and workshops a week compared to 6 hours for some of his friends. He graduated in 1936 and spent six weeks in Munich to improve his German. Here he was shocked by the virulence of anti-Semitic propaganda, the thin and haggard political prisoners he passed building new autobahns and by Hitler's hate-filled yet strangely mesmerising radio speeches. On his return to England, he found that his reports of what was going on in Germany were met with disbelief. ==Apprenticeship and war years== After Cambridge, Crosfield joined the British Thomson-Houston Company (BTH) at Rugby as a student apprentice, where he worked in departments testing electric motors, turbines and generators, and in the drafting, design and estimating departments. Adjoining the turbine department, where the monotony of the production line exasperated him, was Frank Whittle's laboratory. Crosfield sneaked in to see the first prototype of a jet engine. Frustrated at being stuck for six months in the drafting department, Crosfield left BTH in February 1938 to continue his apprenticeship at ASEA, based in their headquarters in V√§ster√§s, Sweden. The summer of 1939 found him in Stockholm at one of ASEA's companies making electric lifts. He was on a painting holiday in the Sk√§rg√§den when he heard that the Luftwaffe had bombed Warsaw. After a false start he reached Newcastle by boat from Bergen and, as he had sailed in the Baltic, he volunteered for the Navy. He had to wait for his papers and ASEA gave him a job to install a newspaper drive at Manchester for Allied Newspapers, his first work on a printing press. Crosfield was impatient to get into the Navy, where he wanted to join a fighting ship. He explained his frustration to an acquaintance at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, who referred him to a friend in the Admiralty. In February 1940, the Admiralty assigned Crosfield to the Mine Design Department HMS Vernon at Portsmouth. The first assignment he completed was to design equipment for detecting midget submarines at Britain's harbour entrances. He was then charged with designing a magnetometer to measure a ship's magnetic field, but he realised that magnetic mines were useless against German E-Boats (motor torpedo boats) that were built with wooden hulls. So he started work on an acoustic mine that worked on the sound emitted by a ship's propeller. He had made a prototype and started testing it when Commander Brown called him in and told him to get back to the magnetometer. He ignored the order and, \\"with improved security\\", continued the development of the acoustic mine. This became an official priority after a British destroyer, which had been 'degaussed' and was therefore impervious to magnetic mines, set off a mine in the Thames Estuary. With the help of a mathematician and much testing he overcame the technical obstacles. In its first use in the Baltic Sea, 200 of the new acoustic mines sank 47 enemy vessels and the Baltic was closed to shipping for two weeks. One of his colleagues at HMS Vernon was his friend and future Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick, who built up a little organization which modified mines to meet new tactical requirements. Crosfield's superior, the mathematical physicist Professor Harrie Massey, asked him to do a special job for the Normandy landings. Crosfield and his team developed a new acoustic and subsonic mine. He was put in charge of producing enough of them for the RAF by 15 May 1944. He found that the four depots assembling mines were chaotically run. By commandeering a lorry to move parts to where they were needed, sending in his engineers to control stock and quality and convincing the manager of the Milford Haven depot to deploy eight of his secretarial staff together with six of the Admiralty's mathematicians on the production line, they met their target. The new mines were dropped by the RAF in the Kiel Canal, the Straits of Dover and the Western Approaches (Operation Maple and Operation Bravado), with the result that very few German vessels were able to reach and attack the invasion fleet. The Admiralty awarded Crosfield 500 pounds for his invention, and with this he bought his first house at Emsworth. ==Crosfield Electronics Limited (CEL)Origins=== After the war, Crosfield writes, \\"We worked on a number of research projects at ASEA, some of which seemed very good to me, but they were not appreciated by management and very little was going into production. I was earning a good salary, but I felt that if I stayed there my life would be wasted. So I decided to start up on my own account.\\" In 1947, Crosfield set up a laboratory in the attic of his house in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London to develop two new projects. He learnt that the commercial banks wanted equipment to automatically sort cheques to replace the large number of staff engaged in cheque sorting. He developed a cheque sorting machine designing magnetic characters that could be read photo-electrically. But when Barclays Bank produced a huge cheque they wanted his machine to sort and, as cheque sizes were not standardized, Crosfield realised it wasn't practical to continue with the project. Working with his first employee, Dennis Bent, who lived at the Crosfield home, the second project was a success. Magazines could not print in four colours and keep them in register (alignment) as this depended entirely on manual braking by machine operators. Quality was poor and paper wastage high. Crosfield's former ASEA manager and friend, Niels Haglov, asked him if this could be resolved. Crosfield worked out a photo-electric control system to do it automatically on web-fed presses, thereby improving the quality of colour printing and reducing paper waste from 25% to 4 or 5%. The printer of Women's Illustrated allowed them to try the new colour register control, dubbed the Autotron, on their rotogravure press. Although they \\"sweated blood for 18 months\\" they got it working and the word spread around the printing industry. Crosfield's first customer (1950) was The Melbourne Herald, and soon Crosfield was shipping Autotrons around the world. ===Press control equipment=== The Autotron spurred spinoffs: the Secatron (1954) for carton makers to ensure their pictures were centred; the Webatron for bag making machines; the Trakatron (1953) for the special requirements of cellophane and paper printers, and the Inkatron (1960) for sheet-fed offset presses. At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The Synchroscope gave machine minders the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop \\"speckling\\", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas. In 1966 the Heliostat, which applied an electric charge of several thousand volts to attract ink to paper, appeared. By then Crosfield had the support of a team of talented researchers, installation engineers, a production facility and sales and administrative staff. ===Colour scanners=== In the early 1950s Sun Printers asked Crosfield if he could design an electronic machine to do the job of retouchers (skilled artists who reworked the contact print of the film negatives so that a 4-colour ink process would produce a good quality print on paper). Sun was expanding its facilities for colour printing but, due to trade union restrictions, the company could not hire and train enough retouchers. Crosfield thought it a very difficult task, but Sun offered to pay half the R & D costs and Crosfield \\"decided to have a go\\". He built a new research team and rented premises at Old Street for the laboratory to develop the colour scanner. The first Scanatron appeared in 1958. By then CEL had a large back order for scanners from rotogravure printers in Europe and the US. Colour scanners became the biggest money earner for the company and Crosfield continued their development, launching the Diascan, an improved and cheaper model in 1965 and the enlarging Magnascan in 1969. This machine scanned a colour slide and had all the equipment and software necessary to adjust the size, form, colour and hue to get the desired result for the publisher. The Magnascan's launch at the Milan printing fair caused a sensation.The German printing journal \\"Druckwelt\\" wrote, \\"The great sensation of the Milan Fair was \\"the Crosfield Magnascan\\"\\". The company continued development of scanners, bringing out new models that improved the versatility, quality and productivity of earlier versions. High quality colour printing was now common in catalogues, magazines and newspapers around the world. ===Crosfield Business Machines=== Ten years after Crosfield's frustrated attempt to design a cheque sorting machine, the Scottish banks came to Crosfield and asked him to build a banknote sorting machine. The American equipment then used for cheque sorting could not handle the soft, light paper of used, sometimes sticky banknotes. In 1959, Crosfield set up a team of engineers at Fortress Road, London, and in 1964 they produced the first banknote sorting machines for the Scottish banks. He used optical character recognition and a new patented process for handling small, flimsy pieces of paper, called the 'Double curvature sheet feeder'. The banknote sorter was followed by machines for sorting and reading luncheon vouchers, postal orders and lottery tickets and for counting and dispensing banknotes. In 1966 Crosfield spun this new division off as Crosfield Business Machines, with its own management, offices, production and research in Watford. New equipment, built first for Nord West Lotto in Germany, coupled to small computers automatically printed out a list of prize winners and the weekly profit and tax liability for the lottery. Simultaneously a high-speed camera made a microfilm of the coupons as a security check. A few machines replaced hundreds of production staff. Another development, a sorting machine and 'garbler', first installed for the Dutch Central Bank, sorted good used banknotes from bad and bundled the good while shredding the bad, a task that formerly required a staff of thousands. ===Financing CEL=== Crosfield founded his company with 2,000 pounds of his own savings, but these were soon exhausted. His father refused to help, but his brother Edward and sisters Margaret and Rachel put up 2,500 pounds that saw him through the first three years, until he made his first sale of an Autotron. He relied on advance payments from customers and a bank overdraft to fund the growing needs of CEL, dipping into his own bank account for emergencies. In 1959 he brought his cousin, Ken Wilson, into the business, with Wilson putting up 10,000 pounds to buy 15% of the company and 14,000 pounds as a loan. Six years later, requiring further funding, Hambros Bank bought out Ken Wilson's shares and provided a further loan. In 1971, after Crosfield had rejected Hambro's proposal to merge CEL with Muirheads, the merchant bank Keyser Ullman bought Hambro's shares. ===Frustrated stock market listing and sale to De La Rue Ltd.=== In the spring of 1974, CEL, with 1,300 employees, was ready for a public listing on the London Stock Exchange. The company had increased sales from 3.6 million to 10.6 million pounds and profits from 0.2 million to 1.0 million pounds in the preceding 5 years. 85% of sales went abroad, with the US and Japan its largest markets, and CEL was a world leader in press control and colour scanner equipment. Bank borrowings had increased from 0.2 million to 1.1 million pounds in the same period and, although net equity had increased fourfold to 2.1 million pounds, the company required a larger capital base to finance production to satisfy the soaring demand for its colour scanners. The Stock Market crashed, the FTSE 30 losing 73% of its value, all new issues were pulled and the company found itself in a quandary: in this period of uncertainty neither banks nor Government were willing to make a loan to CEL. To ensure its future, Crosfield sold the company to De La Rue for 6 million pounds in September 1974. This proved to be an excellent investment for De La Rue. In 1988, just the scanner business of CEL made an operating profit of 21 million pounds on sales of 210 million. De La Rue sold the colour scanning business to a joint venture of Fuji and DuPont for 235 million pounds in 1989. ===Later years=== As a main board member of De La Rue through to 1985, and Honorary President of CEL thereafter, Crosfield maintained a close interest in the development of the businesses. At the request of the Chairman of CEL, he wrote a history of the company that was published in 1991 as Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947-1975. Recollections is more about the people who made CEL than anything else, reflecting Crosfield's essentially people- orientated approach to both research and business. His staff responded with loyalty and dedication, without which his venture would not have succeeded. In 2000, former CEL employees formed the John Crosfield Foundation as a charitable trust to assist young people in furthering their education in the graphic arts. ==Personal lifeFamily=== Crosfield married Geraldine Fitzgerald of Lockport, New York (1915-1987), where her father was a prominent surgeon, in 1938, and they had a son, Robin Braden Fitzgerald (b. 1939). After a lengthy separation caused by the war, they were divorced in 1945. In 1945, Crosfield married Edythe Miriam Bertinet (1917-2009) of Rockville Centre, New York and they had three children: Richard John (b. 1946), Eleanor Miriam (b. 1949) and James Michael (b. 1951). Their marriage lasted 64 years. She supported him in difficult times and she organised their active social life that they both so enjoyed. Crosfield had a strong sense of family. He corresponded with his mother from schooldays through to his first marriage and enjoyed frequent family gatherings. After his mother's death in 1959, he remained close to his brothers and sisters and their children and, eventually, to their grandchildren. On leaving full-time employment in 1975, he devoted years to researching, writing and editing two large family histories. These brought him into contact with distant relations, including the American branches of the Crosfield and Cadbury families. He published The Crosfield Family in 1980 (revised and updated in 1990) and The Cadbury Family in 1986.Extant correspondence with his mother and personal knowledge Richard Crosfield ===Painting=== Beechwood by John Crosfield 1931, aged 15. Oil and palette knife on canvas Ammonium Carbonate Crystal X 10,000 by John Crosfield, 1980. Oil on canvas Crosfield's youthful oil paintings showed promise. His interest in art was awakened by Maurice \\"Grassy\\" Field, his art master at the Downs School, when he was 11. By the age of 15 (around 1930) his landscape oils show the influence of Impressionism. His father, himself an amateur painter, thought that his artistic talent and interest in engineering would best be served in architecture. Marriage, the war, starting his own business and his growing family left little time for painting, but when he returned to it seriously, his art reflected the change in artistic values. He was very interested in the development of abstract art and a frequent visitor to galleries. He had seen a scanning electron microscope in a Helsinki research institute and, in 1975, when he had the money and the time to use it, he bought one from Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company. Crosfield was to be seen in his painter's smock at the top of Grove Lodge (his birthplace, which he had bought in 1965) preparing, scanning and photographing minute objects - insect parts, pollen, petals, crystals - that he subsequently reproduced in colour and in a much larger scale on canvas. Viewing nature magnified thousands of times \\"was like opening a door onto another planet.\\" Though he sponsored an exhibition at a West End gallery, he did not receive the recognition he hoped for, and he abandoned the subject but not painting itself. He continued to paint landscapes, drawn from his extensive travels, and portraits, mainly for the family, until he packed up his paint box for the last time in April 2007, at the age of 91. Though these later paintings demonstrated his technical skill and, given that he projected slides onto his canvas, were very realistic, they did not show the feel for his subjects that he had demonstrated as a boy nor the originality of the sometimes surreal paintings based on what he saw through the viewfinder of the electron microscope. ===Sailing=== Crosfield was a keen sailor who bought his first boat in 1938, \\"an ancient sailing boat for about ten pounds\\", shared with a Dutch apprentice like himself at ASEA. They sailed her on Lake M√§laren. He bought another boat after the war and he chose a 25-foot catamaran, Orlando, because a catamaran's speed, unlike a monohull sailing vessel, is not limited by its overall length. For four years he sailed around the Solent and Isle of Wight, with his family and any friend who might be aboard as crew. In 1962 he had a hankering for a larger and faster boat and was taken with a 38-foot catamaran that had won the Round the Isle of Wight race against much larger boats. Snowgoose had been built by the Prout brothers but, \\"they seemed to have no idea how to build a family cruiser.\\" Crosfield took a drawing board home and, using Snowgoose's hot moulded plywood hulls, designed her himself. The Prout brothers built Gemini and asked Crosfield if they could use his design for future customers. The Crosfield family sailed Gemini for ten years, first in the Thames estuary and the North Sea, and then in the Western Mediterranean. In 1972, Gemini hit a heavy object in strong winds off the coast of Corsica and was irreparably damaged. In 1975 Crosfield bought a summer house on the Salcombe estuary. For some years he sailed a Salcombe yawl. ===Quaker influence=== Crosfield's maternal grandfather, George Cadbury, was a prominent Quaker whose public works included the building of the model town of Bournville for his employees. Crosfield's paternal grandfather, Albert Crosfield, devoted most of his life to the Society of Friends, spending nine years as Chairman of the Friends Foreign Mission Association. Crosfield's family were practising Quakers, and every Sunday they went to Jordans Meeting. The Quakers, as pacifists, were conscientious objectors in wartime. They abstained from alcohol and both his parents had taken the pledge not to touch it. Crosfield writes about champagne parties at Cambridge and he volunteered for the Navy soon after the outbreak of war. And Crosfield was an atheist, who did not keep his opinion to himself. Yet he held in high esteem the perceived Quaker values of honesty, probity, hard work, a strong social conscience and simplicity in personal matters.Personal information Richard Crosfield Crosfield was a modest man. He bought most of his clothes at Marks and Spencer, he would travel only in economy, and he considered flamboyant cars a waste of money. Yet Crosfield was a generous man. After the sale to De La Rue, Crosfield set up a charitable trust with 75,000 pounds capital (closed in 2000 with its capital distributed to charities). Over the years he gave away most of his capital to family, friends and people he knew in need and to a large number of charities. These included the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and Dignity in Dying. Crosfield detested discrimination of any kind, and Crosfield Electronics hired staff only for their ability. Crosfield was a long-standing member of Hampstead Golf Club, as was the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The Club did not admit Jews, but in the early 1960s Crosfield put up his friend and neighbour Leon Smulian, who was admitted. Crosfield said, \\"I put an end to that.\\" The Crosfield home was always open to friends who were ill or in need. Sometimes friends stayed with them for months and, in one case, for two years. ==Honours and awards== *1971 - Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for Services to Industry. *1973 - Gold Medal of the Institute of Printing *1980 - Doctor Honoris Causa, (DSc), Cranfield Institute of Technology *2010 - Champion of Print, International Printing Exhibition (IPEX) Crosfield Electronics received Queen's Awards for Technology in 1967, 1972 and 1973 and the Queen's Award for Export in 1973. ==Publications== *The Crosfield Family: A history of the descendants of Thomas Crosfield of Kirkby Lonsdale who died in 1614 (Cambridge, England 1980, Revised Edition 1990) *A History of The Cadbury Family (Cambridge, England 1985) 2 Vols *Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947 to 1975 (Peterborough, England 1991) ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Hampstead Category:English businesspeople ","title":"John Crosfield"},{"id":"35902875","text":"Hans Ove Hansen (August 14, 1904 - July 3, 1994) was an American-born farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

During the takeover of the town, the militants killed five policemen, including a high-ranking officer, and one civilian. Two more soldiers were killed in clashes with militants in Loder. Over the next few months the military made several attempts to retake the city, but they were all repelled leaving more than 600 dead on both sides. By mid-September 2011, the military halted their attacks on Zinjibar and held positions on its outskirts. ==Battle== On 4 March, militants launched an attack against an Army artillery battalion on the outskirts of Zinjibar, in the small town of Dofas, overrunning it and killing 187 soldiers and wounding 135. 32 Al-Qaeda fighters also died during the fighting. The militants attacked the Army base with booby-trapped vehicles and managed to capture armored vehicles, tanks, weapons and munitions. The military reported 55 soldiers were captured while the militant group claimed up to 73 were taken prisoner. The assault started with a diversionary attack on one end of the base, with the main militant force attacking the other end of the compound. Several car bombs were detonated in front of the gates, after which the attackers entered the base, capturing heavy weapons and turning them against the soldiers. The nearby 115th and 119th Brigades, which the artillery was supposed to support, were not able to assist the battalion due to them also being under attack. At one point they were hit by artillery from the battalion base after it had been overrun by the Islamists. Reinforcements from other nearby military bases came too late due to a sandstorm. In the town of Ja øƒÅr, the militants paraded the captured soldiers. In the days following the attack, the military conducted air-strikes against militant positions around Zinjibar which they claimed killed 42 Al- Qaeda fighters. The Ansar al-Sharia group that took responsibility for the attack is believed to be just a re-branding of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to make it more appealing to the devout rural population. Three days after the attack, the group let a Red Cross team into Ja øƒÅr to treat 12 wounded soldiers and demanded a prisoner exchange with the government. ==Aftermath== Attacks continued during the next weeks, including a suicide bombing on 13 March, near al-Bayda that killed four soldiers and left four other critically injured. After this attack militants posted a video in which they announced the capture of yet another soldier, bringing the total number of prisoners they hold to 74. They demanded an agreement to free imprisoned insurgents in exchange for the soldiers. On 31 March, a large group of militants attacked an Army checkpoint in Lahij Governorate during the night, sparking a battle that left 20 soldiers and 4 insurgents dead. The attackers fled with heavy weapons and at least two tanks. Government forces later called in airstrikes that successfully destroyed one of the captured tanks, killing its three occupants. Another similar attack took place on 9 April, when a base near Lowdar was briefly overrun during a battle where locals had to join the military to help drive the militants out. There were at least 44 people killed, including six civilians, twenty-four insurgents and fourteen soldiers. ==References== Dofas Dofas Category:2012 in Yemen Category:Abyan Governorate Category:March 2012 events in Asia ","title":"Battle of Dofas"},{"id":"35902888","text":"miRthkon was an American avant-rock group based in Oakland, California founded by guitarist/vocalist/composer Wally Scharold. In addition to several album releases, they have also had songs featured in the video games Guitar Hero Van Halen (\\"QXP-13 Space Modulator\\") and Tap Tap Revenge (\\"Banana\\" was the Tap Tap Thursday Track on June 24, 2010). ==History== While studying composition at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Scharold self-published several CDs under the miRthkon name. These early releases were not produced as albums but more as archival compilations of a variety of Scharold's compositions and improvisations, including several early, less developed versions of songs in the current band's repertoire. These performances featured one-off bands made up of Scharold's fellow students including trumpeter Peter Evans and drummer Brian Chase of the art punk band Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Upon completing his degree, Scharold moved to Oakland to attend Mills College for his Master of Arts in Music Composition, where he studied with Fred Frith and Alvin Curran, graduating in 2003. There he met other musicians to form a band and perform his older miRthkon compositions, as well as collaborate on new ones. After starting with more standard rock instrumentation the ensemble evolved to include two guitars, two woodwinds, bass and drums. From this point forward the lineup has maintained this exact instrumentation, with a few changes in the line-up. With Jarred McAdams, miRthkon then added a seventh member, providing video for live performances and general conceptual design. The band recorded an EP \\"The Illusion of Joy\\" with the core lineup of Wally Scharold, Rob Pumpelly (The Flying Luttenbachers), Carolyn Walter, Dickie Ogden, and Nathaniel Hawkes. While searching for a regular second saxophonist, Scharold's Oberlin classmate Dave Reminick was brought in to record all alto saxophone parts. Weeks before its release, alto saxophonist Aram Shelton joined to form the first core lineup. Shortly after that Nathaniel hurt his hand and was temporarily replaced by Matt Lebofsky (MoeTar, Secret Chiefs 3). Lebofsky continued to perform with the band for eight months while Hawkes healed. During this time Shelton and Ogden both left the band, replaced respectively by Jamison Smeltz and Matthew Guggemos. (Guggemos also played in an earlier version of the band during Scharold's tenure at Mills College.) Hawkes returned from his injury and the debut album \\"Vehicle\\" was completed and released in 2009 on the Italian Avant-Progressive label AltrOck Productions. It was well received and was selected as an 'Album Pick' by reviewer Dave Lynch on the music guide service Allmusic. After a spate of local gigs and touring on the west coast Hawkes decided to take an indefinite break from music and Lebofsky rejoined as a full member. That summer the band learned a New Music composition written specifically for them and small orchestra for a performance in San Francisco. For that show Michael Mellender of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum filled in for Pumpelly on guitar. In 2010 miRthkon performed at the annual CalProg music festival in Whittier, California, along with District 97, RPWL, and Ambrosia (band). The performance was documented and is the core footage for their live DVD \\"(Format).\\" They also headlined the annual Switchboard Music Festival in San Francisco. In late 2011 Pumpelly left the band, and was replaced by Travis Andrews. On May 19, 2012 Pumpelly returned for a single performance to fill in for an absent Travis at UnderCover Presents production of Paranoid by Black Sabbath, a recreation of the 1970 album by over 50 Bay Area musicians. miRthkon performed Scharold's arrangement of the album's final track, Fairies Wear Boots. In 2013 the band released their second full-length album \\"Snack(s)\\" (also on AltrOck Productions) and toured Europe (including a headlining spot at the annual Rock in Opposition festival in Carmaux, France). In 2014 they went on a short tour around California opening up for Secret Chiefs 3. ==Style== Like most avant- progressive artists, miRthkon's musical aesthetic eludes easy categorization, its defiance of virtually all musical convention being the only unifying attribute. On their original Myspace page, influences listed included Albert Marc≈ìur, Anton Webern, Fred Frith, Meshuggah, Henri Dutilleux, Anthony Braxton, Slayer, Henry Threadgill, Muhal Richard Abrams, Igor Stravinsky, Samuel Barber, and Elliott Carter. However, more than any of these, Scharold has repeatedly made claims to the significant influence‚Äîboth musically and conceptually‚Äîof Frank Zappa. Zappa's influence is prevalent in the musical complexity of the compositions, but is also felt throughout the band's satirical presentation of a number of concepts involving a dense mythology underpinning the band's recorded and live material. These concepts were taken to an extreme on the album \\"Vehicle\\" and a thread of continuity is maintained in their live performances via the projection of dozens of short films and fake commercials created by Scharold and video/conceptual collaborator Jarred McAdams. Zappa's influence can also be found in the execution of the music itself. Scharold has stated in an interview that \\"when [he] heard [Zappa's composition] Be-Bop Tango and then learned that the entire song was a notated composition, it was an epiphany: take a rock band and use it like a chamber ensemble.\\" Every song in miRthkon's repertoire is fully scored in traditional and extended music notation, including fully orchestrated parts for the drumset. This approach draws on the notational practices of contemporary classical music, big band jazz, and thrash metal guitar technique, often incorporating many idiomatic techniques and employing the specialized notation standardized within each particular musical style. The process of rehearsing and recording the music is often done in the style of contemporary classical orchestral and chamber music, with a strong emphasis on ensemble interplay and dynamics. ==Current band members== * Travis John Andrews - guitars * Matthew Guggemos - drums * Matt Lebofsky ‚Äì bass, keyboards, vocals * Jarred McAdams - video, concept design * Wally Scharold - guitars, keyboards, virtual orchestra, percussion, sound design, vocals * Jamison Smeltz - alto and baritone saxophone, slide whistle, ratchet, vocals * Carolyn Walter - piccolo, flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, alto/tenor/baritone saxophones, vocals ==Discography== *miRthkon (1999, self-released, CD-R) *ruth-bikula phaze-ivy (2001, self-released double CD-R) *The Illusion of Joy (2006, self-released, EP) *Vehicle (2009, altrOck Productions, #ALT-009, CD) *(Format) (2012, altrOck Productions, live DVD) *Snack(s) (2013, altrOck Productions, CD) ==References * miRthkon - official website * altrOck Productions website for miRthkon Category:American experimental musical groups Category:American experimental rock groups Category:Rock in Opposition Category:Musical groups from Oakland, California ","title":"MiRthkon"},{"id":"35902894","text":"Chah-e Sabz or Chah Sabz or Chah-i-Sabz () may refer to: * Chah Sabz, Bavanat, Fars Province * Chah Sabz, Zarrin Dasht, Fars Province * Chah Sabz-e Bahman Khani, Fars Province * Chah-e Sabz, South Khorasan ","title":"Chah-e Sabz"},{"id":"35902909","text":"Chah-e Seyar (, also Romanized as ChƒÅh-e SeyƒÅr) is a village in Bandan Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

She was introduced in Fear Effect in 1999 and is most notable and remembered because of her controversial bisexual relationship in the game's 2001 prequel Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix. She was supposed to return in the canceled sequel Fear Effect Inferno for the PlayStation 2. ==AppearancesIn video games=== Hana is a freelancer of French and Chinese descent who was once a teenage prostitute and a member of a vast criminal organization known as the Triad. In fact, the Triad still claim her as their property, and it is in part to earn enough money to buy back her \\"contract\\" that she works such high-risk and high-paying assignments. Brash and edgy with a penchant for sarcasm, Hana is as skillful with her tongue as she is with using firearms and piloting vehicles, able to finagle or flirt her way out of many difficult situations but equally capable of solving problems with weapons if need be. In spite of a demonstrated level of sophistication, she is not above using sex as a weapon. Hana's close partner and male love interest is another mercenary, Glas Royce. In Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix, her friend and lover is Rain Qin, a female hacker with a past shrouded in secrecy who Hana discovered during a mission a few years before the story begins. ===In other media=== Hana and Rain as seen in one of Retro Helix ads Retro Helix gained some notoriety for a suggestive advertisement campaign in gaming magazines, hinting at a lesbian relationship between Hana and Rain. Director Stan Liu would go on to state in various interviews that Hana and Rain were not necessarily lesbians, but simply two women who in this particular instance had developed a physical relationship. In fact, the only scene in the game itself that matches the overt sexuality of the steamy ads is one where the two women disrobe on an elevator and embrace specifically to distract the male guards watching them on a security camera - most of the game is actually spent with the duo apart and talking via radio. Liu suggests that human relationships are not so black and white as to be reduced to categories, but often fall into a grey area. According to GameCritics.com, \\"Publisher Eidos may have played up the girls-gone-wild lesbo angle by having [...] Hana Tsu- Vachel and Rain Qin, straddling each other in their underwear for the print ads, but the actual game wasn't the promiscuous orgy that ads teased.\\" Hana also stars in two Image single-issue comics based on both Fear Effect games. In 2004‚Äì2006, German film maker Uwe Boll planned to make a live-action film featuring \\"sexy heroines Hana and Rain in a much edgier fashion.\\"Uwe Boll Buys Option For Fear Effect Flick: News from 1UP.com ==Reception== According to a review by GameSpot's Frank Provo, \\"Rain and Hana's relationship ultimately proves itself to be the game's tearful legacy.\\" GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos featured Hana and Rain in their article \\"Great Loves\\", despite being portrayed \\"in more of a 'hey dude, it's hot lesbians making out!' way\\", but noting rarity of video game female homosexual characters before them \\"so Hana and Rain's relationship, while at times gratuitous, was nonetheless quite interesting.\\" GamesRadar US called them \\"the sexiest lesbian heroines ever to appear on PlayStation.\\" In 2007, Alexander Villafania of Inquirer.net featured them on the list of ten \\"most memorable video game love teams\\", stating \\"just imagine Lara Croft and Joanna Dark making out in a video game,\\" citing the promotional posters. In 2011, UGO.com included the \\"hard-edged heroine\\" Hana on the list of top 11 \\"girls of gaming\\", remembering her for \\"hot body and unique style,\\" but most of all for \\"the suggestive ad campaign for Fear Effect: Retro Helix, which depicted Hana and her new... friend Rain Quin in some very suggestive poses.\\" PlayStation Official Magazine included Hana among the ten characters they wanted to appear in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, stating: \\"Consider these reasons for Hana‚Äôs inclusion: she‚Äôs a half French, half Chinese assassin; she‚Äôs packing an entire arsenal of inexplicably concealed weaponry; she‚Äôs locked in a battle for her soul with the King of Hell. See? Didn‚Äôt even mention the unzipped catsuit.\\" In 2013, Hana was ranked as the 28th greatest heroine in video game history by Michael Rougeau of Complex, who commented that \\"the fact that she's an openly gay protagonist makes her even more of a badass, even if that relationship is somewhat sexualized for a male audience.\\" In 2008, Ryan Ash of Gearfuse listed her as one of the 25 of the \\"sexiest video game babes ever\\", because \\"any game character who bares it all and isn‚Äôt afraid of a little carpet munching is a prime candidate for this list.\\" In 2010, GameTrailers included her on their countdown of the top 10 \\"babes who are out of your league\\" at number three. UGO.com included Hana among the 50 \\"video game hotties\\" in 2011, commenting: \\"We're all for a little girl-on-girl action, especially because the game's director wanted to make sure that fans understood that Hana 'swings both ways.' Duly noted.\\" In 2012, both Hana and Rain ranked 27th on the list of \\"hottest\\" video game characters by Larry Hester of Complex, and tenth on ScrewAttack's list of top \\"hoes of gaming\\", as well as placing at number spot on the list of \\"hottest female video game characters\\" by Kristie Bertucci of Gadget Review. In 2013, the lesbian scene between the two in an elevator was ranked as the 10th most controversial moment in video games Cheat Code Central, as well as the fifth lesbian scene in gaming by ZoominGames. On the other hand, Dave Meikleham of GamesRadar included her on the list of \\"game characters that deserved to die\\" for her possibility to die of fright during the gameplay, calling her \\"a big scaredy cat who has no place in the survival horror genre.\\" Anthony Burch of Destructoid criticized the prequel, stating that \\"instead of remembering Hana, Glas, Deke, and a supernatural crime story, gamers remember the absurd lesbian relationship between Hana and Whatsherface.\\" According to Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman, \\"Hana's homosexual attitudes in Fear Effect 2 raised a fair bit of controversy at the time, with some groups shocked at the flagrant sexuality on display while others simply hoped they'd get a little more action out of Hana. Sadly, the latter would wind up the more disappointed.\\" Adrian Hatwell of Voxy.co.nz devoted an entire page in the article \\"Brief History of Gaming Sexual Failures\\" to criticize the portrayal of Hana's and Rain's relationship, adding that Stan Liu \\"in fact he even back-peddled away from the one area where he might have been awarded some kudos - in actually depicting queer characters as positive lead roles in the game\\" to make clear Hana is \\"a hot-blooded heterosexual female that just chooses to go to bed with women sometimes,\\" a subject of \\"male fantasy\\". ==See also== *List of female action heroes and villains ==References== Category:Action-adventure game characters Category:Fictional assassins in video games Category:Fictional criminals in video games Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional American people in video games Category:Fictional bisexual females Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional prostitutes Category:Horror video game characters Category:Image Comics characters Category:LGBT characters in video games Category:Fictional mercenaries in video games Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Science fiction video game characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 1999 Category:Video game protagonists ","title":"Hana Tsu-Vachel"},{"id":"35903009","text":"Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia may refer to one of the following two sons of Ivan the Terrible: *Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1552) *Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582) ","title":"Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia"},{"id":"35903016","text":"Charmallaspis is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

On 12 May, the military started the offensive in an attempt to recapture all areas of Abyan out of their control. Over a month of fighting, 567 people were reportedly killed, including 429 Islamist fighters, 78 soldiers, 26 tribal fighters and 34 civilians. On 12 June the Yemeni army succeeded in retaking Zinjibar and Jaar, pushing the militants away after heavy clashes in and around both towns. The city of Shuqrah fell on 15 June, and militants retreated towards neighboring Shabwah Governorate. == Early advances== Over 19 and 20 May, 19 soldiers and 33 militants were killed in fighting in Ja'ar. On the evening of 23 May, militants conducted a counter-attack in the region of Wadi Bani, west of Ja'ar, during which 33-35 militant fighters and nine soldiers were killed. A military official stated that though the army was making progress in its advance on Ja'ar, \\"it was facing resistance\\" from the militants. Earlier in the day, the military managed to advance into northeastern neighbourhoods of Zinjibar. Although managing to capture several buildings on the outskirts, they were being harassed by militant snipers. On 26 May, the military pressed on with its offensive in Zinjibar, recapturing key positions in the Maraqid and Mashqasa districts on the outskirts of the city. The military stated 62 militant fighters were killed during the day while they suffered four dead and four wounded. 20 of the rebels were killed in the ground fighting and around 30 were killed when they were bombed by warplanes while trying to flee the area in pick-up trucks. Most of the dead militants were reportedly Somalis. Troops had also found the bodies of 25 militants killed in earlier clashes. At the same time, in Ja'ar, a roadside bomb destroyed a military vehicle on the outskirts of the town killing eight soldiers. Seven militants were killed in the fighting there. On 31 May, fighting was reported on the northern and western outskirts of Ja'ar where troops, backed up by local tribal fighters, assaulted militant positions. An air strike also hit an AQAP communications centre in the town of Shaqra, east of Ja'ar. ==Fighting intensifies== In fighting on 2 June, three militant rockets hit the headquarters of the 25th Mechanised Brigade, killing one soldier and wounding six others. On 3 June, after securing the outskirts of Zinjibar, the military moved into the central part of the city where heavy fighting ensued with the militants in the city center. At the same time, troops fought Islamist fighters on the western edge of Jaar. On 4 June, the military was closing in on the militant-held town of Shaqra, 50 km (30 miles) along the coast east of Zinjibar. Militant forces in the town were reportedly preparing for a fight. On 11 June, warplanes bombed areas to the north and the west of Jaar and the Army attacked a hilltop munitions factory overlooking the town. After hours of fighting the Army captured the factory. Fighting was also reported in the nearby town of Shaqra. ==Recapture of Zinjibar, Ja'ar and Shuqrah== On 12 June the Yemeni army succeeded in retaking Zinjibar and Jaar, pushing the militants away after heavy clashes in and around both towns. At least 28 casualties were reported, all but two of them being insurgents. Local residents reported vehicles carrying armed men, weapons and furniture heading east towards Shuqrah. The militants reportedly distributed pamphlets in Jaar apologising to residents for dragging the town into a conflict with the army and for the damage caused by the fighting. The governor of Abyan Governorate Jamal al-Aqel estimated that about 200-300 militants, including senior leaders and foreign fighters, had fled east and were being pursued by government forces. The Army reopened the main road between Jaar and Aden and vehicles could travel to the port for the first time in more than a year. The Defence Ministry said on its website that the Yemeni Navy had sunk 10 boats in which the militants had been planning to flee Shuqrah if needed. After two days of heavy battles the Army reported regaining control of Shuqrah on 15 June. At least 57 militants were confirmed killed, with most of the rest fleeing to Shabwah Governorate and the city of Azzan, one of the last urban strongholds of the militants. The adjacent province also saw intense fighting, with reports indicating at least 23 insurgents died on 14 June during clashes at gas facilities near Belhaf. Government forces have not yet announced their own casualty figures, as well as the civilian toll. On 17 June, AQAP peacefully withdrew from Azzan following mediation by local tribal leaders. However, the following day, the Army general leading the assault against the militants, General Salem Ali Qatan, was killed in the port city of Aden by a suicide bomber. Two soldiers were killed in the attack and twelve people sustained injuries. ==Aftermath== In the weeks after the recapture of the main population centers there were no reported incidents. The first major attack was on 1 August, when a group of around 20 militants attacked a police station in the former insurgent stronghold of Ja øƒÅr, killing four officers and injuring another. Three days later, a suicide bomber killed at least 45 people and injured more than 40 others during a funeral service in Jaar. Military officials and residents said the bomber targeted tribesmen who sided with the Yemeni army during an offensive against Islamist fighters that the government hailed as a major victory in June. Abyan remained quiet for the following weeks, despite major attacks by AQAP against the central intelligence building in Aden on 18 August, as well as the convoy of Yemeni Defense Minister Gen. Mohammed Nasser Ahmed in the heart of the capital Sana'a. The latter blast came one day after the government announced the death of AQAP number-two operative Said al-Shihri in a US drone strike. On 16 October a suicide bomber killed six local militia members at a checkpoint outside the city of Mudya in Abyan. On 19 October militants set off a car bomb at an army base in Abyan Governorate, sparking a heavy firefight with security forces. Sixteen soldiers and 8 militants were killed during the raid, while at least 29 soldiers were injured. A suicide bombing at a militia office in Zinjibar killed at least three on 16 November. In the beginning of December Amnesty International released a report on the fighting, accusing both sides in the conflict of \\"horrific\\" rights abuses and calling for an impartial government probe into events on the ground. According to the report, Islamic militants had set up their own courts and carried out \\"public summary killings, crucifixion, amputation and flogging\\". Ansar al- Sharia also \\"used residential areas as a base of operations, particularly in Jaar, thus exposing civilians to harm. The London-based watchdog also accused Yemeni government troops of using air strikes, artillery and mortars to indiscriminately bombard civilian areas, resulting in scores of casualties, including many children. On 31 January 2013, clashes broke out between Yemeni Army units and suspected militants in al-Maraksha, Abyan Governorate. By 2 February the government forces had successfully pushed the insurgents out of the town, killing 12 of them. At least 5 Yemeni soldiers and local militia members were also killed during the fighting. According to local sources, the militants moved to East Anwar, about 80 km from the regional capital Zinjibar. ===2015-2016 fall and recapture=== Al-Qaeda's fighters stormed Jaar and Zinjibar in early December 2015 and recaptured the towns, later declaring them \\"Emirates\\", providing civilian services, and establishing a Sharia court. In summer 2016 Yemeni government forces backed by Arab coalition aircraft and gunboats moved to retake the towns, and despite encountering \\"repeated suicide attacks\\" drove AQAP out of Zinjibar on 14 August 2016. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 2012 Category:Battles involving Yemen Category:2012 in Yemen 2012 offensive Category:May 2012 events in Asia Category:June 2012 events in Asia ","title":"2012 Abyan offensive"},{"id":"35903070","text":"Graham is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, United States.

Although the majority of their releases have been done through their own record company, Trust in Trance Records (which later merged with Phonokol), they have also released records with other labels including Transient. In addition to an extensive discography, the group has an extensive worldwide touring schedule. Astral Projection's most well known tracks include hits such as \\"Kabalah\\", \\"People Can Fly\\", \\"Mahadeva\\" and \\"Dancing Galaxy\\". ==History== A precursor to Astral Projection, 'SFX' (abbreviation of 'sound effects'), was formed in Israel in 1989 and originally consisted of Avi Nissim and Lior Perlmutter. They released a hit single in 1991 named \\"Monster Mania\\", which prompted them to start working on an album. Work was halted when they decided to travel to New York City and try their luck there. While Avi soon went back home, Lior stayed in the United States and in 1992 released the single \\"JBIE\\". In 1993, with Lior still in the US, Avi teamed up with Yaniv Haviv and Guy Sabbag and they released the single \\"Another World\\". In early 1994, Lior returned to Israel to work on his own material, with the rest of the members under their new label Trust in Trance Records. Their album Trust in Trance 2, reached number two on Israel best selling album chart. After this release, Guy decided to leave the group and the remaining members eventually changed their name to Astral Projection. In 1995, they opened their own professional sound studio. They have produced nine albums, some of them reaching positions on best selling album charts abroad. The most recent album is Ten which was released in 2004. They have released several singles since then. Astral Projection's tracks \\"Open Society\\", \\"The Prophecy\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Strange World\\" were greeted enthusiastically by Goa and psychedelic trance fans. The release of their EP Open Society was pushed back first from January 2008 to 2010. Astral Projection's website attributed this to a dispute with B.N.E., the label which they originally had agreed to release the album. The EP was finally released by Trust in Trance Records on September 7, 2010. Astral Projection ‚Äì Open Society The EP, Discogs. On February 10, 2010, the New Astral Store opened on Astral Projection's website, making virtually all of their music available for a download fee in MP3 or WAV format. Their EP, One, was released June 12, 2012 on TIP Records. In December 2014 they released Goa Classics Remixed, an album containing reworks of other classic Goa trance artists' tracks. ==Discography== *The Unreleased Tracks (1989‚Äì1994) (as SFX) * Trust in Trance 1 (1994) * Trust in Trance 2 (1995) * Trust in Trance 3 (1996) * The Astral Files (1996) * Dancing Galaxy (1997) * Trust In Trance - The Next Millennium (1998) * Another World (1999) * In the Mix (2000) * Unmixed Vinyl (unofficial) (2000) * Amen (2002) * Ten (2004) * Back To Galaxy (2005) * The Blissdom EP (11th Anniversary Limited Edition) (2010) * Open Society EP (2010) * One EP (2012) (TIP Records) * Goa Classic Remixed (2014) (TIP Records) * Let There Be Light EP (2017) (Suntrip Records) ==References * Astral-Projection.com (Official Website) Category:Goa trance musical groups Category:Israeli electronic music groups Category:Israeli psychedelic trance musicians Category:Psychedelic trance musical groups ","title":"Astral Projection (band)"},{"id":"35903085","text":"Hileolaspis auratus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Hileolaspis.Bezark, Larry G.

His poem Stolt Anne (ca. 1700), written in the Kviteseid dialect, became a popular folk song in Telemark. 12 verses were included in Norske Folkeviser (1853) by Magnus Brostrup Landstad and Henrik Ibsen, a relative of Hans Paus, paraphrased the poem in the drama Lady Inger of Ostrat.Francis Bull, Gerhard von der Lippe Gran, i Edda: nordisk tidsskrift for litteraturforskning, vol. 30. s. 21, 1930 The poem honored Anne Clausdatter, the owner of Borgestad Manor and a relative of Paus.

All of the camps practice organic gardening and farming and are certified by the Northeast Organic Farming Association. All of the camps have composting toilets, which they call Kybos, and campers and staff live in three-sided cabins in the woods. ==History== Farm & Wilderness was founded by Kenneth and Susan Howard Webb in 1939. The Webbs were influenced by Vermont philosopher and educational reformer, John Dewey. The first camp was all-boys and was founded in 1939 under the name Mehrlicht, meaning \\"More Light\\" in German. After its initial success, the name was changed to Timberlake, and a companion girls camp, Indian Brook, was founded in 1941. Later additions to the group were Tamarack Farm (a work camp for 15- to 17-year-olds of all genders), Saltash Mountain (co-ed, focused on hiking trips), Flying Cloud (for 11- to 14-year-old boys, originally borrowing the traditions of the Lakota people but later creating their own system of wilderness living in the manner of cultures from around the world; originally called \\"Indian Encampment\\"), and Barn Day Camp (for 4- to 10-year-old children). A program called \\"Questers\\" was created for those campers who wanted greater challenges in wilderness adventures. The program is based from Saltash Mountain (SAM) and on the trail for the majority of the session on a long trip. Questers have hiked the entire Long Trail (a two-session program), which spans from the southern to northern tip of Vermont. Other one-session Quester adventures typically involve both canoeing and backpacking as well as rock climbing or white water rafting. ==References *http://www.farmandwilderness.org/ Category:Quakerism in the United States Category:Summer camps in Vermont Category:Buildings and structures in Windsor County, Vermont ","title":"Farm &amp; Wilderness"},{"id":"35903333","text":"Chah-e Vali Mohammad () may refer to: * Chah-e Vali Mohammad, Sistan and Baluchestan * Chah-e Vali Mohammad, South Khorasan ","title":"Chah-e Vali Mohammad"},{"id":"35903341","text":"Derancistrodes vittatus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Derancistrodes.Bezark, Larry G.

Jeffrey is an American former college athlete and coach. He played college football at the University of Missouri for one season before transferring to Baylor University where he participated in both football and baseball. Jeffrey was also the first baseball head coach of Southwest Texas State University (now known as Texas State University‚ÄìSan Marcos) in their transition to NCAA Division I competition in 1985. == Playing career == Jeffrey was a standout athlete at Shawnee Mission West High School in Overland Park, Kansas. When picking the university where he would want to continue his football career, Missouri and Baylor were his first and second choices, respectively, even though his older brother Neal had previously been a star quarterback at Baylor. Jeffrey enrolled at Mizzou in the fall of 1977. He did not play during his freshman season. After backing up starting quarterback Phil Bradley during his entire sophomore season in 1978, he grew discontented and looked to transfer. Jeffrey called Baylor head coach Grant Teaff and was told he would have to earn the starting job, but he transferred anyway. Due to NCAA bylaws pertaining to transferring, Jeffrey had to sit out the 1979 season. He then beat out the other quarterbacks to earn the starting job for the 1980 season and guided the Bears to a Southwest Conference championship with a 10‚Äì1 record. The Bears reached a #6 national ranking heading into the 1981 Cotton Bowl Classic against #9 Alabama. The Crimson Tide, led by Hall of Fame coach Bear Bryant, won the game 30 to 2, however, and Baylor ended their season with a 10‚Äì2 overall record. The following season, Jeffrey's last, did not duplicate the success of the 1980 season. The Bears finished with a 5‚Äì6 overall record and tied for sixth place in the conference. Along with playing football, Jeffrey also suited up for the Baylor baseball team during his final two years at the school. In his junior year he played shortstop while in his senior year he was a left fielder. Once his college athletic career ended in the spring of 1982, Jeffrey was finished as an athlete. == Coaching career == Jeffrey graduated from school in the spring of 1982 and followed former Baylor football assistant John O'Hara to Southwest Texas State University. He served as the quarterbacks and wide receivers coach through the 1986 season. While at Southwest Texas State, Jeffrey also became the baseball team's head coach for the 1985 and 1986 seasons.NCAA Coaches Database. Retrieved on May 22, 2012. The 1985 season marked the school's first ever as a Division I member. He compiled an overall record of 60 wins and 52 losses in two years as the head coach. === Head coaching record = Later life and personal == Jeffrey earned his master's degree in education in 1987 from Southwest Texas State. He moved back to Waco, Texas and has worked at Time Manufacturing ever since. He has five children by his wife, Chris, and his son Ryan played football and ran track at Baylor.

The law was created through decree on 8 December 1931 by Reichspr√§sident Paul von Hindenburg. The Reich Flight Tax was assessed upon departure from the individual's German domicile, provided that the individual had assets exceeding 200,000 Reichsmark (‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥) or had a yearly income over 20,000 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥. The tax rate was set at 25 percent. In 1931, the Reichsmark was fixed at an exchange rate of 4.2 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ per USD; 200,000 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ was equivalent to $47,600 USD (). During the Third Reich, the use of the Reich Flight Tax shifted away from dissuading wealthy citizens from moving overseas and was instead used as a form of \\"legalized theft\\" to confiscate Jewish assets. The departure of Jewish citizens was desired and permitted by the Nazi governmenteven after the Invasion of Polanduntil a decree from Heinrich Himmler forbade Jewish emigration on 23 October 1941. The tax was used as a \\"partial expropriation\\" to seize the assets of Jewish refugees who were persecuted and driven to flee their homeland. == Historical background == The Great Depression of 1929 led to massive loan cancellations from the international banking system; this particularly affected Germany, which had an estimated foreign debt of 24 billion ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ in 1931, of which 5.25 billion ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ alone had to be repaid in the first half of the year. The German government limited free capital flows and controlled the exchange of foreign currency, while also implementing austerity measures and raising the income tax. These measures precipitated a wave of capital flight, and the Reich Flight Tax was intended to dissuade wealthy would-be emigrants from leaving the country. The idea that penalizing \\"unpatriotic desertion\\" (relocation overseas to avoid taxation) was not new. In 1918, the German government had passed the \\"Law against tax evasion\\" (, Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 951) which was repealed in 1925. Because of the increasingly precarious and dysfunctional parliamentary government in the final years of the Weimar Republic, a series of emergency decrees were issued in lieu of normal legislating through parliamentary procedure. == Decree of 8 December 1931 == The Reich Flight Tax was only of many other measures implemented by the \\"Fourth Decree of the Reich President on the Protection of the Economy and Finance and on the Defense of Civil Peace\\" (, published in the Reichsgesetzblatt 1931 I, pp. 699‚Äì745.): there were also regulations on prices, interest rates, the housing industry, social insurance, labor law, and financial rules, as well as gun control regulations and the forbidding of uniformed bodies. As a temporary \\"Measure Against Capital Flight and Tax Evasion\\", individuals who were citizens of the Weimar Republic as of 31 March 1929 and had moved or would move their residence abroad before 31 December 1932, the Reich Flight Tax would be assessed, provided the emigrant had taxable assets in excess of 200,000 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ or an annual income over 20,000 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥. The tax rate was set at 25% of total assets or income and was also applied retroactively. Taxable persons who attempted to evade this penalty could be punished with no less than three months imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The names of those abroad who evaded this penalty were listed in a \\"Tax wanted poster\\" published in the Deutscher Reichsanzeiger, and were to be arrested in the event of a visit to Germany. Any assets in Germany belonging to tax evaders who had moved overseas were seized. The law was supposed to expire at the end of the year 1932 but that year it was extended to 31 December 1934 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 572). == The Reich Flight Tax in Nazi Germany == The existing decree assessing the tax was substantially changed with the \\"Law Concerning Revision of the Specifications of the Reich Flight Tax\\" (), issued 18 May 1934 (RGBl. 1934 I, pp. 392‚Äì393), and was extended six times during the Third Reich and was amended on 9 December 1942 (RGBl. I, p. 682) to remain in force indefinitely. A major change included in the 1934 revisions was the lower limit for taxable assets was decreased from 200,000 to 50,000 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ (). The assessment means were also changed to the detriment of the would-be emigrant. As such, a much larger group of people were targeted by the tax. The tax, which was originally aimed at those who voluntarily sought to reduce their tax burden by moving overseas, instead affected primarily the Jews who wished to leave their homeland due to well- justified fears of violence, incarceration, and occupational limitations. Prior to Machtergreifung in 1933, the funds raised through the Reich Flight Tax were comparably small, amounting to just under 1 million ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ in 1932. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, the wave of refugeescaused by the government's rapidly escalating persecution of Jewsmade up a substantial part of the government's finances. In 1933, the tax raised 17 million ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥, eventually reaching a peak of 342 million ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ in 1938. In total, the Nazi government collected 941 million ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ in taxes through the Reich Flight Tax. An estimated 90% of these funds came from emigrants persecuted for religious or racial reasons. == Implementation == In order to legally emigrate, a \\"tax clearance certificate\\" () was required from the Tax Authority, certifying the payment of the Reich Flight Tax and other taxes. When individuals were suspected of intentions to emigrate, the Exchange Control Office of the Tax Authority could require a security deposit equivalent to the amount of the tax. A tight surveillance net was created to discover persons planning to flee the country: the Reichspost tracked change of address orders by Jews; freight companies were required to report moves; notaries reported sales of real estate; life insurance companies were required to report cancellations of life insurance. The Gestapo surveiled the letter and telephone correspondence of suspected individuals. Even upon payment of the Reich Flight Tax, it was not guaranteed that an individual could leave the country with his or her remaining property.

Commercial fishing operations are contracted out. Ancient Hawaiian fishponds were noted in the 1826 journal of William Ellis, the naturalist on James Cook's third voyage (1776‚Äì1779): Moli'i, along with Huilua, Kahaluu and Heeia are the only four original Hawaiian fishponds remaining on Oahu. Fishponds were used by the ancient Hawaiians for ocean husbandry. Each pond had a set of sluices that controlled the seawater flow and the fish available in the pond for harvesting. Moli'i had five such sluices, and three of the sluices were still in place in 1972 when the pond was listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu. This system of harvesting ocean catch was unique to Hawaii, and does not exist within other areas of ancient Polynesia. The wall which partitions the pond from Kaneohe Bay dates back to the earliest Hawaiian settlement of the land, and is traditionally attributed to the Menehune of Hawaiian mythology. The craftsmanship applied in constructing the wall is similar to brickwork, in that the gaps and crevices between the stacked stones are plugged with coral and smaller rocks. ==Gallery== File:Oahu-Moliifishpond-rockwall.JPGRock wall at Moli'i Fishpond File:Oahu ahupuaa.gifHakipuu on Ahupuaa map File:Oahu- Moliifishpond-toward-Kualoaridge.JPGFacing Kualoa Ridge File:Oahu-Moliipond- toward-Kaneohe.JPGFacing Kaneohe File:Moli ªi Teich.jpgFacing the Kualoa Mountains ==See also== *Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture Today's Staradvertiser (7 June 2017) has an article on oysters in Pearl Harbor that says Moli\`i fishpond's most valuable money crop now is oysters. ==References== Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii Category:History of Oahu Category:Geography of Honolulu County, Hawaii Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii Category:Fish ponds Category:Ponds of the United States ","title":"Molii Fishpond"},{"id":"35903574","text":"Grete Berger (born Margarethe Berg; 11 February 1883 ‚Äì 23 May 1944) was an Austrian-German stage and film actress whose career came to an end following the rise of the Nazi Party in 1933.

She began her education under acting teacher Rosa Roth in Vienna. She made her stage debut on 1 September 1903 in Berlin at the Deutsches Theater. In 1904 she began an engagement at the Deutsches Theater under theatre director and pedagogue Max Reinhardt where she performed in youthful character roles. In 1911 she performed with Reinhardt's ensemble in Sophocles's Oedipus Rex on guest tours of Prague and St. Petersburg. Other notable roles in Berlin included Puck in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the title role of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's drama Elektra, D√©sir√©e in Richard Beer-Hofmann's The Count of Charolais, Marikke in Hermann Sudermann's Johannisfeuer, and Rahel in Franz Grillparzer's The Jewess of Toledo.cyranos.ch Grete Berger.

Stellan Rye would also cast her in several other of his films, including several other horror films penned by Berger's then-romantic partner Hanns Heinz Ewers. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Berger returned to the stage. During the 1920s, she was cast in a number of films, including multiple roles in films directed by Fritz Lang.

On March 20, 2017, Smith was diagnosed with possible UCL damage in his left elbow, but no structural damage. He returned to California to seek second opinions with doctors, who petitioned that Smith would require surgery. On March 24, it was reported that Smith elected to have Tommy John surgery on his elbow, ending his 2017 season with the Giants. In 2018, he returned to action in mid-season and was used as a setup man and the closer. In 2019, Smith was named the Giants' closer. He was selected to the All Star Game in 2019 after he converted 23 of 23 save opportunities in the first half of the season. For the season, he was 6-0 with 34 saves (3rd in the NL) and a 2.76 ERA, and 96 strikeouts in 65.1 innings. ===Atlanta Braves=== On November 14, 2019, Smith signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Braves worth $39 million, with a club option for a fourth year. On July 4, 2020, it was announced that Smith had tested positive for COVID-19. He returned to baseball-related activities on July 26, and was placed on the Braves' active roster on August 6. In 2020, he was 2-2 with a 4.50 ERA in 18 relief appearances covering 16 innings. ==References * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:National League All-Stars Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Orem Owlz players Category:Cedar Rapids Kernels players Category:Wilmington Blue Rocks players Category:Gulf Coast State Commodores baseball players Category:Rancho Cucamonga Quakes players Category:Arkansas Travelers players Category:Salt Lake Bees players Category:Northwest Arkansas Naturals players Category:Omaha Storm Chasers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:People from Newnan, Georgia Category:Sportspeople from the Atlanta metropolitan area ","title":"Will Smith (pitcher)"},{"id":"35903620","text":"An elaborately decorated \\"ritual wine server\\" in the guang shape (; pinyin: g≈çng; Wade‚ÄìGiles: kung1) is a Chinese ritual bronze wine vessel, accession number 60.43, in the permanent Asian collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. It dates to about 1100 BCE in the Shang dynasty period. The piece is currently on display in the Arthur R. & Frances D. Baxter Gallery of the museum. == Description == This ritual wine server, referred to in Chinese as a guang, is a bronze, piece-mold cast vessel complete with removable lid. Adorning the surface of the vessel are three primary decorative animal motifs, including fifteen imaginary creatures cast in relief along the sides. The first animal depicted is apparent in the overall shape and design of the removable lid. Here a battle-horned beast dominates the wide spout, with its large head merging seamlessly with reverse-S shaped bodies descending to the base of the vessel. Under the spout, the beast's forepaws appear posed in a position indicating the animal is rearing up on its hind legs. The second animal motif is that of a taotie, a mask designed to look like a monstrous animal. The taotie cast into this vessel sits at the end of the lid, depicted with zoomorphic horns and a sharp, upward curved base. The final animal motif consists of a scaled, serpent-like dragon along the rear register of the vessel. This dragon is curved to look back upon its own tail and the front of the guang. In addition to these three creatures, small birds and dragons have been cast in low relief along the vessel's upper register and the handle is designed to resemble the scaled body of an unidentified creature with an animal face molded into the upper curve. Cast into the underside of the lid is a Chinese character, likely a signature from the vessel's original owner depicting the owner's tribe sign. This particular clan sign has also been noted within several other bronze artifacts dated from this period. For example, a \\"lei\\" vessel in the Shanghai Museum collection (H. 46.5 cm), recorded in Zhongguo qingtongqi quanji 3.83 (see also Jinchu yinzhou jinwen jilu erbian, Vol.3, p. 197). In the Museum f√ºr Ostasiatische Kunst K√∂ln is a \\"fangyi\\" vessel (H. 26.5 cm) that also carries the same emblem (Bagley 1987:137). A third example is the Metropolitan Museum of Art \\"zun\\" vessel (H. 39.7 cm), accession number 43.25.1. This has led some scholars to believe that this wine vessel may have been only one of several pieces designed by a single workshop for one influential customer. == Historical information == A comparable Late Shang Dynasty guang, Shanghai Museum Cast during the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600‚Äì1050 B.C.), this wine vessel is representative of the highly evolved piece-mold technologies developed within China's Bronze Age. Due to the large number of surviving bronze vessels from this era, scholars have deduced that this age in China's history must have been a highly developed state with strong control over resources such as copper, tin, and lead, needed to create the alloy bronze. Additionally, the Chinese technique of using piece-mold casting was considered extremely sophisticated compared to the lost-wax method used by other world cultures during their own Bronze Ages. During piece-mold casting, the object to be created is first designed as a model, and then enclosed in a clay mold that can be cut into pieces to remove it from the model. These clay pieces are then decorated or stamped with intricate designs before being fired back together, creating a mold for the bronze casting. For vessels such as this one, the central cavity of the container would have been created by placing a core inside the mold before casting with molten bronze. By casting the objects into molds already decorated with designs, craftsmen were able to use this technique to attain a higher level of definition than in any previously utilized casting methods. Furthermore, unlike many other early bronze wine vessels, guang have no history of prior ceramic prototypes, marking them as unique casts specifically from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Wine vessels such as this one were likely the property of a single owner and according to Chinese traditions of the time, the vessels would have been buried with that owner upon their death. This has resulted in most early Chinese bronze examples having been discovered in tombs throughout the nation. This particular vessel would have only been used for the serving of wine during rituals, particularly ones honoring the owner's ancestors. This is proven by the intricate designs of mythical creatures along the vessel's surface as these images were believed to represent mystical powers beyond the physical world. Stylistic similarities with other vessels excavated in the Henan province, suggest that this guang probably belonged to an individual from Anyang, the last capital of the Shang. ==Acquisition== This wine server is listed as being a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Eli Lilly to the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Provenance information for the vessel explains that a letter dated May 15, 1950 to W. Peat from Fritz Low- Beer states Eli Lilly purchased the guang in February 1949 for $8,500. ==References== Category:Shang dynasty bronzeware Category:Decorative art of the Indianapolis Museum of Art ","title":"Ritual wine server (guang), Indianapolis"},{"id":"35903624","text":"Route 340 is a long, mainly east/west secondary highway in the north-eastern portion of New Brunswick, Canada.

A disruptive physician is a physician whose obnoxious behaviour upsets patients or other staff. The American Medical Association defines this in their code of medical ethics as \\"personal conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or that potentially may affect patient care\\". These behaviors are also noted as causing adverse effects such as morale, focus and concentration, team work, collaboration and communication. Starting in 2009, The Joint Commission which accredits hospitals in the United States requires them to have a written code of conduct addressing this issue. This code of conduct defines acceptable, disruptive, and unacceptable behavior in the workplace. Along with these definitions of behaviors the Joint Commission also wrote ways to manage these behaviors in order to fix them. Simon Sebag Montefiore has reported a remarkable tendency for doctors to become tyrannical dictators.

Dutton was a left-handed batsman who bowled with his left-arm, though his exact bowling style is unknown. He was born at Tattenhall, Cheshire, and was educated at Oakham School. Dutton made his debut in county cricket for Cheshire against Staffordshire in the 1926 Minor Counties Championship. Prior to the start of World War II in 1939, Dutton made 73 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship. In 1936, he was selected to play a first-class match for a combined Minor Counties cricket team against Oxford University at the University Parks. Batting first, the Minor Counties made 251 all out, with Dutton scoring 44 runs before he was dismissed by Tristan Ballance. In response, Oxford University made 288 all out, to which the Minor Counties then responded to in their second-innings with 294 all out, with Dutton dismissed by Bill Murray-Wood for 56. The match ended as a draw. He made a second first-class appearance for the team the following year against the same opponents and at the same venue. The Minor Counties once again batted first, making 195 all out, with Dutton being dismissed for 26 by Ballance. Oxford University then made 307 all out in their first-innings, before the Minor Counties responded with 257 all out in their second-innings, with Dutton being dismissed once more by Ballance, this time for 34. Oxford University reached 146/4 in their second-innings, winning by 6 wickets. Following the war, he returned to playing minor counties cricket for Cheshire, making five further appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against the Worcestershire Second XI in 1951. Outside of cricket he worked as a solicitor in Chester, in partnership at one point with a firm called Mason & Moore Dutton. He died at Jersey, on 25 March 1999. ==References *Ronald Dutton at ESPNcricinfo *Ronald Dutton at CricketArchive Category:1902 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from Tattenhall Category:English cricketers Category:Cheshire cricketers Category:Minor Counties cricketers Category:English solicitors Category:Sportspeople from Cheshire ","title":"Ronald Dutton"},{"id":"35903850","text":"Macrochoriolaus elegans is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Macrochoriolaus.Bezark, Larry G.

It was developed by the Gro√ü L√ºsewitz-based plant breeder Norika.Luenekartoffel.de In 2010, it was chosen as Thuringia's potato of the yearOTZ.de Th√ºringer Kartoffel des Jahres 2010 in a public contest to which nearly 1000 consumers contributed, and in which Laura was second place. ==Tuber properties== The potato has typically a roughly oval form with shallow eyes which makes it particularly suitable for mechanical peeling. Its yield per plant is relatively high, but a good water supply is vital. When cooked, the tuber suffers from only very minor discolouring. The variety has a bright yellow skin colour and a medium yellow flesh colour. It also has a very long dormancy period and it normally produced for the fresh market. == Resistances == This variety is heat and drought resistant, as well as resistant to potato cyst nematode. It is also resistant to Pallida types 2 and 3. It has good resistance to foliar and soil-borne diseases and it also has good scab and blackleg resistance. ==Planting== Planting, using chitted seed potatoes, can be done at a depth some 2 cm deeper than normal since the plants are compact and easily lifted. To support irrigation requirements and nutritional qualities, Gala is also suitable for cultivation in relatively light soils. A protective dressing to counter Rhizoctonia is recommended. ==External links== * Amt f√ºr Ern√§hrung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten Augsburg Fachzentrum Pflanzenbau == References == Category:Potato cultivars ","title":"Gala potato"},{"id":"35904011","text":"An antiglucocorticoid is a drug which reduces glucocorticoid activity in the body.

JSTOR, doi:10.2307/3623064. Research on the Nuguria Atoll and the language itself is scarce; past research demonstrated that this language was at risk of potential endangerment. The language was only then classified as at risk of endangerment because it was still used between generations and was passed on to the children. However, recent research indicates that Nukuria is now most likely an extinct language. == Classification == Nukuria is a Polynesian language and a part of the Austronesian language family, which includes Tagalog, Marshallese, and Tongan. The Austronesian language family is a language family that extends throughout the Pacific Islands and parts of Asia.The Austronesian Language Family. http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/Ling450ch/reports/austronesian.html. Accessed 19 Oct. 2018. It is one of three major language families in the Pacific. The Austronesian language family ( not to be confused with Austroasiatic languages) is also divided into ten subgroups, one of which is Malayo-Polynesian.Blust, R. A., and Australian National University Pacific Linguistics. The Austronesian Languages. Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, The Australian National University, 2009. Nukuria is a part of the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup because of its southeast location to Asia. It is further grouped into Ellicean, one of the eleven Nuclear Polynesian branches. The Nuclear Polynesian language is divided into two major branches: Samoic and Eastern Polynesian.Ray, Sidney H. ‚ÄúThe Polynesian Languages in Melanesia. With Notes on the Neighbouring Melanesian Languages.‚Äù Anthropos, vol. 14/15, no. 1/3, 1919, pp. 46‚Äì96. The Nuclear Polynesian languages are classified as languages in this region that are not a Tongic language (Tongan and Niuean). == Geographic Distribution == Nukuria is a language in opposition to a dialect and it is spoken in the Nuguria Atoll.Regan, Anthony J., and Helga M. Griffin. Bougainville before the Conflict. ANU Press, 2015. It is alternatively known as the Fead Islands located in the Bougainville Province.Jerry Allen and Conrad Hurd. ‚ÄúLanguages.‚Äù Languages of the Bougainville District, Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1963, p. 56.

JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bgzbgg.10. Nuguria Island lies on the outer edge of Melanesia, making it a Polynesian Outlier. Polynesian Outliers are the islands that do not exist within the major boundaries of Polynesia, but instead they are within Melanesia and/or Micronesia. The Nuguria Atoll is located in Melanesia along with the Solomon Islands. == Grammar == There is a distinct scarceness of research on the grammar and alphabet of the Nukuria Language, but it is understood that as with many Austronesian languages, Nukuria has a subject-verb-object sentence structure. However, all of the Austronesian Languages within the Bismarck Archipelago have a subject-verb-object sentence structure.T his sentence structure (typology) is also used in the English language, which is a part of the Indo- European language family.Blust, Robert. 2009. The Austronesian Languages. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics ==Phonology== The Nukuria language's alphabet contains five vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/, and fifteen consonants: /p/,/b/,/m/,/f/,/v/,/t/,/s/,/n/,/l/,/r/,/k/,/g/,/≈ã/,/w/,/h/. There are five stops, four fricatives, three nasals, two approximants, and one trill. Of those consonants three are bilabial, two are labiodental, five are alveolar, four are velar, and one is glottal. To provide a comparison, the Nukuria Language has seven more consonants than the Hawaiian language ('≈ålelo Hawai ªi'): /m/,/n/,/p/,/t ~ k/,/  î/, /h/,/ w~v/,and /l/. It also has five consonants more than MƒÅori, (te reo): /p/,/t/,/k/,/wh/,/h/,/m/,/n/,/≈ã/,/r/,and /w/. Hawaiian and MƒÅori are used for comparison because they are two of the more commonly known Polynesian Languages. In addition, the English language has twenty-four consonants and at least fourteen vowels. The ≈ã is a voiced velar nasal and is present in the suffix \\"ing\\" such as in the English word \\"ending\\". It is the \\"ng\\" sound in the words: \\"laughing\\", \\"crying\\", \\"hiking\\", \\"jumping\\" and so on. These pronunciation of the vowels and consonants are derived from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), a standardized alphabet that demonstrates the different phonetics of languages. {   +Consonants ! colspan=\\"2\\"  !Bilabial !Labiodental !Alveolar !Velar !Glottal - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Stop !voiceless p  t k  - !voiced b   g  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Fricative !voiceless  f s  h - !voiced  v    - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Nasal m  n ≈ã  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Approximant   l w  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Trill   r   } ==References== Category:Ellicean languages ","title":"Nukuria language"},{"id":"35904135","text":"Fritz Richard (17 November 1869 ‚Äì 9 February 1933) was an Austrian actor.

Some say that Atahu was from an island called Tokelau, while others speculate he came from Tonga. But later, Sikaiana was invaded by Tongans, leaving many people who lived on Sikaiana dead. In the late 1920s ritual houses were burned and missionaries from the Melanesian Mission came to Sikaiana and completely converted almost everyone on the island to Christianity. They burnt down the ritual houses because they believed that people would still have faith in other religions if it were still there. The people were eager to learn to read and write since it offered educational and employment opportunities off the island, which helped contribute to the success of the missionaries (Donner, 2012). ===Population=== The Sikaiana language is a Polynesian outlier language spoken on Sikaiana in the Central Solomons, about ninety miles east of the Malaita Island in Polynesia. There are about 730 speakers of this language left in the world, a very low number for any language. ===Classification=== Sikaiana is an Austronesian language in the Ellicean family. Its sister languages include Kapingamarangi, Nukumanu, Nukuoro, Nukuria, Ontong Java, Takuu, and Tuvaluan. ==SoundsConsonants=== Sikaiana uses nine different consonants which are reflexes of the Proto-Polynesian language. The consonants include: /p, t, k, f/h, v, s, m, n, and l/. In most situations, /h/ and /f/ are free in variation, but in many words, only /h/ can be used (Donner 2012). There is also a length distinctions for consonants. This sometimes occurs as a result of a non-pronunciation of a vowel. For example, hahai changes to hhai because the first /a/ is simply omitted. Double consonants can also be used as a form of reduplication, showing agreement in verbs with plural subjects, or to mark repeated actions (Donner 2012). ===Vowels=== There are five vowel phonemes in Sikaiana which include: /a, e, i, o, and u/. The /u/ and /i/ are pronounced with the glides /w/ and /y/, usually when preceding /a/. Like the consonants, they are all reflexes of the Proto-Polynesian language. Vowel length distinction in Sikaiana is very important for proper pronunciation. The length distinction for vowels can completely change the word if not pronounced correctly. For example, the word for shell tool is aha, and the word for cyclone is ahaa. Such a slight difference in the pronunciation can make a big difference on the meaning of the word, although some native speakers who were born after World War II don't know what the original forms of the words are (Donner 1996). ==GrammarBasic word order=== The basic constituent order for Sikaiana is subject verb object. Although the order may vary, this pattern is always used for short, simple statements. Object subject verb and object verb subject are not used in any oceanic language, which means that it will not be used in Sikaiana (Lichtenberk, 2012). In the Sikaiana grammar system, sentences that start with a noun usually do not lead with a preposition, but for noun phrases that follow a verb phrase, it may or may not lead with a preposition (Donner, 2012). As for nouns and noun phrases, there must always be a preceding article except if it is a noun of place, names, or free pronouns. The articles that usually precede a noun is either te or n The use of these articles makes nouns easily distinguishable from other parts of speech (Donner, 2012). ===Morphology=== Sikaiana uses extensive morphology to transform words to better express more complex sentences. Like many other Polynesian languages, Sikaiana has two types of nominal possession markers. There is an alienable marker which is a, and an inalienable marker, o. Pronominal possessive markers differ slightly. The alienable marker for a pronoun is 'ana and the inalienable possession marker is ona'. Pronouns in Sikaiana include singular, first person inclusive, first person exclusive, second person, and third person. In order to nominalize verbs in Sikaiana, the suffix ana is added to a verb to nominalize it. There are also length distinction morphemes used. For example, taku means my, and takuu means axe. ==Vocabulary== Sikaiana is very similar to the Proto-Polynesian language, so many words that are present in Polynesian languages are also in the Sikaiana language. For example, hale in Sikaiana means house, and the same word is also house in Hawaiian. ==EndangermentVitality=== The people of Sikaiana speak the Sikaiana language or Central Solomon Pidgin English. After WWII, many people from Sikaiana migrated to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands in search of jobs and education (Donner, 2002). This means that there was a decrease in the use of the language, since Sikaiana was not the language mainly used in that area. A decrease in the advantages of using the Sikaiana language increases the endangerment of it. ===Materials=== Although there is a decrease in the number of speakers of the Sikaiana language, there is a dictionary which was put together by Arthur Capell in 1935 which covers vocabulary, grammar, typology, and brief history of the Sikaiana language. It may be possible for someone to learn how to speak Sikaiana if they read and studied the whole dictionary. Some other sources are by William Donner, who visited Sikaiana in the 1970s and 1980s, and wrote many things regarding history, language change, culture, and emigration of the Sikaiana people. Most of Donner's work was published in the Journal Pacific Studies. ==Further reading== *Donner, W. (1996). LINGUA FRANCA AND VERNACULAR: LANGUAGE USE AND LANGUAGE CHANGE ON SIKAIANA.

Jack Ross was named as his assistant, and he remained in charge for their game that weekend against Dunfermline Athletic. ==Results and fixturesPre season=Scottish First Division=Ramsdens Cup=Scottish Communities League Cup=Scottish Cup=Stirlingshire Cup=Player statisticsCaptains= Squad === :Last updated 5 May 2013 } ===Disciplinary record=== Includes all competitive matches. :Last updated 5 May 2013 {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10%; \\"Nation  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10%; \\"Position  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20%; \\"Name  colspan=\\"2\\"First Division  colspan=\\"2\\"Challenge Cup  colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup  colspan=\\"2\\"Scottish Cup  colspan=\\"2\\"Total - ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#fe9;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#ff8888;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#fe9;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#ff8888;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#fe9;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#ff8888;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#fe9;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#ff8888;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#fe9;\\" ! style=\\"width:60px; background:#ff8888;\\" - GKJamie Ewings 1000000010 - GKStephen Grindlay 0100000001 - DFJames Creaney 5110100071 - DFNicky Devlin 3000100040 - DFRoss Forsyth 2000000020 - DFAndy Graham 4000201070 - DFJosh Horne 0000000000 - DFAlan Lithgow 5000001060 - DFJamie Lyden 0000000000 - DFPaul McGinn 4000000040 - DFKevin Nicoll 0000000000 - DFScott Smith 3000000030 - DFStuart Urquhart 1000000010 - MFScott Agnew 4000100050 - MFAdam Asghar 0000000000 - MFRoss Forbes 0000000000 - MFGarry Fleming 90000010100 - MFMark Gilhaney 0100100011 - MFPhil Johnston 0000000000 - MFMark Lamont 0000000000 - MFSteven McDougall 3000000030 - MFGary McKell 0000000000 - MFMartin McNiff 2000000020 - MFRyan Metcalfe 0000000000 - MFNick Phinn 0000000000 - MFReese Pearson 0000000000 - MFGlenn Thomson 0000000000 - MFChris Turner 80000031111 - FWJim Lister 7000001080 - FWMarc McCusker 0000000000 - FWBryan Prunty 3000000030 - FWOwen Ronald 0000000000 - FWPatrick Walker 0000000000 - FWRobbie Winters 0000000000 } ==Team statisticsLeague table=Division summary=Transfers Players in === {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\\" - !Player !From !Fee -  Jim Lister  Brechin City  Free -  Phil Johnston  Airdrie United  Free -  Andy Graham  Greenock Morton  Free -  Ross Forsyth  Greenock Morton  Free -  Steven McDougall  Dunfermline Athletic Free -  Garry Fleming  Irvine Meadow XI Free -  Mark Lamont  St Mirren Loan -  Nicky Devlin  Motherwell Loan -  Chris Turner  Shamrock Rovers Free -  Marc McCusker  Queen of the South Free -  Scott Smith  Hibernian Loan -  Mark Lamont  St Mirren Free -  Paul McGinn  St Mirren  Loan -  Owen Ronald  Queen's Park  Free -  Nick Phinn  Stranraer  Free -  Stuart Urquhart  Rangers  Loan -  Adam Asghar  Motherwell  Loan -  Robbie Winters  Peterhead  Free } === Players out === {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\\" - !Player !To !Fee -  Adam Monaghan  Queen's Park  Free -  Robert Connelly  Free Agent  Free -  David Gray  Montrose  Free -  Ryan Borris  Stranraer  Free -  Paul Nugent  Free Agent  Free -  Graeme Ramage  Annan Athletic  Free -  Kieran Brannan  Albion Rovers  Free -  Arlan Kadina Mptata  Free Agent  Free -  Arnaud Gastal  Free Agent  Free -  Tony Wallace  Greenock Morton Undisclosed -  Craig Dargo  Dunfermline Athletic  Free -  Grant Howarth  Beith Juniors Free -  Phil Johnston  Stirling Albion Loan -  Kevin Nicoll  Clyde Loan -  Jamie Lyden  Clyde Loan -  Martin McNiff  Annan Athletic Loan -  Ross Forsyth  Stirling Albion Loan -  Patrick Walker  Albion Rovers  Free -  Marc McCusker  Clyde Loan -  Gary McKell  Free Agent  Free -  Robbie Winters  Free Agent  Free } ==Factfile== The League match against Dunfermline Athletic on 23 March marked Mark Gilhaney's 100th appearance for Dumbarton in all national competitions - the 133rd Dumbarton player to reach this milestone. ==See also== *List of Dumbarton F.C. seasons == References  *Josh Horne (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) *Jamie Lyden (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) *Gary McKell (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) *Reece Pearson (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) *Glen Thomson (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) *Owen Ronald (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) Category:Dumbarton F.C. seasons Category:Scottish football clubs 2012‚Äì13 season ","title":"2012‚Äì13 Dumbarton F.C. season"},{"id":"35904227","text":"John Herrington is an astronaut.

A hockey player herself, part of her activity with the charity is to skate from one end of Canada to another in the space of five months starting June 4 until late October (estimated date October 21). == Skate4Life== The 2012 objective for her charity is to inline skate from St. John's, Newfoundland to Victoria, British Columbia. She began the trek on June 4, 2012 and plans to end it at \\"Mile 0\\" of the Trans Canada Highway, Victoria, British Columbia, in early October. The hope is to raise awareness and funds for Do It For Daron and youth mental health. Her motivation to start the charity and raise money for DIFD was based on the loss of a childhood friend to suicide in February 2011. Her friend, a university rugby player, had suffered a brain injury when she was hit by a car while jogging.http://www.emcottawawest.ca/20120726/news/Skate4Life+campaign+rolls+up+to+Parliament+Hill She prepared by training in 2011 for the journey. Prior to the beginning of her journey, she dipped a wheel in the Atlantic Ocean in Newfoundland on June 4. Her journey began in St. John's, Newfoundland on June 4, 2012. By July 1, Gilbank arrived in Fredericton, New Brunswick. During her skate through Eastern Canada, Gilbank covered 60 to 80 kilometres a day. In Newfoundland, she managed 100 kilometres in one day. Prior to arriving in New Brunswick, Gilbank fought the elements of wind, rain, heat, along with construction work. On July 18, 2012, Gilbank arrived at Parliament Hill, having skated through 3,000 kilometres of Canadian roads. She was met by supporters wearing purple DIFD shirts at Parliament's Centennial Flame. Celebrity guests included Do It For Daron founder Luke Richardson and Ottawa City Councillor Alan Hubley (representing the district of Kanata South). Both men have lost a child to suicide. Do It For Daron was created to honour the life of the late Daron Richardson. Gilbank and Richardson played in the same hockey league.http://www.emcnorthwest.ca/20120712/News/Break+down+stigmas+with+Skate+4+Life Upon her arrival in Ottawa, Skate4Life had only raised just under $2,000, with the goal being $60,000. On August 1, 2012, she reached the community of Hastings, Ontario, home to her grandparents. The nearby Campbellford and District Mental Health Centre helped raise $1,100 for her charitable cause. Due to fatigue, Gilbank was hospitalized on August 7, while in Ontario. ==Personal== At the age of 13, she was diagnosed with Acid Reflux Disease. She attended secondary school in Lindsay, Ontario and played competitive hockey. She is a member of the Kidsport Ottawa Board of Directors. In addition, she has participated in ball hockey in the Ottawa area.http://www.ovwbhl.hockeyleaguestats.com/index.php?go=playerpage&pid;=476&did;=0&sid;=22&tid;=40 Her husband is one of the campaign volunteers and her brother Andrew Gilbank helps out from Ottawa. Ashley's husband follows her in a van and assists to collect donations. ===Film making=== In February 2011, Gilbank, and her brother Andrew claimed that an ad that appeared during Super Bowl XLV looked like a pitch they had made.http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2011/02/07/pf-17188911.html The brother and sister are amateur film makers and entered the Doritos and Pepsi MAX \\"Crash the Super Bowl\\" contest, in which contestants submitted homemade ads for consideration. A video was made featuring her pet dog (a pug) barking at a window as he watches her brother eat Doritos. Her brother gets into a car only to find the pet dog waiting in the backseat. The Gilbanks claimed the video never successfully loaded on the contest website. The eventual winner made a video called Pug Attack and won $1 million. Their ad was posted to YouTube.

The film was directed by Rodrigo Casta√±o and features Christopher Lago and Ver√≥nica Castro in the leading roles. In 1987 it was released after Pope John Paul II's visit to Colombia. ==Plot== In a humble Mexico City neighborhood, a small boy named Angel lives with his mother, who is a homemaker and works as a seamstress. She really dreams that her son will study and someday receive a bachelor's degree. When Angel is at school, a strong earthquake strikes the city leaving thousands of people injured (or worse), including Angel and his mother. Angel was desperate to find his mother alive, he decides to walk a few steps until arriving at the Basilica of our Lady of Guadalupe, with the intention of praying for his missing mother. At the same time, Alicia, his mother, is helped by Carlos, a hospital doctor. As the boy leaves the church, he sees a large statue of Pope John Paul II, and a priest tells him that the next visit of saint father will be to Colombia. An hour later, he went forward onto the registration of missing people, and he realized that his mother's name would not appear among those found persons and he should be sent to an orphanage. Hearing this, he decides to flee until coming curiously to the airport, where he thinks it would be a good idea to take the next flight bound to Colombia with the aim of meeting the Pope. Arriving in Colombia, some flight attendants find him hidden in a bathroom of the plane and hand him over to a woman to take charge, but suddenly the boy escapes. The next day, Angel went to a food stand and he is seen by Carmen, who works as a saleswoman at that place. When she offers him a potato, he steals a piece of \\"black pudding\\" and he is caught immediately by the business owner, and when Carmen realizes he is attacking Angel, she intervenes on his behalf and eventually quits her job. Thereafter, Angel apologizes for bad behavior, until she decides to forgive him, then explains what happened with the earthquake and his mother and insists to stay in her home; she finally believes him and agrees to give him shelter. On the other hand, the doctor realizes that Alicia suffers from amnesia, because she doesn't remember anything about her past life and she had forgotten her own name. The doctor decides to call her \\"Guadalupe\\". Carmen knows the Angel's wish is to meet the pope personally, and she accompanies him to Bolivar's square and tells some of the places where he might go to get information regarding the Pope. After unsuccessful attempts to establish contact with the Pope and in the midst of a difficult situation with Carmen unemployed, Angel read the newspaper and he noticed that they were looking for a performer to sing at the Pope's reception. Angel realizes that Carmen has a great aptitude for singing, and convinces her to answer this call. On the other hand, Alicia remembers little about her past and Carlos invites her to meet his mother, who cordially received at home. Meanwhile, Angel decides to ask for help from \\"Mr Fulgencio\\" to compose a song for the Pope, being precisely the singer Carmen. However, Carmen, was not entered formally in the competition, they were rejected. Despite the adversities, the parish Father which the contestants were presented, was that Carmen had a great talent and felt the song as the best of all, so that gave him the opportunity to perform. Time passed and Carmen did not receive the invitation to present that act, because the contest was rigged in favor of another singer. However, Angel decided to investigate and discovered that everything had been controlled, is with the Father and then apologizes for not coming, so does perform alongside Carmen \\"Mr Fulgencio\\" and she is chosen to sing on July 2, the very day the Pope arrives. When Carmen was ready to sing before thousands of people in the pavilion of Tunal park, Angel is prevented from entering, since only the singer could be near the Pope during the tribute. But ultimately, the child manages get in and goes up to the pavilion and he is received by the Pope, who gives him a kiss on the forehead and blesses him. Carlos's mother turns on the TV just as the Pope's visit to Colombia is broadcast, so that Alicia sees her son and she begins to remember everything that happened. At that moment she asks Carlos' help, and he manages to communicate with the singer. The film ends when Angel, eager after all this time, greets his mother by phone.

Roscommon, Ireland about 4.5 kilometres north-west from the village of Arigna. Gubbarudda is a very rural area composed of 432 acres with only two residences. Much of the northern parts of the townland encompasses Coillte woodlands, while its southern areas are situated on the 'Kilronan Mountain Bog Natural Heritage Area'. The population of Gubbarudda as of 2012 totals eight individuals. Gubbarudda borders Co. Sligo to the west, and the tripoint of counties Leithrim, Roscommon, and Sligo on the river Arigna is less than a kilometre away from its northern border. Neighbouring townlands are Greaghacorra to the north-east where the river Arigna forms the border, Aughabehy to the east, Greaghnageeragh and Cashel to the south, Rover, Co. Sligo to the west, and Glen, Co. Sligo to the west and north. The name is composed of gubba, which is a corruption of ghob, the Irish for 'beak', describing the pointed shape of the land area, and rudda, which derives from the word rua meaning 'red', relating to the large quantities of iron minerals found in the vicinity. The traditional Irish flautist Packie Duignan lived for a while in Gubbarudda in the house where his father grew up. During the Great Famine a huge population decline was observed in every other townland in Arigna apart from Gubbarudda which enjoyed a slight population increase. There were five households in the townland in the year 1858. The population of Gubbarudda in the year 1901 was 26. Nonetheless the townland's population was to decrease dramatically throughout the 20th century when locals either emigrated abroad or moved to larger, more populated areas such as Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo. ==Coal mines== Coal mines in Gubbarudda were documented in the 1837 Ordnance Survey Namebook.Descriptive Remarks; as Ainmleabhar Par√≥iste na Suirbh√©ireachta Ordan√°is/from the Ordnance Survey Parish Namebook.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. ==History== Plan of St. Urban's Abbey in 1654 Ornate choir pews in the Abbey Courtyard of the Abbey The monastery was founded in 1194 on a land grant from the Freiherren of Langenstein and of Kapfenberg. The mother church was Lucelle Abbey. It was first mentioned in 1196 as sanctus Urbanus and in 1201 as cenobium sancti Urbani. The first monastery was a single monk's cell in Kleinroth, which is now in the municipality of Langenthal. In 1195, the first monks moved about down the valley to establish a larger monastery building. During the 13th century, the monastery expanded with land grants from local nobles and became a major landowner in the Langeten and Rot valleys. Over the following centuries it continued to expand acquiring property and rights throughout the region. By 1266, the monastery had become an abbey with an abbot who was also responsible for several surrounding nunneries. In 1234, a small monastery was founded in Gottesgarten near the village of Kleinroth. This monastery may have been a daughter house to St. Urban's until 1237 when it transferred to Olsberg. In 1280, the Abbey acquired a small chapel at Fribach, which became a local Marian pilgrimage site until the Protestant Reformation. Starting in the middle of the 13th century, the monks in the Abbey gained citizenship in several surrounding towns. The Abbey owned farms in many of the surrounding villages and even owned a vineyard on the shores of Lake Biel. Also, in the 13th century, they established a brick factory which produced elaborate decorated bricks for export. This medieval brick operation eventually grew into the Roggwil AG brick factory which is still in operation. In 1407 the city of Lucerne took over the Vogtei office over the Abbey, making the city the secular ruler over the Abbey. During the 1490s Lucerne began interfering with the monastery leadership to force St. Urban's to reform many aspects of monastic life. However, the reforms helped make the Abbey into a leading Cistercian house in Switzerland. The Abbey was secure enough that it weathered a devastating fire in 1513 without problems. In 1537, the abbot was raised to become a mitred abbot. However, the surrounding Swiss Confederation prevented the abbot from expanding his power or creating an ecclesiastical state around the Abbey. During the 17th century, the Abbey supported the creation of a pan- German Cistercian council and the goals of the Counter-Reformation. During this time, the Abbey expanded both physically and socially. Increasingly, the monks at St. Urban's came from noble or patrician families. By the 19th century, the Abbey was home to an average of 20-50 members. In 1690, Abbot Ulrich Glutz built a new baroque chapel to house the Ulrich chasuble relic, the vestment of St. Ulrich from the 10th Century, which had become a popular relic for pilgrims. Then, in 1711, Abbot Malachy Glutz had the Vorarlberg architect Franz Beer rebuild the church and convent buildings in the baroque style. The first mention of a school at the Abbey was in 1470. By 1500, it became a center of humanism and reform scholarship. The school remained in operation over the following centuries and in 1780 it became the first teacher training college in Switzerland. From 1841-47 it was the cantonal teacher training college. During the Helvetic Republic (1798-1803) the Abbey was placed under secular management and became the center of its own municipality. In 1814 the Abbey was assigned to the municipality of Pfaffnau. The last abbot, Friedrich Pfluger, initiated a series of reforms. However, shortly after his death in April 1848, the Abbey was secularized by the liberal cantonal government. The property, church treasure and choir pews were sold. The Abbey library was transferred to the cantonal archive and library. The monastery buildings changed hands several times after 1853. In 1859 the Basel silk industrialist Johann Jacob Richter-Linder bought the Abbey and converted it into a silk factory. In 1870, the Canton of Lucerne, bought the building complex back and established a psychiatric hospital there. This hospital opened in 1873 and remained in the Abbey until a new hospital was built in 1977-87. The village of Sankt Urban grew up around the hospital in the 1930s to provide housing for the hospital staff. Portions of the Abbey are now used for cultural purposes such as concerts or tours. The Gottfried Keller Foundation aims the acquisition of major works from Switzerland and abroad, to entrust them as loans to Swiss museums or to return them to their original locations, such as the choir of the St. Urban Abbey. The collection comprises more than 8,500 paintings, sculptures and other art objects in around 110 museums respectively locations in Switzerland. . ==References Category:Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Lucerne Category:Cistercian monasteries in Switzerland Category:1194 establishments in Europe Category:Buildings and structures in the canton of Lucerne Category:Tourist attractions in the canton of Lucerne Category:12th- century establishments in Switzerland Category:Monasteries dissolved under the Swiss Reformation ","title":"Saint Urban's Abbey"},{"id":"35904651","text":"Hoseynabad-e Sar Kal (, also Romanized as ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd-e Sar Kal and ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd Sar Kal; also known as ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd Abaleh) is a village in Bandan Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Benn believed that his change of party allegiances warranted him resigning his seat and seeking re-election. == Previous result  Candidates == Benn had been the Liberal MP for Leith since 1918 and was keen to stand for election as a Labour candidate. However, the Leith Labour Party did not want him as their candidate, so Benn did not contest the by-election.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies (1950) The Leith Labour Party adopted R.F. Wilson as their candidate. He was a local left-wing Socialist who had stood against Benn in the previous two elections. The Conservatives, who had not contested the seat since 1918, put up a candidate in Allan Beaton. He was one of the Scottish conservatives most experienced candidates.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies (1950) He had contested the safe Labour seat of Edinburgh Central at the last General Election. The Leith Liberal Association struggled to find a Liberal candidate prepared to defend a seat under such difficult circumstances.

He had briefly been Liberal MP for Rugby from 1923-24 when he was defeated. ==Campaign== The Liberal campaign was reliant upon Brown's ability and enthusiasm as a speaker, backed by plentiful funds from Lloyd George's national organisation. However, his task was made difficult because the local Liberal organisation had been allowed to run down during Benn's tenure as MP.Trial by Ballot by Ivor RM Davies == Result == Right up to polling day, the newspapers were predicting either a Labour win or a Conservative win with much talk about the prospect of the Liberal losing his deposit.Trial by Ballot by Ivor RM Davies == Aftermath == Four days after this victory, the Liberals gained a seat from Labour at Southwark North. Benn did not have long to wait for a local Labour Party to adopt him as a candidate when a by-election vacancy came at Aberdeen North in 1928, where he was returned to parliament. At the 1929 general election Brown was re-elected here.

The Biggest Trailer Mobile Hospital in the world. Saba Palaye 64 Bed Trailer Mobile Hospital was established In Karbala / Iraq at 9 October to 22 October 2019 In fact, a mobile hospital is a modular in that unit that every part of it is on the wheel, so it can be moved to another place easily, although all the required space and necessary equipment are considered so it can be utilized in the minimum time. With mobile hospital, one can provide medical services to wounded soldiers or patients near the war zone or any other place before moving them to the permanent hospital. In the mobile hospital, depending on the patient's situation and definitive treatment, admitted to the hospital and after evaluating the condition sent to another health center. During hundreds of years, the armies need to save soldiers‚Äô lives and rescue wounded has led to the development of military medicine In fact, war always directly or indirectly has caused development in medical Science. In this case, mobile hospitals and field hospitals are developed to help them to present fast and desirable services in the battlefields. Nowadays mobile hospital serves as a more comprehensive and wider type of the Mash, and more modern and up-to-date than the field Hospital to save human being's life and improve medical processes in natural disasters and war. Since mobile hospital provides most of the medical equipment and required medical areas on the wheels through the roads, it needs a special platform. Base platform of a mobile hospital can be a rear box of a truck or the box of a semi-trailer. Since mobile hospitals have similar therapeutic protocols with permanent hospitals, the rules and Criteria are the same too. Therefore, mobile hospital platform must be so flexible and efficient to design a health center similar to a permanent one. Regarding Variety of medical services or capacity of hospitalization part, mobile hospital and field hospitals are similar to each other In particular, a mobile hospital is bigger than first aid units and smaller than a permanent hospital. Also, the mobile hospital can be connected to another field hospital, for increasing ward sections capacity every time everywhere.Nosratkhah, Keivan, Vice President of SabaPalaye Co.(Designer and producer of mobile hospitals) According to the international laws of human rights, including Geneva Convention based on the ban on strike to doctors, ambulance, and hospitals which Marked with Red Cross or Red Crescent sign, Mobile hospitals will have Immunity on any strike too. == Mobile hospitals or field hospitals == The primary platform of the mobile hospitals is on semi- trailers, trucks, buses or ambulances which all of them can move on the roads. However, the main structure of a field hospital is tent and container. Tents and all necessary medical equipment will be placed in containers and finally transport via airplane, train, ship, truck or trailer. Therefore, the mobile hospital is a movable unit itself, but a field hospital is a transportable unit. The body materials of the mobile hospital are thermal insulation layer with a sheet of steel or fiberglass, but the tent of the field hospital is a fabric and tarpaulin. Hygienic Decontamination and compliance with health protocols in mobile hospitals better than field hospitals can be observed and also heat and cooling systems will be more efficient than field hospital. == Platform and structure of mobile hospital == In advanced mobile hospitals, special trailers with more efficient medical space are used, so some of these special trailers are expendable. Expandable trailers are similar to other standard semi-trailers while they are moving on the roads but as they stop or during the use, the semi-trailer (or truck) boxes will expand. For example, the total area of a semi-trailer with four expandable boxes can reach over 80 square meters if a standard size of a trailer is only 35 in usual. == Structure of various parts of the mobile hospital == Structure of different parts of the mobile hospital can be different According to its purpose. Generally, several types of platforms are used in the construction of mobile hospitals; therefore different parts of mobile hospital, from the viewpoint of platform framework, can be placed in three following categories: * Corridor trailers Several kinds of trailer widely used in mobile hospitals * Utility trailers * Medical trailers === Corridor trailers structure === In the mobile hospital, connectable halls or corridors can be standard size trailers or a normal container. These trailers have several doors to connect to other units or corridors via a special connector. The special connector can be a tent, inflatable structure, or open gangway connection. For efficient use of space; technical rooms, receptionist desk, cabinets, and closets can be installed. === Utility trailers (service units, offices, welfare sections and accessories and necessary utilities) === Each hospital, apart from the medical departments, needs electrical and mechanical facilities, repair and maintenance units, safety and health section, administrative offices, communication servicing, equipment management, toilets, bathrooms, laundries, kitchens, food supply and distribution, staff and doctors dormitories, production, and distribution. Electrical energy, water purification and storage units, warehouses, merge command rooms, and other services This equipment or spaces mostly takes place in a standard truck rear boxes or semi- trailers regular size boxes. === Medical trailers === Most Medical sections of mobile hospital are placed on special trailers Medical special trailers are semi-trailer boxes with expanding ability. == Division of space and various departments of the mobile hospital== The mobile hospital includes different sections of a permanent hospital. So all or some of the following departments can be a part of a mobile hospital. * Accident and emergency (A&E;) *Triage * Trauma * Decontamination * Ward section * Medical Imaging department (X-Ray, Ultra Sound, CT scan, MRI) * General Surgery *Inside of a mobile surgical trailerICU, CCU, and recovery * Anesthetics * Pharmacy * Laboratory * General or specialist Clinics * Women health * Admissions * Pathology * General Services (Support Services): such as Portering, Catering, Housekeeping, Security, Health & Safety, Switch, Laundry and the managements of the facility such as parking, baby tagging, access control, CCTV, etc. * Hospital management, Access control, CCTN The parts mentioned below may not be an essential part in mobile hospital, but due to the event, time and place some of these sections can be added to mobile hospital: * Breast screening (mammography) * Cardiology * Chaplaincy * Elderly services * Gastroenterology * Gynecology * Hematology * Health & Safety * Information Management *inside of mobile hospital, hospitalization and diagnosis sectionMaternity wards * Microbiology * Neonatal * Nephrology * Nutrition and Dietetics * Oncology * Ophthalmology * Orthopedics * ENT (Otolaryngology, Ear, Nose, and Throat) * Pain Management * Patient Accounts * Patient Services * Physiotherapy * Purchasing & Supplies * Radiotherapy * Rheumatology * Sexual Health, urology == Requirements and arrangements == # The mobile hospital should be settled in a familiar, easily accessible place. It is recommended that the hospital is placed next to a relatively tall or well-known landmark (such as a school or shopping mall, etc.) So patients and locals may locate it without much trouble. # The mobile hospital should be deployed locally to reach the appropriate road # The mobile hospital's ambit should be large sufficient to provide the necessary space for the movement and rotation of the trucks and trailers. # The mobile hospital's ambit should be enclosed with walls, fences or any other suitable coverings. # The mobile hospital's scope should have a sufficient number of magnified flags of RED CRESCENT and the RED CROSS sign so that they can be discovered from the surrounding hills, ground or the air with relative ease. # The mobile hospital's ambit should contain at least two standard Helipads. # The mobile Hospital's area must have accessibility to the drinkable water, food, medicine & medical equipment and fuel supplies as well as drinking water tanks in its ambit must be considered; along with food and medicine storage, medical equipment storage and fuel tank and waste water tank (or dry well) # After settling the mobile hospital, medical tents might be considered in blank spaces between structures, (and tents heating and cooling systems) in these free areas. In emergencies, these tents can be used for increasing ward section capacity. # Inside the mobile hospital area; trailer trucks, cars, and ambulances should be identified, so these areas will always be available and clear. # Before settling the mobile hospital, final location of trailers must be marked and linearized with a Surveying camera and a specified map # Necessary arrangements should be made for lighting inside and outside of the mobile hospital on day or night. # Parking areas should be considered for an enough number of ambulances. # Security system, doorman, guards and road blocks should be considered for hospital discipline. == History of Mobile hospital == To discuss the history of the mobile hospital, we must first take a look at the history of Mash and field hospital; since the mobile hospital is the advanced and generalized form of Mash and more efficient and operational form of the field hospital. === Field hospital === The surgical, evacuation or field hospitals would remain many miles in the rear, and the divisional clearing stations were never intended to provide emergency life-saving surgery. With the Army's larger medical units unable to assume their traditional role in support of the front line combat units, the chain of evacuation was interrupted at a critical point. Some interim solution had to be found quickly to provide the necessary surgical services and care to the severely wounded directly behind the front lines. Otherwise, many wounded soldiers would die from either the lack of life-saving surgery at the front or from the long and arduous evacuation trek along jungle trails from the frontal clearing stations to the nearest surgical unit, Manned with skilled surgeons and located close to the fighting to render quick, life-saving surgical intervention, the portable hospital could be moved by its own personnel to remain with the infantrymen during fluid operations. === MASH units === The concept of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital or MASH was invented by United States army. It is by definition a fully functional hospital used on the battlefield. It first came into being in August 1945; later it was used in the Korean War and many following conflicts. The idea of a mobile medical unit originated from the dental field by Major Vincent P. Marran, a medic during WWII. His achievements were highly appreciated, but it was never formally labeled. Also, Harry A. Ferguson, the executive officer of the Tokyo Army Hospital, had a big part in the development of MASH. Korean War had a big part in defining of MASH since the rising number of battle-injured demanded a more efficient medical care than traditional army doctors or transportation to a permanent hospital. MASH was that solution. It was established near front not only to supply more flexible military medical care and offer better care but also to serve as other purposes such as blood storage and distribution. A MASH unit was supposed to provide mostly surgical services for injured on the battlefield, but this definition was abandoned under the pressure of war-time needs. Early plans were a truck-based, portable, 60-bed facility deployed deep into the battlefield just out of enemy artillery range; to provide primary care for injured until they can be transported to back line to a permanent hospital. In Korean War, without a proper means of transportation, as a result of the expansion of required services of MASHs without a possibility of more personnel, rapid evacuation of patients were essentialized. There are some reports of Korean War that in some cases, a MASH hospital took care of a number of patients two times its capacity, each day. In late 1951, MASHs were being deployed much closer to battles, usually in 30 kilometers of front line. Still, in relative safety, MASHs were able to operate more efficiently with wounded receiving medical care sooner than ever. According to military standards, acceptable time for assembly of a MASH unit from arrival to becoming operational is 4 hours. For disassembly, getting loaded into vehicles and ready to depart, this time is 6 hours. Early MASHs could perform five surgeries a shift and had an efficient system to prioritize wounded. Each MASH unit was accompanied by a platoon of ambulances to ease the quick evacuation of treated patients and a group of helicopters to resupply the unit and speed up patient delivery to it as air ambulances. This system turned out to be super effective. The fatality rate for US army wounded dropped from 4.5 percent in WWII to only 2.5 percent in Korea. MASH proved its worth in Korea and became a key part of armies afterward. Technological and medical progress have helped MASH to save many lives not only in battlefields but also during unpredicted incidents and less developed regions. === Summary === * MASH provides only basic surgical and lifesaving treatments to sustain the patient until transportation to a permanent hospital. Field hospital lacks the needed efficiency in harsh conditions such as abnormal rain, heat, cold, and bio- hazard environment as a result of structure and material used, and disability in proper air-conditioning and decontamination; And it takes a considerable amount of time to deploy and tents tend to be very difficult to set up in mentioned conditions. To solve the mentioned issues and by combining the idea of the field hospital and platforms and structures of MASH, the mobile hospital was born. == See also  References  Further reading == * History of Mobile Hospital No. 6 American Expeditionary Force * History of the U.S. Army Medical Service Corps Category:Hospitals ","title":"Mobile hospital"},{"id":"35904745","text":"Atimiini is a tribe of beetles in the subfamily Spondylidinae, containing the following genera and species:Bezark, Larry G.

Gossels was named a Copley Artist in 1996 by the prestigious Copley Society of Art. She is also co-editor of the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book, Vetaher Libenu, published in 1980. ==Personal life== Born in Norwich, Connecticut, Gossels was raised in Putnam, Connecticut by her parents, Benjamin and Sadie Tuber. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree (magna cum laude) from Pembroke College (Brown University) and was elected into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1958, she married C. Peter R. Gossels. They have three children: Lisa R. Gossels, who was honored by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 2001 which awarded her an Emmy for her film, The Children of Chabannes; Amy D. Gossels, a casting director, film producer and teacher; and Daniel J. Gossels, an investment banker. ==Artistic career== Gossels worked at The Atlantic Monthly from 1956 to 1958. Gossels subsequently served as associate editor of Child Life Magazine from 1958 to 1960 and as a reporter and columnist for the Cochituate/Wayland/Weston Town Crier from 1962 to 1964. Gossels began her artistic career as a painter, but over time found that her painting was becoming more and more sculptural. In 1986, Gossels and Brenda Zaltas exchanged ideas about designing outdoor sculptures from found metal, discovered that the metal shapes reminded them of menorahs and embarked on a new career. Although they worked separately, they shared a vision and often showed their work together in art exhibits and galleries. Since the late 1980s, Gossels has received national attention for her unique \\"found metal\\" sculptures, both religious and non-religious, which \\"have been shown in museums, galleries and selected juried exhibitions\\" across the U.S., including the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Yeshiva University Museum, the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, Mizel Museum in Denver, and the Flagler Museum in Palm Beach. In 1988, the In the Spirit Studio / Gallery in New York City featured her aluminum and brass menorah titled, Brave New World. McCalls featured Gossels' Reflections, a Chanukah lamp with bronze mirror back, in its December 1990 article, \\"The Art of the Menorah.\\" At the General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations, Combined Jewish Philanthropies included a gift shop that displayed \\"unique Jewish artworks from throughout the world,\\" including Gossels' menorah works created from industrial metals. In 1996 Gossels was named a \\"Copley Artist\\" by the Copley Society of Art, the oldest art association in America. In order to qualify for this honor, an artist must meet the demanding standards for membership in the society and must have his or her work accepted into five different juried shows produced by the society. Gossels received her art training at the DeCordova Museum School in Lincoln, Massachusetts. She also took classes with Boston area artists Glenda Tall and George Dergalis. Her works are also represented in a growing number of private collections. ==Liturgical work== In addition to her sculpture, Gossels is a poet. According to an interview in the Wayland Town Crier, designing sculptural pieces made her realize \\"the connection between the written word and the visual piece.\\" While serving as a member of the National Commission on Worship of the Jewish reform movement between 1976 and 1980 and as Vice President of Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley in Sudbury, Massachusetts, Gossels composed and edited (with Joan S. Kaye and her husband, C. Peter R. Gossels) the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book for the Sabbath and Festivals, Vetaher Libenu, which was published in 1980. Among the many innovations contained in Vetaher Libenu, Nancy Lee Gossels and Joan S. Kaye revised the traditional Hebrew translation of \\"\\" or \\"Praised are You, Adonai our God, Ruler to the Universe,\\" to \\"Holy One of Blessing, Your Presence Fills Creation.\\" This invocation is now used by many Reform congregations. This siddur, which has sold more than 10,000 copies worldwide, contains many liturgical poems written by Gossels (including her well-known poem, \\"Somewhere Out of Time\\"), which have been widely republished, translated into German, anthologized and included in the Singing the Living Tradition, hymnal of the Unitarian Universalism Association. Gossels' poetry has also been included in the anthologies, Sarah's Daughters Sing, Esther erhebt ihre Stimme, Kol HaNeshamah, Celebrating the New Moon, The Torah: A Woman's Commentary,, Covenant of the Generations, and Gates of Shabbat: A Guide for Observing Shabbat. Gossels served as the editor of Chadesh Yamenu (Renew Our Days), an egalitarian machzor for Rosh HaShanah, published in 1997 and Kanfay HaShachar (Wings of Dawn), a siddur for weekly morning worship published in 2003. In 2011, Gossels co-edited Veha'er Eyneynu (Enlighten Our Eyes) with Michael Mirman, Harry Abadi and Sheila R. Deitchman. ==Public service== From 1976 to 1977, Gossels served as committee chair of the building committee for Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley. In this capacity, she oversaw the enlargement of the temple building. In 2005, Gossels was honored by the Massachusetts Association of School Committees for her commitment to public education and her generosity of time, energy and support to enhance the educational opportunities of students at Wayland High School by creating and endowing the Gossels Fund for Academic Excellence and the Gossels Fund for Human Dignity. Gossels served as a trustee of the Exploration School from 2001 to 2011, a summer enrichment program for approximately 3,000 students from Grade 4 through high school on the campuses of the St. Mark's School (Massachusetts), Wellesley College and Yale University. She currently serves as a member of the board of directors of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and Temple Shir Tikva in Wayland, Massachusetts. ==References * Life Magazine / Child Life Magazine * DeCordova Museum School * Glenda Tall * George Dergalis * Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley * Temple Shir Tikva Category:Living people Category:Jewish American writers Category:Jewish artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Nancy Lee Gossels"},{"id":"35904763","text":"The Chuka massacre, which happened in Chuka, Kenya, was perpetrated by members of B Company, 5th Battalion of the King's African Rifles in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. ==The massacre== The 5th KAR B Company had been sent to the Chuka area on 13 June 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. The Company commander, Major G. S. L. Griffiths, set up a base camp from which he directed operations ‚Äì two platoons would sweep through the forest to flush out the rebels, while African members of the local Home Guard policed the forest boundary. The sweeps were conducted by two junior officers. This was a typical anti-Mau Mau operation. Two Mau-Mau fighters that were recently captured were brought by the soldiers to act as \\"guides\\" to assist to reveal hideouts. When they were questioned, neither were willing to provide information. Major Gerald Griffiths and his two junior officers interrogated the men, and when the first prisoner seemed unwilling to co-operate, Griffiths ordered that a hole be made in his ear with a bayonet. A string was passed through the gaping wound, to be used as a tether over the next four days. The second prisoner also proved uncooperative. His ear was amputated on Griffiths' orders, and he was then summarily shot dead. Griffiths would later claim he had been shot whilst trying to escape. Over the next two days, the KAR platoons flushed out a number of Mau Mau fighters who were caught by the Home Guard stationed at the forest edge. Then, in the early afternoon of 17 June, a patrol of ten men led by an African warrant officer moved out of the forest and into the surrounding farmland. It came across twelve members of the Home Guard gathered at a farmhouse. For reasons that have never become clear, the twelve men were ordered to lie face down, and were badly beaten. Two of the victims were sent to fetch food for the soldiers ‚Äì and subsequently made their escape ‚Äì while the remaining ten were escorted into the forest by the KAR patrol. They reached the soldiers' camp around 4 pm and made to lie face down in a line. At sunset, they were shot where they lay, at close range and in cold blood.Kenya: Unveiling Secrets of Kenya's The following morning, 18 June, the warrant officer led his patrol along the forest edge, close to the settlement of Karege. Again it encountered and interrogated a group of Home Guards. The soldiers pillaged food gardens in Karege and shot a farmer before escorting their captives into the forest. African witnesses saw a British officer with the patrol. Early that afternoon, the captives ‚Äì nine men and one child ‚Äì were executed in a clearing near a small coffee farm at the forest edge. Soldiers cut off the hands of six of the victims and tucked these into their packs before returning to camp. The final killing occurred between 2 and 3 am the next day, when the surviving guide, still tethered by his ear, was shot, allegedly while trying to escape. At dawn, the soldiers broke camp, heading back to B Company's headquarters at Nyeri, leaving the body of their dead guide where it lay. ==Aftermath and trial== Days after the massacre, a new commander-in-chief, General George Erskine, arrived in Kenya in June 1953. He quickly sought to change the conduct of the security forces. In a directive to all troops he stated: \\"I will not tolerate breaches of discipline leading to unfair treatment of anybody,\\" and ordered that \\"every officer ... should stamp on at once any conduct which he would be ashamed to see used against his own people.\\" However, Erskine took the decision to cover up what had happened. A military inquiry was hastily convened for the following Monday on 22 June but its findings were never made public. Rumours of what had happened spread quickly, but the colonial government refused to acknowledge the affair publicly. Fragments of information nonetheless found their way into the public record. In an effort to prevent a haemorrhaging of support towards the Mau Mau in the Chuka area, the colonial government authorised the payment of compensation to the families of the murdered villagers. General Erskine then wrote personally to local chiefs, up to then allies, to reassure them that \\"investigations have satisfied me that whoever is to blame, it is not any of the persons killed.\\" However the army did not pass its findings to the Attorney General, and so prosecutions could not be taken forward \\"due to lack of evidence\\". All of the soldiers involved in the Chuka patrols were placed under open arrest at Nairobi's Buller Camp, but Erskine decided not to prosecute them. Instead, he would make an example of their commanding officer, Major Griffiths. And, rather than risk bringing publicity to the Chuka affair, Erskine was able to obtain evidence to have Griffiths charged with the murder of two other suspects in a separate incident that had taken place a few weeks before the Chuka massacre. However, the 5th KAR soldiers giving evidence at the courts martial in November 1953 refused to speak frankly against Griffiths. He was acquitted of the charge and rest of the soldiers were not charged either. Griffiths was put before a second court-martial following the McLean inquiry's findings charged with the murder of the first guide. On 11 March 1954, he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment; he was cashiered from the Army and served his sentence in Wormwood Scrubs in London. To this day, no British soldier involved in the massacre has been charged.Kenya: Unveiling Secrets of Kenya's In a letter to the War Office, in December 1953, to be found in the UK National Archives, Erskine made this candid admission: \\"There is no doubt that in the early days, i.e. from Oct 1952 until last June there was a great deal of indiscriminate shooting by Army and Police. I am quite certain prisoners were beaten to extract information.\\" To avoid a scandal, McLean's inquiry, therefore, drew a veil of official secrecy over the first eight months of the emergency.

According to The Guardian it 'shocked and impressed in equal measure' and has been compared to Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin. ==Plot introduction== Set in an affluent Manchester suburb it concerns Brendan and Sherilyn Guttridge and their daughter Samantha, who has not been seen for weeks. The story is told in mostly first person accounts of the couple themselves and of those who come into contact with them. Their love for each other is all-consuming and nothing is allowed to disturb it including the birth of their daughter. ==Inspiration== In an interview with Amazon.co.uk the author reveals 'I wanted to explore what lies behind the kind of tabloid headlines that scream \\"PERVERT! BEAST! MONSTER!\\" when someone is accused of a heinous crime ... Killing a child ‚Äì especially your own ‚Äì ranks high in the hierarchy of unconscionable acts, so I embarked on an archaeological dig in the Gutteridges' history, hoping to disinter whatever had caused them to kill their child.' The author herself is a practicing psychoanalytic psychotherapist and in her professional life she has 'struggled to discover what froths behind masks and make sense of things that often appear senseless'. ==Reception== Alex Larman writing in The Guardian praises the first half of the book and its 'psychological acuity' but is disappointed by its \\"slow decline into more routine 'blame the parents' plotting\\". James Urquhart in The Independent also remarks on the strength of the 'emotional realism' in the opening chapters and agrees that the novel ultimately 'loses its way'. Both reviewers though see much promise in this debut and look forward to the author's future work. ==References *Interview with Carol Topolski about the novel *Interview from The Telegraph Category:2008 novels Category:Novels set in Manchester Category:Psychological novels Category:Novels about child abuse Category:2008 debut novels ","title":"Monster Love"},{"id":"35904807","text":"Brooks Johnson (born February 28, 1934) is a former sprinter and a current American track coach. == Early life == Johnson was a track star for his high school in Plymouth, Massachusetts.http://www.sptimes.com/2008/02/08/Sports/QA_with_Olympic_sprin.shtml \\"Q&A; with Olympic sprint coach Brooks Johnson\\", Dave Scheiber, Times Staff Writer, Tampa Bay Times, February 8, 2008.

As one of Japan's 20 major cities designated by government ordinance (seirei shitei toshi), Osaka City has some administrative responsibilities that are handled by the prefectures in ordinary municipalities and is subdivided into wards. The administration is headed by a mayor directly elected by the people every four years in first-past-the-post elections. Enacting and amending city ordinances, passing the budget and approving important administrative appointments, including the vice-mayors and the treasurer, are handled by the city assembly that is directly elected by the people every four years by single-non transferable vote. As in all prefectures and municipalities, citizens may initiate chokusetsu seiky≈´ (\\"direct demands\\"), i.e. mayor and assembly are subject to recall referendums, and the people can influence policies directly via petitions and plebiscites. Osaka City is the prefectural capital of Osaka and Japan's second largest incorporated city after Yokohama, Kanagawa. Political debate in Osaka City has in recent years been dominated by the Osaka Metropolis plan of former Osaka governor and current Osaka City mayor T≈çru Hashimoto and his Osaka Restoration Association. Under the plan, Osaka City and Osaka's other designated city, Sakai City, would be abolished, subdivided into special wards that have a status as municipalities but leave some municipal tasks and revenues to the prefectural administration. As mayor, Hashimoto has set up an office to prepare for the unification of city and prefectural administration. == Historical background == As one of Japan's three most important cities (the \\"three capitals\\", santo: Tokyo City, Osaka City and Kyoto City), wards (ku) as subdivisions of the city were set up in 1878 and are thereby older than the city as a modern administrative unit itself, and when (albeit limited) local autonomy was introduced for other municipalities in the 1880s, autonomy rights in Tokyo City, Osaka City and Kyoto City were limited by a special imperial decree: The governor of Osaka also took the role of mayor of Osaka City and there was no independent city executive. After the decree had been lifted in 1898, the administration evolved as in other major cities of Japan. Unlike Tokyo City, Osaka City was not dissolved by the central government in World War II. In 1947, the U.S. drafted constitution and the Local Autonomy Law created the current legal framework of local autonomy for the city. In 1956, it became one of the first five \\"designated major cities\\". == National representation == Osaka City is covered by six of Osaka's 19 electoral districts for the House of Representatives. Osaka's 1st through 5th districts only consist of wards of Osaka city, the 6th districts covers the Asahi and Tsurumi wards but also extends into other areas of Osaka, namely Moriguchi City and Kadoma City. == Prefectural representation == As in all designated cities, Osaka City's wards serve as electoral districts for the Osaka Prefectural Assembly. Most are single- or two-member districts. Together they elect 33 of the 109 members of the assembly.Osaka prefectural election commission: Electoral districts for the prefectural assembly == Mayor == Osaka City's current mayor is T≈çru Hashimoto who had resigned as Osaka governor in 2011 to run in the mayoral election against incumbent Kunio Hiramatsu. Hashimoto won a clear victory even though Hiramatsu was supported by the established parties including the Japanese Communist Party who had for the first time since 1963 not nominated their own mayoral candidate to prevent Hashimoto's alleged \\"fascist, dictatorial\\" policies.The Japan Times, November 8, 2011: Stunner: JCP skips Osaka mayor race As mayor, Hashimoto supports the implementation of the Osaka Metropolis plan, opposes unionsThe Japan Times, February 8, 2012: [www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120208a5.html Hashimoto group claims union tried to tip election]The Japan Times, May 27, 2012: Hashimoto stalks anthem foes particularly the unions of public sector workers (local public servants union, teachers union, transportation workers union), and has taken an anti- nuclear stance in the energy policy debate after the earthquake in 2011. While Hashimoto's reformism is popular among his supporters not only in the city or the prefecture but nationwide (where he and his party threaten to contest elections if the national Diet obstructs his reforms), opponents see him as a populist and criticize his leadership style as authoritarian,The Japan Times, March 27, 2012: Old guard see despot in Hashimoto.

Two rival political visions emerge for reviving Japan. Will they clash? Mayoral elections had been held as part of unified regional elections since 1947 until 1971 when Kaoru Ch≈´ma's death caused an early election.

The CBI Officer also misunderstands, believing that Cherry is responsible for the two murders, although Siddharth is the real murderer. With Jilebi, the CBI Officer goes to Kumbh Mela at Haridwar in pursuit of Cherry. As Rawat is offering holy rituals, the CBI Officer catches Cherry and holds him, however, Siddharth rises from the Ganges and stabs Rawat with a trident, after which he fights with all of Rawat's guards. As he is about to kill Rawat, the CBI Officer attacks him with a taser and arrests him, thereby exonerating Cherry. Cherry comes to know the story of his look‚Äìalike. Siddharth visits his sister's house in Kolkata to pursue higher education. He shares a strong bond of love and affection with his sister, her husband, and his sister-in-law Nandini. Siddharth and Nandini are about to be married. Meanwhile, his brother-in-law, who is a doctor, attends a case of a minor who was injected with steroids by Rawat's second Brother Badvel and then forced into prostitution. When he complains to the police, he is unaware that the police officer is friends with Badvel, and is betrayed to Badvel, who kills him to keep him quiet. Siddharth is unable to bear this and kills Badvel, becoming a public sensation overnight. Shortly after, Siddharth seizes all of Rawat's property and distributes it to the public. Rawat kills the Minister, and puts the blame on Siddharth, who he stabs and throws into the Ganges. Rawat becomes the Minister within a week, while Siddharth survives, planning to kill Rawat. Cherry, after reading about his story, decides to help him. He, along with Jilebi, goes to the CBI Jail where Siddharth is in custody. He introduces himself and hatches a plan to get Siddharth exonerated. In court, since Siddharth admits that he committed the crime, the Judge orders that he be put to death. Cherry enters the court, stating that he is Siddharth Naayak and the one standing there is his fan. Siddharth tells exactly the same story, which causes some confusion. The Judge orders the CBI to find out the real identities of the two persons within ten days. During that time, Siddharth manages to bring Madhu and her family, including Babji and his paternal uncle, to Kolkata, uniting Cherry and Madhu. The next day, Rawat makes a call to Siddarth to come to his place to save the kidnapped school children. But Cherry eavesdrops on the conversation and goes to Rawat's place ahead of Siddharth, where he is severely attacked by Rawat. Siddharth reaches the place after watching a MMS sent by Rawat,Naayak (DVD). Scene from 2:30:32 to 2:30:50 saves Cherry and the two kill Rawat. The case is dismissed due to lack of evidence, and Siddharth is freed. In the end, both Siddharth and Cherry unite with their respective lovers. == Cast  Production  Development === At the end of April 2011, V. V. Vinayak held story discussions for his next film, featuring Ram Charan as the protagonist and written by Akula Siva. By then, Vinayak was busy in giving final touches to his film Badrinath (2011), and Ram Charan was participating in the shooting of Racha (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi. After completing all of the promotional activities for Badrinath, Vinayak and Siva started working on the film's script in early July 2011. DVV Danayya was confirmed to produce the film under the banner Universal Media, and pre-production on the film was expected to be launched in August, followed by filming starting in September 2011. The film's script was approved by Ram Charan's father, and it was announced that actor Chiranjeevi would be part of the cast; Kona Venkat was brought in to assist with the film's screenplay. The project was confirmed in late October 2011. The film was officially launched on 9 November 2011, at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. S. Thaman was announced as the music director, marking his first collaboration with both Vinayak and Charan; Chota K. Naidu and Gautham Raju were announced as the film's cinematographer and editor, respectively. The film's title was announced as Naayak, with the caption \\"The Leader\\", on 13 August 2012. Weeks before the film's release, a few Girijan students protested that the term \\"Naayak\\" referred to a certain tribal group, and they demanded a change of the title. While censoring the film, the Central Board of Film Certification looked into the group's objection about the title. They found that there was no derogatory reference to either the name Naayak or the caste of tribes, either visually or in the audio part of the film, and cleared the use of the title. === Casting === Kajal Aggarwal was considered for one of the two female leads in the film in early October 2011, later signing on to the film, which marked her second collaboration with Ram Charan after Magadheera (2009). Ram Charan confirmed that he would be seen in a dual role in the film. Hansika Motwani was rumoured as the second female lead, however this was denied by Danayya, who added that she was never considered for that role, and Kajal was the only actress who had been signed up until that point. In late February 2012, Amala Paul was selected as the second female lead, which she confirmed to Sify saying \\"Mynaa meets Magadheera\\". It was reported that Shruti Haasan would perform an item number in the film, which she later denied. Chiranjeevi and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. were rumoured to make cameo appearance in the film. Charmee Kaur confirmed in late December 2012 that she would perform an item number along with Ram Charan. Posani Krishna Murali and Jaya Prakash Reddy were seen in comic roles. === Filming === Principal photography began on 7 February 2012. By April 2012, the film was shot at various locales in Hyderabad. A few action sequences were shot at night, for which Ram Charan trained for several days; he performed several of the stunt sequences himself without using a body double. Filming was suspended for almost three weeks when Ram Charan was injured during filming Racha (2012). Vinayak intended to complete shooting Ram Charan's solo portions and then start the schedule with Kajal; Ram Charan and Amala Paul would take part in the final part of the planned schedule. The next portion of the schedule started in Dubai, where a song, \\"Laila O Laila\\", with Ram Charan and Kajal was shot. Ram Charan later said \\"It was a week before my wedding and I had just returned from my bachelor's party. I landed directly in Dubai to shoot the song. I had to wear shades to hide the fatigue\\" and added \\"I was told that I wouldn't need much rehearsals, but was zapped when I saw the choreographer take me through the routine. I was like 'can we please slow the beat or something?' I couldn't settle for anything less than the best and went ahead and completed the song in seven days.\\" After its completion, some key scenes and songs were shot in Europe involving the three leads. Subsequent to the marriage ceremony, Ram Charan resumed his work on Naayak in late June 2012, after shooting for a Tata DoCoMo commercial. The song \\"Subhalekha Raasukunna\\" was shot in Iceland on 22 August 2012. It was originally planned to be shot using Ram Charan and Kajal, but it was filmed using Amala Paul instead, as Kajal had a scheduling conflict. After the completion of that song, two more songs were shot using Ram Charan and Kajal. After returning from Iceland, filming continued in the Old City in Hyderabad. On 7 October 2012, scenes featuring Ram Charan and Amala Paul were shot at the Cineplanet Multiplex near Kompally. The next part of the schedule started in Kolkata from 12 October 2012. Some action episodes involving Ram Charan, Dev Gill, and others, and a few continuity scenes were shot. An entire day was spent shooting a few action episodes with Ram Charan at Chhotelal Ghat near the Mullickghat flower market, since Vinayak insisted on perfection. This portion of the schedule ended on 22 October 2012. The team returned to Hyderabad and filming continued in a set erected at Sarathi Studios. By mid November 2012, a majority of the filming was complete, with final completion expected in December 2012. The last portion of the schedule began on 4 December 2012, during which the remaining climax action episodes scenes and a song were planned to be shot until 18 December 2012. Amala Paul joined the filming of the climax on 7 December 2012, after returning from the sets of Thalaivaa (2013). The song \\"Nellorae\\" was shot using Ram Charan and Charmee at Ramoji Film City on 24 December 2012, and after its completion, filming came to an end on 29 December 2012. The filming phase lasted for approximately 9 months, and the film was the first Indian film to be shot in Slovenia. Ram Charan completed his part of dubbing in late December 2012. == Themes and influences == The film features a protagonist in a dual role, revolving around their lifestyles and the circumstances when they meet. A reviewer from Sify felt that the film's script was inspired from V. V. Vinayak's previous works like Tagore (2003), Lakshmi (2006), Krishna (2008) and Adhurs (2009), as well as from S. S. Rajamouli's past works like Simhadri (2003) and Chhatrapati (2005) and S. Shankar's Tamil film Sivaji (2007). Akula Siva said that the dialogue in the film had a philosophical touch despite being humorous and added, \\"The hero is elevated on par with divinity in the introduction; such glorification is imperative, if the hero doesn't have that power and courage he cannot fight so many people\\". == Music == S. Thaman composed the film's soundtrack and background music, marking his first collaboration with both V. V. Vinayak and Ram Charan. In April 2012, it was reported that Thaman was composing the film's songs with a focus on romantic songs featuring the two female leads. The song \\"Subhalekha Rasukunna\\", originally composed by Ilaiyaraaja for the soundtrack of the 1990 Telugu film Kondaveeti Donga, was remixed for this film in mid-July 2012 without any alterations in the tune and lyrics written by Veturi Sundararama Murthy. The lyrics of the remaining five songs were penned by Chandrabose, Bhaskarabhatla, and Sahithi. All the songs were arranged by Thaman and were recorded at Studio N.Y.S.A. in Mumbai and Studio T.A.A.L. in Hyderabad. Aditya Music acquired the audio rights for an undisclosed high price. The audio teasers were unveiled in mid-December 2014, and the official track list featuring six songs was unveiled on 14 December 2012. The film's soundtrack was launched on 17 December 2012, during a promotional event at Ramanaidu Studios. Pawan Kalyan attended the function as the chief guest along with the film's principal cast & crew. Oneindia Entertainment placed \\"Nellorae\\" in fourth place on the list of top 10 item numbers of the year in 2013. == Release == Naayak was planned to be released on 14 January, the eve of Sankranthi. Later the film's release was rumoured to be delayed due to Danayya's financial hardships, although he later confirmed the release date as 9 January 2013, denying the previous reports as rumours. The film was awarded an 'A' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification on 4 January 2013. Six cuts were suggested by the board to delete politically charged dialogue, and few other lines that included the names of the Andhra Pradesh Governors, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. The board also requested a few words being altered in the song \\"Nellorae\\", and the display of a statutory warning on drinking and smoking wherever they occur in the film. The film was shown on 110 screens in Hyderabad, breaking the previous records set by Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu (2012) and Businessman (2012), which were released in 105 and 103 theatres, respectively. Universal Media, in association with Praneeth Media, released the film on more than 100 screens in the United States, including 70 digital prints and sixteen 35 mm prints, which was a first for a Telugu film in an overseas market. The makers said that the film would be released in more than 1200 theatres in Andhra Pradesh. === Marketing === On the eve of Valentine's Day, first look stills of the film were released to the media. A few stills featuring Ram Charan were unveiled on 18 August 2012, which featured him sporting a new look. Two first look posters, confirming the film's title and its spelling, were unveiled on 26 November 2012. The film's first teaser was unveiled on 14 December 2012. Allu Arjun and S. S. Rajamouli unveiled the trailers at Shilpakala Vedika during the soundtrack launch. === Distribution === By early November 2012, the film's trade came to an end in all areas except Guntur. Bharath Pictures acquired the film's Nellore distribution rights, while Shobu acquired the rights for the ceded (Rayalaseema) area. Shakti Films acquired the theatrical rights for the Krishna District, and Siri Media obtained the film's Nizam region rights. V. Rao, Challa Shankar Rao and Tulasi Films acquired the screening rights in Vishakhapatnam, East Godavari district, and West Godavari district. Abhirami Movies acquired the film's Tamil Nadu distribution rights. Errabus acquired the screening rights for the United Kingdom and Europe. Gayathri Films bought the Karnataka distribution rights for 41 million, the highest price offered for any Telugu film in Karnataka up to that time. Universal Media distributed the film in the United States. Producer Dil Raju acquired the film's distribution rights in the Nizam region in mid-December 2012. === Home media === The satellite rights for the Hindi dubbed version were sold for a record price of . Gemini TV paid an advance of 26 million for the satellite rights of the original version, and fully acquired them after the film's release for an additional 75 million. The DVD and Blu-ray were marketed by Sri Balaji Videos and were released on 3 April 2013. == Reception  Critical response === The film received positive reviews from critics. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu wrote, \\"... the writing is humorous, lively and consistent. What more, the film works mainly on its dialogues and a brisk screenplay and has all the potential to rake in moolah at the box office,\\" and added, \\"Vinayak, having read the pulse well, comes out with Naayak that is a throwback to many of his earlier films but with correct dose of humour added, to cover the flaws. By the time you sense something wrong, he cleverly comes up with another funny scene. This way the film progresses and winds up before it gets too heavy, and voila there are smiles everywhere\\". Mahalakshmi Prabhakaran of Daily News and Analysis wrote, \\"We‚Äôll say that even if the film is about the age-old formula of the hero bashing the bad guys and coming up trumps, Naayak is an entertaining film that you won‚Äôt regret watching,\\" and rated the film 3.5 out of 5. AS Sashidhar of The Times of India termed the film a \\"pot boiling paisa vasool entertainer\\" and rated the film 3.5 out of 5. Oneindia Entertainment stated, \\"V. V. Vinayak may not have given a great screenplay, but he has had a high entertainment quotient with his narration. His mass appearance has doubled up Ram Charan's performance. Naayak is a perfect Sankranthi entertainer,\\" and rated the film 3 out of 5. Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com wrote, \\"The first half of the film moves at a breezy pace while the interval brings in the twist. In the second half there's mostly stomach-churning violence which is pretty repulsive. Technically the film is top-notch. V V Vinayak delivers a hardcore commercial entertainer for the festival. If you can watch Naayak without analysing it, you will find it fun,\\" and rated the film 3 out of 5. IndiaGlitz summarised, \\"Vinayak proves to be a director who knows how to play gimmicks with a formula story in hand and a narration baptized in masala. Naayak is for all those who love to watch an entertainer filled with doses of heroism and comedy, and also good music,\\" and added that the film is \\"commercial to the hilt\\". In contrast, a reviewer from Sify stated, \\"Director V V Vinayak, has chosen a routine story which has nothing new to offer. He chose a simple story and weaved an entertaining screenplay around it. Vinayak concentrated more on the presentation of the movie rather than the subject. The story and screenplay is predictable after the interesting interval bang\\" and called the film \\"Average\\". Another reviewer from Sify rated the film 3 out of 5 and stated, \\"Nayak, a regular commercial potboiler, starts off as a regular mass movie and ends up the same way. Nayak team should have concentrated on the story more. A rehashed film that can be watched once\\". B. V. S. Prakash of Deccan Chronicle wrote, \\"Even though Ram Charan impresses in the role of a brooding young IT employee who is determined to smash evil forces, the final outcome is more comic than serious. Vinayak tends to repackage scenes from his earlier movies. Akula Siva pens strong punch lines to enthral Ram Charan fans\\". === Box office === Naayak grossed 112.5 million at the worldwide box office on its opening day, and on its second day, taking its two-day total to 282.9 million. The film collected a total of 295 million in its first week. As of late April 2014, the film stood in fifth place of the top 10 Telugu films with the highest first week gross. In its second week of release, the film's gross suffered due to the competition from the release of Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, slipping to the second spot in the charts. It witnessed more than a 50% drop in its business, collecting approximately 80 million during the second weekend, and a total of 450 million in 10 days. By the end of its second week, the film had added approximately 55 million, for a 16-day total of 505 million net. The film grossed 600 million in its lifetime worldwide, and became the third most successful film of 2013, after Attarintiki Daredi and Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu. Its distributor share of 465 million made it Ram Charan's third film to cross the 400 million mark. It was fifth on the list of top 10 all-time highest-grossing movies at the Andhra Pradesh box office, as of November 2013. It also ranked tenth on the list of top 20 hit Telugu movies of all time at the box office, as of May 2014.  India  The film averaged 90% occupancy in both single screens and multiplexes in India on its opening day, collecting 85.5 million at the Andhra Pradesh box office and 27 million throughout the rest of India. With an average of 66% across the globe, it collected 134.9 million at the Andhra Pradesh box office, and 35.5 million in the rest of India on its second day. In six days, it collected a total 234.6 million net at Andhra Pradesh box office, and 25 million in the rest of India. The film completed a successful 50-day run in several centres across Andhra Pradesh on 27 February 2013. The film collected a distributor share of 389.5 million net at Andhra Pradesh box office in its lifetime, placing it sixth on the list of all-time highest grossing Telugu films, as of November 2013.  Overseas  The film collected 4.5 million in overseas receipts on its opening day, which increased to 6.5 million on its second day. However, the film's trade was severely affected by Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, dropping 70% at the overseas box office, with a three-day total of 9.2 million, compared to Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu 3 day opening day total of 11.3 million. The film collected 21.1 million in six days at the overseas box office. The film did good business by the end of its second weekend at the USA box office, ranking third in the charts by collecting 25.3 million, despite of the adverse effect of Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu which was in first place. Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola stood in second place, although its per screen average was lower than that of Naayak. The film suffered a big setback after the release of Race 2 and Viswaroopam, dropping to sixth place while collecting 26.5 million in 23 days. === Awards and nominations === {  - ! Ceremony !

Recent estimates put them at 7-800,000. Oral History suggests that the grand Ancestor of the Huli was a man named Hela who had 4 sons and a daughter from which the Hela nation was to emerge. The offspring of Hela were sons Huli, Opene, Duna, Tuguba and sister Hewa. Traditional Hela Territory ranged from whole of Enga Province (Opene) (Mt Porgera specifically Kumbi Para, ipa Yambale where sacrifice to traditional gods took place) to Mt Tundaka (Sacrificial sacred area) to Lake Kutubu to Mt Bosavi to Mt Gigira to the Strickland gorges bordering western and West/East Sepik Provinces. Territories and resources given as birthright to each by Hela are as follows. ===Huli=== The designated land area of huli include Tari pori, margarima,Komo, benaria, hulia and Tani, south Koroba areas and part of North Koroba. Under this area is Mt Kare gold project, Moran and Moro Oilfields=.Moro oilfields are in Southern Highlands Province ===Opene=== Opena land includes whole of current Enga Province. Opene was the first born son of Hela and under its boundary was given the largest gold mine in PNG, Porgera. ===Duna=== Duna Land includes the whole of strickland gorge, part of North Koroba LLG, and all Kopiago Basin, Awi-Pori. ===Tuguba=== Tuguba lands start from Mt Bosavi and ends at Mt Gigira. traditionally tuguba lands was known as any areas opposite the Tagali river from Huli lands. Under its lands lies the Hides, Juha and Mananda petroleum projects. ===Hewa=== Hewa lands are found in the Lake Kopiago Rural district. This includes the lands bordering both the Laigaip and Om Rivers as well as the headwaters of the Strickland River and the grasslands of the Strickland gorge north of the Duna lands around the Galaga settlement. ==Original Hela Province proponentsDamian Arabagali=== chairman of Hela Gimbu association; author of 'god dadagaliwabe was working in Hela'. ===Handape Tiahape=== Pioneer Member of Parliament from Hela who had to have a Huli Translator in Parliament due to lack of English/pidgin. ===Sir Andrew Wabiria OBE === The pioneer member for Kutubu, Komo Koroba, representing the area in the House of Assembly from 1964-1977. He was then Minister for Mines, Lands and Surveying. When he was minister he established the PNG chamber of Mines & Petroleum. The Papuan highly spokes person not to get Independence, which he fought hard with New Guinea leaders. He also raised the Hela District agendas together with late Sir Teii Abal Wabag MP. The Hela District bill was passed but he lost the Koroba Lake Kopiago open site in 1977. The founding Prime minister Sir Micheal Thomas Somare and his National Alliance Party together support Jiwaka and declare twin Provinces in Papua New Guinea in 2012. Sir Late Andrew Wabiria OBE also involved in negotiation with BP company in hides,Southern Highlands Provincial Government,Enga Provincial Government, Hides PDL1 for the Gas to Electricity to Porgera Gold Mine, he himself comes from Nogoli pajapa where his mother comes from, the Ninth (9) Tukupa tribesmen call \\"YUKU\\". ===Sir Matiable Yuwi=== Pioneer MP and one of the founding fathers of Papua New Guinea. Was a member of the committee overseeing the creation of the PNG constitution with the likes of Sir Michael Somare. ===Hon.Alfred Aluago Kaiabe=== Former member for Komo Margarima and strong fighter for a separate Hela Province. ===Aruru Matiabe=== Former MP for Koroba-Kopiago. ===Albert Mokai=== Former Premier of the Southern Highlands; from Pureni in Koroba Lake Kopiago electorate. ==Natural resources== Hela is the host province for a number of many natural resources projects that benefits Papua New Guinea. The current biggest project includes the PNG LNG Project source area of Hides, Angore, Kutubu, Moro, Moran and Mananda Oil Fields. The second biggest project underway is the Mt Kare Gold Project operated by Indochine Mining. Mt Kare is under Tari Pori electorate. Current gold explorations are underway in Mt Tundaka in Upper Wage LLG of Margarima district under Komo Margarima electorate. ===Hides=== The Hides gas field, located in PDL 1, was discovered in 1987. It is a large anticlinal structure, approximately 30 kilometres long and five kilometres wide. Four wells have been drilled on the structure to date. Gas production commenced in 1991 with the development of the Hides Gas to Electricity Project (GTE). The Hides GTE project consists of a pipeline (PL 1) connecting the Hides-1 and Hides-2 wells to a small gas conditioning plant at the Hides Production Facility (HPF) located in the Tagari River valley. Sales gas is then used by the Porgera Joint Venture to generate electricity in an adjacent facility. The electricity is transmitted to the Porgera Gold Mine by overhead wire. Condensate produced along with the gas is distilled into naphtha and diesel which is sold into local markets and used as back-up fuel for the power station. Oil Search owns 100% of the GTE project and is Operator. The gas is sold under a long-term gas supply contract, which was revised in the first half of 2012. As at 31 December 2013, the reserves attributable to the Hides GTE Project (Oil Search - 100%) were at standard conditions and of condensate. Recent explorations have been done into Mt Kare, Mt Tundaka and Mt Bosavi areas for prospects of Gold. Currently the hides gas fields together with Juha, Angore, Mananda, Kutubu, Moro and Moran fields are used to supply the PNGLNG Project operated by Exxon Mobil subsidiary, Esso Highlands Ltd. Hides alone supplies 70% of the required natural gas to the project. It is located on Tuguba Tribal Land stretching from hides to angore to SE mananda areas. ===Mt Kare Gold Project=== Mt Kare is under Tari-Pori electorate on the lands of the Pujaro and Heli Tribes in the Tagali River area. Historically it has always been part of Hela and given to Hela under oral traditions. Porgera is the 'birthright' of the Enga (Opena) brother while Mt Kare is the Birthright of Hela (Huli) shared among the two by their common ancestor Hela (Man). It is known to contain more gold reserves than the current Barrick operated Porgera Gold Mine. Geologically the Mt Kare deposit shares many similarities with the nearby Porgera gold mine, with the same host rocks, similar geological structures, mineralisation types and the same age of mineralisation. This indicates the large potential for growth in the current Mt Kare resource. Porgera is one of the world's top 10 gold mines, with over 500,000 oz/yr production for over two decades, and has developed significant infrastructure, including roads and power lines, nearby to Mt Kare. Porgera started as a high grade underground mine and later developed a major open cut operation, now more than 500 metres deep. ===Mt Tundaka=== Recent explorations have speculated on deposits of gold at the Mt Tundaka area of Upper Wage in Margarima District in Komo Margarim Electorate. No confirmation has been given but ongoing exploration for further confirmation is in progress. ===Kutubu Oil Project=== The Kutubu Oil Project, which was Papua New Guinea's first commercial oilfield development, is located in the southern highlands of Papua New Guinea and takes its name from nearby Lake Kutubu. Oil was first discovered at Kutubu in the Iagifu sandstone structure in 1986 and commercial production commenced in June 1992. The Kutubu development comprises a network of wells that produce oil from the Iagifu-Hedinia, Usano and Agogo fields, a gathering system and on-site processing facilities (the Agogo and Central Processing Facilities) and supporting infrastructure, as well as a 265 kilometre export pipeline to the coast and a marine loading terminal in the Gulf of Papua. The pipeline operates under Pipeline Licence 2 (PL-2), while the oilfield operates under Petroleum Development Licence 2 (PDL-2). Both licences were issued in December 1990 for a term of 25 years and were extended in December 2009 until December 2035. Production from the Kutubu field peaked in 1993 at of oil per day. Although still a strong contributor to Oil Search's profitability, the Kutubu Oil Project is well into its decline phase due to natural field depletion. However, efforts over the past several years to arrest the production decline have been highly successful with additional production resulting from the drilling of development wells at Kutubu, Agogo and Usano. As at 31 December 2013, Oil Search's share of remaining recoverable 2P reserves at Kutubu was 18.7 million barrels. The main reserves are contained within high permeability oil rims in the Toro and Digimu sandstones with smaller volumes in the Iagifu and Hedinia reservoirs. ===Moran=== Moran production is processed at the Agogo Production Facility (APF) and liquids are then piped to the Central Production Facility for further processing, storage and export through the export pipeline. The Moran PDL-5 participants pay a tariff to the PDL-2 and PL-2 partners for processing and transporting crude through the Kutubu system. In late 2003, NW Moran, an extension of the Moran field towards the north west, into PPL 219, was discovered. In September 2005, an Extended Production Test (EPT) of the NW Moran 1 well commenced, following the construction of a 23 kilometre pipeline linking NW Moran into the APF. This, together with infrastructure debottlenecking, additional infill wells and success in re-pressurising the Moran reservoir due to improved facilities reliability, has resulted in an increase in production rates in recent years. In late 2006, the PDL 2, PDL 5 and PPL 219 (now PDL 6) joint venture partners agreed to establish a single Greater Moran Unit across the Moran and NW Moran fields. The unitisation split is 55:44:1 to PDL 5, PDL 2 and PDL 6 respectively, giving Oil Search a 49.51% interest in the Unit. A Production Development Licence over the NW Moran field, PDL 6, was awarded in 2008. As at 31 December 2013, Oil Search's share of remaining recoverable 2P reserves at Moran was 13.9 million barrels. The reserves are contained within generally high permeability oil rims in the Toro and Digimu sandstones ===South East Mananda Oil Project=== The SE Mananda field, located in PDL 2, was discovered in 1991. While the field was very close to the Kutubu facilities, it is on the other side of a very deep gorge and consequently, for a number of years, was deemed to be uncommercial. Following the PNG Government's introduction of a marginal field tax regime to encourage the development of smaller oil fields, and the transfer of Operatorship, Oil Search commenced detailed technical and engineering studies on the SE Mananda field during 2003. This work confirmed that the field was economic based on a low cost development and incorporating an appropriate fiscal regime. A development plan was sanctioned in 2004 and the fiscal and regulatory framework agreed with the PNG Government in early 2005. The SE Mananda development came on-stream in early 2006. There were significant challenges associated with the development, including very difficult terrain and the need to span the 470 metre wide, 400 metre deep Hegigio Gorge. The latter resulted in the design and construction of the world's longest pipeline suspension bridge. In addition, the SE Mananda landowners are made up of three separate ethnic groups, which under Oil Search, for the first time came together in a cooperative manner. The infrastructure will facilitate further development opportunities along the Mananda ridge ==SportsHela Wigmen RLC=== Hela Wigmen Rugby League Club is a Papua New Guinea semi-professional rugby league football club based in Mendi, Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. Hela Wigmen entered Papua New Guinea Semi-professional League in 2009. Hela Wigmen represents the people of Hela Province. Because of limitations in logistics and facilities in Tari, the team is based in Mendi. Hela Wigmen is sponsored by Kemele Construction and Hides Gas Development Company (HGDC). In 2014 they won the top national Rugby league competition, Digicel Cup in the Grand Final against Agmark Gurias in Lae Rugby League Grounds. ===Hekari FC=== Hekari United is a semi-professional association football club, based in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The Club is owned by a Southern Highlands Businessman from Kutubu, Mr John Kapi Natto. Hekari has been sponsored by Petroleum Resource Kutubu. The team represents Kutubu, which is located in the Southern Highlands Province but is based in the nation's capital and is composed of the best players from PNG and the Pacific. They were winners of the 2006 (when named PRK Souths United)[1] and the 2007/2008 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League.[2] In 2010 Hekari United became the first club to qualify for the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2010 to be hosted in Abu Dhabi from 8‚Äì18 December. The qualification of Hekari United is historic and represents the first time Papua New Guinea and for that matter any South Pacific Island club not from Australia and New Zealand has been involved in a FIFA club football tournament at any level. == Provincial leadersChairmen of the Hela Transitional Authority (2010‚Äì2012)=== {  !

Accordingly, they often refer to each other as brothers (Glasse 1965:33; Biersack 1995:14-16), considering themselves sons of the same father. On the basis of this connection there have been calls for many years for the formation of a Hela province, which would take in the resource-rich districts occupied by the Duna, Huli and Paiela, namely the Komo-Margarima, Tari-Pori, Koroba-Lake Kopiago, Nipa-Kutubu and Porgera-Lagaip districts (Vail 1995:360; Haley 2002b).[3] The project is for the most part Huli owned and driven, and lacks wider support, although it does have the support of many key political figures. What local-level support it has derives directly from discontent over the lack of services in the western end of the province and the lack of benefits accruing from present resource developments. It is this same discontent which led to the formation of the United Resources Party by Anderson Agiru. These peoples also hold that the world is bound up in a process of loss, degradation and decline. This is expressed in the way they engage with their environment and in the ways they perceive and interpret environmental and social changes. Ethnographers of the Duna and Huli have repeatedly commented on this all-pervading theme (Frankel 1986; Goldman 1983; Ballard C. 1995; Strathern 1991; St√ºrzenhofecker 1993; Haley 2002b), which is common to the region more generally (see also Jorgensen 1981, 1985; Poole 1986; Biersack 1991, 1995). Myths found amongst these groups reveal a common belief that the world originally consisted of formless clay-like mud which was given shape and strengthened by ancestral spirits; that the cardinal elements of the universe were born of an original ancestress; and that the landscape as fashioned by the ancestors is held securely in place by a subterranean cane or cane-like python known as the ‚Äòroot of the earth‚Äô. These myths also reveal that the way of the world is such that the fertile substance, which sustains the universe, by nature dissipates, and that the expenditure of this substance will bring about the world's end. The peoples living in the western end of SHP similarly share the belief that they are part of a regional system deeply rooted in mythology and ritual, and that the fertility of their region is morally constituted. This means they must act and behave in certain ways for their world to be fertile. Such was the basis of their pre-colonial cosmologies. Indeed, in the past, Duna, Huli, Hewa, Bogaia and Paiela participated collaboratively in ground-seeding and ground-making rituals which sought to ensure the ongoing fertility of the region (Haley 2002b). These rituals, which involved the sacrifice of human substances and body parts in order to replenish the root of the earth, were enacted along ritual ‚Äòroads‚Äô which criss-crossed the region. Specifically, there were at least five major ritual roads crossing the Duna region, these being Kirau atia, Ambua atia, Hewari atia, Nona atia and Miliano atia, and another, Ukuam Sama, traversing the Bogaia region. One thing these roads had in common is that they all terminated outside the Duna area. The most southerly road, Kirau atia, started in Bogaia country near Bulago and proceeded via Nogoli to Gelogili in Huli country (Gelote in the Huli literature. See Goldman 1979; Ballard C. 1995). Ambua atia started on the Oksapmin side of the Strickland Gorge and, it seems, originally terminated at Bebenite, south of Tari.[4] The third road, Hewari atia, commenced at the Duna parish of Angora in the mid Pori River area and travelled through the Logaiyu and Urei river valleys into the Ipili-speaking areas and thence to Mt Kare where it terminated. Nona atia commenced in the Strickland Gorge on Yokona ground, traversed the south Hewa area, and likewise terminates at Mt Kare. The final road, Miliano atia, commenced in Hewa country, traversed Duna country from north to south, and terminated in the Bogaia area. Ritual sites linked by these roads typically featured ground oil seeps and natural gas seeps, which became the focus of the rituals which sought to replenish fertile substance in order to restore and ensure the ongoing fertility of the region. Even today, despite the almost complete absence of indigenous ritual practice, Duna hold to the belief that moral behaviour conserves fertile substance, and that immoral behaviour sees it depleted and will ultimately bring about the world's end. Ongoing fertility continues to be something Duna must negotiate through appropriate moral behaviour and proper social intercourse (Haley 2002b). Indeed, it is their actions which render specific substances, particularly (but not exclusively) fluid substances, either inimical to growth or capable of inducing fertility. Linked to this is the notion that inappropriate moral behaviour can render a previously fertile substance infertile (see also Ballard C. 2000:210). Mineral resources are seen as examples of fertile substance which originate from deep within the root of the earth. As such they must be properly handled and engaged with in a morally appropriate manner. Duna hold that social intercourse in relation to mineral extraction must also be properly managed, and that the flow of resources elsewhere must be curtailed, lest the fertile substance sustaining the world be depleted at a rate which brings about the end of the world. How is this relevant to a discussion of politics? For generations, Duna, Huli and Paiela and their more immediate neighbours performed cooperative rituals aimed at re-making and re-fashioning the ground so as to ensure the ongoing fertility of the entire region. Specifically, these involved replenishing the earth's fertile core. In the contemporary context, Duna claim the Huli and Paiela have forgotten this. They cite their exclusion from Mt Kare as a case in point. Indeed, although many Duna clans in the upper Pori area directly descend from Ko-Yundikia (the spirit associated with Mt Kare) and several old men from these groups had sacrificed pork to Ko- Yundikia in their own lifetimes, Duna were chased away from Mt Kare during the height of the gold rush. Duna feel that their Huli and Paiela ‚Äòbrothers‚Äô should have recognised and acknowledged their claims, especially as they had been cooperatively responsible for Ko-Yundikia's ritual propitiation for generations. Furthermore, Duna maintain that they continued observances at Mt Kare well into the early 1970s, long after the Huli had abandoned these practices.[5] Duna, today, charge the Huli, in particular, with having forsaken both the regional ritual projects which they once strongly promoted (Ballard C. 1994; 2000:213) and the ties which made such cooperative performances possible. Instead of being concerned to preserve the fertile substance of the earth's core, Duna see the Huli and Ipili as pillaging it. They regard the gold, oil and gas being extracted at Porgera, Mt Kare, Nogoli, Moran, Kutubu and Gobe as examples of this fertile substance, and insist that the Huli are wantonly consuming fertile substance which should be conserved so as to sustain them and the world. This blood taken along Kirau atia and Ambua atia was fertiliser for gardens, medicine for pigs and children. Those things started here. But where they stored them, that was at Nogoli [Hides Gas], on the Huli side. They have forgotten the true origins of Kirau atia and Ambua atia. We believe that there is something important here ‚Äî mineral oil, gas or something. We don't know. Our ancestors told us not to dig the ground in the [Strickland] Gorge. They said, if we did, this thing would come out and burn us all ... Where those roads ended they are extracting gas. We too are responsible for that gas. Those things started here. (Andrew Makano 1997; Robinson Fieldnotes Notebook 4:129-130). In the contemporary context, Duna feel that Huli have sold them out. They charge the Huli with monopolising for themselves the fruits born of their cooperative ritual efforts. The boy went that way and the girl went this way. She went with a female pig. That pig didn't take a walk by itself. The people here took it up that way. They would call the name of each group. One group would bring it and give it to the next, all the way to Gelogili ... Before we [Huli and Duna] stayed together like a married couple. Our union bore fruit. Our union bore the oil and gas ... Those things are as much ours. But they [the Huli] are using it, expending it. They have forgotten us (Sane Noma 1994; Haley Fieldnotes Notebook 3:48; 54). The Duna likewise charge the Huli with having forgotten that they are brothers who trace descent from a common ancestor, Hela. Almost without exception, Duna now preface conversations and statements about mining and other large-scale development projects with statements to the effect that the Duna, Ipili and Huli are brothers ‚Äî Hela ingini ‚Äî sons of the same father. Such appeals to common descent also form the basis of an anti-Huli sentiment which now permeates all aspects of Duna discourse. Despite espousing the rhetoric of Duna, Huli and Paiela as brothers, Duna have not embraced the growing calls for a Hela province (Biersack 1995; Vail 1995; Goldman n.d.). They vehemently oppose such a project, seeing it as a Huli owned and driven project which will bring them no benefits (cf. Goldman n.d.:12). Some even view the calls for the formation of a Hela province as sinister in intent, fearing that if the province comes to pass they will lose both their land and their identity (Haley 2002b). ==References== Category:Provinces of Papua New Guinea Category:Highlands Region Category:States and territories established in 2012 Category:2012 establishments in Papua New Guinea ","title":"Hela Province"},{"id":"35905229","text":"Shand-e Maleki (, also Romanized as Shand-e Male·∏µƒ´) is a village in Bandan Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Starting March to April, they present a major source of nectar and pollen, and are foraged on by different species of honey bee. In late summer they bear colourful samaroid fruit, containing one seed each. The young shoots are useful as cattle fodder. ==Notes * Indian Redwing, Flowers of India * P. hexapetalum, Flora of Nilgiri Biosphere * Bhoca, a bee forage plant, Bees for Development Journal * Range and synonyms: Pterolobium hexapetalum, LegumeWeb, from ILDIS World Database of Legumes H Category:Flora of the Indian subcontinent Category:Flora of Myanmar ","title":"Pterolobium hexapetalum"},{"id":"35905302","text":"Talaran-e Markazi (, also Romanized as TƒÅlƒÅrƒÅn-e Mar·∏µazƒ´; also known as TƒÅlƒÅrƒÅn) is a village in Bandan Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

It refers to the Tosk-based Albanian standard regulated by the Academy of Sciences of Albania. ==Nouns (declension)== Albanian has two grammatical genders, feminine and masculine, neuter is not distinct from masculine. Nouns are morphologically altered for number (singular/plural), definiteness (indefinite/definite), and case. The cases are nominative, accusative, dative, ablative and vocative. Many texts include a genitive case, but this is produced using a linking clitic (see below) and is morphologically identical to the dative. The vocative is distinguished from the nominative in the case of only a few nouns. The dative and the ablative are identical, except for the indefinite plural. The indefinite accusative is always the same as the indefinite nominative. ===Plural formation=== Albanian plural formation is highly irregular. Suffixes include -ra, -a, -e, -onj, -√´, but modification of the stem by final consonant palatalization or internal vowel mutation is common. ===Regular noun endings=== The indefinite form of the noun is identical in the nominative and accusative cases, being the uninflected form of the noun in the singular, and the form noted above in the plural. The following are the endings for the dative and ablative cases when the noun is in indefinite form: {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! !! DAT !! ABL -  singular, masculine/neuter nouns  i  i -  singular, feminine nouns  e  e -  plural  ve  sh } The endings for nouns in definite form are as follows: {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! !! NOM !! ACC !! DAT/ABL -  singular, masculine nouns of \\"u\\" type  u  un/n√´  ut -  singular, masculine nouns of \\"i\\" type  i  in/n√´  it -  singular, neuter nouns  t(√´)  t(√´)  it -  singular, feminine nouns  a  n(√´)  s(√´) -  plural  it/t(√´)  it/t(√´)  ve(t) } The masculine nouns of \\"u\\" type are those whose uninflected form ends in a stressed front vowel or in -h, -k or -g. Others are of \\"i\\" type. For examples of noun declension patterns, see Albanian language (Grammar). ==PronounsPersonal pronouns=== The personal pronouns decline for case, as do nouns; they have additional clitic (weak) forms in the accusative and dative. Older forms of the personal pronouns for the 3rd person in the ablative case are occasionally found. {  - ! !! NOM !! ACC !! DAT !! ABL !! ACC (clitic) !! DAT (clitic) -  1st pers. singular  un√´  mua  mua  meje  m√´  m√´ -  2nd pers. singular  ti  ty  ty  teje  t√´  t√´ -  3rd pers. singular, masculine  ai  at√´  atij  atij (si) e  i -  3rd pers. singular, feminine  ajo  at√´  asaj  asaj (soje) e  i -  1st pers. plural  ne  ne  neve  nesh  na  na -  2nd pers. plural  ju  ju  juve  jush  ju  ju -  3rd pers. plural, masculine  ata  ata  atyre  atyre (sish) i  u -  3rd pers. plural, feminine  ato  ato  atyre  atyre (sosh) i  u } ===Demonstrative pronoun=== The declension of the demonstrative pronouns is very similar to that of the 3rd person personal pronouns. Older forms of demonstrative pronouns in the ablative are occasionally found. {  - ! !! NOM !! ACC !! DAT/ABL !! (old)ABL -  masc. sing.  ky  k√´t√´  k√´tij  k√´si -  fem. sing.  kjo  k√´t√´  k√´saj  k√´so -  masc. plural  k√´ta  k√´tyre  k√´tyre  k√´si(sh) -  fem. plural  k√´to  k√´tyre  k√´tyre  k√´so(sh) } ==Adjectives (declension)The linking clitic=== An Albanian noun phrase typically has the form \\"N Lnk Adv* A\\" where Lnk is the declinable particle described below. (If adverbs appear between the adjective and the linking particle, then the latter must take its indefinite form.) The linking particle agrees with the noun in gender, case and number. Indefinite linking clitic: {  - ! !! NOM !! ACC/DAT/ABL -  SG.M  i  t√´ -  SG.F  e  t√´ -  PL  t√´  t√´ } Definite linking clitic: {  - ! !! NOM !! ACC !! DAT/ABL -  SG.M  i  e  t√´ -  SG.F  e  e  s√´ -  PL  e  e  t√´ } The adjectives themselves are also declined to agree with the noun in gender and number. Paradigms differ depending on whether the adjective is or is not used with the linking particle. ===Adjectives with the linking clitic=== One group of adjectives uses the same form for all except the feminine plural, which uses the ending -a. The other does not differ by number, but has an -e on the feminine and none on the masculine. ===Adjectives without the linking clitic=== Some adjectives are used without the linking particle. These take different endings from those that use the linking particle, and come in seven different types. {  - ! M.SG !! M.PL !! F.SG !! F.PL -  -  -  -  - -  -  -  -  a -  -  -  e  e -  -  √´  e  e -  -  ?  e  e -  -  ?  ?  ? } Each row is a different declension class. Each cell labeled \\"?\\" indicates varied/irregular endings. ==Verbs (conjugation)== In the active voice, Albanian morphologically alters the indicative present, imperfect and aorist, the optative present, and the admirative present and imperfect (with 6 person/number inflections for each), as well as the imperative (2nd person singular and plural) and a participle (indeclinable). (The admirative endings are regular across conjugational classes and are similar to forms of the auxiliary kam.) All other mood/tense/aspect combinations are produced periphrastically using the auxiliary kam (have) and indeclinable particles. The Albanian passive voice continues the Indo-European medio-passive, and has separate declension paradigms for the indicative present and imperfect, as well as the imperative. The other forms are produced from these and from the active forms periphrastically. ===Regular paradigms (active voice)=== Class 1 {  - ! - !! IND.Present !! IND.Imperfect !! IND.Aorist !! Optative -  1  oj  oja  ova  ofsha -  2  on  oje  ove  ofsh -  3  on  onte  oi  oft√´ -  1  ojm√´  onim  uam  ofshim -  2  oni  onit  uat  ofshi -  3  ojn√´  onin  uan  ofshin } Imperative: Singular -o, Plural -oni Participle: -uar Class 2 {  - ! - !! IND.Present !! IND.Imperfect !! IND.Aorist !! Optative -  1  -  ja  a  sha -  2  -  je  e  sh -  3  -  te  i  t√´ -  1  im  nim  √´m  shim -  2  ni  nit  √´t  shit -  3  in  nin  √´n  shin } Imperative: Singular -, Plural -ni Participle: -ur Class 3 {  - ! - !! IND.Present !! IND.Imperfect !! IND.Aorist !! Optative -  1  -  ja  ta  √ßa -  2  -  je  te  √ß -  3  -  nte  ti  tt√´ -  1  m√´  nim  t√´m  tshim -  2  ni  nit  t√´t  tshit -  3  n√´  nin  t√´n  tshin } Imperative: Singular -, Plural -ni Participle: -tur ===Irregular verbs=== Most proper Albanian verbs are irregular since they change their only vowel of the stem, often rearranging consonant order or by changing the stem completely. Verbs of foreign origin like studioj, kandidoj, refuzoj, provoj, etc. are regular. Verbs derived from nouns, like ndryshoj (from ndryshe, different), vler√´soj (from vler√´, value), are normally regular. Here are some examples of irregular verbs: kam ‚Äòhave‚Äô (auxiliary) (I have, you have, I had (aorist), I had (simple perfect), I (wish to) have, (imperative) have!, had (participle). jam ‚Äòbe‚Äô (auxiliary) shoh, to see ha, to eat. rri, to stay vij, to come bie, to fall flas, to speak them, to say ==Bibliography== * Buchholz, Oda & Wilfried Fiedler.

While the fish with the common name crested bigscale in Alaskan waters had formerly been identified as P. crassiceps, it is now believed that Alaskan crested bigscales are actually Poromitra curilensis, and that P. crassiceps is restricted to the Atlantic Ocean.M.S. Yang (1993) - Food habits of the commercially important groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska in 1990. US Dept. of Commerce, NOAA Tech. Memorand MMFS-AFSC-22 As a result of this mis-identification, P. crassiceps is occasionally identified as the largest ridgehead - while specimens of P. curilensis as large as 18 cm SL have been found, the maximum length of P. crassiceps is 14.8 cm SL. Although almost no light penetrates to the deep sea from the surface, the crested bigscale has evolved features that make it practically invisible. Like other deep sea fish, it needs to avoid being seen by predators, some of which hunt for prey by creating their own light by means of bioluminescence. The crested bigscale achieves invisibility by having a skin that absorbs light with great efficiency. The pigment melanin is crammed into granules which are grouped into melanophores which cover virtually the whole of the dermis. This absorbs almost all of the incoming light, and any remaining light that scatters sideways is absorbed by neighbouring granules. The melanophores also cover the big scales, but these detach easily, and any predator that gets close enough, may end up with a mouthful of scales. Altogether, the absorption of light is 99.5% efficient, a fact that makes photographing this fish in its natural habitat very difficult. == References  External links == * Crested Bigscale at the Digital Fish Library - With some images of crested bigscales. * Fishbase Article on Poromitra crassiceps - Much more information with references. * R√©sultats des campagnes scientifiques - Prince Albert I of Monaco (french) Category:Melamphaidae Category:Deep sea fish Category:Fish described in 1878 ","title":"Poromitra crassiceps"},{"id":"35905470","text":"Renberg is a surname.

It was founded by Bill Blosser and Susan Sokol Blosser in 1971 in what is now known as the Dundee Hills AVA. Sokol Blosser Winery is family owned and operated by second generation co-Presidents, siblings Alex and Alison Sokol Blosser, and is the 6th largest wine producer in Oregon.Klooster, K. ‚ÄòFinalizing 2011 Numbers‚Äô Oregon Wine Press, February 1, 2012.

The first Pinot noir vines were planted on a 5-acre plot on a dilapidated prune orchard in 1971, and the first vintage was produced in 1977. That year, the first tasting room was built, designed by John Storrs. Additional vineyard land was purchased in 1980, bringing the estate total to 72 acres, and 20 acres of neighboring land was purchased in 2007 and planted to Pinot noir in 2008. In 2006, founder Susan Sokol Blosser wrote At Home in the Vineyard: Cultivating a Winery, an Industry, and a Life, a memoir published by University of California Press about the experience of founding the winery.Sokol Blosser, Susan (2006). At Home in the Vineyard: Cultivating a Winery, an Industry, and a Life. University of California Press. The winery started construction on a new tasting room in 2013, designed by architect Brad Cloepfil. ==Sustainability== Sokol Blosser Winery has been Certified Organic by the Oregon Department of Agriculture since 2005. In 1996, Sokol Blosser‚Äôs vineyards were the first to be certified Salmon-Safe, a program launched by the Pacific Rivers Council to publicize products produced without using pesticides and causing runoff that would harm salmon. Sokol Blosser‚Äôs underground barrel cellar became the first US winery to receive LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification.Mitham, P. 'Going for Gold' Wines & Vines, January 2010. At the north end of a main Pinot noir vineyard block is a 24kW photovoltaic solar panel array, which was installed in 2006 and provides for approximately 25% of the Winery‚Äôs energy needs.

Oxy. 222 or P. Oxy. II 222) is a List of Olympic victors by an unknown author, written in Greek. It was discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a roll. It is dated to the third century. Currently it is housed in the British Library (Department of Manuscripts, 1185) in London.P. Oxy. 222 at the Oxyrhynchus Online == Description == The document was written by an unknown copyist. The recto side contains a List of Olympic victors from the years BC 480 to 468 and 456 to 448. The verso side contains an accounting of money. The measurements of the fragment are 180 by 95 mm. The text is written in a small semi-cursive hand. It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1899. ==Significance== According to Grenfell and Hunt, \\"the number of interesting points upon which the papyrus throws new light is very considerable.\\" A few examples of these points are as follows: The manuscript allowed the dating of Pindar's victory odes on the Pythian Games to be definitively confirmed at 582 BC. It also allowed the dates of three of Pindar's odes, which had previously been disputed, to be determined precisely. The papyrus also dated Pindar's First Olympian Ode and the Fifth ode of Bacchylides. This papyrus proved that Bacchylides was alive as late as 452 BC, when the latest previously known date was 468 BC. It showed that Polykleitos and Pythagoras of Rhegium flourished in the fifth century BC. It also cleared up a long-disputed point of interpretation of a passage in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (vii 4.2). The more general value of the papyrus lies in its bearing on the wider question of the credibility of early scholiasts and commentators on matters of fact of the sort discussed in the manuscript. Because it was found at a remote and relatively unimportant center of Hellenic culture, it shows that such information was widely diffused and easily accessible throughout the Hellenic world. Given such diffusion, false statements of fact by ancient authors would have been easily detected, which makes it very unlikely that such authors would risk exposure by making things up. Thus this manuscript supports an assumption of the trustworthiness of ancient tradition as a sound principle of modern textual criticism. == See also == * Oxyrhynchus Papyri * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 221 * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 223 == References == 222 Category:3rd- century manuscripts Category:British Library collections ","title":"Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 222"},{"id":"35905734","text":"Maiestas oryzae (formerly Recilia oryzae) is a species of plant-sucking bug from the Cicadellidae family that can be found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Henan, province of China. and the far-eastern Russian maritime.

It was built to replace a previous Roman Catholic church in Holyhead dedicated to St Mary, which was built in 1860 but could only seat 150 people. By the 1960s, the old church had 1,000 parishioners. The new church, which cost ¬£50,000 and could seat 880 people, was opened in 1965. An extension to the church in 1992 added a church hall and a library. St Mary's is described in a book describing the buildings of north Wales as \\"a large formal square church\\"; the authors also noted the copper roof, and the platform upon which the church is raised. The church is part of Caernarfon Deanery within the Diocese of Wrexham. As of 2013, the parish priest is Father Frank Murray, of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The parish of Holyhead also includes St Therese's Church, Rhosneigr. The pattern of services (as of 2013) is for a celebration of Mass on Sunday morning at 11am (with a vigil Mass on Saturday evening) and Mass every weekday morning preceded by Morning Prayer. In April 2008, the church was burgled and vandalised. ¬£230 from collection boxes was stolen, a font was damaged, paint was poured into the speaker system, white spirit was poured across banners, and hymn books were damaged.

It is the location of the Franciscan monastery with the miraculous statue of St. Anne and the imposing calvary, which is an important destination for Roman Catholic pilgrimage. It has been a strategic location important to both German and Polish nationalists, and in 1921 it was the site of the Battle of Annaberg, commemorated in the Third Reich by the construction of a Thingst√§tte (Amphitheatre) and a mausoleum. The theatre remains, but the Nazi mausoleum was destroyed and replaced with a monument to those who took part in the Third Silesian Uprising. The Composed Cultural and Natural Landscape of G√≥ra ≈öwiƒôtej Anny was announced one of Poland's official Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii) by the National Heritage Board of Poland and the President of Poland. ==Geology== The Annaberg is a volcanic cone of Tertiary basalt, the easternmost end of the Silesian volcanic belt and the easternmost occurrence of basalt in Europe.Review: \\"Dr. Partsch's 'Silesia,--A Geographical Study'\\", The Geographical Journal, Royal Geographical Society, 7 (1896) 417-20, p. 419: \\"the Annaberg (1350 feet), the most easterly cone of Tertiary basalt in Europe.\\"Henning S√∏rensen, The Alkaline Rocks, London/New York: Wiley, 1974, , p. 260.Sidney Osborne, The Upper Silesian Question and Germany's Coal Problem, London: Allen and Unwin, 1920, , p. 150: \\"The Annaberg, about 1300 feet high, situate[d] approximately ten miles southwest of Gross Strehlitz, contains beds of basalt, and it is a noteworthy fact that it is the most eastern point in Europe where basalt can be found.\\" It is high.\\"Schlesien (Preu√üisch-)\\", Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon Volume 14 Rudera--Soccus, 14th ed.

It was formerly known as the Chelmberg; around 1100 a wooden chapel to St. George was built on the hill,Chmielus, p. 400. and it became known as the Georgenberg (St. George's hill). In 1516 the noble family of von Gaschin, who had moved to Silesia from Poland in the mid-15th century, erected a church dedicated to St. Anne on the Chelmberg. The hill became a popular pilgrimage destination, especially after the donation in 1560 of a wooden statue of St. Anne, containing relics, which is still in the church today. Count Melchior Ferdinand von Gaschin wanted to make the hill the seat of Franciscans, and during the Swedish-Polish War, the order decided to close its houses in Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w and move to Silesia for safety, and an agreement was made under which they would take over the church on the Annaberg. 22 Franciscans moved there on 1 November 1655.Lucius Teichmann, Die Franziskanerkl√∂ster in Mittel- und Ostdeutschland, 1223-1993 (ehemaliges Ostdeutschland in den Reichsgrenzen von 1938), Studien zur katholischen Bistums- und Klostergeschichte 37, Leipzig: Benno, 1995, , p. 96 The count had a simple wooden monastery building built and replaced the church with a new stone building which was dedicated on 1 April 1673.Chmielus, p. 401. The church attracted increasing numbers of pilgrims and led to the hill's becoming known as St. Anne's hill. In addition to pilgrims' hostels and other infrastructure, in the 19th century, three publishing firms were established to serve the needs of pilgrims, by Franz Gielnik, Michael Rogier and Adolf Marcyago.Nieke, p. 88. In 1864, 400,000 pilgrims visited the church. The Annaberg viewed from the south at a distance of about 25 km After the First World War, a plebiscite was held on 20 March 1921 under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles to determine whether the parts of Silesia which had belonged to Prussia and thus to the German Empire would remain German or join the reconstituted Poland. In the parish of Annaberg, as in most of Upper Silesia, a majority voted for Germany, but the local administrative district (Landkreis Gro√ü Strehlitz) was one of the areas where the majority favoured union with Poland. In early May the Third Silesian Uprising began, with Polish units of the Wawelberg Group, against the wishes of the Polish government, seeking to unite with Poland those areas that had voted for it. On 4 May they captured the Annaberg, which in addition to the cultural importance of the monastery for German Silesians, had strategic importance since it dominates the Oder valley,Carlos Caballero Jurado, The German Freikorps 1918-23, Elite Series 76, Oxford: Osprey, 2001, , p. 32. from the legally limited forces of the German army. On 21-23 May, in the Battle of Annaberg, unofficial German forces of the Upper Silesian Selbstschutz and the Bavarian Freikorps Oberland, under the command of Generalleutnant Bernhard von H√ºlsen, retook the hill despite having no artillery of their own.Christian Raitz von Frentz, A Lesson Forgotten: Minority Protection Under the League of Nations: The Case of the German Minority in Poland, 1920-1934, Arbeiten zur Geschichte Osteuropas 8, M√ºnster: Lit / New York: St. Martin's, 1999, , pp. 76-77.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland, Volume 2 1795 to the Present, 1981, rev. ed.

Several participants on the German side were later prominent in the Nazi regime. With the battle added to its existing role symbolising the Catholic identity of Silesia within predominantly Protestant Prussia, the Annaberg became a powerful symbol of German regional nationalism; it features in this role in the 1927 propaganda film Land unterm Kreuz.Haubold, p. 349. It also had religious and cultural importance for Polish Silesians; it was the subject of a poem by Norbert Bonczyk; and after the 1921 battle, also became a political symbol for Poles.Haubold, p. 356.

Analysen zur √Ñsthetik eines unbew√§ltigten Mythos, ed. Reiner Stommer with Claudia Gabriele Philipp, Marburg: Jonas, 1982, , pp. 155-92, pp. 169-70 The intent was for the complex of mausoleum and theatre to be a counter to the monastery and \\"transform the Annaberg into the symbol of Upper Silesia and an appropriate site of religious and national celebration\\".Haubold, p. 354: \\"Ausbau des Annaberges zum Wahrzeichen Oberschlesiens und zu einer w√ºrdigen religi√∂sen und nationalen Feierst√§tte\\". However, after its inauguration in May 1938, the theatre was not used again for ceremonies, while pilgrims continued to visit the monastery in ever increasing numbers. The mausoleum was dynamited in 1945 and in 1955 was replaced by a monument to the Silesian rebels, designed by Xawery Dunikowski.Dobesz, \\"Der Umgang mit dem Bau- und Kunsterbe\\", p. 305. The monks have been expelled from the monastery three times, under Napoleon (in 1810; pilgrims brought their own priests with them and the Franciscans did not return until 1859), Bismarck, and Hitler. When they returned in 1945, they did not reinstate German-language services at the church until June 1989.Politische Studien 41 (1990) p. 731 \\"G√≥ra ≈öwiƒôtej Anny\\", in Mark Salter and Jonathan Bousfield, Rough Guide to Poland, 5th ed.

Helmut Kohl had intended to attend a service there during his reconciliation tour of Poland in November 1989 from which he was recalled by the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November.Christoph Gunkel, \\"Helmut Kohls Polen-Reise 1989: Problemfall Mauerfall\\", einestages, Der Spiegel, retrieved 23 May 2012 (This was regarded as an unfortunate choice and Kohl was instead taken to Helmut von Moltke's estate, where a chaotic mass in Polish took place with members of the German minority attempting to sing hymns to St. Anne.Peter Schneider, German Comedy: Scenes of Life After the Wall, tr. Philip Boehm and Leigh Hafrey, New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux/Noonday / London: Macmillan, 1992, , pp. 54-55.) The monastery today draws thousands of pilgrims every year, particularly from Upper Silesia itself and especially for St. Anne's Day, 26 July, and for the Catholic Church is a symbol of piety that transcends national boundaries.Haubold, p. 347. In March 1980, Pope John Paul II declared the church a minor basilica.Teichmann, p. 185. On 14 April 2004, the Annaberg was declared a Polish historic monument.Sankt Annaberg: Sanktuarium der hl. Anna Selbdritt Pomnik historii, G√≥ra ≈öwiƒôtej Anny: Sanktuarium ≈õwiƒôtej Anny Samotrzeciej ==MonumentsMonastery=== Interior of the monastery church The monastery buildings, at the top of the hill, are Baroque; the church was rebuilt in 1665 and the other buildings, which form a quadrangle on its south side, date to 1733-49.Jahrbuch der Schlesischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t zu Breslau 32 (1992) p. 95 The main object of veneration by the pilgrims is a statue of St. Anne with the Virgin and Child carved out of lime wood above the main altar in the church, about tall, which supposedly contains relics of the saint from the monastery of Ville near Lyons in France and is credited with miracles. It is said to have been donated to the church by Nikolaus von Kochtitzky, a local nobleman, in 1560, and is dressed in cloth of gold with pearls. Outside the church is the Paradiesplatz (Paradise Square), a formal monastery garden laid out in 1804. Below the monastery there is a Calvary (a path between stations of the Passion of Christ) with 33 Baroque chapels as stations. This was specified in the will of Count Melchior Ferdinand von Gaschin, who thought the landscape of the Annaberg resembled that of Jerusalem and its surroundings; it was constructed under his nephew, Georg Adam von Gaschin, in 1700-09 to designs by Domenico Signo and partly rebuilt in 1764 and again in 1780-85, when the Holy Stairs were added to designs by Christoph Worbs.Hanna Faryna-Paszkiewicz, Ma≈Çgorzata Omilanowska and Robert Pasieczny, Atlas zabytk√≥w architektury w Polsce, Warsaw: Wydawn Nauk PWN, 2001, , p. 429 According to Nieke, p. 88, more chapels were added in 1760-64 and there were 42 in the 19th century. Georg Adam and Anton von Gaschin are buried in the crypt of the Cross Chapel and depicted larger than life on its central columns.Chmielus, p. 403. In 1912 the Lourdes Grotto was added.Alma Mater (Jagiellonian University) 100 (2008) p. 25 ===Amphitheatre=== The Thingst√§tte or open-air theatre for Thingspiele, Nazi multi-disciplinary performances, was built in 1934-36, the first in Silesia. It was designed by Franz B√∂hmer and Georg Pettich and had seats for 7,000, standing room for 20,000, and the capacity to hold up to 50,000. Since the war it has been used for harvest festivals and concerts and attempts have been made to fund restoration, but in 2008 the stonework was in serious disrepair.Radoslaw Dimitrov, \\"Amfiteatr na G√≥rze ≈öwiƒôtej Anny rozpada siƒô\\", Nowa Trybuna Opolska, 9 September 2008 The theatre and mausoleum in a Nazi-era photograph ===Mausoleum=== In 1936-38, a mausoleum for the 51 Freikorps members who had died in the Battle of Annaberg was added at the top of the cliff above the amphitheatre. It was designed by Robert Tischler, chief architect for the German War Graves Commission, in military style, recalling a medieval fortress such as the Hohenstaufen Castel del Monte.Gunnar Brands, \\"From World War I Cemeteries to the Nazi 'Fortresses of the Dead': Architecture, Heroic Landscape, and the Quest for National Identity in Germany\\", in Places of Commemoration: Search for Identity and Landscape Design, ed. Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn, 19th Dumbarton Oaks Colloquium on the History of Landscape Architecture, 1995, Washington, DC: Dumbarton Oaks, 2001, , pp. 215-56, p. 241. One writer at the time compared it to a gun turret.Janusz L. Dobesz, \\"Der Umgang mit den Bauten aus der NS-Zeit in Polen\\", in Die Schleifung: Zerst√∂rung und Wiederaufbau historischer Bauten in Deutschland und Polen, ed. Dieter Bingen and Hans-Martin Hinz, Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Deutschen Polen-Instituts Darmstadt 20, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2005, , pp. 188-98, p. 192 According to Ken Worpole, Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West, London: Reaktion, 2003, , p. 93, it was actually fortified. It was circular, with heavy columns of rusticated sandstone surmounted by eternal flames, and a narrow entrance leading to an ambulatory lit only by narrow windows reminiscent of gun-slits, while on the other side a dark stairway suggestive of passage between worlds led down into the crypt cut out of the rock. Niches contained sarcophagi labelled with stages in the military history of Germany from 1914 to \\"1931/32: Deutschland erwache!\\" (Germany, awake!), and in the centre was a statue of a fallen warrior in green porphyry, by Fritz Schmoll known as Eisenwerth, which the sculptor and his assistants had created in place during construction of the monument because it would have been too large to bring through the entrance. A cupola admitted diffused light, and predominantly gold mosaics by R√∂ssler of Dresden and Klemm of Munich depicted stylised German eagles and swastikas.Dobesz, \\"Der Umgang mit dem Bau- und Kunsterbe\\", pp. 304-05. A 1938 description in a publication of the War Graves Commission described the dead there as \\"keep[ing] watch on the border and encourag[ing] the border region and its people to preserve German character and German faith\\" and pointed out the location midway between the Hindenburg monument at Tannenberg and the monuments in the K√∂nigsplatz in Munich.Quoted in Lurz, pp. 169-70; translation from Brands, p. 241. The surroundings of the monument were made a nature preserve, and to complete their pilgrimage, visitors had to walk up from the level of the theatre through the natural environment.Brands, p. 242. Tischler designed several monuments in a similar somewhat rustic style reminiscent both of medieval fortresses and of the Hindenburg monument.Sergiusz Michalski, Public Monuments: Art in Political Bondage, 1870-1997, Essays in art and culture, London: Reaktion, 1998, , pp. 102-04. ===Monument to the uprising=== Monument to the rebels, photographed in 2007 The mausoleum was dynamited in 1945 and in 1955 a monument to the Silesian rebels (), designed by Xawery Dunikowski, was dedicated in its place on the tenth anniversary of the liberation.Haubold, p. 361. This is a simple classical design with four pillars in rectangular section surrounding an eternal flame and supporting architraves, under which are four massive granite sculptures of \\"Silesian heads\\". There are industrial symbols on the gables. On the inside, the pillars are decorated with stylised depictions of miners, Silesian peasants, ironworkers, and a mother with a child on her arm in the manner of caryatids, while the exterior surfaces have drawings outlined in lead of everyday and work scenes from the present and the past and scenes of the uprising itself. These included conflicts with the Germans since the medieval period of the Teutonic Knights, implying eternal enmity between Germans and Poles, and for the 25th anniversary of the uprising in 1946, urns containing ashes of people killed by the Nazis in the Warsaw Uprising had been interred there. However, by 1955 the anti-German message was overshadowed by the message of praise for the forerunners of the Communist state. Dunikowski had already sketched ideas for the monument in early 1946, and won a contest to design it, but he was less expert as an architect than as a sculptor and was under official pressure, and the building does not have the intended impressive effect.Dobesz, \\"Der Umgang mit dem Bau- und Kunsterbe\\", pp. 305-06. ==Gallery== File:Kloster St. Annaberg.JPG18th-century depiction of the Franciscan monastery File:Gora Sw Anny Kreuzweg 2003.jpgLourdes Grotto File:G√≥ra ≈õw.

He is the younger brother of Andra≈æ Struna. ==Club career FC Koper === Struna began his career in the youth ranks of Slovenian PrvaLiga side FC Koper. He made his first team debut on 11 April 2009, coming on as a substitute in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Maribor. Although Struna played primarily with the youth teams, he made two first team appearances in the 2008‚Äì09 season. Struna found more playing time at the beginning of the 2009‚Äì10 season, appearing in fifteen league games and twice in the Slovenian Cup. He scored his first goal for Koper on 12 December 2009 in a 4‚Äì0 win over Celje. Struna would go on loan to Slovenian Third League club Jadran Dekani for the second half of the season. Koper would go on to win the PrvaLiga. Struna returned to Koper after his brief loan. He made his first appearance of the season on 13 July 2010, making his European debut by coming on as a substitute in a UEFA Champions League qualifying match against Dinamo Zagreb. Struna established himself as a starter as the season progressed. On 2 April 2011, Struna scored his first goal of the season to help Koper defeat Maribor 3‚Äì0. He would find the net again on 6 April 2011 as Koper beat Celje.

He scored his only goal of the season on 14 September 2011 in a 2‚Äì0 win over Olimpija Ljubljana in a Slovenian Cup match. Struna and Koper would finish fourth in the league, just missing out the UEFA Europa League spot by one point. === Palermo === On 21 May 2012, Struna was sold to Italian side Palermo for ‚Ç¨300,000. In the summer he went on loan to Varese of Serie B, with an option for his new club to acquire 50% of his transfer rights by the end of the season. He missed the start of the season due to a fracture in his foot. Struna made his debut for Varese on 6 October 2012, coming on as a substitute in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Empoli. He would however suffer another injury, forcing him to miss multiple months. Struna returned to action in February 2013 and would go onto make nine appearances in his debut season in Italy. Struna returned to Palermo for the 2013‚Äì14 season. He made his debut for the club on 31 August 2013, coming on as a substitute in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Empoli. On 31 October 2013, Struna suffered a left knee injury during training. He underwent surgery on 5 November 2013. Struna was forced to miss the rest of the season due to his injury. On 29 August 2014 Struna went on loan to Serie B side Carpi for the 2014‚Äì15 season. He made his Carpi debut on 30 August 2014 in 1‚Äì1 draw with Livorno. Struna scored his first foal for Carpi on 24 December 2014 in a 4‚Äì0 win over Perugia. He made 34 appearances as he helped Carpi have the strongest defense in the league, allowing a league low 28 goals in 42 games. In part due to their stingy defense, Carpi finished first in the league and won promotion to Serie A for the first time in club history. After signing a new contract with Palermo while on loan with Carpi, Struna returned to Palermo for the 2015‚Äì16 season. He made his Serie A debut on 30 August 2015 in a 1‚Äì0 win over Udinese. However, he was suspended for the next match after picking up two yellow cards. Struna scored his first Serie A goal and his first for Palermo on 20 April 2016, finding the back of the net in the 76th minute to give Palermo a 2‚Äì2 draw with Atalanta. He helped Palermo avoid relegation, finishing 16th and one point above the relegation zone. On 31 August 2016, Struna went back to Carpi on loan for the 2016‚Äì17 season with an obligation to buy if Carpi were to be promoted. On 20 September 2016 he scored to help Carpi secure a 2‚Äì2 draw with Brescia. Struna made 30 appearances as he helped the Carpi have the fourth lowest goals against in the league. Carpi finished in seventh place and qualified for the promotion playoffs. Struna helped Carpi defeat Cittadella in the first round and defeat Frosinone 1‚Äì0 over two legs in the semi-final. Struna was forced to miss the first leg of the final after picking up two yellow cards in the second leg against Frosinone. He would return in the second leg of the final, but Benevento would win 1‚Äì0 and earn promotion. Struna returned to Palermo for the 2017‚Äì18 season, who had been relegated from Serie A the previous year. He made his first appearance of the season on 6 August 2017 in a 5‚Äì0 win over Virtus Francavilla in a Coppa Italia match. Struna made 35 Serie B appearances to help Palermo end the year with the second best defense, allowing only 39 goals in 42 matches, and finish in fourth place, qualifying for the promotion playoffs. Although he did not feature in either of the semi-final matches, he would start both of the final legs against Frosinone. However, Struna and Palermo would lose 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. Struna made his first appearance for the 2018‚Äì19 season in a 2‚Äì1 win over Lecce on 21 October 2018. On 26 October 2018, Struna scored in the 90th minute to give Palermo a 1‚Äì1 draw with Venezia. With his contract set to expire at the end of the season and the club in a poor financial situation, Palermo agreed to sell Struna in the January transfer window. === Houston Dynamo === On 24 December 2018 Struna signed with the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer. He made his Dynamo debut on 19 February 2019 in a 1‚Äì0 victory over C.D. Guastatoya in a CONCACAF Champions League match. He missed the MLS season opener and the first leg of the quarterfinals tie with Tigres UANL due to a slight thigh injury. Struna returned to action on 9 March 2019, making his MLS debut in a 2‚Äì1 win over the Montreal Impact. While he was able to play in the second leg against Tigres, the Dynamo would lose 3‚Äì0 on aggregate. Struna had a strong debut season, playing in 29 league matches and picking up one assist, coming in a 4‚Äì2 win over the LA Galaxy on the last day of the season. He was voted as the Defensive Player of the Year by local members of the media and the technical staff. Despite Struna's strong performances, Houston ended the season in tenth place in the Western Conference, missing out on the MLS Cup Playoffs. ==International career== Struna made his first youth international appearance with the Slovenian under-18 team, appearing in three friendlies in May 2008. He made his debut with the senior national team on 23 March 2016 in a 1‚Äì0 friendly win against Macedonia. The match was played at Bonifika Stadium, his old home stadium with FC Koper. Struna made his competitive debut for Slovenia on 8 October 2016 in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier, getting the start in a 1‚Äì0 win over Slovakia. He scored his first international goal on 6 September 2019 in a 2‚Äì0 win over Poland in a UEFA 2020 Euro qualifying match. == Personal life == Struna was born and raised in Piran. When he moved to Palermo, Struna got a large tattoo of Piran on his back. He is a big fan of basketball, particularly Michael Jordan and fellow Slovenians Goran Dragiƒá and Luka Donƒçiƒá. Struna says that he likes basketball more than football and would stay up to 4am watching NBA games while living in Italy. Struna's older brother Andra≈æ Struna is also a Slovenian international footballer and was his teammate at FC Koper until 2010. Struna's nickname of \\"Kiki\\" originated because Andra≈æ struggled to pronounce his brother's name and instead called him Kiki, which was the name of a candy he liked. == Career statistics Club=== {   + ! colspan=\\"3\\" Club Performance ! colspan=\\"2\\" League ! colspan=\\"2\\" National CupIncludes the Slovenian Cup, Coppa Italia and US Open Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" Continental ! colspan=\\"2\\" Other ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Club!!Season!!League!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"5\\" Koper 2008‚Äì09  rowspan=\\"4\\" PrvaLiga 1010 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî20 - 2009‚Äì10 15120 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî171 - 2010‚Äì11 242202Appearances in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers00Slovenian Supercup 0282 - 2011‚Äì12 230212Appearances in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers0 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî271 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Koper Total !63!!3!!7!!1!!4!!0!!0!!0!!74!!4 - Jadran Dekani (loan) 2009‚Äì10 3.

It premiered at the 43rd Annual Nashville Film Festival on April 19, 2012. (Press release) Canadian distributor Mongrel Media acquired the North American rights to the film in June 2013. == Plot == In 2012, Ana, a failed writer who works as a nurse, meets Freddy, an aspiring comic book artist, on a bus. Though Ana brushes him off, Freddy persists in conversation. The two are surprised to find that they live on the same street in a small town, but before they can talk any further, the bus is involved in an apparent crash. Ana wakes up in her bed, late for work. When she arrives at the hospital, it seems deserted, though she finds a mysterious, barely-intelligible audio recording. Although the town initially seems empty, loud music draws her to Freddy's house. After comparing experiences, the two set off to explore the town. At a police station, they find that all communications channels, including radio transmitters, are down. As they explore the town limits, they discover a dark wall of fog encircles the town and is slowly encroaching. Unwilling to drive through it, they retreat to the center of town, which they discover has suddenly reverted to 1992. As Freddy unsuccessfully attempts to get the attention of passers-by, Ana observes a younger version of herself interact with her Aunt Lu. After they suddenly shift back to 2012, Freddy estimates that they have three days until the fog engulfs them. The two discuss theories, including whether they have died in the bus crash. Remembering the recording at the hospital, Ana shows it to Freddy. They are surprised to hear a real-time conversation in which doctors discuss cutting off life support for Ana in three days, as she has been in a coma for two months. Ana explains that after her aunt's protracted coma and eventual death, she signed a living will. Freddy suggests that the fog represents Ana's impending death, and the two reluctantly enter the fog to find answers. They find a locked door, thousands of keys, and a chain. They flee back to town when they hear monstrous growling, and a chained monster chases them. As they gather supplies, Freddy experiences a memory of his step-father, who attempts to bond with him after Freddy gets in trouble at school. Ana describes a play she wrote about a monster similar to the one that chased them, and Freddy shows her a comic book that he made that ends with a locked door and thousands of keys. Convinced that their experiences and memories are being brought to life, the two go to a fairground they both visited on the same day in 1992. There, they observe a brief meeting between their younger selves. Convinced that they must face the monster, they set a trap, but it only frees the monster from its chains. Freddy and Ana hole up in a church. When Ana suddenly becomes ill, Freddy leaves to confront the monster by himself. Ana is horrified to see him dragged off, and she retreats to her childhood house. There, she experiences a memory in which she performs her play with Aunt Lu. During the play's climax, Freddy's friends coerce him into petty vandalism that results in an accidental fire and Aunt Lu's coma. Back in 2012, a bruised and battered Freddy appears and apologizes before sinking into unconsciousness. When the monster appears, Ana kills it and takes the crucial key from its corpse. She drags Freddy to the door inside the fog, and when the key opens it, she pulls him across the threshold so that they escape together. In the hospital, Ana wakes up and rushes to find Freddy, whom she learns has already been released. His caretaker explains that Freddy has partial amnesia and remembers little except the crash itself. Using his sketchbook and an emotional embrace, Ana helps him to remember their shared experiences. == Cast == * Steven Strait as Freddy * Karolina Wydra as Ana * Sandra Lafferty as Aunt Lu * Madison Lintz as Young Ana * Chase Presley as Young Freddy * Jackson Walker as Phil == Production == Principal photography took place in Birmingham and Decatur, Alabama, in December 2010. == Reception == Robert Bell of Exclaim! rated it 6/10 stars and wrote, \\"While the bigger questions are thought-out and mapped intricately, the superficial conversations between Ana and Freddy lack the nuance necessary to invest us in their plight.\\" Anton Bitel of Little White Lies wrote, \\"And so After is ultimately a twisted tale of boy meets girl, in a neat merger of boyish comic-book fantasy and girlish fairytale dress-ups that all unfolds in the barren mindscape of a less imaginative adulthood.\\" Martin Hafer of Influx Magazine rated it A and compared it positively to Soultaker, which he said proved that a good film could take seemingly bad ideas and make them compelling. James Mudge of Beyond Hollywood wrote that \\"it's simply too familiar, too limp, and too dull to elicit anything other than vaguely annoyed yawns.\\" Gareth Jones of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Far too saccharine for its own good, After is an exercise in boredom that just can‚Äôt be saved by the presence of a nifty monster nor an impressively inventive take on the dead/coma premise.\\" == References  External links == * * Category:2012 films Category:2010s fantasy thriller films Category:American films Category:American fantasy thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in 1992 Category:Films set in 2012 Category:Films shot in Alabama Category:2012 directorial debut films ","title":"After (2012 film)"},{"id":"35905921","text":"FK Slavija Skopje () is a football club from the town Pr≈æino near Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.

The term \\"classicide\\" was termed by sociologist Michael Mann as a term that is similar but distinct from the term genocide. Classicide has been committed by China during the Great Leap Forward, by North Vietnam as part of the Land Reform, and by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. == Definition == Classicide is a term first used by Fred Schwarz in his 1972 book The Three Faces of Revolution. It was used later by Michael Mann as a well defined term. Classicide has since been used by sociologists to describe the unique forms of genocide that pertains to the annihilation of a class through murder or displacement and the destruction of the upper class to form an equal working class. == History  Soviet Union===  Classicide of Kulaks  In 1929, at the beginning of his dictatorship, Joseph Stalin demanded the \\"liquidation of kulaks as a class\\". The Kulaks were peasants who were deemed \\"wealthy\\" by Stalin in 1929. The idea for dekulakization first arose in 1918 from Vladimir Lenin, who claimed that the Kulaks were \\"freeloaders\\".–ê.–ê—Ä—É—Ç—é–Ω–æ–≤ ¬´–î–æ—Å—å–µ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –±–µ–∑ —Ä–µ—Ç—É—à–∏. –î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã. –§–∞–∫—Ç—ã. –°–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞.¬ª, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –í–µ—á–µ, 1999 The oppression of kulaks didn't end until 1932, throughout this time Kulaks were being evicted from their homes, having their land confiscated, shot, imprisoned, deported, or being sent to local work camps. Although the term classicide was never formally used to describe Stalin's destruction of the kulaks, Stalin did say that they had \\"... gone over from a policy of limiting the exploiting tendencies of the kulak to a policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class.\\" ===China=== In 1947, during the Chinese Civil War, three years before the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong won the hearts of the Communist Party and the peasant class by introducing a new land reform. This land reform encouraged the mass murder of landlords and well-off peasants in order to redistribute the land to the peasant class and other landless workers. The idea of killing landlords was first outlined by Kang Sheng, expert in terror tactics, in 1947. The reform was an open door for violence when Mao insisted that the peasants themselves should do the killing. Landlords were tortured. They were dismembered, buried alive, strangled, shot, etc. There is no way to know exactly how many people were killed but the numbers range anywhere from one million to 28 million. === Cambodia === In 1969 in the midst of the Vietnam war, President Nixon staged massive attacks on Cambodian soil due to his belief that the Viet Cong were hiding communist base camps, supplies and infantry in Cambodia. Nixon also believed the Viet Cong enemy was bombing US soldiers from bases established in Cambodia as well. Cambodia's then-president Lon Nol was initially unaware and did not address any of the Nixon bombings so they lasted from 1969‚Äì1975. Victims of the US attacks saw the American enemy as rich and upper-class and they also believed that Lon Nol possessed the same characteristics as Nixon‚Äîhe was rich and powerful. Pol Pot recognized the Cambodian people's fear and hatred of the upper classes and exploited this hostile environment as a tactic in order to gain control of both the lower and upper classes so the Khmer Rouge could rise to power. To enforce their rule of Cambodia and transform it into an agrarian socialist society, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge believed they needed to cleanse Cambodia by killing everyone who they considered members of its 'upper classes‚Äô, including all members of its rich and educated ‚ÄòKhmer minority‚Äô who shared cultures with the former leader, Nol. Supporters of Nol were primarily rich, upper-class elite. Therefore, Pol Pot targeted these individuals. Anyone who was educated including doctors, lawyers, and teachers were murdered. Following the bombings, by Americans, Pol Pot persuaded victims of the bombings to join the Khmer Rouge by playing on their fearful state of mind. Anyone who would not cooperate was simply murdered. Pol Pot's actions eventually led to displacement and created refugees. He soon abolished civil and political rights which enabled his genocidal policies to go unchecked. Although the majority of the people who the Khmer Rouge massacred were Vietnamese immigrants and members of Cambodia's Cham minority, over 2 million Khmer people were also murdered. Children were ripped from their families and their parents were killed in cold blood, soldiers from the former regime and speakers of foreign languages were also killed. Pol Pot continued his raids by attacking Vietnamese border towns, which eventually led the Vietnamese to invade Cambodia and put an end to his reign. Many Cambodians believe that if the Vietnamese army had not fought back, the Khmer Rouge's raids and killings would have continued for a longer period of time. === North Vietnam === Ho Chi Minh, the former leader of North Vietnam, instituted land reform in the 1950s in order to redistribute land from the holdings of landlords to the peasantry. The landlords in North Vietnam became targets of smear campaigns which were launched against them by the government, in the hope that the peasantry would revolt against the country's upper classes. Stories of rape, murder, and exploitation of the peasantry by landlords were told in order to gain the lower classes's support. The government purged landlords as a class. Most of them were executed by firing squads, stoning, and starvation and the rest of them were imprisoned in reeducation camps. The number of landlords killed during the years of the land reform ranges from 5,000 to 50,000. ==See also== * Class conflict * Dekulakization * Democide * Life unworthy of life * Mass killings of landlords under Mao Zedong * Politicide * Social cleansing ==References * Category:Crimes Category:Mass murder Category:Social classes Category:Discrimination Category:Politicides Category:Class discrimination ","title":"Classicide"},{"id":"35905980","text":"Maiestas schmidtgeni (formerly Recilia schmidtgeni) is a species of bug from the Cicadellidae family that can be found in European countries such as Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, England, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy (including Sardinia and Sicily), Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Ukraine, and southern part of Russia.

The Messenger-Inquirer serves 15,087 daily and 20,383 Sunday readers in five counties in western Kentucky. ==History== The paper was founded by Lee Lumpkin in 1875 in the form of The Examiner. In the first issue of the new publication, Lumpkin pledged \\"to aid in disseminating truth and intelligence in persuading the masses to be true to their country and just to their fellowmen.\\" By 1864, when Thomas S. Pettit purchased the paper, it had changed its name to The Monitor.Connelley and Coulter, p. 158 Immediately after taking control of the paper, Pettit published a series of items vigorously criticizing the Republican Party and its policies during the Civil War.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 141 On November 17, 1864, Pettit was arrested on orders from General Stephen G. Burbridge on charges of being \\"notoriously disloyal\\" to the Union. He was taken to Memphis, Tennessee, and transferred into Confederate territory. In May 1865, he returned to Owensboro and found his print shop and printing press had been destroyed by federal authorities. He traveled to Cincinnati, Ohio to purchase replacement equipment and, on hearing the story of his arrest and subsequent travels, the equipment dealer extended him a generous line of credit, allowing him to purchase more sophisticated equipment than had ever before been used in Owensboro. With this new equipment, Pettit revived the Monitor and published his stories of wartime banishment, bringing him significant acclaim in Kentucky. Moreover, he also published editorials by future U.S. Senator Thomas C. McCreery, giving the Monitor further credibility and increasing its readership. After many years of publishing the Monitor, Pettit sold the paper to Urey Woodson, who changed its name to the Owensboro Messenger. Woodson was editor of the Messenger from 1880 to 1929, when it was sold to the Hager family, who already owned the Owensboro Inquirer. That family maintained ownership of the paper until 1996, when it was sold to A. H. Belo. In 2000, Belo sold the paper to its current owner, Paxton Media Group.Belo sells Kentucky daily == Reputation and awards == The Messenger-Inquirer has consistently been recognized as one of the top papers in Kentucky, winning first place in the Kentucky Press Association's Better Newspaper Contest in 1996 and 2000 and taking second place five times this decade. In all, the M-I news staff has taken home more than 80 state awards since 2004 while competing against the state's largest newspapers. In 1989, the Messenger-Inquirer was chosen by the University of Missouri School of Journalism as one of the nation's top five small dailies. That same year, the American Society of Newspaper Editors named the M-I one of the nation's 14 best small dailies. ==References== * * ==External links== *Official website Category:Newspapers published in Kentucky Category:Owensboro, Kentucky Category:Publications established in 1875 ","title":"Messenger-Inquirer"},{"id":"35906015","text":"A Scanian derby () is the name given to any fixture between football clubs in Scania, the southernmost county and traditional province of Sweden.

Dean Andersson is an American writer of fantasy fiction and horror novels since 1981, both under his own name and under the pseudonym Asa Drake. == Biography == Best known as a writer of fiction in the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres. Other work: television graphic artist, professional musician in United States Air Force bands, robotics computer programmer, and a technical writer specializing in software documentation for mainframe relational database management systems.C. Dean Andersson  Author Born in the United States of America, state of Kansas, his childhood in Kansas served as a setting for the novel, Buried Screams, and for several scenes in the novel, Raw Pain Max. A childhood encounter with Dracula in a small Kansas movie theater led to a fascination with the character and vampires in general that inspired research and spawned two novels, Crimson Kisses and I Am Dracula. Having a Swedish-American father led to an interest in Scandinavian Mythology and Viking Age history, used for the Scandinavian Mythos Bloodsong Saga Warrior Witch of Hel, Death Riders of Hel, Werebeasts of Hel, and Valkyries of Hel (in-progress). Familiarity with Dallas, Texas provided background for the Dallas Horror Trilogy, Torture Tomb, Raw Pain Max, and Fiend. Childhood fear of Witches caused by Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs led to studies of historical Witchcraft persecutions, modern NeoPagan religions, and Goddess Spirituality that influenced thematic elements in many novels. C. Dean Andersson is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. He has a BS in Astrophysics and a BA in Art. He is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and was a Bram Stoker Award nominee. === Prizes, honors, awards, tributes === For academic achievement, elected to Sigma Pi Sigma (Physics Honor Society), Beta Gamma Sigma (Business Honor Society), Phi Kappa Phi (National Honor Society).

The franchise also sells branded merchandise and music videos. Talking Tom and Talking Angela's music video for their single \\"You Get Me\\", created in cooperation with Walt Disney Records, has received over 350 million views on YouTube as of March 2020. Talking Angela has also recorded her first solo song called \\"That's Falling in Love\\". Talking Tom and Talking Angela's \\"Stand By Me\\" received 26 million views as of April 2020. Talking Tom and Friends launched a range of interactive toys called Superstar in 2012. The plush toys talk and interact with multiple Talking Tom and Friends apps, as well as with each other, using a voice recognition system. The series has since been discontinued. ==ControversiesPaedophile hoax=== In February 2014, Talking Angela was the subject of an Internet hoax claiming that it encourages children to disclose personal information about themselves, which is allegedly then used by paedophiles to identify the location of these children. The rumor, which was widely circulated on Facebook and various websites claiming to be dedicated to parenting, claims that Angela, the game's main character, asks the game's user for private personal information using the game's text-chat feature. Other versions of the rumor even attribute the disappearance of a child to the app, or claim that it is run by a paedophile ring, while some go so far as to even claim that the user is recorded by the camera and can be seen in Angela's eyes. The former rumor originated from an article on Huzlers, which has since been proven to be fake, like many articles on the satirical website. The rumour has been claimed to be true even by YouTubers and even on the app's review page on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, even though there have been no verified reports of the said events happening. It was debunked by Snopes.com soon afterwards. The site's owners, Barbara and David Mikkelson, reported that they had tried to \\"prompt\\" it to give responses asking for private information but were unsuccessful, even when asking it explicitly sexual questions. While it is true that in the game with child mode off Angela does ask for the user's name, age and personal preferences to determine conversation topics, Outfit7 has said that this information is all \\"anonymized\\" and all personal information is removed from it. It is also impossible for a person to take control of what Angela says in the game, since the app is based on chat bot software. In 2015, the hoax was revived again on Facebook, prompting online security company Sophos and The Guardian to debunk it again. Sophos employee Paul Ducklin wrote on the company's blog that the message being posted on Facebook promoting the hoax was \\"close to 600 rambling, repetitious words, despite claiming at the start that it didn‚Äôt have words to describe the situation. It's ill-written, and borders on being illiterate and incomprehensible.\\" Bruce Wilcox, one of the game's programmers, has attributed the hoax's popularity to the fact that the chatbot program in Talking Angela is so realistic. However, genuine concern has been raised that the game's child mode may be too easy for children to turn off, which, if they did, would allow them to purchase \\"coins\\", which can be used as currency in the game, via iTunes. Disabling child mode also enables the chat feature, which, while not \\"connecting your children to pedophiles,\\" still raises concerns as well, according to Stuart Dredge, a journalist from The Guardian. Dredge wrote that in chat mode, Angela asks for information such as the user's name. Impact The scare has significantly boosted the game's popularity, and is credited with helping the app make it into the top 10 free iPhone apps soon after the hoax became widely known in February 2015 and 3rd most popular for all iPhone apps at the start of the following month. === Age-inappropriate advertising === In 2015, the My Talking Tom app was reported for having advertised age-inappropriate advertisements for adult services. The Advertising Standards Authority of the United Kingdom ruled that advertising for an adult web site was delivered to underage children via the app. The ASA noted that Outfit7 \\"had a strict advertising policy\\" but that the company \\"had not been able to identify which ad network had served an age-inappropriate ad on a children‚Äôs app\\" and how the advertisements were shown in the app. ==Reception== My Talking Tom had over 11 million downloads and was the top games app in 135 countries worldwide within 10 days of its launch. The Talking Tom and Friends YouTube channel has over 10 million subscribers and 3.5 billion views as of March 2020. As of April 2020, the franchise has had its apps downloaded more than 12 billion times. ==Accolades== The My Talking Tom app won the award for \\"Best iPad Game: Kids, Education & Family\\" at the 2014 Tabby Awards, the global competition for the best tablet app. My Talking Tom was also voted the 2014 Tabby Award Users‚Äô Choice favorite in two categories, \\"Best iPad Game: Kids, Education & Family\\" and \\"Best Android Game: Puzzle, Cards & Family\\". The Talking Tom and Friends television series won the Best Animated Series Award at the 2016 Cablefax Awards. == See also == * List of most downloaded Android applications * Digital puppetry ==References * Category:Android (operating system) software Category:IOS software Category:Video games adapted into television shows Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2010 Category:Mass media franchises Category:Fictional cats ","title":"Talking Tom and Friends"},{"id":"35906177","text":"Maiestas truncatus (formerly Recilia truncatus) is a species of insect from Cicadellidae family that is endemic to India.

He is sometimes referred to as Jon Izaguirre, to retain the correct pronunciation under Castilian orthography. ==Career== Born in Ormaiztegi in the Basque Country, Izagirre comes from a family of professional cyclists, as both his father Jos√© Ram√≥n and brother Gorka have competed professionally on the roads and in cyclo-cross. Having joined the team ‚Äì alongside brother Gorka ‚Äì from the 2011 season onwards, Izagirre won his first professional races in the spring of 2012; he won the individual time trial at the Vuelta a Asturias in April, before taking a victory during his Grand Tour d√©but at the Giro d'Italia. During the sixteenth stage, Izagirre made a solo breakaway with remaining, before winning the stage by sixteen seconds from his nearest competitor. Following the collapse of the Euskatel-Euskadi team at the end of the 2013 season, both Izagirre brothers were signed by the for the 2014 season. In 2015, Izagirre won the Tour de Pologne. He started the final stage sixth on general classification but overhauled race leader Sergio Henao () and the others above him by virtue of a superior time trial performance on the rolling 25 km circuit.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/third-time-lucky-for- overall-winner-izagirre-at-the-tour-de-pologne/ Izagirre won Stage 20 of the 2016 Tour de France in Morzine, after attacking on the wet descent from a three rider group that led over the final climb of Col de Joux Plane. Izagirre moved to the newly formed team for the 2017 season. He was the team's GC leader at the 2017 Tour de France, but crashed out on Stage 1, an individual time trial in D√ºsseldorf, suffering a lumbar fracture which ended his season.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/ion-izagirre-sustains-lumbar-fracture- in-tour-de-france-crash/ He was joined at by his brother Gorka for the 2018 season. In August 2018 it was announced that the brothers would join in 2019. ==Major results== Izagirre at the 2017 Paris‚ÄìNice, where he finished in seventh place. ;2006 : 3rd Junior race, National Cyclo-cross Championships ;2008 : 1st Gipuzkoa Individual Time Trial : 3rd Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships ;2009 : 1st Under-23 race, Basque Cyclo-cross Championships : 1st Memorial Angel Mantecon : 1st Stage 4 Bizkaiko Bira : 5th Overall Bidasoa Itzulia ;2011 : 4th Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia ;2012 : 1st Stage 16 Giro d'Italia : 1st Stage 2b (ITT) Vuelta a Asturias : 3rd Les Boucles du Sud Ard√®che : 7th Overall Tour de Pologne ;2013 : 2nd Road race, National Road Championships : 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne : 4th Overall Tour Down Under : 9th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr√©al ;2014 : National Road Championships ::1st 20px Road race ::2nd Time trial : 2nd Overall Tour de Pologne : 4th Overall Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a : 6th Overall Tour of Britain : 8th Overall Tour de Romandie ;2015 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Pologne : 2nd GP Miguel Indur√°in : 2nd Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia : 3rd 15px Team time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 10th Overall Volta ao Algarve ;2016 : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships : 1st GP Miguel Indur√°in : 1st Stage 20 Tour de France : 2nd Overall Volta ao Algarve : 2nd Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st Stage 8 (ITT) : 3rd Overall Tour de Romandie ::1st Prologue : 4th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana : 5th Overall Paris‚ÄìNice : 8th Time trial, Olympic Games : 8th Overall Eneco Tour : 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr√©al ;2017 : 3rd Road race, National Road Championships : 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 5th Overall Tour de Romandie : 5th Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge : 6th Overall Tour de Suisse : 6th Vuelta a Murcia : 7th Overall Paris‚ÄìNice : 7th Amstel Gold Race ;2018 : 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships : 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 4th Overall Paris‚ÄìNice : 6th Giro di Lombardia : 7th Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n : 9th Overall Vuelta a Espa√±a ;2019 : 1st 20px Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 1st 20px Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana : 1st Stage 8 Paris‚ÄìNice : 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Vuelta a Espa√±a : 2nd Overall Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a ;2020 : 4th Overall Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a : 7th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana ===General classification results timeline=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" colspan=11 align=\\"center\\"Grand Tour general classification results - !

Ongan is a small family of two attested languages in the Andaman Islands, while Austronesian is one of the largest language families in the world, with a thousand languages spread across the Pacific. The proposed connection has been criticized and rejected by other linguists.Robert Blust (2014) \\"Some Recent Proposals Concerning the Classification of the Austronesian Languages\\", Oceanic Linguistics 53:2:300-391. ==Sound correspondences== Blevins (2007) proposes the following sound correspondences: {class= +Consonants -align=center !Proto-Austronesian (PAN) *p*t*k*q*ku*qu* î*b*d*g*s, *S*c, *C*z*j*h*m*n*ny*≈ã*N*l*r*R*w -align=center !Proto- Ongan (PO) *p*tcolspan=2*kcolspan=2*kw* î*b*d*j, *gcolspan=3*c*j, *y*h, *y, *‚àÖ*m*n*ny*≈ã*l, *y*l*r*l, *r*w } There is neutralization and sometimes loss of final nasals in Proto- Ongan, with final **n merged into Proto-Ongan *≈ã, and final **m and **ny partially merged into *≈ã. (The latter merger, and loss, may post-date Proto- Ongan.) Final (oral) stops are lost in multisyllabic words (unstressed syllables?) in Proto-Ongan. Initial **b drops from Proto-Ongan before **u and perhaps before **i. **qw and **kw become *kw in Proto-Ongan, and *q/k or *w in Proto-AN. Proto-Ongan and Proto-AN share a typologically odd restriction against root-initial *m-. Vowel-initial words in Proto-Ongan correspond to *q in Proto-AN; because the Austronesian forms often include doublets, Blevins believes this is due to epenthesis in Proto-AN. {class= +Vowels in open, non-final syllables -align=center !Proto-Austronesian (PAN) *i*u*a*…ô*ay# -align=center !Proto-Ongan (PO) *i*u, *o*a, *e*e*e# } Final **ay has become *e in Proto-Ongan. *e also derives from **a before palatals, word-finally, and when unstressed. Proto-Ongan *o typically derives from **u in a checked syllable, or from assimilation as in **wa. Proto-Ongan *…ô is thought to have been an allophone of *e, found before coda nasals except after palatals. ==Grammatical correspondences== Most derivational morphology and grammatical words are so short that the several resemblances between Proto-Ongan and Proto-AN may be chance. However, Ongan morphology does appear to explain an odd situation in Austronesian. Proto- Austronesian has a limited set of reconstructed vowel-initial roots, all of which are kin terms, body parts, or other readily possessed nouns. Ongan languages have inalienable possession, and inalienably possessed nouns are all vowel initial. Elsewhere, vowel-initial roots in Proto-Ongan correspond to initial *q- in Proto-Austronesian. The complete list of vowel-initial Proto-AN roots reconstructed by Blust is as follows: ;Kin: *aki grandfather; *ama father, paternal uncle; *aNak child; *apu grandparent/grandchild; *aya paternal aunt; *ina mother, maternal aunt ;Body: *ujung/ijung nose; *ikuR tail; *iSeq urine; *uRat vein, sinew; *utaq vomit ;Other: *asu/wasu dog; *aCab cover; *ian home; *uNay splinter These are all the kinds of words expected in inalienable-possession systems.*aCab 'cover' may be cognate with Proto-Ongan *otab 'head', Blevins suggests that inalienable possession was lost from Proto-Austronesian, presumably after epenthetic *q- was added to vowel-initial words. There are many Proto-AN doublets like *wasu, *asu 'dog'; initial *w- has also been lost from *w-anaN 'right side' and *w-iRi 'left side' in Pazeh and other languages, from what Blust describes as \\"some now-obscured morphological process\\".Blevins, p 183 Blevins suggests that in all three cases, the Proto-Austronesian *w- reflects the Proto-Ongan possessive prefix *gw- 'his, her', which remained as a fossil in some daughter languages. Thus proto-Austronesian‚ÄìOngan may explain some of the odd patterns found in proto- Austronesian. ==Criticism== The connection between Austronesian and Ongan has not been supported by Austronesianists. Robert Blust (2014) finds that Blevins' conclusions are not supported by her data: Of her first 25 reconstructions, none are reproducible using the comparative method, and Blust concludes that the grammatical comparison does not hold up. Blust also cites non-linguistic (such as cultural, archaeological, and biological) evidence against Blevins' hypothesis.Robert Blust (2014) \\"Some Recent Proposals Concerning the Classification of the Austronesian Languages\\", Oceanic Linguistics 53:2:300-391. ==References== * (available here) * * Category:Proposed language families ","title":"Austronesian‚ÄìOngan languages"},{"id":"35906279","text":"Nina Romberg has been an American writer since 1978.

Psychological Review, 102, 246-268. ==Biography== Shoda was born and grew up in Japan. He studied physics at Hokkaido University in Sapporo. After attending the University of California, Santa Cruz, he started graduate school in psychology at Stanford, and finished at Columbia University with a PhD degree in psychology in 1990. He joined the University of Washington in 1996. In 1995 he co-authored with Walter Mischel a paper presenting the \\"cognitive-affective system theory of personality\\", stating that people's behavior changes across situations, but behind the change, something important about the person is unchanged. These relatively unchanging qualities include the person's \\"meaning system\\", including the categories and concepts through which she or he experiences the social world, and the belief and value networks that guide responses to specific social situations. This could be considered a form of \\"higher order\\" stability, analogous to the notion of \\"higher order\\" invariants in mathematics. These personal qualities are reflected in the person's \\"behavioral signature,\\" the set of if (situation) then (behavior) patterns that characterize each person. From 2012 to 2015, Shoda served as an Associate Editor of Social Psychological and Personality Science. Currently, he serves as an Associate Editor of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. ==Selected works== * Whitsett, D. D., & Shoda, Y. ( 2014 ).

He supervised coverage of the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s and became the magazine's foreign editor from 2002 to 2009, covering the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. David also previously authored the \\"Bagehot\\" column on British politics, before finally moving to the U.S. to author the \\"Lexington\\" column on American politics. ==Early years== Peter David was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to a family of Lithuanian Jews who had settled in South Africa decades earlier to escape pogroms. His father was a lawyer and his mother was a left-wing political activist who fought against the apartheid government. After the Sharpeville massacre there in 1960, where 69 people were killed by police, she feared arrest and the family relocated to London within days. They eventually settled in Liverpool. After graduating from the University of London in 1972, where he studied sociology, he took jobs as a journalist for various magazines, among those were journals covering house plants and UFOs. ==Career== David became the Washington bureau chief for Nature, the world's most cited journal on science. In 1984 he then joined The Economist as a science writer. He soon became the magazine's \\"main authority\\" on the Middle East while also writing the Bagehot column covering British politics and running its business sections. Later, he became its foreign editor for international topics, acting as \\"editorial manager and senior writer.\\" According to his friend Clive Crook, senior editor of The Atlantic, \\"he was respected for his knowledge. As a boss he was known for his kindness and generosity, as a writer for his wit, even-handedness and unaffected elegance,\\" noting that \\"David was a superb journalist, one of the best The Economist ever hired.

The duo is complemented by mutual friend Sarah Davis, who helps to bring balance and sensibility to the misadventures often resulting from Thomas' poorly planned schemes.

It was released online on December 19, 2011, and was made using the Adventure Game Studio engine. Metal Dead is heavily influenced by classic adventure games released by LucasArts and Sierra Entertainment in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. The game's interface, comedic dialogue, and graphics are all reminiscent of titles such as Day of the Tentacle and Leisure Suit Larry. Also counted among its influences are a wide range of zombie films and heavy metal bands. ==Plot== The game begins with protagonist Malcolm and his best friend Ronnie driving down zombie infested streets in a beat-up car. Upon learning that Ronnie is driving them directly into the heart of the undead infestation, Malcolm grabs the wheel and causes them to crash outside the MediGeniTech building, a place where nefarious medical experiments are said to take place. Ronnie dies a violent death in the wreck, leaving Malcolm to find his way into the building on his lonesome. Once inside the facility, Malcolm meets Doctor Fritz Von Fechenheim, a stereotypical German mad scientist who sends him on an errand to collect the head of a zombie. When returning to the wrecked car, Malcolm finds that Ronnie has already become one of the undead. Using his wits, he manages to remove Ronnie's head without damaging the brain and brings it back to Doctor Fechenheim, who then performs an experimental surgical procedure. By installing a speaker and other various machinery inside the disembodied cranium, Fechenheim gives Ronnie the ability to communicate as if he were never dead. Before long, Ronnie is back to his normal self, sans body and perhaps a little more rotten than before. As friends reunited, Malcolm and Ronnie vow to discover the cause and source of the zombie apocalypse, which seems to be converging on the MediGeniTech building. With an elevator keycard obtained from the Doctor, they begin their ascent, meeting a cast of weird characters along the way and uncovering the building's dark secrets. == Development == The game was designed by Liam O'Sullivan and Robert Wriedt, with music composed by Josh Birch. Development began in mid-2010 and ended in late 2011. == Reception == The game received generally positive reviews, with most focusing on the strength of the writing, humor, and characters. Adventure Gamers wrote that the \\"polished writing surpasses that of efforts from much larger studios\\" and that \\"jokes come quickly, hitting far more often than not\\". The game's puzzles were also praised, and Gnome's Lair said that while \\"generally easy, they are logical, well integrated and actually fun.\\" Many reviewers commented on the surreal, surprising ending.

An electiveSometimes known by other names, such as a Subject to Endorsement Placement (StEP) at Manchester Medical School. is a placement undertaken as part of a medical degree. The content and setting of the placement are largely decided by the student undertaking it, with some students choosing to spend it in a different country. Elective placements are not exclusive to medical degrees; many other degree programmes within the field of healthcare also incorporate electives (such as nursing, dentistry and physiotherapy) and the format is often the same. ==Motivations== An elective represents a unique opportunity for medical students to experience healthcare in a setting unfamiliar to that in which they are accustomed to studying, or in a place or field of specific interest. This is classically in a low resource setting, but may also be to experience a specialist field, a place the student is considering working in the future, or for a variety of other reasons. Placements abroad may provide experience of differing practices, but also allow students to encounter medical conditions they are less used to seeing at home.For example, certain infectious diseases that are uncommon in the Western world but common elsewhere. In addition, students often retrospectively describe how their placements broadened their horizons with regards to the social issues affecting healthcare in developing countries. A placement in a particular specialist setting may allow students insight into a potential career path, or allow students to participate in the research or implementation of new treatments or practices. ==Structure and organisation== An elective is usually undertaken in the penultimate or final year of study of a medical degree, often after students have finished their final exams. The university usually specifies the dates during which an elective can be undertaken by students. Electives are usually entirely self-arranged, with the student organising travel, accommodation, the placement itself, and other aspects like travel insurance and indemnity insurance. Often the hospital will help organise accommodation, and indemnity cover may be automatic depending on the student's existing policy. Some students recruit the services of companies which specialise in organising medical electives. Students often share their experiences on the internet, and good placements become well-known. Popular destinations can fill up 12 months in advance or more ===Cost=== Most students need to cover travel and living costs, many needing to cover accommodation, and some are charged administration or tuition costs, which can be up to $1,000 or more http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/concord/electives/fees.php. Many students fund their electives personally, but financial help is occasionally available in the forms of bursaries, prizes or scholarships, either from the student's university or from societies or private companies. In these cases, the sponsor may require that the student undertakes some form of project whilst on their elective to justify the expense. ==Requirements== Requirements of students vary from medical school to medical school. Some (such as Aberdeen) require students to submit a written project as part of their placement, whereas other institutions utilise few formal assessments. Students are still subject to all the ethical and professional requirements they would be at their home institution, such as the GMC's requirement that students at British med schools \\"recognise and work within the limits of their competence\\". It is immoral and illegal for unregistered medical students to work as if doctors, despite the fact that their level of skill and expertise is often comparable to the professionals they will work with on the placement. ==NotesReferences== Category:Medical education ","title":"Elective (medical)"},{"id":"35906835","text":"Soul Serenade is the name of several songs and albums produced by different artists, including: * Soul Serenade (Derek Trucks album), a 2003 album by The Derek Trucks Band * Soul Serenade (Gloria Lynne album), 1965 * Soul Serenade, a 2000 album by Gospellers * \\"Soul Serenade\\" (King Curtis song), a 1968 jazz song by King Curtis ","title":"Soul Serenade"},{"id":"35906840","text":"Evangeline is a community in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

It operated freight and passenger trains between Baltimore and Delta, Pennsylvania. ==History== The Maryland Central was chartered by the Maryland General Assembly in 1867 to build a railroad from Baltimore to Philadelphia. It was not successful at raising sufficient funds for construction through the 1870s. (A competing railroad, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, had the same objective and had completed a bridge over the Susquehanna River in 1866.) Another company, the Baltimore and Delta Railway began building a gauge line in 1878 to reach slate quarries in Delta, and to interchange with the Peach Bottom Railway. The southern portions of the Baltimore & Delta opened in 1882, but the company needed additional funds for completion. It merged with the Maryland Central in August 1882. MCRR continued the construction northward and reached Bel Air, Maryland in 1883. Passenger train service between Baltimore and Bel Air began on June 21, 1883. The railroad commenced U.S. mail service in July 1883. The remaining un-built route of 17 miles, from Bel Air to Delta, involved some difficult construction work, but the line was completed by December of that year. The track in Pennsylvania was owned by a subsidiary, the Slate Ridge and Delta Railway. Passenger trains began running from Baltimore to Delta in January 1884. The company experienced financial difficulties and entered receivership in October 1884. MCRR was sold at auction in 1888 and a new company, the Maryland Central Railway, was formed. Spence v. Maryland Central R.R., Equity No. 5206 (Baltimore County, Md. Cir., filed Oct. 24, 1884), Md. State Archives Collections T258 (Judicial Record 126, at pp. 111-242), T696 (Boxes 2148-1, -2 [papers filed]). In 1889 the Maryland Central acquired control of the York and Peach Bottom Railway (Y&PB;), the successor to the Peach Bottom Railway, and which terminated at Delta. Through-service trains between York, Pennsylvania and Baltimore began operation in May 1889. The Maryland Central owners were interested in expanding further north into Pennsylvania, and they made plans for a merger with the Y&PB.; In 1891 the Y&PB; and Maryland Central merged to form a new corporation, the Baltimore and Lehigh Railroad. ==Successor lines== The Baltimore and Lehigh encountered financial problems in 1893 and entered bankruptcy. The Maryland and Pennsylvania sections of the railroad were sold off separately in 1894. The York Southern Railroad acquired the Pennsylvania portion, and the Maryland portion was acquired by a new company, the Baltimore and Lehigh Railway. In 1895 the York Southern converted its tracks to standard gauge, and in 1900 the Baltimore and Lehigh did likewise on the Maryland tracks. The York Southern merged with the Baltimore and Lehigh in 1901, to form the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad. The new company announced that it planned to build a branch line from Red Lion to Columbia, Pennsylvania, to connect with the Reading Railroad. However, this idea was not implemented and the railroad never succeeded in expanding northward beyond York. ==See also== *List of defunct Pennsylvania railroads *List of Maryland railroads ==References== * Category:Defunct Pennsylvania railroads Category:Defunct Maryland railroads Category:Narrow gauge railroads in Pennsylvania Category:Narrow gauge railroads in Maryland Category:Railway companies established in 1882 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1891 Category:3 ft gauge railways in the United States ","title":"Maryland Central Railroad"},{"id":"35906848","text":"A Children's Puppet Show by Liu Songnian \\"Three Sages Appreciating Antique\\" by Liu Songnian.

He was the treasurer of the Dorchester Company, which established an unsuccessful settlement on Massachusetts Bay in the 1620s, and was deputy governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company from 1629 to 1630. He came to Massachusetts in 1634, where he served as a magistrate and was the first sergeant major general of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. He became involved in English attempts to settle Providencia Island in the late 1630s, and returned to England in 1641 after financial reverses and probable religious differences with other members of the Massachusetts ruling elite. He then became involved in an attempt to settle The Bahamas in the late 1640s, and had some involvement in the politics of the English Civil War. Children that Humphrey and his wife left in Massachusetts had an unhappy fate, and the Humphreys were criticised at the time for leaving them. Three daughters were subjected to physical and sexual abuse, and only one of them survived to adulthood. The Massachusetts leadership did little to prosecute offenders, and some saw this mistreatment as a form a divine punishment of the Humphreys for their actions in abandoning the Massachusetts colony. ==Early life and family== John Humphrey was born in the mid-1590s, probably in the English County of Dorset. The exact date of his birth is uncertain at best: no histories give precise dates, estimated dates differ, but are roughly clustered around 1595. His father, Michael Humphrey, was steward at an estate in Dorset. Humphrey was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and studied law at Lincoln's Inn in 1615.Morison, p. 383 He settled in Dorchester, where he was a member of John White's church.Staloff, p. 4 John Humphrey was married at least three times. John Humphrey's first wife was Isabel Williams; daughter of Bruen and Elizabeth (Churchill) Williams[2]who died before 1621. John married (2nd) Elizabeth Pelham on 4 September 1621 at St. Thomas, Salisbury, Wiltshire. She died at Dorchester, Dorsetshire on November 1, 1628. Three children were born to Col. John Humphrey and Elizabeth at Fordington, Dorsetshire: John Humphrey Jr. B. Aug 11, 1622. Named administrator of father's estate on June 4, 1653 Elizabeth Humphrey B. Nov. 23, 1623 Anne Humphrey B.

Page 4 ==Establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Company== Humphrey and White became involved in a variety of plans for migration to North America. In the early 1620s Humphrey served as treasurer of the Dorchester Company, an early effort spearheaded by White to colonise Massachusetts Bay. This colonisation effort failed in 1625 due to a lack of funding. Humphrey and White persisted in efforts to establish a successful colony. While White sought new sources of funding in London, Humphrey circulated in the Puritan circle of his brother- in-law the Earl of Clinton. White succeeded in interesting new investors, under whose auspices the Massachusetts Bay Company was established in 1628. The company acquired a grant from the Plymouth Council for New England for land roughly between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers. Humphrey also invested in this company and served as its treasurer. A number of Clinton's associates, notably John Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, Richard Bellingham, and Simon Bradstreet, were also drawn to the idea of migration to North America. In 1629 the company received a royal charter, and Humphrey was elected its deputy governor, under Winthrop. ==Massachusetts== He was unable to accompany Governor Winthrop on the 1630 fleet that brought the first large-scale migration to Massachusetts, and was consequently replaced by Thomas Dudley as deputy governor shortly before the fleet sailed.Avery, p. 12 He remained actively involved in the Company in London, and assisted in defending its charter against attacks levied by Sir Ferdinando Gorges in 1633.Breen, p. 104 He eventually arrived at the colony in 1634 with his second wife and children, and immediately became involved in the administration of the colony. He had been granted land in what is now Swampscott, Massachusetts, and was regularly elected one of the colony's assistants despite his absence. In 1637 he sat on the tribunal that resulted in the banishment of Anne Hutchinson. Possibly dissatisfied with the religiously intolerant nature of the Massachusetts government, Humphrey became involved in a scheme headed by Lord Say and Sele to colonise Providencia Island in the Caribbean. His attempts to influence Massachusetts residents to migrate there did not sit well with other Massachusetts leaders, who disagreed with his relatively tolerant views on religion. In 1640 Lord Say and Sele offered, and Humphreys accepted, appointment as governor of the Providence Island colony. A ship of colonists he sent there from New England arrived in 1641 to find the island in Spanish hands, and was forced to return. ==Providence Island and Bahamas== Unhappy with the state of affairs in Massachusetts, Humphreys and his wife left the colony in late 1641 for England. Humphreys aligned himself with the Independent faction associated with Henry Vane the Younger and others during the English Civil War. In the late 1640s he became involved in an attempt to establish a more religiously tolerant colony in The Bahamas; the colonisation attempt failed due to a shipwreck and political-religious differences. Humphreys died in England in 1661. ==Fate of children== With his second wife he had six children that remained in New England; he also appears to have had a son by his first wife. The children he left in Massachusetts ended not being well cared for, and three daughters were subjected to physical and sexual abuse. ==Legacy== A house supposedly built for him still stands in Swampscott and is known as the John Humphreys House (sic); it is one of the oldest wooden houses in the United States. ==NotesReferences== * *Whitman, History of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, Volume 1. *Avery, John Humfrey, Massachusetts magistrate *Malden Historical Society, Register of the Society, Issues 5‚Äì6 * * Category:1597 births Category:1661 deaths Category:Lieutenant Governors of colonial Massachusetts Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:People from Dorset Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to Massachusetts Bay Colony ","title":"John Humphrey (Massachusetts)"},{"id":"35906968","text":"Jarmer Plads Jarmers Plads is a road junction and public space in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It takes its name after Jarmers Tower, the ruin of a Medieval tower which used to be part of the Fortification Ring which surrounded the city until the mid 19th century. ==History== he ruins of Jarmer's Tower in 1885 When Copenhagen's fortifications were decommissioned in the second half of the 19th century, the ramparts were leveled and the moat filled in. Jarmer's Tower was long gone but the site was excavated in connection with the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 and the remains of the tower were afterwards restored as a ruin to commemorate the city's past as a fortified city. √òstifternes Kreditforening Im 1913, it was decided to built a new head office for √òstifternes Kreditforening at the site. An architectural competition for the design of the building was won by Ulrik Plesner and Valdemar Dan[ and the building was completed in 1916. Ot was demolished in 1954 when H. C. Andersens Boulevard was connected wto Gyldenl√∏vesgade. The only connection between the two streets had until then been the relatively narrow street Jarmersgade.

These programs now have served close to ten thousand people in communities throughout Hawai‚Äòi. In 2011, PIDF received grants of more than $1.6 million from the US Department of Education through the Native Hawaiian Education Act. The grants were awarded for the purpose of continuing, expanding, and improving the educational programs of PIDF. == ProgramsEducation=== * T≈´t≈´ and Me - A traveling preschool with the goal of meeting the developmental needs of children ages 0‚Äì5 years old in order to prepare them to overcome the challenges of kindergarten and of life. A caregiver is required to attend alongside the child being served as the caregiver is also instructed as to how to be a teacher and mentor to the child. It is a statewide program having locations on Hawai ªi, Maui, Moloka ªi, O ªahu and Kaua ªi. *NƒÅ Pono No NƒÅ  ªOhana - A family education project on Hawaiian Homestead land in WaimƒÅnalo, O‚Äòahu. It is an effort of school and community partners that focuses on the family as the foundation for learning, and offers a program designed to prepare Native Hawaiian children for academic success in school while helping parents advance their own education, work preparedness, and parenting skills. By integrating Native Hawaiian cultural values, NƒÅ Pono No NƒÅ ‚ÄòOhana has improved the social, economic, and educational opportunities for hundreds of Native Hawaiian families. *Ka Pa ªalana - The Ka Pa‚Äòalana Traveling Preschool and Homeless Family Education Program serves houseless families on the Leeward coast of O‚Äòahu. Through collaborative partnerships with Leeward coast outreach agencies, Ka Pa‚Äòalana assists families by delivering or providing access to essential services, such as a parent-child participatory preschool, food bank, toiletry, and dental supplies distribution. Ka Pa‚Äòalana also serves as an initial contact agency for families who are ready to transition to local shelters or temporary housing facilities. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders comprise a disproportionate 59% of the sheltered population while only accounting for 17% of the state‚Äôs total population.University of Hawaii, Center on the Family, Homeless Service Utilization Report, 2009; U.S. Census Bureau, 2008 Population Estimates. Using culturally-sensitive strategies, Ka Pa‚Äôalana incorporates early childhood and family education programs that serve between 15 and 40 children and their parents in a mobile day-center each week.Kanani Kaaiawahia Bulawan (Administrative Advisor, Wai‚Äôanae Community Outreach), e-mail message to Institute for Childhood and Poverty, January 31, 2010. Ka Pa‚Äòalana is currently funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Kamehameha Schools, the Administration for Native Americans, Aloha United Way, and Friends of Hawai‚Äòi Charities. Previous funding sources which helped develop of the program include the Hawai‚Äòi State Department of Human Services and NƒÅ ‚Äò≈åiwi KƒÅne. There are five components to the Ka Pa‚Äòalana program: #MƒÅlama Mobile - A ‚Äúfirst contact‚Äù homeless outreach that provides a modified center-based preschool experience for at-risk families near coastal beach parks and homeless families living at beach parks. Families receive canned and dried goods as well as educational and social services with partners from local shelters, outreach and government agencies. Adult educational services include goal-setting, budgeting, vocational training, job placement and GED preparation. Ninety-five percent of the families served are Native Hawaiian. #Traveling Preschool - A parent-child participatory preschool that provides services at two family shelters on the Leeward Coast. The two- hour-a-day, two-day-a-week program provides pre- and post-testing, portfolio assessment, referrals for health and developmental needs through community partners, parenting classes and TANF education. Adult educational services include goal-setting, budgeting, vocational training, job placement and GED preparation. The curriculum of the preschool meets the Hawai‚Äòi Preschool Content Standards and the ‚ÄúLearning to Grow‚Äù Infant and Toddler Development standards. #Family Education Services - A four-hour-a-day, four-day-a-week comprehensive Family Education Service is offered at transitional shelters. Parents interact with their child for the first two hours of the program, then participate in various adult education and life skills programs while their children receive an intensive, developmentally appropriate education through preschool teachers and assistants. Adult educational services include goal- setting, budgeting, vocational training, job placement, and GED preparation. #‚ÄòIke No‚Äòeau - A traveling preschool program provides developmentally appropriate, culturally relevant math and science preschool curriculum to families at the shelters and at Hawaiian Homelands in Wai‚Äòanae and WaimƒÅnalo. #Ke Kama Pono - A Safe House program that services a maximum of 12 adjudicated youth, ages 13‚Äì17, for six to nine months with follow-up monitoring by the program for three years. On site classes are held by DOE certified teachers in order to assist the youth in maintaining school credits. Additionally, the residents take part in monthly team meetings with case managers, probation officers, and parent/guardians to evaluate resident treatment and service plans. The Ke Kama Pono program embeds Native Hawaiian values throughout its activities, functions, and mentorships. Residents work three times a week at the Mountain View Dairy, and twice a week they engage in activities at the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Weekend activities vary from outdoor recreation to performing community service. The emphasis on parent and family involvement is an important aspect of the program. Parent/guardians are required to attend monthly parenting classes which help to ensure a successful family reunification process. The Safe House program differs from many other residential programs because of the holistic approach in addressing all areas of need of the residents, including their family dynamics. *Ka Hana No ªeau - Located in the rural North Kohala district of Hawai‚Äòi-island this project has developed mentoring programs for Hawaiian youth that meld traditional knowledge with contemporary technologies. Traditional Hawaiian products and crafts have been slowly disappearing due to fewer opportunities for adolescents to learn the skills necessary to produce them. Ka Hana No‚Äòeau brings an older generation of craftsmen and practitioners, and puts them together with young students in a unique mentoring program that will preserve traditional knowledge, products and, skills. An important and major portion of the program is an entrepreneurial component that introduces students to the marketing possibilities that their acquired skills will produce. *Tech Together - A hands-on energy technology class that teaches sixth graders and their families about renewable and non-renewable energy in a classroom setting. By going into the classroom for two weeks, the Tech Together Program benefits the students as well as the participating schools by offering high tech projects that integrate science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) focused on the energy industry. Some of the hands-on projects include building a solar car, solar oven, bio dome, and hydroponics system, all of which the students can keep. With qualified trainers, this program also weaves Hawaiian culture throughout, highlighting the resourcefulness of the Hawaiian people, and encouraging the students to think in terms of conservation, preservation and sustainability. Students are asked to solicit a mentor and share their newly acquired knowledge with their families. All participating teachers are encouraged to learn along with their students and are given tools to support their learning and enable them to continue teaching this topic in the future. Students thoroughly enjoy the hands-on nature of the program and their parents are impressed with what their children learned. *Pili A Pa ªa - Pili A Pa‚Äòa is an educational project that was created to address critical deficits in reading, math and science for the Native Hawaiian students on the island of Hawai‚Äòi. Native Hawaiian students represent nearly half of the school's student population and are at risk because the current curriculum is geared towards Western teaching styles that focus on individual effort and competition. Native Hawaiians, on the other hand, strive for achievement and excellence for the benefit of the group and not individual recognition. This project seeks to build teacher's knowledge of curriculum, Common Core State Standards and instructional strategies while integrating Native Hawaiian cultural values and processes. :The project provides teachers a four-week intensive training/ collaboration period to enhance their teaching practices. Teachers work with instructional coaches to create units of instruction for their respective content area(s). Coaches provide critical feedback and research based instructional strategies to enhance the curriculum development process. :Through this process, teachers will be able to examine and integrate culturally responsive teaching strategies to increase academic achievement not only for Native Hawaiian students but also for all other student groups found at the school. Collaboration between teachers at all schools is embedded in the project to create professional learning communities within and between the schools. :Over the three-year grant period, this project expects to serve 88 teachers and 486 students at selected schools within geographic areas of Hawai‚Äòi Island that have a high rate of Native Hawaiian students. The main objectives are as follows: :*To increase instructional capacity of teachers; :*To build capacity via teacher leadership; and :*To build student confidence in their ability to excel in school. ===Social Services=== *Hui Ho ªomalu - A foster care program, it aims to provide stable, caring homes for at-risk children with reunification with their birth family as the ultimate goal. They achieve this by recruiting, training, and assessing resource caregivers for children in foster care. :In 2006, Partners in Development Foundation was awarded a master contract from the Department of Human Services (DHS) to create and implement innovative strategies to better meet the needs of Hawai‚Äòi‚Äôs children in foster care and the resource families that care for them. Hui Ho‚Äòomalu comprises Partners in Development Foundation, Catholic Charities Hawai‚Äòi, and Family Programs Hawai‚Äòi. These agencies, in partnership with DHS, address the identification, recruitment, screening, training and ongoing support and retention of Resource Families for children and families in the care of DHS. :The General Licensing branch of Hui Ho‚Äòomalu under Partners in Development Foundation identifies, recruits, trains and assesses Resource Families who are willing to foster any unrelated child. There is a special emphasis on finding Native Hawaiian families with the hope of being able to place children in homes that share their cultural background and heritage. Catholic Charities Hawai‚Äòi trains and screens child-specific families, who are either related to or, have a prior relationship with the child. Family Programs Hawai‚Äòi provides training and ongoing support and retention services for Resource Families. ===Environmental=== *Green Machine - A tank based constructed wetland wastewater treatment facility located in Makiki Valley State Recreational area in Honolulu, Hawai‚Äòi. It recycles wastewater from the Hawai‚Äòi Nature Center for irrigation on site in nearby fields. Constructed wetland technology uses the biology of Native Hawaiian wetland plants and bacteria to purify water. :The Living Machine‚Ñ¢ technology was developed in the 1980's by inventor scientist, Dr. John Todd of Ocean Arks International and was used to build the Green Machine that is housed at the Hawai‚Äòi Nature Center in Makiki. Educational programs are conducted for Hawai‚Äòi‚Äôs students where they can do experiments at the constructed wetland laboratory. The educational curriculum introduces students to the water cycle, nutrient cycle and the role of wetland ecologies in the watershed. Various lessons have been developed for different ages and meet all of the State of Hawai‚Äòi science content standards. The Green Machine also treats a thousand gallons a day of domestic wastewater from the park facilities to bring it to Hawai‚Äòi DOH R-2 reuse quality. The Green Machine hosts K-12 classes each month to see firsthand the natural processes of waste treatment. ===Hawaiian Language=== *Baibala Hemolele - This project involves republishing the Hawaiian Bible in digital and print form to preserve the out-of-print Baibala Hemolele and to increase access of the Hawaiian Bible for the next generation of Hawaiian language students. The original translation, completed in 1839, played a significant role in the development of the Hawaiian language as a written language because the Christian missionaries needed to first create a written language to be able to print a bible in the Hawaiian language ( ª≈ålelo Hawai ªi). It continues to be a major linguistic, cultural, and spiritual resource for the Hawaiian community and Hawaiian language students throughout the world. :Digital image files of every page of the original Palapala Hemolele (published in 1839), the revised Baibala Hemolele (published in 1868), and the 1994 Baibala Hemolele have been created and are available on the Internet at Baibala.org. Searchable text files of all three Baibala and the Baibala Hemolele in the new orthography are also available on the website, as well as a recording track of the entire Baibala. :In 2012 the project, in partnership with Mutual Publishing, will publish the Hawaiian Bible in the new orthography. It will mark the first time the Hawaiian language bible has been formatted and printed with the diacritical markings: the  ªOkina and Kahak≈ç. It will include genealogy pages and biblical maps in Hawaiian. == References  External links == Category:Non-profit organizations based in Hawaii ","title":"Partners In Development Foundation"},{"id":"35907052","text":"Juan Ignacio S√°nchez, or Pepe S√°nchez, is an Argentine-Spanish professional basketball player.

One, in Godwin Street, was built in 1930 and survives; the other, in Manchester Road, was built in 1938 and demolished in 1969. == Godwin Street building == West Yorkshire PTE buses passing in front The cinema, originally built as a 3,318 seat cine-variety theatre, was the largest outside London, and the third largest in England. It was completed in 1930 as the New Victoria. It is on the site of William Whittaker's brewery and malting, which had closed in 1928. It is a Renaissance Revival building designed by the architect William Illingworth, with copper-covered cupolas on two corners complementing those on the neighbouring Bradford Alhambra theatre. The New Victoria combined a 3,318-seat auditorium, ballroom and 200-seat restaurant. The auditorium was primarily a cinema, but also a concert and ballet venue with a stage, orchestra pit, Wurlitzer organ and excellent acoustics. As a cinema it was the third largest in Britain when it opened, with only the Trocadero at Elephant & Castle and Davis Theatre at Croydon being larger. By 1930 cinemas had converted to screen sound pictures, which had been introduced in 1927, but the New Victoria was the first cinema in Britain to be purpose-built for \\"talkies\\". It was built at a cost of ¬£250,000 for Provincial Cinematograph Theatres, backed by the Gaumont British Picture Corporation. In 1950 the complex was renamed the Gaumont, by this time both the Odeon and Gaumont circuits were controlled by Circuits Management Association Ltd., a subsidiary of the Rank Organisation. With the city's Odeon scheduled for re-development by Bradford Corporation, Rank decided to redevelop the Gaumont as a twin cinema and bingo club and on 30 November 1968 it closed for nine months. By the time that the building was ready to re-open, the original Odeon had been closed for five months and the new complex opened on 21 August 1969 with the Odeon name. === The Gaumont as the Odeon === The Rank Organisation converted the Gaumont into a complex with the former circle divided into two film auditoria, one of 1,200 and the other of 467 seats. The former stalls were converted into a 1,000 seat Top Rank bingo hall, replacing the company's bingo operation in the former Majestic cinema in Morley Street. The \\"Odeon\\" name was transferred to the new two-screen cinema, which opened in August 1969. The bingo hall opened later in the year. The Gaumont (formerly New Victoria) ballroom had also closed in 1968, and it remained unused for 20 years. In 1988 Rank had it converted into a 244-seat auditorium and reopened that June as a third screen of the cinema. In 1991 Rank had plans prepared to convert the bingo hall into three film auditoria and the former restaurant into retail units. In 1994 it had plans prepared to divide the 1,200-seat auditorium into three auditoria and the 467-seat auditorium into two. Neither plan was implemented. In the 1990s the Gallagher Group planned to redevelop a site at Thornbury on the eastern edge of Bradford into a leisure park that would include a 13-screen multiplex. The cinema chain originally contracted to operate it withdrew, so Odeon (Rank had sold the cinema chain to Cinven in February 2000) took its place and in July 2000 opened the new cinema as the Odeon Leeds-Bradford. It closed the Bradford Odeon in June 2000 and the Odeon Cinema Leeds in 2001. === Live music === The New Victoria / Gaumont building disused in 2009 The New Victoria / Gaumont was a distinguished venue for live music. Big bands played for dancers in its ballroom, and its season included charity balls hosted by the Grand Order of Water Rats and the National Union of Journalists. The main auditorium was the largest concert venue in the north of England. The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) played at its opening gala in 1930, and a subsequent LSO concert was conducted by Leopold Stokowski. Further classical music performances included the London Festival Ballet in 1952 and the Italian tenor Beniamino Gigli in 1954. The Gaumont's main auditorium continued to host stage performances. In 1950 it hosted an ice show, Babes in the Wood on Ice. UK tours of the most successful popular music acts included concerts at the Gaumont, including Billy Daniels (1953), Frankie Laine (1953), Bill Haley & His Comets (1957), Buddy Holly (1958), Paul Anka, Count Basie and the Peruvian soprano Yma Sumac. In 1960 the Gaumont hosted Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran's first ever British concert, and Vince Eager was the supporting act. 1963 was a notable year at the Gaumont. In February Helen Shapiro headlined a concert there, with supporting performances by Danny Williams and Kenny Lynch. At the bottom of the bill was a new band called The Beatles, who were about to release their first LP record Please Please Me. In October The Everly Brothers headlined a concert with supporting acts by Bo Diddley and another new British band, The Rolling Stones. In December The Beatles returned, headlining a concert playing to two packed houses with supporting performances from The Barron Knights, Tommy Quickly, Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black and Rolf Harris. The Rolling Stones returned in 1965, this time heading the bill. Tom Jones sang at the Gaumont in 1968. === Redevelopment proposals === Model of part of the New Victoria / Gaumont building at an exhibition in 2012 Since 2000, asbestos has been removed from the former New Victoria / Gaumont building but it has remained unused. In 2003 the regional development agency Yorkshire Forward bought it for ¬£3 million and proposed to redevelop the site. Public opposition quickly formed the Bradford Odeon Rescue Group (BORG),BORG Bradford Odeon Rescue Group whose campaign included a \\"Hug the Odeon\\" event in July 2007 in which an estimated 1,000 people encircled the building in a human chain. BORG's supporters include Richard Attenborough, George Clarke and Jonathan Foyle. In 2009 an open public campaign began which included several websites, Twitter accounts and Facebook groups created by members of the public. As part of the public 'Save The Odeon' campaign, a series of demonstrations around the building were organised by members of the public, such as an alternative Christmas lights switch-on, projections onto the towers of the building during the opening of City Park, and pinning 'get well soon' cards and flowers to the building during maintenance works. The public campaign gathered the support of David Hockney, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Imelda Staunton. Yorkshire Forward contracted a commercial property development company, Langtree Group, to demolish the building and redevelop the site. However, in March 2012 Yorkshire Forward was abolished as a result of HM Treasury's 2010 Spending Review, and in September 2012 ownership of the building passed to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). In late 2013 the HCA sold the building to Bradford City Council for a nominal ¬£1 on condition that the latter invest ¬£1.32 million in its maintenance and repair. The City Council has invited bids to redevelop the building, retaining as much as possible of its original fabric. After a gap of 45 years, live music is foremost in current proposals to restore and reopen the New Victoria / Gaumont. Two parties, Bradford LiveBradford Live and Bradford One,Bradford One have each proposed to remove the partitions and false walls inserted in 1968‚Äì69 and restore the original auditorium as a single performance space. Bradford One says the restored auditorium would provide part-standing capacity for 3107 people, or for 2,487 people all seated. Bradford Live says redevelopment would cost ¬£20 million and claims it could increase capacity from the original 3,318 seats to between 3,500 and 4,000. As of January 2019 Bradford Live and NEC Group International working together have secured ¬£4m funding and aim to start construction in summer 2019.

It was a 2,713-seat super cinema built for Oscar Deutsch's Odeon Cinemas as a competitor to what was then the New Victoria. Odeon's house style was futuristic Art Deco, and this one was a Streamline Moderne building designed by the architect Robert Bullivant of Harry Weedon and Partners. A Luftwaffe air raid in August 1940 seriously damaged the building, but despite wartime restrictions Deutsch had extensive repairs completed in only 10 weeks, reopening the cinema on Armistice Day 1940. Capacity was slightly reduced to 2,685 seats. Although Rank would normally have been expected to keep the Odeon open until the re-developed Gaumont had opened (as happened in other cities), Bradford City Council required the site and it closed on 22 March 1969 and was demolished to make way for a realignment of Manchester Road. == References == Category:Theatres completed in 1930 Category:Theatres completed in 1938 Category:Art Deco architecture in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1969 Category:Cinemas in Yorkshire Category:Concert halls in England Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Odeon Cinemas Category:Buildings and structures in Bradford Category:History of Bradford ","title":"Bradford Odeon"},{"id":"35907335","text":"Isikeli Vuruna (born 27 January 1988 at Taveuni, Fiji) is a Fijian Rugby UnionFijian Rugby Union footballer.

Customs officials elsewhere and such publications as the Mercantile Navy List frequently called the port \\"Wide Bay\\" well into the 1860s. ==Background== The native name of the stream upon which the port is situated was named Moonaboola River History of Maryborough. Maryborough Wide bay and Burnett Historical Society by Andrew Petrie, which he discovered on his boat trip in 1842 while looking for good grazing land suitable for sheep. Later Mr Joliffe R.N. became the superintendent for John Eales, a prominent land owner in the Hunter Valley, and brought a flock of sheep across the Darling Downs, blazing a track over the Brisbane Range to establish a head station near Tiaro. This venture was short-lived as the local aboriginal tribes took a liking to the taste of lamb.Genesis of Queensland, by Stuart- Russell George Furber became the first white settler on the south side of the river in 1847, where he set up a trading station and Inn. When Edgar Aldridge, Henry and Richard Palmer, Enoch Rudder and their party arrived in 1848, they crossed the river and settled on the north bank, which was later to be named the Wide Bay Village, now the Old Township Site. The river became known as the Wide Bay River until after the untimely death of Mary Fitz Roy, Wife of the Governor of New South Wales at that time when it became known as the Mary River. To honour her memory Governor Fitz Roy renamed the stream, Mary, and the post office at the settlement was then called, Maryborough.Official Proclamation of the naming of the township of Wide Bay to Maryborough ==Development== When the river became unnavigable to larger vessels a new township was surveyed by Surveyor Labatt in 1852 and in 1854 the small iron- hulled screw steamship William Miskin, built in 1852, 124 tons discharged cargo at the Old Township and was possibly the first steamship to visit the Mary River. In 1856, the people officially moved down to the new township, where the port was established. Wool became an important commodity and exports through the port in 1860 totalled ¬£107,000 with wool accounting for ¬£98,000 of that figure and imports totalled ¬£71,456. At this time Maryborough was the only port in the colony with a favourable trade balance. Within the next ten years which included the discovery of gold at Gympie and the commencement of the sugar industry, gold took the lead with ¬£756,000, or nine tons, transported in a little over two years, while vessels totalling 163,532 tons visited the port during 1869. The gold was stored in the vault of the Bank of New South Wales. The building now used as the Maryborough Heritage Centre was the second Bank of New South Wales to be built on this site.History of Maryborough written by Maryborough Wide Bay and Burnett Historical ==Immigrants== From the 1850s to the end of the century the port was one of Australia's busiest immigration ports. Immigrant labour was needed and an advertisement inserted in the Wide Bay & Burnett Times on 23 January 1861 by Messrs Melville & Travis announced that they would be bringing out British migrants while another advertisement by Henry Hamburger said that he would support the emigration of German settlers. Of the migrants landed at Brisbane in 1862 from the ship Suldanha, 160 came to Maryborough by the paddle steamer Clarence. The 42 Germans among them had already been engaged for work on nearby sheep runs. The first migrant ship to call direct at Maryborough was the barque Ariadne (built in 1861 of 671 Tons). She arrived on 9 October 1862. This was the turning point for the Maryborough and Wide Bay Region, and the number of passengers from the Ariadne swelled the population of Maryborough by one third.Tall Ships on the River: Ariadne 1862 by Judith A Grimes and Kay F Gassan Between 1863 and 1870 there were 3,142 arrivals; from 1872 to 1880, 9,164 arrived (of which 1762 were Germans and Scandinavians) and between 1881 and 1890, 7,332 migrants landed. In all nearly 21,000 migrants landed before direct calls were abandoned in 1900, although ships still bought passengers into the port until about 1912. The Immigration Celebration planned for 29, 30 September and 1 October 2012, to honour the arrival of the Ariadne 150 years ago, it is hoped, will be the first one to be celebrated each year afterwards, as each ship in each subsequent year will celebrate its 150th anniversary of its arrival into the Port of Maryborough.Information from Maryborough Family Heritage Institute Inc == Deep water facilities at Urangan == As ships became larger, it became more difficult for the larger ships to negotiate the Mary River up to Maryborough. Concerns about the port's ability to cope with exports of Burrum coal were raised as early as 1882. A program of dredging was instituted to ensure the river remained deep and wide enough for navigation. However, by 1911, it was becoming obvious that Maryborough needed a deep water port. This resulted in proposals to construct a pier at Urangan on Hervey Bay to reach into the deep water and then extending the existing railway line from Maryborough to Pialba (which had opened in 1896) through to the pier at Urangan. Construction of Urangan Pier commenced in 1913 and the extension of the railway line to the pier was completed in 1917. While shipping continue to come to Maryborough, over time more of the vessels went to Urangan. By 1963, commercial shipping to Maryborough had ceased in favour of Urangan. However, Urangan had its limitations as only one vessel could berth at a time and by the 1950s the facilities needed to be expanded to cater for even larger ships. However, the Urangan facilities were not upgraded and opening of the new Port of Bundaberg at Burnett Heads in 1958 created a major local competitor with better facilities. In 1985 the MV Leonard was the last ship to dock at the Urangan Pier, bringing the Port of Maryborough to a close. == References  External links == * ‚Äì North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation Limited * Port of Maryborough, Queensland Holidays * Port information * Ship arrives, Maryborough District Family History Society * Port of Maryborough history Category:Maryborough, Queensland Category:Economic history of Queensland Maryborough Category:River ports of Australia Category:Mary River (Queensland) Category:1847 establishments in Australia ","title":"Port of Maryborough"},{"id":"35907396","text":"Maryborough Fire Station with appliances ca. 1890 The Maryborough Fire Brigade Board of Maryborough, Queensland was the first fire brigade in Queensland, Australia, outside of the capital city of Brisbane. In the early days of settlement in Maryborough there were a number of major fires in the town. \\"These fires were all extremely destructive, primarily because of a lack of any efficient fire services, the lack of a good water supply and the frailty of wooden constructions.\\" Matthews, Tony, (1995), River of dreams: a history of Maryborough and District, \\"Maryborough City Council\\", pg 431 The only way to fight a fire was for men to form a bucket brigade. In most cases the buildings weren't saved. Maryborough's largest and most destructive fire in 1876 destroyed 12 premises in the main business district and provided the major impetus for the development of a fire brigade.Roberts, W, 1876, 'Fire: great conflagration in Kent Street', Maryborough Chronicle, 3 February, p. 3 In July 1882 the Maryborough Municipal Council allocated funds to purchase fire fighting equipment and made land available in Lennox Street, near the corner of Kent Street, for the storage of the equipment. The firemen were all volunteers, paid two shillings an hour when attending a fire and one shilling and six pence for attending drills which were held fortnightly.A history of Maryborough: 1842-1997, (1998), \\"Maryborough Wide Bay & Burnett Historical Society\\", p. 176 By 1884 there were two other fire brigades in Queensland, both in Brisbane. Prior to the construction of the first fire station, the bells of St Paul‚Äôs Church of England, which could be heard all over the town, were used as the fire alarm and also to alert the firemen that they were needed to attend a fire.Remember when: an interactive historical journey through Maryborough, (2006), \\"Maryborough City Council\\" p. 54 In 1888 the first fire station in Maryborough was erected in Adelaide Street. This structure included a high tower from which a fire watch was kept. When the watchman saw a fire he rang a bell. The number of times he rang the bell identified which part of the town the fire was in. The bell was no longer used after 1922 because telephones had become more common. The building was dismantled in 1942 because it was in a state of disrepair and considered dangerous. In 1951 a new fire station at the corner of Alice and Lennox Streets was opened. This fire station is still in use today. Steam-powered fire engine, Maryborough Queensland ca. 1890The equipment first used by the Maryborough Fire Brigade Board was very basic. They used a two-wheeled trolley on a frame, which they had to pull to the site of the fire themselves. The trolley contained a hand pump, a water barrel and a large hose and reel. By 1885 the Maryborough Fire Brigade Board had purchased the best fire-fighting equipment available. It included a horse-drawn vehicle which carried men, hoses, axes and other equipment and an expensive horse-drawn steam-powered pump that had been built in England. This machine was named \\"Progress\\" because it was the most modern machine of its type in Australia at that time. First motorised fire engine in Maryborough, Queensland ca. 1925As cars became popular the Maryborough Fire Brigade Board decided that they should have a self-propelled fire engine. These could not be bought and had to be made from a car. In 1921 the Fire Brigade Board purchased a second-hand 1913 Alldays and Onions Touring Car. These quaint sounding vehicles were actually made in England up until 1921. It took the Fire Brigade Board two years to convert the car to a fire engine and when it was finished they painted No. 1 on it as it was Maryborough‚Äôs very first self-propelled fire engine. Unfortunately when the call was received for it to attend its first fire it had to stay in the shed because it was found to have a flat tyre. No. 1 Fire Engine went on to provide long and good service for the city. The only part left of this engine is a small red painted door that is held at a museum in Childers, while Olds Engine House in North Street, Maryborough has in its display a whistle from the old steam engine that No. 1 replaced. == References == Category:Fire and rescue services of Australia Category:Maryborough, Queensland ","title":"Maryborough Fire Brigade Board"},{"id":"35907398","text":"Dugong hunting in Australia is not prohibited; however, the practise is heavily regulated. Dugongs are protected throughout Australia, although the rules vary by state; in some areas indigenous hunting is allowed.Marsh et al. 2002. Dugong : status reports and action plans for countries and territories . IUCN. Dugongs are listed under the Nature Conservation Act in the Australian state of Queensland as vulnerable. Most currently live in established marine parks, where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted.Lawler et al. 2002. Dugongs in the Great Barrier Reef : Current State of Knowledge . Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Dugong hunting has been practised in Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett in Queensland since at least 1861. Commercial netting began in 1924. The dugong was a prized source of oil, hide, and meat, and charcoal from their bones was used in sugar refining. The practice was banned in 1965, apart from a limited catch by indigenous Australians, who used dugongs as a food source since before the arrival of European settlers. The Native Title Act 1993 allows for traditional owners to hunt both turtles and dugongs. ==History== right Hunting of dugongs for their flesh and oil which was exported to Europe for medicinal purposes began in the 1850s. Apart from the traditional aboriginal hunters, it is difficult to place precisely when dugong hunting commenced in the waters of the Wide Bay. One of the first references we have of this activity was recorded in the Maryborough Chronicle in August 1861 when a report claimed that a man named Thomas Gees, who was employed in 'dugong fishing' in Hervey Bay.Maryborough Chronicle in August 1861 John Lionel Ching during the 1870s and 1880s, was the person who primarily controlled the Dugong industry in Wide Bay and Hervey's Bay. Ching's method of catching the mammals was to string a long net across the mouths of estuaries and creeks where the dugongs were grazing on sea grasses. The dugong could then be driven into the nets where they would become entangled and finally drown; he would sell the flesh and oil to a ready market in Maryborough and elsewhere. His production plant was based at Stewart Island, opposite Boonooroo. John even perfected an ointment which he advertised in his pamphlets as being capable of curing rheumatism, bruises, sprains and other ills the flesh. This oil was used during the First World War to relieve the suffering of soldiers who had been gassed in the trenches. However, Ching was so successful in hunting dugong that after several years few of the mammals could be found in the region and he was forced to travel north where he soon set up another dugong processing plant. During the 1870s, other dugong fishermen set up a small operation at Hervey Bay, building a crude hut where they carried out the boiling down of the mammals. Their work was only modestly successful and they later gave up the venture. Commercial netting began in 1924 where the dugong were netted, brought to the surface and then shot. Prior to the banning of the trade in 1965, dugong oil was a popular Australian product. Brisbane chemists bought it in large quantities and it was also used in the production of cosmetics. Dugong bone, when turned into charcoal, was said to be the best charcoal for sugar refining. A ban on hunting dugong in Moreton Bay was enacted on 20 March 1969. ==Current practice== Aboriginal people are still allowed to hunt a small number of sea cows, and this practice has been partially responsible for the decline in dugong numbers during the past thirty years. Other factors, such as human clearance of seagrass, the dugong's main food source; and metal pollution, have also contributed to the decline. However, the current dugong population of Australia is comparatively healthy, and is under limited threat except in Eastern Queensland. == References == Category:Hunting in Australia Category:Hunting by game Category:Sirenians ","title":"Dugong hunting in Australia"},{"id":"35907402","text":"Alexander Adie (1861 ‚Äì 18 July 1940) was a pioneer of the sugar industry in Childers, Queensland where he was born, and the third chairman of the Isis Central Sugar Mill Company.THE HISTORY OF THE ISIS SCRUB by Authur Laurie From 1897 till 1939 Adie kept a work diary or farm production record.Diaries of Alexander Adie 1897‚Äì1899.

By then he had already been awarded a ‚ÄúGold Disc\\" and had given many concerts in Poland and abroad (e.g. in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Prague, Moscow and Kuwait). Moreover, he was awarded the first prize in Poland for the most popular multi-instrumentalist for five consecutive years (1981‚Äì1985). For the next 4 years (1986‚Äì1990) he was a lecturer in the Academy of Music in Kuwait. At this period of time he created compositions with Arabic influences. The most well known composition in Poland that emerged from this period of time was the symphonic fantasia \\"Faces of the Desert\\". This composition was supposed to be used in the celebration of the 30th anniversary of Kuwait's independence, but the Iraqi invasion precluded realization of the event. After the Persian Gulf War, the \\"Faces of the Desert\\" (which was visualized by photos of artist-photographer Jacek Wozniak ) represented Kuwait on the Global Exhibition EXPO‚Äô92 in Seville, Spain.

In 1998 he was commissioned to write a suite, \\"Reflection: I - Toscania, II - Loara, III - Bolero, IV - Seville\\", in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the artistic work of Agnieszka Duczmal and her Chamber Orchestra \\"Amadeus\\". This piece was composed for chamber orchestra and percussion and each movement bears the names of the places where the orchestra performed. The premiere of the suite occurred in November 1998 at the National Philharmonic in Warsaw. \\"Reflections\\" were received very enthusiastically by the audience. As the first in Poland and in this part of Europe, following the steps of Jean - Michel Jarre, he performed great outdoor concerts of music and light in Szczecin ('93) and Krak√≥w ('94), which were viewed together by 50,000 spectators. Other Concerts of this type were the following: In July 1996 during the Festival of Euro-Eko Meeting in Zlot√≥w, Marek Bilinski presented a very unusual concert - \\" The Beginning of the Light\\", with international musicians: Hannibal Means (tenor)- USA, Sarhan Kubeisi (ethnic percussion instruments) - Syria, Edyta Kulczak (soprano)- Poland, Stanislaw Skoczynski (percussion instruments) - Poland and others. With laser, light and picture most of his important compositions were played at the concert. TVP1 recorded and showed the entire concert on September 1, 1996. It was recognized as one of the most interesting artistic events of the year. On March 12, 2000 in Gniezno he performed a concert, \\"Gniezno - 2000 - Sound - Fire - Light - Color\\", in honor of Five European Presidents Summit. Marek Bilinski shared the stage with Michal Grymuza, Wojciech Pilichowski, Michal Dabr√≥wka, Piotr \\"Jackson\\" Wolski and others. They used the biggest drums in Europe for this occasion. The show was on live transmission by TVP1. On June 21, 2003 in Old Town of Gdansk on the bank of Motlawa, he gave a multimedia performance, \\"St. John‚Äôs - Night\\". Marek Bilinski played with Piotr Cugowski, Marek Raduli, Mieczyslaw Jurecki, Mariusz \\"Fazi\\" Mielczarek, Tomasz Losowski, Ryszard Bazarnik, Krzysztof Krzyskow. The whole music program was embellished by the dancers on the boats. Marek Bilinski's compositions deduces from the best standards of classical and romantic music. His talent and knowledge unite tradition with vision of modern world sounds. == Discography  Studio albums === * Ogr√≥d Kr√≥la ≈õwitu (eng.

The episode premiered on April 26, 2012 on CBS. In it, the main characters go to the bachelor party to celebrate Howard (Simon Helberg) and Bernadette's (Melissa Rauch) upcoming marriage. At the party, a drunk Raj (Kunal Nayyar) reveals some information about Howard's past sexual encounters. When Bernadette picks them up from the party, Howard and Rajesh find out that Bernadette learned about Howard's sexual history from a video posted on the internet.

The episode received mixed reviews from television critics, noting that it was not as heavy on jokes compared to other episodes in the series. == Plot == Sheldon, Raj, Leonard and Howard discuss Howard's bachelor party, with Howard reaffirming to Raj that strippers are banned from the party. Raj then suggests a wine tasting train trip through Napa Valley but, despite Sheldon's approval, this idea is rejected as well. Meanwhile, Amy is filming Bernadette and Penny making wedding party gifts. She begins to ask a question about consummation but Penny tells her to ask something normal, such as what Bernadette's married name will be. The bachelor party proves to be a failure, with Sheldon's jokes falling flat and Barry Kripke complaining about the lack of strippers. A drunk Raj then begins his speech by saying that he was lonely when he first moved to America until he met Howard. He then tells embarrassing stories about Howard's sexual history, including how Howard lost his virginity to his second cousin, had a threesome with Raj and a Sailor Moon cosplayer at ComicCon and slept with a prostitute. Later, Bernadette comes to drives Howard and Raj home and reveals that Wil Wheaton put a video of Raj's speech on YouTube. Howard had previously claimed that he told her about every girl he had been with, but had not done so. Back at her apartment, she questions whether she can marry him. She is also upset at Penny, who originally set her up with Howard. Howard shows up at Bernadette's apartment and gives Penny a heartfelt and genuine apology to give to her, which reduces Penny to tears. Bernadette overhears this and forgives him. Amy is relieved that she is still a maid of honor and the four hug. Leonard later meets Penny in the laundry room and wants to have sex, but Penny declines. == Production == Eric Kaplan helped write the story for the episode.

Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded it a C, claiming that Amy \\"gets some of the episode's best lines\\". Sava noted that it \\"has a lot of Jew humor, and Mayim Bialik and Simon Helberg are the perfect people to deliver it\\", although disliked Barry and Wil and said that \\"their jokes wore thin fairly quickly\\". R.L. Shaffer of IGN also gave the episode a mixed review, saying that The Big Bang Theory has become more \\"cynical and chauvinistic\\" towards female characters. Shaffer also noted he was more frustrated about \\"the revelation that Bernadette wouldn't allow strippers at Wolowitz's bachelor party\\", as it is never explained why. Shaffer claimed that there were \\"only a few laughs here and there\\" and scored the episode 5.5 out of 10, classifying it as \\"mediocre\\". Carla Day of TV Fanatic gave a more positive review, rating the episode 4.5 out of 5, and praising Penny's response to Howard's apology and claiming that it \\"provided a nice chuckle.\\" Jill Mader of Inside Pulse also gave the episode a more positive review, praising \\"that the episode ended with a really sweet moment for Howard as, after all, he is a character who doesn't often get to be sweet\\" and claimed that it was \\"definitely about people changing and moving forward, and The Big Bang Theory has done a great job of emotionally maturing many of their characters over the past couple seasons\\". Despite this, she said that \\"the episode wasn't as as [she had] hoped it would be\\" and \\"felt like there was more potential in Howard's bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to Bernadette.\\" Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode as 56 out of 100, describing Howard's \\"little speech\\" as \\"very well written and performed\\". However, he considered most of the comedy \\"generic\\", especially in regards to the jokes about Jewish stereotypes and Penny's dismissal of Leonard. Overall, Pierson said it \\"wasn't the strongest episode of comedy\\" and \\"wasn't a particularly interesting episode until the end\\". == Notes  References  External links == * \\"The Stag Convergence\\" at CBS.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Stag Convergence ","title":"The Stag Convergence"},{"id":"35907499","text":"Jos√© Herrada Lopez (born 1 October 1985) is a Spanish professional road bicycle racer, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam .

He had a talent for drawing and enrolled in the school of Georges Lefort in Rennes. In 1939 he joined the studio of Auguste Perret at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, but the outbreak of World War II interrupted his schooling. After being mobilized, he returned to the occupied zone and returned to the studio before joining a community of students from the Beaux-Arts in the abandoned village of Opp√®de in the Vaucluse. He returned to Paris in 1943, where he met Bernard Zehrfuss. He qualified as an architect in 1944, and became a friend of Zehrfuss's friend Paul Herb√©. ==Later career== In 1945 Zehrfuss, then heading the department of Architecture and Urban Planning in Tunisia, hired Le Couteur as an architect to work on a series of public buildings using standard plans. He kept this position until the end of 1946. He then established his own firm in Bizerte, building his first major work, the Notre-Dame-de-France (1948-1953), which was inspired by Auguste Perret. Between 1947 and 1948 he worked with Herb√© in sub- Saharan Africa on projects in Bamako (Sudan) and Niamey (Niger). The two architects suggested to Jean Prouv√© the prefabricated \\"Tropic\\" metal house design to meet the requirements of tropical climates. Le Couteur and Herb√© formed an official partnership in 1949, working on a variety of projects while based in the Ministry of Reconstruction and Urbanism (MRU). The MRU provided a reliable source of work. Working with Herb√© he created works such as the hospital in N'Djamena (1953) and in 1955 the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Algiers. The two created the design for the 100,000-seat stadium at Vincennes (1962-1963). In 1962 he participated in the development of Languedoc- Roussillon as planner and chief architect of the resort of Cap d'Agde. After Herb√© died in 1963, Le Couteur created the French Pavilion at the Osaka World Fair (1969), and built many housing estates. Other achievements included the Maison de la Culture at Reims (1961-1969), the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar (1961-1972), the University of Amiens and the Agora in √âvry. Married in 1954, he had four children.

He later worked as a Hollywood butler for movie stars Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, and Joan Crawford. Clark's wife lived at the Crawford residence working as the cook for Joan Crawford. ==Early life== Born in 1903,http://www.federalwaymirror.com/news/152791385.html Clark grew up in a segregated Tulsa, Oklahoma as a drugstore delivery boy. He was raised in the Greenwood side of town (which was black) and could not enter stores in the predominantly-white downtown area. In the late afternoon on May 30, 1921, a black teenager, Dick Rowland, used the elevator in the Drexel building in downtown Tulsa. As Rowland exited the elevator, an employee of Renberg's clothing store heard what was thought to be a scream. The clerk reached the conclusion that Sarah Page, the white elevator operator, had been assaulted. Newspaper headlines supported the account, causing a race riot to occur in Tulsa on May 31, 1921. ===Tulsa race massacre=== Clark was 18 years old when the Tulsa massacre occurred and saw many people die. Clark remembered trying to get a car to help victims of the massacre when gunfire came his way. Clark ran for his life while people were shooting at him. His family home was burned to the ground and he believed his stepfather was killed during the massacre, as he was never seen again. During the 18-hour siege white people destroyed 30 blocks of a thriving African-American residential and business community known as the \\"Black Wall Street,\\" leaving 38 known dead and 200+ missing (a figure estimated by the American Red Cross) and 10,000 homeless. Shortly thereafter, at age 19, Clark fled Tulsa on a train bound for California to look for his biological father. He survived 20 days in a California jail for bootlegging and selling illegal whiskey. He wound up getting married and finding employment in Hollywood as a butler. Based on a spiritual dream to become a preacher doing the work of God, Clark later became an itinerant evangelist traveling the United States and the world on behalf of the Church of God In Christ. Officially ordained as a minister in 1946, Clark was the oldest living practising evangelist at age 109, and remained in good health until his death. A documentary was later made entitled Before They Die telling the story of Clark and the massacre as they occurred in 1921. At 109 years old, 'Dad' Clark (as he was called) was the oldest living survivor of the 1921 Tulsa massacre at the time of his death. ==Health and death== Clark was 109 when he died in Seattle. Clark was noted to have been in excellent health, up until his death, having not used medication, hearing aid, or cane when walking. Clark was also noted to have been active, having traveled to Zimbabwe for a three-week mission trip when he was 104, and visiting Canada in January 2012. Clark was reportedly preparing for a mission trip to Nigeria in 2013. ==References *Voices of Oklahoma interview with Otis Clark.

He graduated from Millikin University in 1992 with a degree in political science. ==Early political career== After graduating from college, Davis worked for then-Secretary of State George Ryan. In 1996, he lost a race for the state legislature. In 1998, Davis managed the first re-election campaign for Illinois Congressman John Shimkus. Following the successful campaign, Davis accepted a position on Shimkus' congressional staff. In 2000, Davis lost his campaign for mayor of Taylorville, Illinois. Davis served as Shimkus' projects director while running for Congress. ==U.S House of RepresentativesElections=== 2012 On May 19, 2012, the Republican County Chairmen for the 14 Illinois counties comprising the 13th district nominated Davis as the Republican candidate in the 13th district. This district had previously been the 15th, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Tim Johnson. Johnson had announced in April that he would not seek re-election, just days after winning the Republican primary. Other finalists for the nomination were Jerry Clarke, chief of staff to fellow U.S. Representative Randy Hultgren and Johnson's former chief of staff; Erika Harold, a lawyer and winner of Miss America in 2003; and Kathy Wassink, a businesswoman. Davis was coaching his sons' little league baseball game when he was informed that he had been nominated. His home in Taylorville had previously been in Shimkus' 19th District (which had been renumbered as the new 15th). However, the new 13th had absorbed much of the old 19th's northern portion, including Taylorville. In the general election, Davis narrowly defeated Democrat David M. Gill by a margin of 1,002 votes (0.3%). Independent candidate John Hartman received around 21,000 votes (7.2%). 2014 On June 13, 2013, former Miss America Erika Harold announced she would run against Davis in the 2014 Republican primary.

After the vote, Politico reported that Davis also intended to vote for a bill that would end the shutdown, stressing that an agreement needed to be made and that \\"Like most of those I represent, I remain opposed to Obamacare, but a government shutdown is absolutely unacceptable.\\" ===Gun policy=== In March 2018, in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Davis said the shooting could have been prevented if the perpetrator had been charged with a felony for bringing a gun to school earlier. Davis said he believed more funding should be directed to mental health programs and that loopholes in background checks should be closed, but that he did not see banning guns as a solution.Schlenker, Charlie; Rodney Davis Stands Firm For Second Amendment; NPR; March 29, 2018; http://wglt.org/post/rodney-davis-stands-firm-second-amendment#stream/0 ===Health care=== Davis voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On May 4, 2017, Davis voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA). During his re-election campaign, Davis claimed that The Washington Post fact-checker had found his opponent's claims about the impact of Obamacare's repeal on preexisting conditions to be false. The Washington Post fact-checker responded, saying that Davis was \\"twisting an unrelated fact check and [was] misleading voters.\\" ===Immigration=== In June 2016, Davis cast the deciding vote on a bill to retain the ability of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to join the U.S. military. The program would allow a quicker pathway to citizenship for those who serve. In September 2017, some constituents protested Davis' opposition to extending the DACA legislation without concurrent funding for a border wall. In June 2018, Davis told an interviewer that he hoped to co- sponsor a ‚Äústand-alone bill‚Äù that would address the separation of adult illegal aliens at the Mexican border from the children accompanying them. He expressed optimism that the Congress could come up with some compromise on these issues. ===Tax reform=== Davis voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Davis said the tax bill will improve the economy without impacting the deficit. He said Americans will see \\"more money in the pockets\\" come February 2018 as a result of the bill. In a December 26, 2017, interview on CNN, Davis said that the U.S. would see increase tax revenue because of the economic growth resulting from the tax cut, and this, in turn, would bring down the national deficit.Davis Joins CNN Newsroom to Discuss Health Care Reform; CNN; April 5, 2017; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QblHNuQq4 ===Tariffs=== In an April 2018 interview, Davis expressed concern about the impact of proposed tariffs on Illinois soybean farmers and other Illinois agricultural workers, but was glad that President Trump had given ‚Äúa lot of free rein‚Äù to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.

The bill would allow employers to exclude veterans receiving health insurance from the United States Department of Defense or the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs from their list of employees. This would have had the effect of keeping their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would require them to provide their employees with healthcare under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Davis said that the bill \\"gives our small businesses another incentive to hire veterans, which helps to address the increasing number of unemployed veterans, while providing them with some relief from ObamaCare.\\" ===Women's rights=== Davis opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the health of the mother. According to Emily's List, Davis has voted in favor of a 20-week abortion ban and has also voted to defund Planned Parenthood and also voted against an equal pay bill.https://www.emilyslist.org/news/entry/emilys-list-puts-u.s.-rep.-rodney- davis-il-13-on-notice-for-2016https://emilyslist.org/on-notice/entry/rodney- davishttps://cqrcengage.com/nrlc/app/person/16746?0 He voted to re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act. ===Cannabis=== Davis has cast several votes in favor of legalizing medical marijuana.

The paper is best remembered as a vehicle for the ideas of Daniel DeLeon (1852‚Äì1914), the dominant ideological leader of the SLP from the 1890s until the time of his death. The paper became a daily in 1900, reverting to weekly publication in 1914 for budgetary reasons. Publication of the paper was moved to Palo Alto, California during its later years, finally terminating publication in 2008. Its 117 years of continuous publication make The People the longest running socialist newspaper in the history of American political radicalism. ==Publication historyForerunners=== The privately owned Workmen's Advocate of the Socialist Labor Party was the direct antecedent of the party- owned broadsheet, The People. The Workingmen's Party of the United States was established in August 1876 and renamed itself as the Socialist Labor Party of America at its National Congress in Newark, New Jersey a year later.Tim Davenport, \\"Socialist Labor Party of America (1876‚Äì1946): Party History,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ The members of the organization were predominantly immigrants from Germany throughout its earliest years, although the SLP did maintain 7 English-speaking Sections by the end of 1877. Bolting trade union-oriented Marxists established a newspaper called The Labor Standard in 1877, although no official English-language publication existed until the governing National Executive Committee established The National Socialist in Cincinnati, Ohio in May 1878. This publication was in existence only a short time before budgetary concerns forced its abrupt termination, with a Chicago newspaper called The Socialist emerging as the main English-language organ of the organization. The party's German-speaking majority were served by a privately owned daily, the New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News), which first saw print in 1878. The SLP's English-speaking membership atrophied during the first half of the 1880s and the organization had no official English paper for several years. Instead, the organization launched and briefly maintained an official organ in German, Der Sozialist (The Socialist), published in New York City from 1885 to 1887. It was not until a privately owned weekly, The Workmen's Advocate, debuted in New Haven, Connecticut by the Trades Council of New Haven on September 8, 1883 that the SLP's English-speaking members again had access to a party-oriented newspaper in their own language. It would be this publication from which The People would emerge.The Workmen's Advocate was consolidated with the new publication. See: Rudolph Katz, \\"With DeLeon Since '89,\\" in Daniel DeLeon: The Man and His Work: A Symposium. New York: National Executive Committee, Socialist Labor Party, 1919; pg. 10. ===Establishment=== Volume 1, number 1 of The People was unveiled on April 5, 1891 as the first party-owned English weekly since termination of The National Socialist. The large broadsheet was produced on the press owned by the association which published the Volkszeitung and Sunday was initially chosen as the weekly publication day.Rudolph Katz, \\"With DeLeon Since '89,\\" in Daniel DeLeon: The Man and His Work: A Symposium. New York: National Executive Committee, Socialist Labor Party, 1919; pg. 10. First editor of the publication was Lucien Sanial (1835‚Äì1927), a French-born veteran of the socialist movement. Sanial was soon shunted aside however, resigning as editor in 1892 to make way for the rising star of the SLP's firmament, a university lecturer recently converted to Marxism named Daniel DeLeon.Katz, \\"With DeLeon Since '89,\\" pg. 11. Although Sanial's leaving was ostensibly related to failing eyesight and other physical difficulties associated with old age, few active in the party doubted that the actual reason for Sanial's removal related to a simple need to seat the energetic and intense DeLeon in the editorial chair. DeLeon would remain at the post until his death in May 1914.Carl Reeve, The Life and Times of Daniel DeLeon. New York: American Institute for Marxist Studies/Humanities Press, 1972; pg. 40. DeLeon proved to be a highly effective editor of the 4-page weekly, contributing a stream of articles which aggressively excoriated purported systemic defects of capitalism, while expounding the benefits of the socialist system.Katz, With DeLeon Since '89,\\" pg. 14. DeLeon's consistent and confrontational leftism in the pages of the party weekly soon propelled him to a position of high authority among the SLP's rank-and-file membership, even exceeding that of the nominal political chiefs of the organization. ===1899 split=== Editor Daniel DeLeon as he appeared around the turn of the 20th century As the decade of the 1890s progressed, the Socialist Labor Party became deeply divided over the relationship of the party to the trade union movement, with Daniel DeLeon and his co-thinkers supportive of dual unionism through the SLP's 1896 establishment of a socialist rival to the American Federation of Labor and Knights of Labor called the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance.Morris Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States. Fifth revised and enlarged edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1910; pg. 295. The organization's division over the matter converged around the party press, with The People and the SLP's official German paper, Vorw√§rts, filled with attacks upon so-called \\"pure and simple labor unions\\" and their allegedly corrupt officers.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 296. An Anti-DeLeon \\"opposition faction\\" headed by Morris Hillquit and Henry Slobodin emerged, grouping themselves around the widely circulated New Yorker Volkszeitung. These insurgents expressed critical support for the AF of L and its unions, seeking to radicalize these through the tactic of boring from within. In July 1899 matters came to a head with the anti-DeLeon insurgents of New York calling a special meeting at which the offices of Executive Secretary, the members of the National Executive Committee, and editorship of The People were declared vacant.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 297. There followed a period of organizational dualism, in which two groups both claimed for themselves the mantle of the Socialist Labor Party, each with their own officers and their own official English-language newspaper called The People.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 298. The paper changed to a daily frequency in 1900, thereby becoming The Daily People, ultimately reverting to the previous name in 1914 when financial concerns forced a retreat to weekly status.Thomas Wagstaff, \\"The People: New York, 1891‚Äî,\\" in Joseph R. Conlin (ed.), The American Radical Press, 1880‚Äì1960. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; vol. 1, pg. 307. This name was maintained for decades. Ultimately the DeLeon regulars won rights to the name of the paper in the courts and the dissident edition of The People was supplanted in April 1901 by the establishment in New York City of The Worker ‚Äî lineal forerunner of the New York Call. That same year the anti- DeLeon dissidents of the so-called \\"Springfield Social Democratic Party\\" became one of the primary components of a new organization called the Socialist Party of America. ===Early 20th century=== The first two decades of the 20th century proved to be the period of greatest political influence for The People. In conjunction with the SLP's publishing house, the New York Labor News Company, an array of Marxist articles and pamphlets saw print, including the first American publication of Marx's Critique of the Gotha Program in the pages of The People on January 7, 1900.Reeve, The Life and Times of Daniel DeLeon, pg. 80. In addition to translations by DeLeon of the so-called \\"Marxist classics, new speeches and writings by DeLeon himself were published, such as The Burning Question of Trade Unionism (1904) and Flashlights of the Amsterdam Congress (1906).Reeve, The Life and Times of Daniel DeLeon, pp. 81‚Äì82. A sharply critical and at times venomous rhetorical tone was maintained in the pages of The People against the perceived opponents and rivals of the SLP. In 1911 a series of 30 articles were published in the paper's pages analyzing the day-to-day activities of Victor L. Berger, elected as the first Socialist to the U.S. Congress in the fall of the previous year.Reeve, The Life and Times of Daniel DeLeon, pg. 82. These articles were later collected in pamphlet form in a tract entitled Berger's Hit and Misses. Similarly, a series of 19 articles by DeLeon in The People written against the ideas of a popular anti-socialist priest, Thomas Gasson, were later gathered into pamphlet form as Father Gassoniana. ===Later years=== Following the death of Daniel DeLeon in 1914, the editorial helm of The People was turned over to Edmund Seidel, an advocate of merger between the Socialist Labor Party with the rival Socialist Party of America. The proposition was controversial within both organizations and such unification was not to be. Seidel was replaced in 1918 by Olive M. Johnson, a consistent opponent of the SPA in the tradition of DeLeon. Johnson was re-elected to the post by the membership of the SLP at its conventions of 1920, 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936 without opposition.Frank Girard and Ben Perry, The Socialist Labor Party, 1876‚Äì1991: A Short History. Philadelphia, PA: Libra Books, 1991; pg. 58. Johnson retired from the editorial chair in 1938, suffering from a case of tuberculosis which sapped her strength.Ben Perry, \\"Olive M. Johnson,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing, 1990; pg. 394. Some historians believe her to have been forced out by Arnold Petersen, the powerful National Secretary of the organization. Following Johnson's retirement in February 1938, Emil Teichert took over as editor of The People on a temporary basis. A membership referendum vote was held in 1938 to elect a new permanent editor for the paper, pitting Teichert against Eric Hass, one of the party's National Organizers who had recently completed journalism course work at the University of Kansas. This balloting was won by Hass, who thereby became the 5th official editor of The People. In the subsequent three decades, the publication maintained a relatively stable weekly circulation, hitting a low of 9,000 in 1925 to a high of 11,450 in 1945, including individual subscriptions and bundle orders for free distribution. ===Termination and legacy=== As the membership of the SLP declined in the late 20th century, The People moved from a weekly to a monthly production cycle. In 2003, the paper began to be published every other month, finally terminating in print form effective with the issue of March‚ÄìApril 2008.\\"The People,\\" Socialist Labor Party, www.slp.org/ Thus ended a print run of 117 years ‚Äî by far the longest continuous run of any socialist or communist publication in the history of American radicalism. A short-lived effort to revitalize the publication as an on-line quarterly followed, commencing in the Summer of 2008 and ending in the fall of 2011, at which time the publication ceased publication indefinitely.\\"The People: Notice,\\" Socialist Labor Party, www.slp.org/ The People remains readily available to activists and scholars of labor history and radical politics on microfilm, the master negative of which is held by the Wisconsin Historical Society in Madison. ==Socialist Studies== The organization published a series called Socialist Studies from 1981 to 1983 The series was inaugurated in 1981. Many of the titles in the series were articles reprinted from the SLP's official journal, The People.

He retired as the police chief of West Bengal. ==Career== Gupta joined the Indian Police Service in 1943. He was trained along with Taslimuddin Ahmed, who remained a lifelong friend, but with whom he had a meeting only after the creation of Bangladesh; Taslimuddin was the IG East Pakistan before Bangladesh, during the military crackdown. Between 1943 and 1967 he served in various capacities, including SDPO in Chittagong District (pre-independence Bengal), responsible for liaison with the Indian Army during the war. It was during this period that he made friends with Col. Cariappa, later the Chief of Army Staff of Independent India, and Captain Osmani, later the Chief of the Bangladesh Army. He was posted as SDPO, Serampore, when the war ended, and moved on to be Superintendent, Wireless, where he supervised the installation of the wireless system for the state and for the city of Calcutta alike, a system that has served both police forces since then, with modernisation as demanded. He then was DC, South, and took pride throughout his career on there not being a single casualty during the traumatic days of partition. Later, after stints as DC, DD, and then as DC, HQ, he was the youngest DIG, as the man in charge of the Northern Range. He went on (not in sequence) to be DIG in charge of Presidency Range, DIG Intelligence Bureau, and DIG, Armed Police, Training and Borders. The Armed Police at that time consisted of three battalions and the Industrial Area Reserve Force. Later he raised the 2nd Battalion of the Eastern Frontier Rifles. . He was the DIG (Border Police) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. In 1967, he succeeded another life-long friend, P. K. Sen, as Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, just as the Naxalite movement got into high gear. He played a controversial role in tackling the Naxalite movement. He was hated by not only the ultra-left radicals and human rights activists for his ruthless line of action, but also by mainstream politicians. However, his juniors held him in high regard, particularly for his integrity and strong character. During the troubled Naxalite movement days, as Commissioner of Police, he worked directly under Govind Narain, who was the Union Home Secretary. Afterwards, he worked closely with the centre to restore the rule of law in West Bengal. He is particularly credited for the conduct of the elections in 1971. Quite often in the thick of controversy, he had trouble with the political establishment in April 1971 and proceeded on leave. He returned in 1972 as IG of West Bengal (then police chief; the post of Director General had not been created, and came in with his successor) and continued till July 1976. Thereafter, he retired prematurely. Endowed with impeccable manners, he was a scholar and anthropologist. His original discipline at Presidency College was history, which he read under the legendary Susobhan Sarkar. It was noteworthy that he was the only contributor to the festschrift brought out to honour his old master who was not formally a practising academician; all the others were the biggest names teaching and practising the discipline of history in India. Prasun Mukherjee, a senior police officer who served under him, in an obituary tribute said, \\"In the departure of Mr Ranjit Gupta, we have lost a person who had become a legend during his career, who was a born leader of a force, was confident of himself, trusted his juniors and identified himself with them so much that he called himself a Policeman and not a Police Officer.\\" == Death == Gupta died on 19 May 2012 at the age of 93. ==References== Category:2012 deaths Category:Indian police chiefs Category:Bengali people Category:Police officers from Kolkata Category:Year of birth missing Category:West Bengal Police ","title":"Ranjit Kumar Gupta"},{"id":"35907865","text":"Dumitru Coliu (born Dimitar Kolev, , ; November 7, 1907 - 1985) was a Romanian communist activist and politician.

On February 27, 1907, the Arizona Ranger Harry C. Wheeler attempted to detain a man named J. A. Tracy in the town of Benson, Arizona. Tracy resisted arrest and opened fire on Wheeler, but the latter armed himself and a gunfight ensued. When the shooting was over, both Tracy and Wheeler were badly wounded, however, the former died of his wounds and Wheeler fully recovered. ==Background== J. A. Tracy was a wealthy businessman who lived in Vail Station, where he was employed as an agent for the Helvetia Copper Company. According to author Pleasant DeSpain, Tracy came to Arizona from Nevada to pursue a young lady, with whom he had relations in the past. The lady was not interested in Tracy though and she left Nevada for Phoenix between 1905 and 1906. There she joined a Mr. D. W. Silverton, Jr., who was the son of the Kentucky Colonel D. W. Silverton, and the two went to Tucson to settle down. Mr. Silverton claimed that he married the young lady, whose name remains unknown, because she refused to tell the newspapers in the aftermath of the Benson shooting. She was the daughter in a wealthy family from Colorado and, because of her relationship with Tracy, she wanted to protect her family name from embarrassment. The ceremony was, allegedly, carried out by a traveling evangelist minister in Phoenix, but a later investigation suggested that the marriage may have been fabricated. Tracy was not giving up on Mrs. Silverton. He began sending her threatening letters and, sometime later, he purchased a diamond ring with the intention of proposing to her, unaware that she had already been married. In February 1907, when they discovered that Tracy was coming to Tucson \\"to set things right,\\" the Silvertons decided it would be best to be somewhere else. Accordingly, they boarded a train for Bisbee on the afternoon of February 26. Along the way they stopped at Vail Station and it was at this time that they saw Tracy standing outside on the platform. Mr. Silverton stepped off the train to confront Tracy, but it is unknown what exactly was said in the following argument. When the train began moving again, Silverton boarded it and saw Tracy attempt to jump on the caboose. The journey continued on towards Bisbee, however, the train had to stop overnight in the small town of Benson and the Silvertons were forced to book a room at the Virginia Hotel, located across the street from the station. Fearing that Tracy was following behind, Mr. Silverton hired a local man to watch the train station and warn him if the former arrived. Lieutenant Harry C. Wheeler and his captain, Thomas H. Rynning, were also guests at the hotel. According to DeSpain, Wheeler was known for being \\"levelheaded\\" and was \\"one of the fastest guns around.\\" On the next morning, February 27, the Silvertons awoke to find that Tracy had arrived in town so Mr. Silverton went out to the street to see if it was clear. There he saw Tracy standing on the platform, waiting for the train to Bisbee, and the handle of a revolver peeking out from under his jacket. Silverton then went back into the Virginia Hotel and asked the clerk at the front desk for a weapon to defend himself with. The clerk declined, but Silverton's plight was overheard by Lieutenant Wheeler, who was waiting in the lobby nearby. After being informed of the situation, Wheeler proceeded outside to arrest Tracy while the Silvertons made their way to the train. ==Shootout== Harry C. Wheeler as captain of the Arizona Rangers. Southern Pacific Railroad station in Benson, which is used as a tourist information center. According to a Benson newspaper, Tracy saw the Silvertons walking towards the train station and, just as he was drawing his Colt .45 to fire on them, he was confronted by Lieutenant Wheeler, who said: \\"Hold on there. I arrest you. Give me that gun.\\" Before a reply, however, Tracy began firing at Wheeler. The first bullet passed through Wheeler's jacket without harming him, but one of the others struck him in his left leg. He then drew his weapon and fired four times in return, advancing after each shot. All four hit Tracy above the waist, although he remained standing in the middle of the street. At this time, Tracy called out to Wheeler, saying: \\"I am all in. My gun is empty.\\" It was only a trick, though, a trick that worked perfectly. Wheeler threw his gun to the ground and began walking towards Tracy, but the latter retained his weapon and began firing again. One of the bullets hit Wheeler in his right foot, but, according to the newspaper, he armed himself with rocks and began throwing them at Tracy until he was incapacitated. Pleaseant DeSpain contradicts the newspaper, though, and says that Wheeler was actually struck down by Tracy and, as they were lying side-by-side, the lieutenant grabbed a rock and hit Tracy over the head with it. In any event, both of the men were badly wounded and the Silvertons got away safely. Both sources do agree that immediately after the fighting ended, a bystander heard Wheeler say: \\"Well, it was a great fight while it lasted, wasn't it, old man?\\" Wheeler was taken to the hospital in Tombstone and he remained out of action for several months before going back to duty as the third and final captain of the Arizona Rangers. Tracy was sent to Tucson, but he died of his wounds at Mescal Station, a few hours after the journey began. He was shot four times; once in the neck, once in the chest, once in the shoulder and once in the hip. ==See also== * List of Old West gunfights * Benson (Amtrak station) * Tiburon Island Tragedy ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1907 Category:1907 in Arizona Territory Category:American Old West gunfights Category:Arizona folklore Category:Arizona Rangers Category:Crimes in Arizona Territory Category:February 1907 events ","title":"Shootout in Benson"},{"id":"35908070","text":"Sarnia Regional Cogeneration Plant is a natural gas power station owned by TransAlta Energy, in Sarnia, Ontario.

In Berkeley, McNamara, and his younger brother Liam McNamara, were both known by friends to be rather fearless and to shrug off the pains of rough childhood play, foreshadowing his later ability to face danger while surfing.Personal Experience of D. Glaser During his early childhood, his mother took the family to Central America, where she was a victim of domestic abuse and occasionally abandoned him and his brother; at one point, a Guatemalan farmer sought to adopt him, but his mother returned and brought the family back to America. He then returned to Berkeley, where his mother left him with his birth father; McNamara lived with him for several years until his mother returned with a new domestic partner, who moved the family to the North Shore of Hawaii in 1978. At eleven years old, McNamara followed his younger brother's footsteps and began surfing at Sunset, Waimea and the outer reefs in search of giant swells. He entered and placed in the prestigious Hawaiian Triple Crown Series at seventeen and began to gain major sponsors from major Japanese brands. For the next ten years, both brothers joined the competition circuit, traveling and becoming fluent in Japanese. Tow surfing caught on among the surfing community in the early 1990s and McNamara was one of the first to join the movement. Boats and personal water craft enabled surfers to chase down and catch giant waves that were thought impossible, beyond the bounds of surfers paddling with their bare hands. McNamara welcomed and craved the challenge to find the biggest waves in the world, which would instantly become his dream and mission in life. ==Career== Web Summit 2017, Lisbon, Portugal. After training for a year, McNamara and tow-in partner Rodrigo Resende won the $70,000 purse at the Tow Surfing World Cup in Maui at Jaws in 2002. Later that year, he posed for the cover of major surf magazines around the world after being photographed in a dramatic barrel shot off of the coast of Teahupo'o in Tahiti. In 2003 he rode one of his most well known waves. McNamara was once again at Jaws and caught a wave with a barrel where onlookers believed he had been crushed by the lip of the wave. The wave spit and, escaping death, he emerged to the surprise and amazement of everyone watching, including himself. The boundaries of big-wave surfing were pushed once again in the summer of 2007 by McNamara and partner Keali‚Äôi Mamala, seeking tsunami formed by calving glaciers in South-Central Alaska. A feature film was made documenting their experience. In January 2016, McNamara suffered a severe wipeout on a 50-foot wave at Mavericks in California that caused him to skip off the water three times before being swallowed by the monster-size wave. Rescuers on jet skis eventually pulled McNamara to safety, and he suffered a dislocated shoulder and a broken upper arm that required surgery. Video of McNamara's wipeout went viral, and local surfers have said it was one of the worst wipeouts caught on video. ===World record=== In November 2011, chasing storms and tracking swells paid off for McNamara as he entered the Guinness World Records. He caught a wave in Praia do Norte, Nazar√©, Portugal, after being towed into the wave from a jet ski riding a 6‚Äô0 Dick Brewer Tow Board. His record beat the prior world record by over a foot, but the premature announcement (by others, not by McNamara) proved a source of controversy in the surf world. Meanwhile, McNamara continued to search for an even larger wave. In January 2013, McNamara broke his own world record by surfing an estimated wave. He also did this off the coast of Nazar√©. ===Beyond surfing=== McNamara became interested in Stand Up Paddle (SUP) and gave it his own twist by designing and creating SUP boards for a more extreme experience, venturing into big wave venues like Waimea, Puerto Escondido, and Mavericks. He was invited to compete in the World Stand Up Paddle Surfing Championship in June 2009 by the International Surfing Association, where only 32 elite surfers were invited to attend. ==Personal life== McNamara is married to Nicole McNamara (n√©e Macias), an environmental sciences teacher. The couple wed at Praia do Norte, Nazar√©, Portugal, in November 2012. They have two children, Barrel (2015) and Theia Love Nazar√© Celeste Rose (2018). ==Activity== ;2013 Continuous exploration of Nazar√©, Portugal ;2012 Entered into Guinness World Records for Largest Wave Ever Surfed of 78 feet - Nazar√©, Portugal Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Biggest Wave Award Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Wipeout of the Year Award Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Ride of the Year Nominee ;2011 Surfed 78 foot wave in Nazar√©, Portugal that will later be entered into Guinness World Records ;2010 Exploration of Praia do Norte (Nazar√©) - Portugal ;2009 Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Monster Tube Nominee Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Ride of the Year Nominee def ;2008 2nd Place Puerto Escondido, Mexico SUP Contest Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Performance of the Year Award Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Golden Donut Nominee 2nd Place Free Wave Challenge Tube of the Year ;2007 Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Performance of the Year Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Biggest Wave Award ;2006 1st Place Nell Scott Tow Surfing Championships Billabong XXL Awards ‚Äì Golden Donut Award ;2005 1st Place North Shore Tow Surfing Championships ;2004 Surfer Poll ‚Äì Best Tube Award ;2003 1st Place Jaws World Cup Expression Session ;2002 1st Place Jaws World Cup Tow in Surfing ==Filmography== The following is based on Internet Movie Database data: === Television === *Fuel TV - 12 episodes *Travel Channel - 12 episodes *Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ Segment *Discovery Channel Segment *The Swell Life OWN - 12 episodes === Films === *The Glacier Project *The North Canyon Show by Garrett McNamara == See also == * Nazar√©, Portugal * Praia do Norte (Nazar√©) ==References External links == * Category:American surfers Category:Tow- in surfers Category:Big wave surfing Category:Sportspeople in Hawaii Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Pittsfield, Massachusetts Category:People from Oahu ","title":"Garrett McNamara"},{"id":"35908248","text":"NS Savannah, designed by George G. Sharp, Inc. George G. Sharp, Inc. is a marine design and naval architecture firm established in 1920 in New York City by George Gillies Sharp, former Chief Surveyor of the American Bureau of Shipping. The firm started with the design of excursion steamboats on the Delaware and Hudson rivers, then moved into oceangoing passenger and cargo shipping. From 1934 Sharp designed a standardized series of merchant ships for the U.S. Department of Commerce. During World War II Sharp designed the standardized Victory ship, of which 534 were built, and 50 escort carriers. Some of the 1500 vessels designed by Sharp include: * Type C2 ship prototype * Type C3 ship prototype * SS Ancon, SS Panama and SS Cristobal, \\"World of Tomorrow\\" ships for the Panama Railroad Steamship line, 1939 * Milwaukee Clipper, the last passenger steamship on the Great Lakes, 1940 * Mississippi River Towboat, built for the U.S. Army Engineers, 1942 * Victory ship, 534 built during World War II * , 50 built during World War II * and three other destroyer tenders based on C3 hulls during World War II * , 13 built for the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II * , and passenger cargo ships for the Mississippi Shipping Company's South American Service, 1946‚Äì47 * and storeships for the U.S. Navy in the 1950s * , class of seven for the U.S. Navy in the 1960s * NS Savannah, the first nuclear-powered merchant ship * , four nuclear-powered cruisers for the U.S. Navy in the 1970s * Staten Island Ferrys Andrew J.

By the 1930s Sharp was described together with Gibbs & Cox as one of the leading naval architecture firms in the United States. In 1938, he designed the passenger cargo vessel Cristobal for Panama Line Service to the Canal Zone.Selections from the Work of George G. Sharp, Naval Architect and George G.

The game was developed by BigPark and published by Microsoft Studios. It is a sequel to Kinect Joy Ride. Originally outed via a rating on the Australian Classification Board on April 11, 2012, it was unveiled by Microsoft Studios on April 27, 2012. Unlike its predecessor, Joy Ride Turbo does not use Kinect. It was released on May 23, 2012, and later added as one of the first 100 titles on the Xbox One backwards compatibility list on November 9, 2015. Upon release the game was met with mixed reviews from critics. Scores ranged from 50‚Äî80% approval ratings. Reviewers gave high marks for the game's stunt parks, but cited the series' spotted development past as the cause for many of the game's issues. Critics further noted that the game made good use of the Xbox 360 player avatars, with one review specifically mentioning the animations as a high point of commentary. The use of gamepad controller instead of the Kinect peripheral was met with high praise, and many reviewers noted that the game had strong controls. ==Gameplay== Joy Ride Turbo combines elements from other kart racing games such as powerups, split-screen multiplayer, and combat racing. Joy Ride Turbo is a kart racing game similar to the Mario Kart series. The game is controlled using the Xbox 360 controller, unlike its predecessor, Kinect Joy Ride, which utilized the Kinect peripheral. The player's avatar is used as the race driver, whilst computer-controlled characters have system generated avatars that are created randomly. Eight competitors race in a circuit, with powerups littered across the game's several race tracks. These powerups can be offensive, such as rockets, which can be fired at racers in front of the player, defensive, such as a shield, or simply provide a temporary charge in speed. Each of the game's tracks have multiple pathways to complete the course, with longer tracks having more diverse routes. While airborne the player can perform various tricks by moving the controller's analog sticks, which in turn fill their boost meter. Boost is stored in tiers, and each tier brings a more powerful effect when used. The player can select one of 42 fictional cars which are stylized based on several vehicle tropes such as muscle cars, tuner cars, the Volkswagen Type 2 van, and Hot rod roadsters. Each vehicle has several colors to choose from, and can be customized with parts hidden in each of the game's tracks. Players progress by winning championships, which consist of three to four races. Each championship has three difficulty levels to choose from, and higher difficulty levels provide greater rewards. Performing well in races also earns coins, which can be used to unlock alternate paint colors for vehicles, additional variants of existing vehicles, or new cars entirely. All tracks can be played in a free play mode outside of championship racing. Two open-world areas, known as Stunt Parks, are also included in which the player can search for additional collectables or simply practice their skills. All game modes can be played locally with up to four players via split-screen or with up to eight players online via Xbox Live.\\" ==Development== While Joy Ride Turbo is viewed as a direct sequel to Kinect Joy Ride, its roots span back to E3 2009. Known at the time simply as Joyride, the game was initially announced with the intention of it being released as a free-to-play Xbox Live Arcade title later that year. Joyride Producer Andy Lang stated that players would be able to use Microsoft Points to \\"enhance [their] experience.\\" At the time the game featured various modes, including an unreleased team mode. In this mode racers would be split into two teams, and the winning player would claim the victory for their entire team. Additionally the Stunt Park areas shown in the E3 demo allowed for spontaneous checkpoint races to be played, another feature which was cut from the final game. The game was eventually pushed back to 2010 and was made into a full retail title for the Kinect hardware under the name Kinect Joy Ride. Joy Ride Turbo was later outed via a rating on the Australian Classification Board on April 11, 2012. It was officially announced by Microsoft Studios on April 27, 2012. It was released on May 23, 2012, and later added as one of the first 100 titles on the Xbox One backwards compatibility list on November 9, 2015. ==Reception== Joy Ride Turbo received mixed reviews from critics. It holds an aggregate score of 68.21% at GameRankings and 67/100 at Metacritic. The highest score reported was that of an 80% approval from websites Strategy Informer and Worth Playing, while the lowest was a 50% from the website Destructoid. The week following its release it placed seventh in weekly total sales for Xbox Live Arcade games. It stayed in the top 20 games in weekly sales for five months, and ranked sixth in weekly sales in November 2012. It returned to the top 20 weekly sales in October 2013, where it placed 19th. Game Informers Jeff Cork noted that the game was a slight improvement over its predecessor, Kinect Joy Ride. Destructoid's Ian Bonds stated that while Joy Ride Turbo \\"isn't a good game, it's not a bad game, either.\\" He further went on to criticize the need to pick up vehicle-specific parts, and noted that it was frustrating to have multiple parts for multiple vehicles, but not a complete set for any one vehicle. Christian Dolan of Eurogamer cited the game's spotted past as the source of many of its issues. He did note that the game's Stunt Parks were \\"clever places\\" where the player \\"never hit a dead end, never have to reverse, and never feel like [they've] taken the wrong turn.\\" Paul Semel of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the game's light- hearted, cartoon atmosphere. He noted that the game had a strong sense of speed and \\"the tight controls to handle it.\\" Semel felt that while the game was enjoyable, it was too easy to play, and that it could have issues keeping players engaged for the long term. Dave Rudden, a reviewer from Official Xbox Magazine US had similar opinions. Of the game's length they stated that it \\"runs out of value far too quickly.\\" He further expressed frustrations that the minigames from Kinect Joy Ride were excluded. Rudden did note that the gameplay was improved using a gamepad instead of the Kinect peripheral used in its predecessor. ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Split-screen multiplayer games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"Joy Ride Turbo"},{"id":"35908274","text":"Draymond Washington (born July 17, 1990) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Tampa Bay Rowdies in the North American Soccer League. ==CareerCollege and Amateur=== Washington spent his college career at George Mason University.

These give early warning of ballistic missile launches, mainly from the continental United States. The site is part of the Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning and information from here is processed at the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces centre in Solnechnogorsk and could be used, together with early warning radar such as the Voronezh, for launch on warning or the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system. A similar facility is located at Pivan-1 in the Russian Far East. The name Serpukhov-15 is a code name following the practice established to name closed cities and military facilities. It is named after the nearest city, Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast which is about away. ==Oko== Oko consists of two types of early warning satellites - US-K and US-KMO. The older US-K satellites are in highly elliptical molniya orbits which give them coverage of the United States at certain times during the day. For full coverage of the US missile grounds four US-K satellites need to be operational and the system can have up to nine of them in orbit at once. The US-KMO satellites are geosynchronous satellites providing continuous coverage. In total, 101 satellites have been launched. The system was placed on combat duty in 1982. The last US-KMO satellite (Kosmos 2479) was launched on 30 March 2012 and the last US-K satellite (Kosmos 2469) on 30 September 2010. They are due to be replaced by a new system called EKS. ==Facility== In 1960 the site was used as one of the locations of the missiles for the S-25 Berkut () air defence system. Later it was one of the intended bases for A350 missiles for the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system, although it was not completed. The Oko control centre was built later and was put on combat duty in 1982. It consists of antennas and facilities for data processing. Photographs of the site show a number of buildings and seven domes, presumably containing the antennas. As the western control centre it can communicate with geosynchronous satellites in four of the seven reserved locations, those looking over the Atlantic. The other three, looking over the Pacific, need to be controlled from the eastern centre. {  - align=center ! Location Name!! Longitude !!

It appears that the system misidentified a particular set of circumstances including high clouds and the autumn equinox. Lt. Colonel Stanislav Petrov, the officer on duty at the time, discounted the reports as the system had only recently become operational and the launches were not corroborated by early warning radar. ==2001 fire== A fire broke out at the control centre on 10 May 2001 at 2:20 local time. The military tried to put the fire out itself but called the civilian fire brigade at 3:20 local time. They discovered that the fire was located in the gap between the second and third floors. 100 firefighters were involved and media reports said that the affected building was burnt out. It was reported that the centre restarted operations on 20 August 2001. At the time of the fire there were four satellites in the constellation, all US-K in molniya orbits. The effect of the fire was that control of the satellites was lost for 12 hours. Satellites in molniya orbits need contact from the ground station every 2 or three orbits to maintain their orbital position. The fire caused the loss of four satellites - two satellites were lost immediately (Kosmos 2340 and Kosmos 2351) and two more (Kosmos 2368 and Kosmos 2342) within a year due to the negative effect on their orbits. ==References *Photograph of the site from Vympel Category:Military installations of Russia Category:Russian Space Forces Category:Military installations of the Soviet Union ","title":"Serpukhov-15"},{"id":"35908327","text":"\\"Change Nothing\\" is the debut single of American recording artist and American Idol season 11 runner-up, Jessica Sanchez.

They are more amazed, and Sonya somewhat appalled, when they discover later that Paul is deaf. Pop agrees to train him, even though he's still not quite over the death in the ring of a former protege. A romantic relationship begins with Sonya, but she refuses to marry Paul until he's a champion. She impatiently pushes Pop to set up a title fight, even if he is not ready yet. When a reporter, Ann Hollis, comes to interview Paul, she uses sign language. Sonya mocks it as a \\"dummy\\" language and Paul explains that he has always been reluctant to use it. Ann begins seeing Paul socially, takes him to a deaf- children's school and introduces him to her deaf father, a successful architect. Sonya drunkenly threatens to kill Ann if she does not leave Paul alone. A doctor performs an operation that restores Paul's hearing. He rushes to Ann's house, but a party there is so noisy that it confuses and overwhelms him. Paul goes back to Sonya and is excitedly told that a fight's been arranged with Logan, the champ. Paul discovers that Sonya has hidden a telegram from the doctor, explaining that a beating in the ring could cause him to again go deaf. Sonya bets heavily on the fight, but on Paul to lose. The punches he absorbs cause his hearing to fade. With all the distracting noise tuned out, Paul rallies to win the fight. He reunites with Ann, and is relieved when he can hear her speak. ==Cast== * Tony Curtis as Paul Callan * Jan Sterling as Sonya Bartow * Mona Freeman as Ann Hollis * Wallace Ford as Jack 'Pop' Richardson * Connie Gilchrist as Mrs. Richardson * Katherine Locke as Mrs. Hollis * Harry Shannon as Mike Callan, Paul's Father * Louis Jean Heydt as Whity * Tom Powers as Andy Randoph * Nella Walker as Mrs. Hackett * Harry Guardino as Lou Callan - Paul's Brother * Joe Gray as Cliff * Harry Ravan as Murphy * Ted Stanhope as Maris, the Bulter ==See also== * List of American films of 1952 * List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing ==References * Category:1952 films Category:1950s sports drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American boxing films Category:American sports drama films Category:Film noir Category:Films about deaf people Category:Films directed by Joseph Pevney Category:Films scored by Hans J.

According to her memoirs, which are in a Benedictine monastery in France, she was converted to the nationalist cause after reading John Mitchel's Jail Journal. From 1899 to 1904 she edited a women's page and also a children's page in the Irish Weekly Independent. She promoted the nationalist cause in both. She joined the Gaelic League, where she met Irish-language enthusiasts such as Evelyn Donovan, Agnes O'Farrelly and M√°ire N√≠ Chinn√©ide, and spent several years on its executive.Agnes O'Farrelly, Smaointe ar √Årainn/Thoughts on Aran, ed. R√≠ona Nic Cong√°il (2010), p. 15 In 1907, she married Thomas O'Nolan, who died in 1913. She was a close friend of Arthur Griffith and in a letter of condolence which Griffith wrote to her sister from Mountjoy Jail in 1920 he states that Mary Butler was the first person to suggest to him the name Sinn F√©in as the title of the new organisation which he had founded. She died in Rome in 1920 and is buried there. ==Early life and education== The Butlers of County Clare were a landowning family that had remained Catholic, unlike other branches of the same family.Biletz, F.

Women and Irish-Ireland: The domestic nationalism of Mary Butler; retrieved from https://www.academia.edu/412151/Women_and_Irish- Ireland_The_Domestic_Nationalism_of_Mary_Butler Her father, Peter, had been educated in France and was always at home in French as in English or Irish. The family of her mother, Ellen Lambert of Castle Ellen, County Galway, remained staunchly Gaelic. Her younger sister, Isabella, however, was, interestingly, the mother of Lord (better known as Sir) Edward Carson.Clare Genealogy: The butlers of county Clare: Bunnahow; Walterstown; Kilcommon and Ballyline; Doonbeg; retrieved 16 November 2016, from http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/genealogy/butlers/bunnahow.htm Thus, Edward Carson, who became the symbol of Ulster Unionism,Boyd, W.

Her early education was first conducted at home and the way was carefully prepared for the masters' tuition. During the Land League agitation of the late 1870s and early 1880s, Butler was educated at Alexandra College, Dublin, a school attended largely by young women of Protestant background,Biletz, F. (2002). Women and Irish-Ireland: The Domestic Nationalism of Mary Butler. New Hibernia Review / Iris √âireannach Nua, 6(1), 59-72. where she had the advantage of having native masters for the French, Italian, and German languages which she studied with enthusiasm. According to A Life of Mary Butler, a marked characteristic of her young days and one that grew with her growth, was her intense love of home ties. Butler's conversion to nationalism resulted from a chance encounter with the writings of Young Ireland, and like many blossoming cultural nationalists, she immersed herself in the culture of the western part of the country, visiting the Aran Islands on several occasions.Dworkin, D.L. (Ed.). (2012). Ireland and Britain, 1798-1922. USA:Hackett Publishing. ==Activism== Butler was a member of the Gaelic League, serving for several years on its League Executive, but unlike other notable female members such as Countess Markevich and Maud Gonne, Mary did not seek an \\"assertive public role\\".Biletz, F. (2016). Women and Irish- Ireland: The domestic nationalism of Mary Butler. . Retrieved from https://www.academia.edu/412151/Women_and_Irish- Ireland_The_Domestic_Nationalism_of_Mary_Butler Butler was not a professed feminist. She believed that in order for women to progress in Ireland they must progress within the limits of conservative Ireland. She approached much of her writings from a gender related viewpoint, making much reference to the domestic side of activism. She wrote articles that appeared frequently in the League's newspaper, An Claidheamh Soluis, as well as in the United Irishman and in other periodicals.United Irishman, January 1903 Some were republished as pamphlets.e.g., \\"Irishwomen and the Home Language\\" and \\"Two Schools: A Contrast.\\" Butler's overriding goal was always the achievement of securing an Irish speaking Ireland. It is no surprise then that Mary had ties to Arthur Griffith. Griffith actually credited Mary with coining the term ‚ÄòSinn F√©in‚Äô. She focused mainly in her writings on nationalism but in a domestic context and underlined in much of her texts the important role of women in maintaining and promoting nationalism in the home. ==Writing== Butler was a frequent contributor to the leading periodicals of \\"Irish Ireland\\". Her articles appeared frequently in the League's newspaper, An Claidheamh Soluis, as well as in the United Irishman and in various Irish-American periodicals. She also wrote columns in the Irish weekly independent on issues concerning children's education and women's role in the movement.MacPherson, D. A. J. (2012). Women and the Irish Nation: Gender, Culture and Irish Identity, 1890-1914. Palgrave Macmillan. Many of her articles got issued separately as pamphlets among some of which were: \\"Irish woman and the Home language\\",Dworkin, D. L. (Ed.). (2012). Ireland and Britain, 1798-1922. Hackett Publishing. \\"Two schools: A contrast\\", \\"Womanhood and Nationhood\\".Steele, K. M. (2007). Women, press, and politics during the Irish Revival. Syracuse University Press. Butler also wrote fiction, publishing a collection of stories ‚ÄúA Bundle of Rushes‚Äù in 1900. In 1906 her first novel ‚ÄúThe Ring of Day‚Äù was serialized in the Irish Peasant, before being published in a book form a year later. The book focused on a young woman's conversion to the cause of Irish-Ireland and may be largely taken as a self-portrait.The Ring of Day. London: Hutchinson and Company, 1906 ==Religion== Butler was a devout Catholic, as shown by the fact that she was a frequent contributor to the Bulletin and other Catholic periodicals.Alter, S. (1921). Notes from Rome (on the death in Rome of M√°ire de Buitl√©ir - Mrs. O'Nolan). The Catholic bulletin, Vol. XI, 19-20. Despite her views on gender equality, Butler did believe that the Church promoted domesticated idea of women, although she believed women could still do a lot of work for the Irish language revival movement from the comfort of their own homes. She lived in Brittany, France for a while with her mother, before moving to Rome. Butler was very comfortable living in Brittany, as she viewed the native Bretons as having the same Celtic roots and sharing the same Catholic beliefs and strong level of faith as the Irish. In her writings for the Catholic Bulletin, she also continuously compares the landscape to the west coast of Ireland, constantly remarking at how similar they are. She viewed France and Italy as two very free countries and allies of Ireland and she seemed to believe that Ireland should aspire to be more like them, in terms of politics. She believed that the general populations of the two countries were very interested in the Irish political affairs of the time. Furthermore, she loved her time in Rome too, as the city had such a long and strong history of being connected with Catholicism and the ground was, as she said, \\"soaked with the blood of martyrs\\". She was buried in the Catholic cemetery San Lorenzo in Rome on 29 November 1920. ==References== * M√°ire De Buitl√©ir \\"Bean Athbheochana\\" by Mair√©ad N√≠ Chinn√©ide (Comhar 1993) Category:Irish novelists Category:People from County Clare Category:1874 births Category:1920 deaths Category:People educated at Alexandra College Category:Women's page journalists Category:20th- century Irish women writers Category:19th-century Irish women writers ","title":"Mary E.L.

In 2020, these protected natural zones include the Volcanoes National Park, Akagera National Park and Nyungwe Forest. Maintenance of the national park system, as well as tourism infrastructure and promotion of the parks, is managed by the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) with assistance from government ministries. Each park protects a distinct ecosystem and variety of species. Bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, into which the Virungas volcanic mountain chain extends, Volcanoes National Park is the most heavily patrolled park in the world and the oldest in Africa. In combination with adjoining parks in the neighboring countries, it serves as the world's only habitat of the mountain gorillas, whose numbers have been increasing here over the past decade. Visitor numbers to the gorillas are strictly limited and passes must be purchased, often well in advance, from RDB. Golden monkeys also inhabit a separate portion of the park. To the southeast along the Burundian border, Nyungwe National Park hosts many chimpanzees and various other primate species in a highland rainforest environment. The eastern border of Rwanda, along Lake Victoria and Tanzania, is the location of Akagera National Park and protects a variety of African fauna in a savannah ecosystem, including giraffes, elephant, buffalo, baboons, gazelles and zebra.

Robertson was an unsuccessful Republican candidate in the runoff election held on May 24, 2016, for Texas' 19th congressional district seat, which was vacated in January 2017 by the Republican Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock, who has filled the position since 2003. Robertson was defeated by Jodey Arrington, a former vice chancellor of Texas Tech University and an official in the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush. Arrington polled 25,214 votes (53.7 percent) to Robertson's 21,769 (46.3 percent). Robertson had led a nine- candidate field in the primary election on March 1 with 27,791 (26.7 percent) of the ballots cast, followed by Arrington's 26,980 (26 percent). In third place was Michael Bob Starr, the former commander of Dyess Air Force Base who led handily in Abilene and finished with 22,256 votes (21.4 percent). Laredo surgeon Donald R. May finished fourth in the primary with 9,592 votes (9.2 percent). In the first phase of the campaign, Robertson had questioned Starr‚Äôs participation in the LGBT \\"Fun Run\\" at Dyess Air Force Base. Mayor Norm Archibald of Abilene said that he believed the advertisement backfired on Robertson in the runoff campaign against Arrington. ==Background== Robertson attended Texas Tech in Lubbock from 1976 to 1978. See also Peoplefinders info for Karen Robertson (accessed 2012-05-26). ==CareerPolitics=== In the 2012 Lubbock mayoral election, a non-partisan contest under Texas law, Robertson unseated Tom Martin by 30 percentage points‚Äîa result thought to be related to voter perceptions that municipal \\"taxes\\" had increased in the form of fees. One Lubbock resident (who had previously supported Martin but who went for Robertson in 2012) cited Martin's \\"dedication and countless hours\\" but explained the magnitude of the election margin as being an undercurrent of concerns about increasing debt and spending, and the escalating reliance on hidden taxes on water bills to fund unrelated departments. Shortly after inauguration Robertson announced his support for building an electricity plant powered by natural gas and for changes in the structure of water fees to emphasize conservation. Robertson told the West Texas Home Builders Association that he resists untested experiments to address Lubbock's utility situation: \\"I don't want to be the first Christian to face the lion, because he got the biggest and the meanest lion.\\" In January 2015, Robertson said that he might run against Representative Neugebauer in the 2016 election. Robertson cited his unhappiness with what he called Neugebauer's failure to bolster the cotton industry. In March, Robertson said that he would not run for Congress but would instead seek re-election as mayor. Then, on October 13, 2015, Robertson announced his candidacy for Congress once Neugebauer decided not to run again. In the same announcement, Robertson said that he would vacate his position as mayor in May 2016 regardless of the outcome of the congressional race. After winning the May 7, 2016 general election, Dan Pope succeeded Robertson as mayor. In February 2016, Robertson received national attention when he called upon a local Islamic group to take down a banner, reading \\"Love for All.\\" He received widespread criticism when it was determined that Robertson did not attempt to find out what the banner said before he issued his complaint.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mayor-texas-town-arabic- flag-love_us_56c36afce4b08ffac126aa16 ===Business=== Robertson had been a member of the Electric Utility Board.

His grocery-clerk son, Eddie, needs $25 to bail him out. When he can't borrow it, Eddie enters an amateur fight contest and wins it. Julie Walsh is in love with Eddie, but her father disapproves of the Quaid family, particularly the boy's father, so he makes Julie stay away. Pat Quaid, once a promising prizefighter, urges his son to give it a try professionally. Eddie agrees on the condition that Pat quit drinking. Eddie decides to adopt his dad's old ring name, Packy Glennon. To train him, the Quaids go to Bernie Browne, who also has had a problem with booze. Bernie's work with Eddie eventually leads to a fight with Al Gorski for the middleweight championship. Julie shows up, but Eddie angrily dismisses her. Pat explains that Julie's dad has recently committed suicide. Eddie chases after her. Eddie wins the fight and becomes increasingly arrogant. He trains lazily for the rematch with Gorski and is beaten badly. A referee's decision to stop the fight might have saved Eddie from permanent damage or death, but instead of being grateful, Eddie complains publicly that Tommy Dillon stopped it too soon and should be banned as a referee. In a third and final bout, Eddie beats Gorski mercilessly. Dillon, the ref, doesn't stop it this time. The crowd jeers Eddie when he leaves the ring as Gorski lies unconscious. A depressed Eddie goes on an alcoholic bender with another woman at a motel. He feels \\"dead inside,\\" but when Julie is able to get him back to a boxing arena, Eddie finds that Gorski and the spectators all have forgiven him. ==Cast== * Tony Curtis as Eddie Quaid/Packy Glennon * Patricia Crowley as Julie * Ernest Borgnine as Bernie Browne * Paul Kelly as Jim McBride * Jim Backus as Pat Quaid * Lee Snowden as Lorraine Evans * John Daheim as Al Gorski (as John Day) * John Marley as Tommy Dillon * Joe Louis as Himself * David Janssen as Jack * Carmen McRae as Singer * John Marley as Tommy Dillon * Barney Phillips as Dan Selby * Joseph Vitale as Tony Adamson (as Joe Vitale) * Kay Stewart as Mrs. Gorski ==See also== *List of American films of 1955 ==ReferencesCategory:1956 films Category:1950s sports drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American sports drama films Category:American boxing films Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films directed by Jerry Hopper Category:Universal Pictures films Category:1955 drama films Category:1956 drama films ","title":"The Square Jungle"},{"id":"35908571","text":"Wild and Wonderful is a 1964 comedy film directed by Michael Anderson and starring Tony Curtis and Christine Kaufmann.

She is recorded as having lived during ancient Chinese history. Jiang Yuan was the mother of Houji, who is a culture hero and revered as the god of millet. ==Clan name and title== Women of her era did not have personal names recorded (and may not even have possessed them); instead, Jiang is her clan name. The Jiang clan are possibly related to the Qiang people, a group believed to have been Tibeto-Burman in origin. However, the American scholar Christopher I. Beckwith has recently proposed that they were of Indo-European origins instead. Based on this assumption, Beckwith suggests that Jiang Yuan belonged to a clan of Indo-European origin. Yuan does not seem to be a lineage name: instead, it seems to be a title signifying \\"origin\\" or \\"source\\", in reference to her role as the mother of the royal Ji family of the Zhou dynasty. ==Mythological biography== Jiang Yuan was the mother of Qi (also known as Houji), credited in Chinese mythology with founding the Ji clan who went on to establish the Zhou dynasty. She was said historically to have been a consort of Emperor Ku. In mythology, she gave virgin birth to a miracle child. In some versions such as that found in the Zhou hymn \\"Birth of Our People\\" credit Qi with a miraculous birth after Jiang Yuan stepped into a footprint or toeprint left by the supreme deity Shangdi. The hymn records her as attempting to abandon him three times (his name Qi means \\"the Abandoned One\\"). According to mythology, the baby Houji was guarded in the street by livestock and fed by birds. Houji then (still little grown) introduced the cultivation of millet (ji) and other agricultural improvements and as the Lord of Millet set up the founding of the Zhou dynasty. Thus, the woman who gave birth to a child not sired by a husband mythologically became the ultimate human ancestor of the series of emperors known as the Zhou dynasty, the era when Chinese history as it is known truly commenced (Ferguson 1928, 6). ==History== In Sima Qian's rationalistic account in the Records of the Grand Historian, Jiang Yuan is simply the first consort of Emperor Ku and Qi is one of his children. However, in his account, he credits the success of Zhou as being due primarily to the two women Jiang Yuan and Tai Ren.Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian It is possible he meant this to credit the virtue and success of their children, but it is also possible that they represented important marriage alliances, or matriarchal culture. The Jiang were closely involved with the Ji before and after their rise to empire (Tai Ren of Zhi was the wife of a male descendant of Jiang Yuan and a leader of the Ji family/Zhou dynasty, who also had an important connection to the Shang dynasty). ==Religion== In Chinese popular religion, Jiang Yuan is worshiped as a goddess.Yang, 152 ==References Sources == * * *Ferguson, John C. 1928. \\"China\\" in Volume VIII of Mythology of All Races.

A professional MMA competitor since 2009, Ogle has made a name for himself fighting for numerous promotions all over England. He was a competitor on FX's The Ultimate Fighter: Live. ==Background== Ogle was born in Newcastle upon Tyne to Jan and Gordon Ogle. He was raised in Tynemouth, North Tyneside, and attended Marden High School where he competed in football and also trained mixed martial arts. At the age of 16, Ogle worked as an instructor for his gym, teaching the younger children MMA. Upon leaving Marden, Ogle enrolled at the University of Sunderland. Ogle graduated from Sunderland in 2011 with a degree in sports science. ==Mixed martial arts careerEarly career=== In 2008 Ogle began his semi-professional (amateur) career, posting five straight wins before taking a TKO loss in his final semi- pro fight. After boasting a 5-1 semi-pro record, Ogle turned professional in late 2009. His pro debut came on 18 October 2009 against Graham Armstrong, another fighter making his pro debut. Ogle dominated the fight for three rounds, and was awarded the unanimous decision victory. Only a month later, in his second fight, Ogle lost to Bobby McVittie via submission after getting caught in a triangle choke in the first round. Ogle bounced back from the loss with three straight submission wins, all coming via rear-naked choke, and two of the submission wins coming in the first round. Ogle dominated three more opponents, earning a record of 7-1 before being offered a fight with Shay Walsh, an undefeated fighter at the time considered the top featherweight prospect in the UK. Ogle upset Walsh, winning the fight via unanimous decision. ===The Ultimate Fighter=== In February 2012, it was revealed that Ogle was selected to be a participant on The Ultimate Fighter: Live. Ogle defeated Brendan Weafer via unanimous decision to move into the Ultimate Fighter house, and become an official cast member. Ogle was selected seventh (fourteenth overall) by Urijah Faber to become a part of Team Faber. In the last quarter-final fight of the season, Ogle was selected to fight one of Team Cruz's best fighters in Mike Rio. Ogle earned the upset victory after submitting Rio with a rear-naked choke in the second round. In the semi-final round Ogle was chosen to fight Team Faber teammate, Al Iaquinta. Ogle lost the fight via TKO in the closing moments of the first round, eliminating him from the competition. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Despite not winning the show, UFC President Dana White decided to sign all sixteen cast members to exclusive UFC contracts. Ogle was linked to a bout at The Ultimate Fighter 15 Finale on 1 June 2012. However, due to being medically suspended after his KO loss to Al Iaquinta in quarter-finals of the show, Ogle was not able to compete on the card. Ogle lost in his UFC debut to Akira Corassani via split decision on 29 September 2012 at UFC on Fuel TV 5. There was a lot of displeasure with the decision as many spectators and MMA website columnists believed Ogle had won the fight. Ogle would then fought former featherweight title contender, Josh Grispi, on 16 February 2013 at UFC on Fuel TV: Bar√£o vs. McDonald. After three rounds, Ogle won the fight via unanimous decision. Ogle was expected to face Conor McGregor on 17 August 2013 at UFC Fight Night 26 However, Ogle pulled out of the bout due an injury and was replaced by Max Holloway Ogle faced Cole Miller on 26 October 2013 at UFC Fight Night 30. He lost the fight via unanimous decision. Ogle faced Charles Oliveira on 15 February 2014 at UFC Fight Night 36. He lost the fight via triangle choke submission in the third round. Ogle faced Maximo Blanco on 31 May 2014 at UFC Fight Night 41. He lost the fight by unanimous decision. Ogle next faced UFC newcomer Makwan Amirkhani on 24 January 2015 at UFC on Fox 14. He lost the fight via TKO only 8 seconds into the first round, and was subsequently released from the promotion shortly after the fight. ==Mixed martial arts record== - Loss align=center9‚Äì6 Makwan Amirkhani TKO (flying knee and punches) UFC on Fox: Gustafsson vs. Johnson  align=center1 align=center0:08 Stockholm, Sweden  - Loss align=center9‚Äì5 Maximo Blanco Decision (unanimous) UFC Fight Night: Munoz vs. Mousasi  align=center3 align=center5:00 Berlin, Germany  - Loss align=center9‚Äì4 Charles Oliveira Submission (triangle choke) UFC Fight Night: Machida vs. Mousasi  align=center3 align=center2:40 Jaragu√° do Sul, Brazil  - Loss align=center9‚Äì3 Cole Miller Decision (unanimous) UFC Fight Night: Machida vs. Munoz  align=center3 align=center5:00 Manchester, England  - Win align=center9‚Äì2 Josh Grispi Decision (unanimous) UFC on Fuel TV: Bar√£o vs. McDonald  align=center3 align=center5:00 London, England  - Loss align=center8‚Äì2 Akira Corassani Decision (split) UFC on Fuel TV: Struve vs. Miocic  align=center3 align=center5:00 Nottingham, England  - Win align=center8‚Äì1 Shay Walsh Decision (unanimous) Olympian MMA 12  align=center3 align=center5:00 Liverpool, England  - Win align=center7‚Äì1 Antanas Jazbutis TKO (punches) Supremacy Fight Challenge 3  align=center3 align=center3:08 Gateshead, England  - Win align=center6‚Äì1 Stewart Gillham TKO (punches) Supremacy Fight Challenge 2  align=center2 align=center2:29 Gateshead, England  - Win align=center5‚Äì1 Jay Furness Decision (unanimous) Supremacy Fight Challenge 1  align=center3 align=center5:00 Gateshead, England  - Win align=center4‚Äì1 Phil Flynn Submission (rear-naked choke) Knuckle Up MMA 8  align=center2 align=center1:54 Bolton, England  - Win align=center3‚Äì1 Matt Eynon Submission (rear-naked choke) Strike and Submit 15  align=center1 align=centerN/A Gateshead, England  - Win align=center2‚Äì1 Nigel Wright Submission (rear-naked choke) Strike and Submit 14  align=center1 align=center1:31 Gateshead, England  - Loss align=center1‚Äì1 Bobby McVittie Submission (triangle choke) Absolute Combat 2  align=center1 align=center1:33 Edinburgh, Scotland  - Win align=center1‚Äì0 Graham Armstrong Decision (unanimous) Cage Kombat 11  align=center3 align=center5:00 Edinburgh, Scotland  } ==See also== * List of male mixed martial artists ==ReferencesCategory:Living people Category:1989 births Category:English male mixed martial artists Category:Lightweight mixed martial artists Category:Featherweight mixed martial artists Category:Alumni of the University of Sunderland ","title":"Andy Ogle"},{"id":"35908662","text":"Sebastiano Ranfagni (born 8 August 1985) is a male Italian swimmer. ==Biography== In 2012 Sebastiano Ranfagni qualified for his first Olympic appearance in London 2012.

His personal name was L√º Wuye (ÂëÇÁÑ°Èáé), ancestral name Jiang (Âßú), and Duke Qing was his posthumous title. ==Accession to throne== Duke Qing was the son of Duke Hui of Qi and grandson of Duke Huan, the greatest leader of the State of Qi. He succeeded his father, who died in 599 BC after a ten-year reign. Duke Hui had favoured the official Cui Zhu (Â¥îÊùº). After Duke Hui's death the powerful Gao and Guo clans of Qi expelled Cui, who fled to the State of Wey. Cui would later return to Qi and cause great turmoil in the state. ==Battle of An== In 589 BC Qi attacked the states of Lu and Wey, and annexed the Lu city of Long. Lu and Wey were allies of the State of Jin, a major power of the Spring and Autumn period. In response, Duke Jing of Jin dispatched the Jin army led by generals Xi Ke, Shi Xie, Luan Shu, and Han Jue to help his allies. The Qi and Jin forces fought at An (near present-day Jinan), and Qi was decisively defeated. Duke Qing narrowly escaped capture by exchanging clothes and position with officer Pang Choufu (ÈÄ¢‰∏ëÁà∂), who was taken prisoner by Jin general Han Jue mistaking him as Duke Qing. After the battle Duke Qing was forced to plead for peace and cede territory to the state of Lu. Chapter II. Duke Qing was greatly humbled by the defeat at the Battle of An. After the battle he reduced taxes, gave alms to orphans and the infirm, and was said to forgo alcohol and meat until his death seven years later. ==Death and succession== Duke Qing died in 582 BC after 17 years of reign.

An endangered species, it is found only at Lane Cove Bushland Park in suburban Sydney. Hygrocybe lanecovensis was originally collected by Ray and Elma Kearney in Lane Cove Bushland Park in Sydney's suburban Lower North Shore district on 13 June 1998, and officially described by Australian mycologist Tony Young in 1999. The fruit body of Hygrocybe lanecovensis is a small red mushroom; the cap is a vivid scarlet, convex in shape and is 1-2.3 cm in diameter. Its surface is sticky when young and less so with age. The edges of the cap are very narrowly yellow and crenulated. The thick gills are widely spaced and strongly decurrent. White initially, they can be slightly yellow with age. They can be seen through the edges of the cap. The stipe is 2.5‚Äì5 cm tall and 0.2-0,5 cm wide. The related Hygrocybe kula, found in Royal National Park as well as Lane Cove Bushland Park, is similar in being red with decurrent gills, but its gills are more creamy and not visible through the cap surface. It has a yellow base to the stem. Hygrocybe miniata mushrooms are red but have adnate rather than decurrent gills. Fruit bodies appear in sandy soil among leaf litter in wet sclerophyll forest or warm-temperate rainforest in cooler months, with collections recorded in June and August. It was listed by the NSW Government as endangered in 2002. Searches of similar habitat in surrounding areas have failed to locate the fungus, hence Lane Cove Bushland Park remains its only location. It is possibly threatened by pollutants in runoff from surrounding urban areas. ==See also== *List of Hygrocybe species ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Category:Fungi native to Australia lanecovensis Category:Fungi described in 1999 ","title":"Hygrocybe lanecovensis"},{"id":"35908923","text":"The 1980‚Äì81 NBA season was the Bullets 20th season in the NBA and their 8th season in the city of Washington, D.C..1980-81 Washington Bullets ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #E23B45; color: #FFFFFF\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! style=\\"background-color: #E23B45; color: #FFFFFF\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! style=\\"background-color: #E23B45; color: #FFFFFF\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! style=\\"background-color: #E23B45; color: #FFFFFF\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! style=\\"background-color: #E23B45; color: #FFFFFF\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! style=\\"background-color: #E23B45; color: #FFFFFF\\" width=\\"20%\\" School/Club Team - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  1  14  Wes Matthews  G   Wisconsin - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  35  Rick Mahorn  C/PF   Hampton - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  4  81  Francois Wise    California State-Long Beach - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  5  105  Daryl Strickland    Rutgers - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  6  127  Ken Dancy    Chicago State - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  7  151  Karl Godine    Stephen F.

It reaches 1,002 feet (305 m) at its peak in South Hadley. The Metacomet-Monadnock Trail runs through it as it does for all the Holyoke Range. To the west is Seven Sisters and Mount Holyoke. To its east is Bare Mountain.http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/holyoke.pdf Mount Hitchcock is the second highest peak in South Hadley with Bare Mountain being the highest by 8 feet. On the immediate northern shoulder of Hitchcock lies the highest point in Hadley. For many decades, Mount Hitchcock was thought to be the highest. However, carefully topographical and boundary analysis shows both that the peak of Bare Mountain is within the borders of the town and that it is 8 feet higher. Mount Hitchcock is named after Edward Hitchcock, a former professor of geology at Amherst College. He studied the entire range from a geological and cultural point of view. Once there was a viewing tower on the top of the mountain. It has been taken down. Mount Hitchcock is probably the hardest peak in the Holyoke Range to get to since it is farthest from a road. ==References *Details on Peakery website Hitchcock Category:Hadley, Massachusetts Hitchcock ","title":"Mount Hitchcock"},{"id":"35909046","text":"Debbrich Feys (born 20 December 1984, in Ghent) is a retired professional Belgian tennis player.

The character was mostly known for his change from friendly to villainous when he developed Hero Syndrome. ==Creation and casting== Following the resignation of Robbie Magasiva as the character of Maxwell Avia, writers felt an absence in the Emergency Department set of the soap opera and it was decided that a new doctor would be created. The character of Josh was created, an adrenalin junkie drawn to ED due to its fast paced performance. Storylines decided to characterize Josh as a mysterious character, working with the idea that his parents were naturopaths. It was decided that Josh would debut in the shows 20th anniversary and as such, a dramatic stunt was planned so as to demonstrate the characters' key elements such as efficiency under pressure. Five actors had callbacks for the part of Josh, with Chris Tempest eventually securing the role. British Tempest was familiar with the show through daytime television as a teenager but was unaware as to its impact in New Zealand, \\"It doesn't even feel real to be honest. Especially coming over here and seeing how much Shortland Street is part of the Kiwi culture and how high a regard people hold it. It hasn't settled in yet.\\" Tempest believed that this turn was \\"awfully ironic\\". Tempest filmed his final scenes as Josh in November 2013, in a storyline that saw Josh die in the annual Christmas cliffhanger. Although most characters' final scenes were filmed out of chronological order, Tempest was allowed to film his character's death as his final scene; something which he thought was a satisfying conclusion. ==Storylines== Josh arrived to Ferndale for a job interview with Maxwell Avia (Robbie Magasiva), but was instead thrust into a dramatic helicopter crash, rescuing the crushed Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid). Subsequently, Josh landed a job in the hospital's Emergency Department only to clash majorly with TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell). Josh appeared withdrawn and it was soon discovered his fianc√©e had died from a drug overdose in England. Eventually, he began to date Paige Munroe (Rachel Foreman) but the two broke up and Josh began to date Lana Jacobs (Brooke Williams). However, following his support of Roimata Samuels (Shavaughn Ruakere) after her devastating sexual assault, Lana realized he had fallen in love with her and he subsequently came under suspicion for the attack. Much to TK and the staff's shock, Josh and Roimata began a short-lived affair that isolated the two from their friends. Josh began to associate with Harper's (Ria Vandervis) dodgy mate Neil Hesketh (Erroll Shand), who forced him to smuggle drugs out of the hospital. Josh eventually ratted out the gang and saved Bella from the murderous Neil, resulting in the two ending up in a relationship. The praise saw Josh start to purposefully make patients sick so that he could heal them to applause, climaxing when he poisoned Bella's mother Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn) and electrocuted Nicole's (Sally Martin) girlfriend, Bonnie Deane (Steph Cusick). Roimata, Harper, and TK soon realized what Josh was doing and had him arrested. He was released however and devastatingly exploded a bomb at the staff Christmas function so as to save the victims. Whilst trying to save the life of Roimata, Josh was crushed underneath a large piece of rubble and died after telling a horrified Bella that he loved her. ==Character developmentRelationships=== Tempest described Josh as an accidental ladies man, \\"The thing about Josh is he's never trying to be a ladies man. But as it turns out, chicks really dig that.\\" Upon his arrival to the show, Josh was placed in scenes with the returned character of Paige Munroe (Rachel Foreman) and a partnership was established between the two. Tempest believed that the characters got on well due to both having checkered pasts, Josh having lost his fianc√©e to a drug overdose and Paige having recovered from a drug addiction that saw the death of Jill Kingsbury (Natalie Medlock). Foreman explained, \\"The two definitely cross paths, and theres a connection, but Paige can't put her finger on it. There are a lot of mixed feelings. It's quickly very clear that Josh doesn't want to reveal himself to anyone, so that makes getting into a relationship difficult. But it's all part of his charm.\\" Tempest believed the characters backgrounds incidentally lead them to each other, \\"There is what seems like flirting, but it's really just a lot of awkwardness. Both of them are wary about getting into a relationship. Paige has her issues and Josh has his.\\" Foreman agreed with Tempest's view, \\"I think Josh and Paige are quite similar but just cursed by their respective pasts. They both have baggage and aren't very good at acknowledging it!\\" Josh and Paige briefly dated but in August, Josh started to develop feelings for Lana Jacobs (Brooke Williams), much to the angst of her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Potts (Ido Drent). Lana warned Josh that she was too preoccupied for a serious romance but he promised there would be little strings attached. However shortly into the relationship in what Tempest described a shortened \\"honeymoon period\\", Lana began to shut Josh off in favour of mingling with her recently arrived friends Emma Franklin (Amy Usherwood) and Kylie Brown (Kerry-Lee Dewing). Tempest compared this to how Josh treated Paige, \\"Its almost like karma. Josh was stand offish with Paige and now he's getting a taste of his own medicine. The roles are reversed and he doesn't like being on the receiving end.\\" Josh soon realized the three girls were starting a smear campaign against Boyd Rolleston (Sam Bunkall) and began to question if Lana was who he wanted to date. Williams didn't think Lana and Josh were well suited together, describing Josh as being \\"mean\\" to Lana and not \\"loose\\" or \\"kind\\" enough. Josh initially clashed with his boss TK Samuels' (Benjamin Mitchell) wife Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakrere), but following her becoming victim of a sexual assault, Josh offered her comfort and support when TK couldn't. Suspicious of his behavior, TK began to suspect Josh of assaulting Roimata. Ruakere explained Roimata's bond with Josh, \\"Ever since the attack, Roimata has trusted Josh and turned to him for guidance. She can't understand why anyone would think he would be the culprit.\\" Roimata was insulted by TK suspecting Josh of the attack, \\"Roimata feels TK is undermining her by blaming her pillar of support. Just when she needs TK the most, he can't control his anger\\". However, when Josh broke up with Lana and announced he had fallen for Roimata, she too suspected he may be the attacker. Roimata soon started to develop feelings for Josh, much to TK's ignorance; Mitchell stated, \\"Roimata is always reassuring TK that she loves him. But he's starting to wonder how much she means it.\\" In May, Roimata gave into her feelings and began a love affair with Josh. Josh proved too over protective however and the affair was short lived. The affair isolated Josh from his peers and the friendly, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid) sought to cheer him up, Reid stated, \\"Bella doesn't know the full story about Josh and Roimata, and assumes Josh is heartbroken. She knows what it's like to be broken hearted and finds joy in helping other people get through difficult times.\\" The two began to date but broke up, causing Josh to travel to Uganda. Upon his return the romance was reignited due to an apparent machete injury he sustained. Bella was horrified when she realized the extent of Josh's hero syndrome, but nonetheless held his hand as he was crushed to death following an explosion he caused, in what has been described as a, \\"final act of mercy\\". ===Hero syndrome=== In mid-2013, a storyline saw Josh's character drastically alter from a friendly yet womanizing doctor, into an antagonistic villain seeking praise, having developed the disorder hero syndrome. Tempest believed that Josh was still a good guy but was in over his head, \\"I always had in my mind that Josh had a good heart, and that line gets blurred quite a bit ... He's kind of pushing it a bit more these days and its all because he feels undervalued.\\" The storyline was introduced in June after Josh was alienated by his colleagues and friends, having broken up TK and Roimata's marriage. He was drawn into a life of crime by Harper's (Ria Vandervis) dodgy mate Neil Hesketh (Erroll Shand). Neill soon turned out to be very dangerous and a threat to Josh and his friend Bella. Josh turned on Neill and set him up after organizing a drug raid of the hospital. At this point, the storyline was described as the \\"biggest\\" and most prominent on the show. Josh ended up saving Bella, Ula Levi's (Frankie Adams) son Adam (Dylan Keereweer-Taia), and left Neill to die; resulting in praise from his colleagues. Josh began to crave the limelight once more and accepted a charity position simply to face the media, which Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakere) quickly picked up on, Ruakere believed that Roimata had, \\"seen this side to Josh before. It came out when Roimata and Josh had a relationship. Josh loves to be the good guy but needs to have his moment of glory in return.\\" After a brief holiday in Uganda, Josh returned with what appeared to be a machete wound (but in reality was fake bandage) in an attempt to impress Bella Durville. Josh soon began to partake in much more reckless tasks to achieve praise, such as electrocuting Nicole's (Sally Martin) girlfriend, Bonnie Deane (Steph Cusick), poisoning Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn), and causing Murray (Matthew Chamberlain) to go into cardiac arrest. As the year ended, Roimata, Harper, and TK picked up on Josh's behavior but could not stop him setting off a bomb underneath the Warner family bach, in an attempt to win back Bella, leading to a cliffhanger as to who had survived the explosion. Josh survived the explosion but whilst utilizing his \\"hero-complex\\" was crushed and killed attempting to save Roimata's life. Roimata also ended up dying from the blast. ==Reception== When reviewing the shows 20th anniversary feature-length episode, Lydia Jenkin pointed out how it had become traditional to introduce a new character during the annual 90 minute episodes and pondered which female character would fall victim to Josh's good looks and charm. One of the shows writers, Rebecca Barry Hill, listed the Shortland Street 20th anniversary as one of the highlights of New Zealand television in 2012 and specifically noted Josh's introduction. Paul Casserly of The New Zealand Herald believed that by casting unlikeable characters on TV shows, producers were in effect pulling in viewers who consumed the product simply to hate the character. He noted Josh as an example of this on Shortland Street and referenced a friend who believed Josh was the, \\"worst character, worst actor\\". Tempest noticed a significant difference in attitude towards Josh as his hero syndrome developed, \\"When my character was a bit of a good guy, there were a lot more people stopping me on the street going, 'Hey, how's it going?' Every time I walk down the streets these days... people kind of look over their shoulder and go, 'Ohh'.\\" Josh and Roimata's affair was named as one of the top moments of the 2013 season, alongside Josh's heroic adventure in the 90 minute episode and his bomb in the season finale. Broadcaster Jason Reeves described Josh's story lines throughout 2013 as \\"spectacular\\", with Tempest specifically noting the antagonistic character development. Television blogger, Chris Philpot, believed that though Josh was written with \\"generic dialogue\\", Tempest had done some \\"decent work\\" portraying him in the 2013 finale. In the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 awards, Josh was voted by fans as the character, \\"you most want to leave\\", \\"Most Deluded Character\\" and the character with, \\"The most ridiculous story lines\\". The storyline that saw Josh rat out the hospital heist was named the best storyline of the year. The episode featuring Josh's death was viewed by 622,630 viewers, making it the most viewed television show in New Zealand that night. ==References== Category:Shortland Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional physicians Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Josh Gallagher"},{"id":"35909191","text":"H√ºseyin Cengiz (born 25 July 1984 in Lochem, Netherlands) is a Turkish-Dutch footballer, who most recently played for Racing Club Lebanon. ==Club career== Cengiz played for De Graafschap and Turkish side Yozgatspor, before joining Eerste Divisie club AGOVV in 2006.

It premiered in Germany on March 8, 2012. The working title was The Year of the Snake. ==Plot== The film opens with a man leaving his Moscow apartment building. On his way out he notices strange activity in the basement, but ignores it. As he leaves, the entire apartment building is destroyed in an explosion. 13 years later, the German tabloid journalist Paul Jensen (Moritz Bleibtreu) arrives in Moscow to work on a magazine owned by his late father's friend Onjegin (Rade Serbedzija). One day while buying a sandwich Paul witnesses the customer in front of him being assassinated in the street. Paul's photographer partner Dima (Max Riemelt) tells Paul that the victim was a famous journalist whose TV show got canceled due to him being critical of the government. Paul meets up with the journalist Katja (Kasia Smutniak) in the lunchroom. Katja wants to publish an article about the assassinated journalist, but Jensen's editor does not dare to. Paul suggests that Katja rewrite the article and that he then publishes it in the celebrity section on account of the journalist's fame. Paul and Katja meet at a bar in the evening and Katja reveals that the journalist knew his father. Paul and Katja end up drunk and dance. The following day the two meet at a protest rally and Paul encounters Katja's brother Anatoly (Grigoriy Dobrygin). Police arrive and declare the protest illegal and Paul and Katja leave. They retreat to Paul's apartment and end up making love. The next day Katja finds out that Paul published the article without telling his editor. The editor tells Paul to never do anything like it again as they are now at risk of being shut down. Dima finds out about Paul's relationship with Katja and warns him not to have serious relationships with Russian women much to Paul's confusion. Paul later meets with Katja at a party and she seems distracted and nervous. As they walk past a subway station a man approaches Paul for a lighter and Katja runs into the subway. Seconds later the subway is destroyed by an explosion that throws Paul through the air and knocks him unconscious. Paul wakes up at a hospital and is met by police. He is told that a backpack he helped carry for Katja contained explosives and that Katja died in the explosion in the subway. Paul is charged for terrorism and is presented with evidence that he is unable to prove false. Onjegin is allowed to meet Paul and tells him he will be sent to jail while waiting for his trial, which is seven months away. Paul is sent to the prison known as \\"Little Chechnya\\" due to the large number of Chechen people held captive there. Paul is attacked and beaten up by an inmate but is saved by and taken under the wings of Aslan (Mark Ivanir) who serves as the leader of the Chechens. In a conversation Aslan tells Paul that he knew his father, Norbert Jensen (Bj√∂rn von der Wellen). During the following days Aslan tells Paul about how Norbert interviewed him, how his and several of the terrorists in the prison lost their families in the invasion and how he became a terrorist. Aslan also teaches Paul about the relationship between oil, terrorism and money. One night Aslan is taken out and beaten by the guards. Aslan suspects a prison snitch is informing the prison commander (Merab Ninidze). Aslan finds the snitch and Paul is forced to watch as the inmates kill him. Aslan is then taken away and murdered. Paul decides to sign a contract that will have him expelled to Germany in exchange for him declaring having been treated fairly by the authorities. Paul is driven away but when he realizes he is not being taken to the airport he jumps out from the car and outruns his guards. Paul then meets with Dima and is hunted down by the authorities. He later finds out that Katja is alive and was tricked by authorities to trap him in a plot to get him arrested. He confronts Onjegin with evidence he retrieves from his flat belonging to his late father about authorities' plot to hide secrets behind the start of Chechnya's war. Onjegin arranges for him to leave the country using his money and contacts ‚Äì he bids farewell to Katja and upon landing in Germany he watches the live feed on the TV about Onjegin's assassination. ==Cast== * Moritz Bleibtreu as Paul Jensen * Kasia Smutniak as Katja * Rade Serbedzija as Onjegin * Max Riemelt as Dima * Mark Ivanir as Aslan * Stipe Erceg as Vladimir * Reiner Sch√∂ne as Sokolow * Ivan Vrgoc as Sergej * Isabella Vinet as Jekaterina * Michael Ihnow as FSB officer * Merab Ninidze as Sagalayev * Cosima Shaw as Andrea Berger * Bj√∂rn von der Wellen as Norbert Jensen * Marco Ammer as Chief Waiter Pjotr * Grigoriy Dobrygin as Anatoly * David Akinloye as White House Press Secretary * Jean Denis R√∂mer as FSB Agent * Alexandra Starnitzky as 1st Flight Assistant * Dennis Gansel as Taxi Driver ==Production== Dennis Gansel got the basic idea for the film after the broadcast of Das Phantom, and Gansel mentioned that they have a similar theme.

The editor was Jochen Retter who edited several of director Dennis Gansel's previous short films as well as his debut film Das Phantom and Before the Fall. The film is the fifth collaboration between Gansel and actor Max Riemelt who has starred in every one of Gansel's feature films since M√§dchen, M√§dchen. Gansel stated that the film Three Days of the Condor was an influence for him while making the film. ==Critical response== Variety called the film \\"a sleek, solid but not exceptional Euro thriller\\" and praised the film's cinematography and score. Scene Stealers gave a favourable review and praised the actors and the director for making the film feel frighteningly realistic.

Sisera's mother is an unnamed biblical figure mentioned in the Book of Judges. Her son, Sisera, was defeated in battle by Deborah and Barak, and then killed by Yael, who drove a tent peg through his skull. ==Description== Sisera's mother is mentioned only in , in the Song of Deborah. Thus, all that is said about her is possibly from Deborah's imagination. Deborah pictures Sisera's mother looking out of a window, waiting for her son, and wondering why he has not yet returned. Her attendants suggest, and she agrees, that Sisera is dividing and enjoying the plunder, including \\"a womb or two for every man\\" (Judges 5:30, ESV). Arthur Waskow notes that \\"the tone of contempt she uses might lead to a much rougher translation in colloquial English\\", while Nehama Aschkenasy says that it is \\"blatantly graphic and sexual\\". Judy Sterman suggests that Sisera's mother \\"allows herself to be mollified by untrue and crass words\\". James B. Jordan notes the crude and vicious nature of the words of Sisera's mother, and suggests that \\"the reason why Sisera was such a vicious enemy of God's people, and such a cruel man, was that he had such a mother\\". Jordan goes on to say that Deborah \\"delights in the misery of the enemy mother, whose savage expectations will not be realised\\". Sisera's mother has been described as \\"foolish [and] ineffectual\\", as well as \\"evil and sexually depraved\\". Aschkenasy notes, however, that \\"we have no way of knowing whether the historical woman, Sisera's mother, was really that cruel. Deborah may have based her portrait on rumors, or on her general knowledge of Canaanite women\\".Aschkenasy, Woman at the Window, p. 25. Sisera's mother has been depicted in art and in poetry. Most of these portrayals concentrate on her anxiety while awaiting Sisera's return.For example, John Cornelius O'Callaghan, \\"The Defeat of Sisera\\", in ==Connection to the shofar== According to Jewish tradition, because Sisera's mother cried 100 cries when her son did not return home, Jews blow 100 blasts on the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Further in this vein, the Talmud defines the teruah sound of the shofar as being like the yevava (sobbing) of Sisera's mother.Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Rosh Hashanah 33b. Eliyahu Kitov notes that there are 101 letters in the account of Sisera's mother in the Book of Judges. By blowing only 100 times, Ashkenazi Jews counteract all but one cry, leaving that to the natural emotion of a mother weeping over her son. However, the Sephardic tradition is to blow an additional blast before the end of the Rosh Hashana morning service.

According to tradition, Gregory the Illuminator founded the monastery to house relics of several apostles. The monastery was, however, most likely built in the 11th century. During the 12th-13th centuries it was a major center of learning. In the following centuries it was expanded, destroyed and renovated. It remained one of the prominent monasteries of Turkish (Western) Armenia until the Armenian Genocide of 1915, when it was attacked and subsequently abandoned. It remained standing until the 1960s when it was reportedly blown up. Today, ruins of the monastery are still visible. ==Names== The monastery was most commonly known as Arakelots, however, it was also referred to as Ghazaru vank (’Ç’°’¶’°÷Ä’∏÷Ç ’æ’°’∂÷Ñ; \\"Monastery of Lazarus\\"), after its first abbot Yeghiazar (Eleazar). It was also sometimes known as Gladzori vank (‘≥’¨’°’±’∏÷Ä’´ ’æ’°’∂÷Ñ), originating from the nearby gorge called Gayli dzor (‘≥’°’µ’¨’´ ’±’∏÷Ä, \\"Wolf's gorge\\"). Official Turkish sources refer to it as Arak Manastƒ±rƒ±, a Turkified version of its Armenian name. Turkish sources and travel guides generally omit the fact that it was an Armenian monastery. ==History== A close up view of the monastery According to \\"a late medieval tradition\\", the monastery was founded in the early 4th century (in 312 AD according to one author) by Gregory the Illuminator to house various relics of apostless he transferred from Rome. \\"Those relics (which included the left arms of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and right arm of the apostle Andrew) account for the monastery's name.\\" According to Christina Maranci, evidence shows that the monastery was constructed in the latter half of the 11th century during the rule of the Tornikians‚Äîa branch of Mamikonians‚Äîwho ruled Taron between 1054 and 1207. She writes that it is this era \\"which most scholars date the earliest portion of the structure.\\" According to an inscription on a khachkar, it was renovated in 1125. In the east side of the monastery there were nine 11th century khachkars with inscriptions. In the following centuries it became a prominent educational center. The monastery school was active in 11th-12th centuries under chronicler and teacher Poghos Taronetsi, although it is known that translations were being made at the school since the 5th century. It flourished in 1271‚Äì81 under Nerses Mshetsi, who later moved to Syunik and established the University of Gladzor in 1280. Between the 13th and 16th centuries, various Turco-Mongol dynasties ruled Taron. In the 14th century it was destroyed by Tamerlane's invasions. The Ottoman Empire annexed the region in the mid-16th century. A wall was built around the monastery in 1791. In November 1901 a skirmish between Armenian fedayi (irregulars) and the Ottoman forces took place in and around the monastery. According to Jean-Michel Thierry, \\"the main church and chapels were still in a reasonably good state in 1960. Soon thereafter, however, they were reportedly dynamited by an official from Mush.\\" ==Structure== The ensemble consists of a main church with two chapels, a narthex (zhamatun), and a bell tower. ;Within monastery walls The St. Arakelots Church‚Äîthe monastery's main church‚Äîwas built in the 11th century. \\"It consists of an inscribed quatrefoil masked on the exterior by a massive rectangle. Barrel vaults top each of the four arms of the interior, as well as the corner chapels, which are two-storied at both east and west. A dome on squinches, now collapsed, once rested on an octagonal drum above the structure's central bay. Interior decoration included wall painting, and in the apse one can still discern human figures, most likely representing apostles.\\" It had only one door, on the western side. The church was constructed of brick and mortar. The church was renovated in 1614. Its floor plan was cross-shaped, it had a rectangular shape in the outside. The dome, restored in 1663, was an octagon in the outside. A rectangular gavit (narthex) was built in 1555 by abbot Karapet Baghishetsi. To the west there was a three- storey bell tower with eight columned rotunda built by Ter Ohannes vardapet in 1791. (It has been suggested that a bell tower probably existed earlier than that and was destroyed.) Its lowest floor survives. On the foundations of a 14th-century church, the St. Stepanos (Stephen) chapel was built south of the main church in 1663. \\"Composed of a single aisle terminating in an apse\\", it is now half-buried in rubble. On the northern side, only ruins of the St. Gevorg (George) chapel could have been found. ;St. Thaddeus Church The St. Tadevos (Thaddeus), though not within the monastery walls, was located some 300 meters northeast. Dated to the 13-14th centuries by Jean-Michel Thierry, it was well preserved. On the exterior, it was well-polished tufa; on the inside bricks. ==Cultural heritageThe wooden door=== The wooden door of the Arakelots Church is considered a masterpiece and one the finest pieces of medieval Armenian art. It was created in 1134 by Grigor and Ghukas. It depicts non-religious, historic scenes. The front side probably shows a prince as he has a scepter on his right hand. During World War I, German archaeologists reportedly transferred it to Bitlis in hope to later move it to Berlin. However, in 1916 when Russian troops took control of the region, historian and archaeologist Smbat Ter-Avetisian found the door in Bitlis, in a booty abandoned by the retreating Turks, and with a group of migrants, brought the door to the Museum of the Armenian Ethnographic Association in Tbilisi. In the winter of 1921‚Äì22 Ashkharbek Kalantar moved it to Yerevan's newly founded History Museum of Armenia. ===Manuscripts=== The Mush Homiliarium Many manuscripts were preserved in the monastery. Notably, a manuscript named Homiliarium (Ms. 7729, commonly known as the \\"Mush Homiliarium\\", ¬´’Ñ’∑’∏ ’≥’°’º’®’∂’ø’´÷Ä¬ª M≈°o ƒåÃ£a·πô…ôntir), the largest known Armenian manuscript. It was not created in the Arakelots Monastery, but rather in the Avag Monastery near Yerznka (Erzincan) between 1200 and 1202; written by the scribe Vardan Karnetsi, and illuminated by Stepanos. Written on vellum, it now has 601 pages and weighs 28 kilograms. It originally had 660 pages, 17 of which are now in Venice and one in Vienna. Two pages were transferred to Yerevan from the Moscow Lenin Library in 1977 which were separated in 1918. In 1202 it was robbed by a non-Armenian judge who sold it to the Arakelots Monastery in 1204 for four thousand silver coins collected by locals. It was kept there from its acquisition in 1205 until 1915. During the genocide it was taken to Tbilisi in two separate parts and later transferred to Yerevan. It is now preserved at the Matenadaran. == Burials == Historian Movses Khorenatsi and philosopher David the Invincible are believed to have been buried in the monastery courtyard. == See also == * Saint Karapet Monastery, another prominent monastery in Taron == References Bibliography== * * * Category:Destroyed churches in Turkey Category:Armenian churches in Turkey Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in Mu≈ü Province Category:11th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Churches destroyed by Muslims Category:Armenian Apostolic monasteries in Turkey Category:Armenian buildings in Turkey ","title":"Arakelots Monastery"},{"id":"35909268","text":"Stephanie Bengson (born 31 January 1987) is an Australian former professional tennis player.Stephanie Bengson on Wordpress Her career has developed more in doubles than singles.

This is a list of characters from the Japanese light novel series, Fate/Zero by Gen Urobuchi, illustrated by Takashi Takeuchi and a collaboration between Type-Moon and fellow developer Nitroplus. It is the direct prequel to the Japanese visual novel, Fate/stay night and was adapted into an anime series by Ufotable. ==Main charactersKiritsugu Emiya=== : Miyu Irino (Young Kiritsugu) (Japanese) : is the master of Saber and the main protagonist. Born in Fuyuki City, Kiritsugu was raised on Alimango Island, where he lived with his father, Norikata Emiya, the fourth family head of the Emiya family and a magus specializing in time magic. He became friends with Norikata's assistant, a local girl called Shirley who was four years older than him, developing a crush on her. However, disaster struck when Shirley became a vampire after drinking one of Noritaka's potions. She pled for Kiritsugu to kill her, but he fled instead. Shirley subsequently lost control and turned all the residents of Alimango Island into vampires. ===Saber=== : : is the same character from Fate/stay night, the Servant who was summoned by and fell in love with Shir≈ç Emiya. Known as the King of Knights, , who obtained the magical \\"Sword in the Stone\\", she maintains a high code of honour. Stunned to discover that the legendary King Arthur is a young woman, Kiritsugu refused to speak to her directly since her summoning, which Saber initially believes is because he believes the fact that she is a woman makes her inadequate. However, Irisviel later suggests Kiritsugu's anger towards Saber is out of the belief that he could not accept the decisions Saber made or allowed to be made in life yet he could not justify his reasons for why he believed she was wrong. ===Irisviel von Einzbern=== : : is the main heroine of the story and Kiritsugu's wife. She is a homunculus prototype created by the Einzbern family with the idea of giving birth to an ultimate homunculus. Like many of the Einzberns, she is skilled in alchemy. Irisviel serves as Saber's proxy Master, since Kiritsugu believes that he and Saber are incompatible. Due to possessing the inborn knowledge and reasoning of homunculi, hindsights gleaned from the 1000 years of history of the Einzbern as well only having nine years of life-experience, she has both the elegance of a lady and the innocence of a child. Her true purpose in the War is as the vessel of the Holy Grail itself. When four or more Servants are killed, she will manifest as the Grail, losing fully her humanity and sense of self in the process. :Created by Jubstacheit von Einzbern, the eighth head of the Einzbern family, she originally saw herself only as a tool to summon the Holy Grail. Upon first contact with Irisviel in the Einzbern residence in Germany, Kiritsugu noted that she had no instinct for self-preservation and expressed doubts about Irisviel's suitability as the Grail to Jubstacheit. In response, Jubstacheit threw Irisviel into a junkyard for rejected homunculi, a dangerous place filled with monsters and spirits, reasoning that if Irisviel could not even survive a night there alone, he would accept Kiritsugu's criticism and furnish him a new homunculi. In response, Kiritsugu rescued Irisviel and decided to give her a sense of self-preservation by personally educating her and teaching her what it meant to be a human. Eventually, they fell in love with each other. Wanting to show Kiritsugu that there could be a future for them after her fated death, she bears Kiritsugu a daughter, Illyasviel von Einzbern. They live together for nine years in total before departing to Japan for the War. :While approving of Kiritsugu's ideal and willing to sacrifice herself for its sake, she does not truly understand that ideal, but only wishes to walk the same path as her beloved. However, in order not to burden Kiritsugu, she decides to behave as a woman who would die for that same ideal rather than a woman that would die for her husband. Her Magecraft involves the creation and forging of matter, as well as its applications. In terms of magical ability, she is stronger than Kiritsugu. Her weapons are thin, long and flexible wires, which she uses to produce an instantaneous homunculus with alchemy that attacks the enemy while changing itself into numerous shapes. She may also use her weapon to immobilize her target. ===Kirei Kotomine=== : : is the Master of Assassin. Before the Fourth Holy Grail War, Kirei served as a priest under his father, Risei Kotomine. Although Kirei understood the distinction between good and evil, he could only revel in committing sins. Hounded by guilt and sorrow and with no alternative, Kirei prayed that, through marriage to a woman he loved, he could finally achieve respite from his tortured existence. When Kirei discovered marriage could not change him, he was on the brink of suicide; his terminally ill wife, filled with concern, committed suicide to show to Kirei that he could still feel compassion for others and died happy seeing her husband crying for her. However, after her death, Kirei was disgusted to realize he was crying because he had wanted to kill her himself; from that day on, he ceased pursuing salvation altogether. :Sometime later, he would become the apprentice of Tokiomi T≈çsaka due to the wishes of his father, who wished to see Tokiomi obtain the Holy Grail. He participates in the War as a Master under Tokiomi's orders, serving as reconnaissance and support. While researching into the background of the enemy Masters, he sees his own emptiness mirrored in Kiritsugu, and though he initially likes him because of it, begins to feel a compulsive hatred for him after discovering that, unlike Kirei, Kiritsugu had a chance at normal happiness only to throw it away for his ideals. Conversely, Kirei is the only Master that Kiritsugu fears, the latter seeing him as the biggest threat to his own victory. During the later stages of the War, after goading from Archer, he accepts his own twisted inner nature and murders Tokiomi, becoming the Master of Archer and assuming the role of the main antagonist. Not having a true wish for the Grail, he continues to fight to discover his purpose in life. He is killed by Kiritsugu in one-on-one combat but makes a wish on the Grail with his dying breath. This causes the Grail to set fire to part of Fuyuki, as well as giving Kotomine a fake heart made from its curses, reviving him. He then revels in the suffering of the people below, but his mood is soured when he sees Kiritsugu saving a young Shir≈ç, realizing that, since Kiritsugu held onto his ideals even after their fight, he had been defeated on all fronts. ==Supporting charactersHumans=== ; : :Tokiomi is the father of Rin Tohsaka and Sakura Matou, Master of Archer, and an arrogant and manipulative mage. He arranges for Kirei Kotomine to be his understudy in magic and his support in the Holy Grail War. He thinks highly of Kotomine and has him serve in all manners of affairs, appointing him as Rin's guardian should trouble befall him. He is skilled in fire manipulation, and employs a large ruby set in the end of a staff as his Mystic Code to help him shape and control flame. While a skilled mage and confident in his abilities, he is actually one of the weakest Tohsaka in history and considers himself as inferior in potential to Rin and Sakura, who were both recognized by Tokiomi as possessing extraordinary abilities from birth. Though he and Kiritsugu never have any actual one-on-one engagements, the two are perfect foils for one another, as Kiritsugu is a tech-savvy spellcaster who puts his job as a father ahead of his job as a mage, while Tokiomi is a traditional mage who puts his identity as a mage before all else. He eventually meets his end when Kirei, who had been corrupted by Gilgamesh, stabs him in the back. ; : :Aoi is the mother of Rin T≈çsaka and Sakura Mat≈ç as well as the childhood friend of Kariya Mat≈ç. Though she is devastated by Tokiomi's decision to adopt away Sakura, she quietly accepts the decision due to the fact that she puts her position as the wife of a magus ahead of her position as a mother. She is tricked by Kotomine into believing Kariya had murdered Tokiomi out of jealousy, and declares that Kariya had \\"never loved anyone in his entire life\\" after the two get into a heated argument. This causes Kariya to finally snap and give in to his madness-fueled anger and lust. He strangles Aoi into unconsciousness in a fit of rage and gives her severe brain damage, leaving her both crippled and believing that her family is still whole. She dies sometime before the events of the original story. ; : :Risei is Kirei Kotomine's 80-year-old father, a priest in the Church and the regulator of the 4th Holy Grail War. He is a friend of Tokiomi Tohsaka and actively supports him in a manner that borderlines on corruption. While he is proud of his son, who has demonstrated himself to be a perfect heir, Risei fails to understand Kirei in any sense. He is killed by Kayneth, but not before he is able to write a message in blood to Kirei about the location of the remaining command seals, which he uses in his final fight with Kiritsugu. ; : :The Master of Rider and future Lord El-Melloi II, Waver steals his teacher's artifact early on and uses it to summon Rider. He plans to use the Grail to force the Magus Association to recognize his genius. Despite his difficulties with Rider's overbearing nature, Waver and his Servant form a strong relationship. Though lacking in practical experience in the field of fighting in a war, Waver, mostly due to his Servant, survives the Holy Grail War with little detriment to himself and develops a greater sense of perspective of the world, though he now harbors some bitterness towards Japan. ; : :Maiya is an assistant to Kiritsugu Emiya. She is cold and professional, which makes it easier for Kiritsugu to act as he needs to. Maiya was originally a child soldier from a war-torn land who was rescued by Kiritsugu who taught her his way of life. Her real name is unknown; her current name was given to her by Kiritsugu when he first created false identity documents for her. Despite initial discomfort between them, she and Irisviel develop a mutual respect for one another out of their steadfast dedication to protect Kiritsugu. She is fatally wounded by Berserker (disguised as Rider) when she defends Irisviel and dies after She was joined by Kiritsugu. ; : :A freelance mercenary who sold information concerning Noritaka Emiya and his research on vampires. She rescues a young Kiritsugu after the latter kills his father and takes him as her apprentice. During her last mission, she is able to successfully kill a magus that could turn humans into ghouls through magic, but is killed when Kiritsugu shoots down the plane she is on to prevent the infected passengers from killing others when the plane landed. Kiritsugu's last words to her reveal that he viewed her as his mother. ; : :Kariya is the uncle of Shinji Mat≈ç and Master of Berserker. He is the only member of the Mat≈ç family who truly loves Sakura Mat≈ç like a daughter, and harbors a very strong grudge against Tokiomi, who allowed his younger child to be adopted by Z≈çken. Kariya had previously left the Mat≈ç family ten years prior to the 4th Holy Grail War out of disgust for his own family, but returns and makes a deal with Z≈çken Mat≈ç that he will win the Grail War in exchange for Sakura's freedom. He is in love with Aoi (his childhood friend), although he stepped down after she chose to marry Tokiomi instead. Due to his lack of formal training, Kariya was implanted with the same magical worms as Sakura. This caused a number of side effects as the worms would literally eat away at their host, causing Kariya's health to progressively fail in return for significantly expanding his magic circuits and magical potential. By the time of his summoning of a Servant, Kariya's hair had turned white and the nerves on the left side of his face were dead. In addition, his natural lifespan had been shortened to such an extent that Z≈çken estimated he would only live on for one additional year. However, despite the Crest Worms and his own accelerated training, Kariya remained severely lacking as a Magus. At Z≈çken's behest, he compensated for this by summoning the most powerful of the seven Servant classes, the Servant of Mad Enhancement, Berserker. However, the high volume of magical energy required to maintain Berserker causes him frequent, severe pain. He dies after exhausting his energy and passes away while dreaming of Aoi, Rin, Sakura, and the life he wished he could have had with them. ; : : Ry≈´nosuke is the Master of Caster and a highly deranged serial killer who summons Caster after murdering a family and using their blood as a component in the summoning ritual. He does not seek the Holy Grail, but follows Caster in order to find macabre ways to kill people and relieve his boredom, using a hypnotic charm to lure children to their deaths. However, Ry≈´nosuke does admit that he does in fact feel that there is something missing from his life and that, on some level, he desires to find it through his atrocities. He eventually becomes the primary antagonist of the first season, as the entire war is put on hold so as to stop his and Caster's rampage. He is killed by Kiritsugu, who shoots him in the stomach and head. Ry≈´nosuke does, however, die content with his life after seeing his first bullet wound and commenting on the beauty of his blood and intestines spilling out, having realized that the \\"thing\\" he had been searching for his whole life was his own death. ; : :The Master of Lancer, Kayneth is a nobleman from the Magus Association, Lord of the House of El-Melloi and a prodigy at magecraft, said to be the most talented participant in the Holy Grail War. His artifact is stolen by his pupil, Waver Velvet, but he manages to obtain another artifact and summon Lancer instead. While he holds the command spells for Lancer, the energy to materialize the Servant is maintained by Sola-Ui. Despite his skill, Kayneth's overly-traditional approach to combat causes him to underestimate his opponents' capacity for violence, as he believes that the Holy Grail War will be fought with honorable duels and tests of skill rather than quick blitzkriegs like those perpetrated by Kiritsugu and Kotomine. He is confident in his abilities and takes pride in his heritage, but finds the extent of Kiritsugu's untraditional and underhanded tactics both offensive and unexpectedly challenging to overcome. He loses his ability to use magecraft after being shot by Kiritsugu's Origin Bullet and is left half-blind and crippled. Sola-Ui then steals his Command Seals to make Lancer hers. After being forced to make Lancer commit suicide, he and Sola-Ui are sniped by Maiya so as to tie up any loose ends and avoid future retribution from the Archibald family. Kayneth is then killed by Saber as an act of mercy. ; : :The daughter of the head of the spiritual evocation division, Sola-Ui is engaged to Kayneth as a result of a strategic marriage arrangement and the decision of her family to entrust their crest to her brother instead. However, she is coldhearted and does not reciprocate Kayneth's love for her; instead, she becomes infatuated with Lancer (likely due to his love spot), who in turn does not reciprocate her feelings and regards her only as his Master's wife. After Kayneth loses his magecraft abilities, Sola-Ui eventually steals his Command Seals by breaking his fingers until he gives them to her, only to lose them when Maiya cuts off her arm. She is used by Kiritsugu as a bargaining chip against Kayneth to force Lancer to commit suicide, and is then shot and killed by Maiya. ; : :Z≈çken is a wicked, ancient, and powerful sorcerer and the patriarch of the Mat≈ç family. He was one of the original three Magi to propose the Holy Grail system, being the designer of the Command Seals, and keeps himself alive by use of worm familiars. Having amassed a large and extensive library of sorcery knowledge, his lessons tend to be extreme and inflict a heavy toll on the body. To conceal his status at the ancestor to the Mat≈ç family, he masquerades as a relative to his descendants; as such, he is Kariya's \\"uncle\\", Fate/Zero, Volume 1, Prologue III: One Year Ago The aberrant entry in the family register said he was the brother of Kariya's father. But even at his great-grandfather, his ancestor at the third generation, there were records of the old man named Z≈çken in the family tree. There was no way to figure out for how many generations this man came to reign over the Mat≈ç family. Fate/Zero, Volume 1, Prologue III: One Year Ago \\"Kariya ‚Äî Do you want to die?\\" \\"Don't tell me you're worried? 'Uncle'.\\" and Shinji Mat≈ç's \\"grandfather,\\" and adoptive grandfather of Sakura Mat≈ç. Because the Mat≈ç blood had thinned and no longer produced heirs naturally capable of sorcery, Shinji was incapable of becoming a true sorcerer. Thus, Z≈çken offered to adopt Sakura T≈çsaka into the Mat≈ç when her father, Tokiomi, decided to train only his older daughter Rin to become his sole successor. :Disappointed with the lack of sorcerous potential in Shinji and Byakuya, Shinji's father, Z≈çken blames Kariya for allowing the Mat≈ç's magical lineage decline since Kariya, despite being the first in many generations to be naturally capable of sorcery, left the family ten years before the start of the War. Kariya later returns and formulates a deal with Z≈çken where should Kariya obtain the Holy Grail, Z≈çken must allow Sakura to return to her family. Z≈çken does not truly believe that Kariya has what it takes to win the War, and only accepts out of a whim and the small possibility of success. ===Servants=== ; - : :Archer is Gilgamesh, the same rogue servant in Fate/stay night, the King of Heroes. He takes great pride in claiming to be the first 'hero' ever to set foot on Earth, causing him to have a severe and sadistic God complex, treating all others as \\"mongrels\\" that are not worthy of laying eyes on him. He dislikes the presence of Saber and Rider in particular since they were kings like he was. Much to Tokiomi's displeasure, Gilgamesh has difficulty acting covertly or regaining his temper when his considerable pride is wounded. He is unique in that he possesses a very large number of Noble Phantasms, but only three are unique to him. He later allies with and corrupts Kotomine, helping him orchestrate the death of Tokiomi and assault on Aoi via Kariya. He kills Rider in one-on-one combat and later goes to claim the Grail for himself. He attacks Saber as part of their \\"wedding ceremony\\" but is interrupted by Kiritsugu, who has Saber destroy the Grail. Archer is drenched in the mud, but his ego allows him to resist corruption. He meets Avenger within the grail and tells him that it is the King's job to shoulder all the evil of the world, not his, but that he, as king, will permit Avenger's existence. Archer then escapes the mud with a flesh and blood body, but his personality becomes more destructive and impulsive due to his exposure to All the World's Evils. :His first unique Noble Phantasm, is a key-shaped sword which opens a rift in space to a mystical vault that holds countless prototypes of Noble Phantasms within. Archer can either draw them out for close combat or fire them out of the rift like bullets. The rift also contains assorted artifacts such as \\"the wine of kings\\" and a flying spacecraft from Sanskrit mythology, the Vimana. His second Noble Phantasm, , is an anti-divine chain that binds enemies and becomes stronger the more divinity the target holds. His last unique Noble Phantasm, , is the attack generated by his drill- shaped sword, . When its true power is activated, it manifests itself as a massive rip in space-time, possessing unsurpassed attack power sufficient to damage and disintegrate the world itself. :Gilgamesh is the half-god, half- human king born from the union between the King of Uruk, Lugalbanda, and goddess Rimat-Ninsun with the purpose of being a medium between the Gods and humans, as he is both of these things and yet not quite either. He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era and was supposedly a transcendent being so divine that no others in the world could match him. He was a despot who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. His tale is loosely based on mankind's oldest poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which traditionally portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu. :His title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is a king over all heroes. His name is derived from traditionally being mankind's oldest hero and the origin to all myths, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. Because of this, his Gate of Babylon possesses every hero‚Äôs Noble Phantasm. ; - : :The First of the Knights of Fianna, Lancer possesses a love spot on his face, which causes females with insufficient magic resistance to fall in love with him should they gaze upon it. As a knight, he adheres to a code of honour in battle and a sense of loyalty to his master, being summoned to fight in the grail war because he wants to display the loyalty to his lord that he was not able to show when he was alive. Despite being enemies, he and Saber share mutual respect for each other, and he considers it his duty to take her head, protecting her and aiding her on multiple occasions, in an attempt to ensure that he will be the one to kill her. Lancer fights at Mion river with the other heroic spirits, where he is forced to break one of his spears, Gae Buidhe, in order to allow the wound he inflicted upon Saber to heal so that she can use her noble phantasm, Excalibur, to destroy Caster. Later that day, during a one-on-one duel with Saber, Lancer is forced to commit suicide by Kayneth, and dies cursing his master, Sola-Ui, Kiritsugu, Saber, and the Grail for destroying his pride and last remaining wish. :Lancer possesses two Noble Phantasms: , a short yellow spear which inflicts wounds that do not heal as long as the spear exists in the world, and , a long red spear which cancels mana upon contact, ignoring all magical defences and temporarily dispelling all magical attributes of the target struck. ; - : :Rider's identity is Iskander, the King of Conquerors, famous in history as Alexander the Great, who desires to defeat Saber in particular because he believes her ideals regarding kingship are delusional and that she would thrive as one of his followers. He derives his status as Rider from a set of divine bulls and chariot purportedly a gift from Zeus, known as , summoned when Iskander slices the air with his . His eccentric and overbearing personality along with his incredible abilities creates difficulties for his Master and their opponents. He is also the only Servant that Gilgamesh truly respects as an equal, the latter inviting him to challenge him in combat as many times as he wished. His wish is for a second life and he plans to wage war against the United States to celebrate his revival, believing they will pose an enjoyable challenge. He is killed by Gilgamesh in single combat and, in his dying moments, finally finds Oceanus, the place he had searched for all his life. :His first Noble Phantasm is , the trampling attack used by the Gordius Wheel, which causes lightning strikes upon movement, inflicting massive damage to whatever is in its path. His second and most powerful Noble Phantasm is , which is a Reality Marble, a self-contained miniature world that contains thousands of the most trusted of his soldiers who fought alongside him in life resurrected as temporary Servants, marching upon an endless plain of sand. ; - , : :Commonly known as Bluebeard, his real name is Gilles de Rais - a mass serial killer who seems to favour killing children in particular. Caster is a fiendish Servant who derives pleasure from first providing his victims a moment of relief before terrorizing them and then killing them. He expresses an obsessive interest in Saber because he has mistaken her for Jeanne d'Arc, his former comrade and the protagonist of Fate/Apocrypha, with whom Bluebeard has an infatuation. As his wish for the Grail was for her to be resurrected, Caster becomes convinced he has won the War and repeatedly tries to talk to Saber; when she subsequently tries correcting him, he believes that she has lost her memories by God's intervention, much to his rage. He has, by far, the best relationship with his master of any servant. He sees Ry≈´nosuke as a prophet who preaches that God is a sadistic yet loving being that enjoys seeing His creations commit horrific acts, as He wouldn't have made the human race so violent and their organs so colorful if He did not enjoy chaos. This restores Caster's faith in God and he decides to put on a show for Him, to show Him that He isn't the only \\"entertainer\\" who can put on a show. The war is eventually postponed due to the duo's rampage, as Caster and Ry≈´nosuke had begun to murder hordes of children in hopes of catching God's attention and forcing Him to \\"return\\" Saber's non-existent memories of being Jeanne. Following Ry≈´nosuke's death, Caster is obliterated by Saber's Excalibur. :His sole Noble Phantasm is , a magical tome made from human skin which acts as a massive mana source and a guidebook for various spells of varying power, with the strongest spell capable of summoning otherworldly, self-regenerating monsters. The strength of his Noble Phantasm helps make up for his otherwise average ability in magecraft. ; - : :Previously known as the Black Knight, Berserker is a Servant who possesses the ability to use practically any object as a Noble Phantasm, allowing him to match Gilgamesh in combat. His madness has reduced him to a mindless, though dangerously skilled, fighter. Despite his insanity, he is still able to instinctively recognize Saber. When Saber finally learns Berserker's true identity, she is devastated that her decisions in life and her adherence to chivalry had caused her friend such suffering even after dying. During the battle it is revealed that his insanity stems from his overwhelming desire to be punished for his adultery with Guinevere and his own subconscious love for Saber, his sanity being eaten away as he was forced to watch the love of his life throw away her humanity for the sake of her people. He is killed by Saber as he is about to deal her a killing blow when his Master runs out of magical energy midway, and regains his sanity in his dying moments. His death almost drives Saber into darkness, as she becomes hellbent on gaining the Grail by any means. :He possesses three Noble Phantasms, the first of which is , which envelopes him in a black fog that makes his outline blurred and his status unreadable to other Masters. By use of a Command Spell, it is possible to use the fog to allow Berserker to mimic another's appearance, although it is noted that had Lancelot been summoned under a different Class, he would be able to freely disguise at will. , allows him to turn anything he recognizes as a weapon, into a D-ranked Noble Phantasm. If he grabs hold of others' Noble Phantasms, he claims them temporarily as his own and their original rank is retained, making it the perfect counter to Archer's attacks. His last Noble Phantasm, is a magical sword which, when drawn, dispels For Someone's Glory and Knight of Honor, boosts all his parameters and grants him additional prowess against beings with a 'dragon' attribute such as Saber. ; - : :Assassin is actually the reincarnation of the head of the Assassin Order. While every Assassin in every Grail War thus recorded has shared the same name of Hassan-i SabbƒÅh, they are different persons as all the leaders of the Assassin Order changed their names to Hassan-i SabbƒÅh upon ascending to the position. :The Hassan-i SabbƒÅh in the Fourth War became head by intentionally fracturing his psyche during life to confuse opponents, a form of self-inflicted dissociative identity disorder. When summoned as a Servant, this ability manifests itself as the Noble Phantasm , which splits his body into up to eighty different entities, sharing his spiritual potential amongst them. They act as reconnaissance agents for Tokiomi and Kirei after Gilgamesh \\"kills\\" one of them. Assassin can only be truly defeated if all of them are killed, which they are after being massacred by Rider's Ionian Hetairoi. ==References== Category:Fate/stay night characters Fate Zero ","title":"List of Fate/Zero characters"},{"id":"35909367","text":"Lettieri is an Italian surname.

In 2010 he moved to Kingston, Jamaica, where he lives with his partner, after the birth of his daughter Zuri. == Discography Albums=== * 2004: VH * 2007: Faccio quello che voglio * 2010: Sporco * 2011: Pelleossa * 2012: Pazienza * 2015: L'ultimo tango * 2019: Don Vacca Corleone ===EP=== * 2003: Mr. Cartoon * 2009: Non prima delle 6:10 * 2010: Lost In Mi-Nord ===Singles=== * 2006: Chi sbaglia paga ===Mixtape=== * 2008: Poco di buono * 2009: Don't Say Nothing 1 * 2009: Don't Say Nothing 2 * 2011: Get maad ===Collaborations=== Fabri Fibra (left), Dj Fish (behind) and Vacca (right) in 2008 * 2003: Vacca ft.

Initially, its main focus was producing watches but has now branched out to bags and a range of fashion accessories. Its products are characterised by minimalist and modular design, allowing for customisation of the product. ==Origin== O Bag was founded in 2009 and its products were first exhibited at the Milan International Exhibition in 2010. O Bag can be found in over 50 countries worldwide. After releasing the O clock, O Bag released a pocket watch, the O chive and a range of bags, the O bag. They opened their first branded store in 2011 in Venice. ===Source of the 'O'=== Every product made by O Bag to date has had an 'O' in front of the product. This comes from the first of O Bag's products which was named the 'O Clock', much like the usual way of expressing the time in English. The company kept the 'O' as a way of identifying its products, much like the 'i' in Apple products. ==Products== O Bag developed the O clock in 2010, a watch with a silicone strap and interchangeable faces. The original face of the watch, now called 'O clock Classic' consisted of a plain white face without numbers. The face can be removed from the strap allowing the colour of the strap or face to be changed. There were originally 15 straps but this has grown to 29 which are still in production. O Bag‚Äôs watch packaging takes inspiration from the tin can, a cylindrical tin with a ring pull. O clock developed into a series with the Tone on Tone range consisting of 21 watch face colours to mix and match with 21 straps making a total of 441 possible combinations with Tone on Tone. Other O clock ranges include Camouflage, 80‚Äô clock, Disney, Gold & Silver, Mirror, Numbers, Flower Power and Safari. In 2011 O Bag released a pocket watch, calling it the O chive. This maintains the minimalist design of the O clock range with a plain white face and the inclusion of a seconds hand. The O chive is made of a soft-touch plastic shell and a white matt-varnished metal chain and clip. There were originally 10 colours but the three 80' clock colours were added, bringing the total to 13. The plastic shell can be removed and replaced with another colour much like the O clock faces. The packaging is based on a shoe polish container. In 2012 O Bag released the O bag (the product from which the company is now named), which is fully customizable, much like O Bag's previous products. The O bag is made from an elastomeric foam which comes in 20 different colours, most of which derive from the O clock colour range. The bag's handles and interior can be customised with a variety of materials and colours. O clock Tone on Tone range ==Special Editions== O bag collaborated with Disney, developing a range of watch faces with some of Disney‚Äôs most famous characters. ==Gallery== { O clock Classic Face O chive O bag Classic } ==ReferencesCategory:Products introduced in 2009 Category:Bags_(fashion) Category:Watch brands ","title":"O bag"},{"id":"35909402","text":"Akasaki (written: Ëµ§Â¥é or Ëµ§Ô®ë) is a Japanese surname.

The forces of the Kingdom of Aragon, together with auxiliary forces of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, were pitted against the defending forces of the Almohades. The Christian forces defeated the Muslim defenders. This battle was significant because in taking the castle at Ademuz, the Christian forces riled their Muslim opponents to initiate a grand offensive that would eventually culminate in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. This offensive, in turn, marked the end of the Islamic domination of the region and the beginning of Christian rule in the province. == Context == In 1210, the Almohad Empire, who controlled the Balearic Islands (conquered in 1203), launched a great incursion into the Catalan coast led by Abubola the Elder.Antoni Rovira i Virgili, Hist√≤ria Nacional de Catalunya, volumen IV, p√°g. 458-9 The Muslim forces, being the combined forces from the Maghreb and Al-Andalus, disembarked and began pillaging the countryside seizing much booty and captives in the process. In March 1210, in response to the Almohad incursion, King Peter II of Aragon, who was at the time in the city of Monz√≥n, gathered an army to attack the Moors of the Taifa of Valencia. Within the objectives of this campaign lay Al-DƒÅm≈´s (Spanish: Ademuz), one of the fortresses that formed the defensive net of the Turia River. == Siege == In the middle of 1210, Al-DƒÅm≈´s was conquered by Peter II of Aragon with the help of the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar. Among the knights who participated in the campaign were Ram√≥n de Castillazuelo, Bishop of Zaragoza, Garc√≠a de G√∫dal, Bishop of Osca, Garc√≠a Front√≠n I, Bishop of Tarazona, Jimeno Cornel, Garc√≠a Romeo, Artal II de Alag√≥n, Blasco Romeo, Pero Ses√©, Ato I de Foces, Guillem I de Cervell√≥, Guillem de Peralta, Arnaldo Palac√≠n, Arnaldo de Alasc√≥, Adam de Alasc√≥, Don Atorella, Sancho de Antill√≥n, Guillem III de Montcada, Guillem Ramon III de Montcada, Seneschal of Catalonia, and Guillem d'√ídena. From the Templars was Pedro de Montagut. == Consequences == The offensive continued until the Christian forces finally took the Castle of Serreilla. Pedro del Pomar was charged by King Peter II of Aragon to repopulate all the lands won by the conquest with Christians from the surrounding kingdoms. The loss of Ademuz and the devastation caused by the campaign, troubled the Almohades so much that they sent a delegation of nobles from Xarq al-√Åndalus to Marrakech to beg Muhammad al-Nasir for reinforcements. This was one of the motivating factors that led to the launch of the Muslim expedition that would culminate in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. This would in turn end the supremacy of Al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula. The fortress fell into Almohad hands later in 1210 in an offensive that also recaptured Castielfabib, but failed to reach Moya. ==See also== * Knights Hospitaller * Knights Templar * Peter II of Aragon * Reconquista ==References== * The information and sources of this article were translated from its Spanish equivalent. == Bibliography == * Eslava Blasco, Ra√∫l: Ademuz y su patrimonio hist√≥rico-art√≠stico.

A violent denunciation of the American involvement in the Vietnam War, the play was described by its author as a \\"folk war movie\\" comprising scenes of disillusionment and protest to the American military presence in Southeast Asia. Viet Rock is widely considered to be the first rock musical written and performed in the United States, as well as the first protest play about Vietnam.Gary Botting, The Theatre of Protest in America, Edmonton: Harden House, 1972 Its premiere also marks the first major theatre production in the United States in which actors left the stage to interact directly with the audience. The play was initially developed in 1965 and 1966 during collaborative workshops at New York City's The Open Theater under the leadership of Joseph Chaikin and Peter Feldman. The company performed improvisations based on accounts of the Vietnam War, and Terry wrote and directed a full-length show based on these improvisations. The music was composed by Marianne de Pury, who developed the songs during the workshops. It opened at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club on May 18, 1966. The play then had a two-week run at the Yale Repertory Theatre before its off-Broadway premiere at the Martinique Theatre on November 10, 1966. It closed at the Martinique on December 31 after 62 performances. One of the leading cast members was Gerome Ragni, who would go on to create the musical Hair with fellow actor James Rado. In developing Hair, Ragni borrowed the anti-war theme, as well as the experimental technique of improvisational exercises, from the production of Viet Rock. ==Publication== Viet Rock is published by Broadway Play Publishing Inc. in the collection Plays By Megan Terry. ==See also== * List of plays with anti-war themes ==References External links == * Category:1966 musicals Category:Off-Broadway musicals Category:Original musicals Category:Rock musicals ","title":"Viet Rock"},{"id":"35909664","text":"Annie Lilian La Fleur (n√©e Burgess, born 3 November 1969) is an Australian- Papua New Guinean former basketball player who competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics and the WNBA from 1999 to 2003.

It is the 26th Barney Bear short. This is also the last Barney Bear cartoon in the 1950s and in the original era. ==Plot== As quail season opens, Barney Bear goes downtown to buy himself a bird dog to hunt quail. Unbeknownst to him, he ends up getting a bird loving dog. While out hunting, he tells the dog to get him \\"something to shoot at\\", so it sets up some cans along the fence for him. But when Barney tells him to hunt for birds with him, the dog refuses, showing off his Bird Lovers card. The dog then runs out into the woods to save a baby quail while Barney tries hunting for it. The dog tries to trick Barney by pulling off a disappearing magic trick, but is busted and the bird escapes. Barney tries to shoot it but the dog pulls an entire blade of grass out from under Barney like a mat, tripping him. Barney chases the bird and hides behind a tree, to which the dog sneaks up behind him and draws the quail on his trouser seat. The dog shows it to Barney and, thinking it's the real bird, shoots himself in the rear. Barney then coaxes the bird out of hiding by placing a trail of bird seed that leads into his gun. Barney attempts to run home with the bird, but is tripped again by the dog and his gun is broken in half and the bird once again escapes to the railroad tracks. Barney tries shooting the bird again, and the bird runs away from the oncoming bullets but, after the dog switches the tracks, the bullets fly around and hit Barney's bottom again. The chase continues until Barney has the dog and bird cornered in a bush and fires at them. The dog pours ketchup all over him and pretends to have been shot. Barney ends up saying \\"Please don't die. I'll do anything!\\" to which the dog holds up a Bird Lover's Pledge to never harm another bird again, which Barney reluctantly signs. A bird closes Barney's eyes which has his eyelid say \\"The End\\" and that concludes \\"Bird-Brain Bird Dog\\". ==See also== *The Bear That Couldn't Sleep *The Rookie Bear *Bah Wilderness *Goggle Fishing Bear *Wee- Willie Wildcat ==References== Category:1954 animated films Category:1954 films Category:Animated films about dogs Category:Films about hunters Category:Films directed by Dick Lundy Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films Category:1950s American animated films Category:American films Category:Films scored by Scott Bradley ","title":"Bird-Brain Bird Dog"},{"id":"35909677","text":"Nemophora bifasciatella is a moth of the family Adelidae or fairy longhorn moths.

It is therefore sometimes referred to as the Capitular Church of St Nicholas ( or simply ). It is distinguished by a combination of Gothic and Baroque architecture and a broken longitudinal axis because the chancel is higher than the nave. ==History== The altar painting of St Nicholas by Tintoretto (c. 1582) The original church was first mentioned in 1428, although it was built before this. The chancel with three bays walled on five of eight sides has been preserved from that time. In 1493, when the chapter was established, a reconstruction was started and lasted until 1623. In 1576, the building was damaged in a fire. Its renovation was financed by the provost Polidoro de Montagnana, who ordered the construction of a new high altar and acquired the oil painting The Vision of Saint Nicholas (c. 1582) by the Venetian Mannerist painter Tintoretto for it. In 1621, the nave area with Baroque arches and three Baroque chapels on each side were constructed. In the 19th century, the church was reworked in the Gothic style. In 1733, new side altars with paintings by Valentin Metzinger were installed. In 1860, a new polygonal belfry was erected in the shell of an older one on the west side of the church. The main altar was renovated in 1868 by Matija Tomc.

Their 2011 debut studio album To the Treetops! won the 2011 Norwegian Grammy Awards (Spellemannprisen) in the category Best Pop Group of the Year. Their second studio album Blind as Night was released in early 2015. They disbanded in late 2015 to work on other projects, but Hagen has continued working as Team Me until it was announced in February 2019 that the band had reformed, with two additional members. ==Formation and early work (2010‚Äì2011)== Team Me made their concert debut in Trondheim on 22 January 2010 after they found themselves picked to play at Ur√∏rtfinalen, an annual Norwegian competition for up-and-coming bands held by NRK Ur√∏rt, which is a part of the Norwegian Broadcasting channel P3. Team Me was not an existing band at this stage, but the band's founder and songwriter Marius Drogs√•s Hagen gathered some friends in short time, and attended the finals to play a 30-minute set among bands like Kvelertak, Blood Command and The Pink Robots. The Pink Robots won and Kvelertak came in second, however Team Me gained attention for their finalist song \\"Fool\\", which was playlisted on Norwegian radio stations. In the following months, the band's songs \\"Fool\\" and \\"Weathervanes and Chemicals\\" were spread around on blogs across the world, and the band kept playing shows in Norway, including summer festivals such as √òyafestivalen, Pstereo and Volumfestivalen in the summer of 2010. In an article on the UK website Drowned in Sound, Team Me was called one of the most interesting new bands, and the band was one of the first to be announced to play at both By:larm 2011 and The Great Escape 2011. During 2011 \\"Me and the Mountain\\" was featured in the trailer of Liberal Arts, an American comedy- drama film directed by Josh Radnor. In the winter of 2011 Team Me announced that they had signed with Norwegian label Propeller Recordings, and an EP was released soon after. The song \\"Dear Sister\\" from the EP received airplay in Norway, Europe, the UK and the US. Throughout 2011, Team Me played festivals across Europe, including The Great Escape in Brighton, Club NME in London, Reeperbahn festival in Hamburg, √òyafestivalen in Oslo, Iceland Airwaves, and Berlin Independent Nights. They also embarked on several tours in the UK, Europe and Norway with The Wombats. ==To the Treetops! (2011‚Äì2015)== In October 2011 Team Me released their debut studio album 'To the Treetops!' in Norway. The album was acclaimed by Norwegian media, with many claiming it to be one of the best debut albums ever made by a Norwegian pop band. The band sold out 5 of 10 shows at their release tour in Norway, followed up by another tour the winter of 2012, including a sold out-show at Rockefeller in Oslo, selling 1,300 tickets. In March 2012 To the Treetops! was released worldwide to similarly positive reviews. After their performances at 2012 SXSW Festival, British music magazine NME chose Team Me as \\"one of their 10 new favorite bands\\" from the festival's massive lineup with a big feature in the magazine. Team Me toured extensively in the time after the release of their album, with several tours in Europe and Norway, plus shows in New York, Los Angeles and Austin in the US. The band also did a sold out show at Liquid Room, a 900 capacity venue in Tokyo in May 2012. In the summer of 2012 Team Me played summer festivals such as Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Latitude in the UK, Dour Festival in Belgium, Paredes de Coura Festival in Portugal, and Haldern Pop Festival in Germany. In 2013, the documentary ‚ÄúSayonara, Elverum‚Äù by director Sven Arild Storberget was screened at the Poolinale in Vienna, Austria; it follows the band on their first trip to Japan in May 2012 to play in Tokyo and their encounters with Japanese fans. The 35-minute-long documentary film was produced by Kristoffer Kumar and can be streamed in full on Kumar‚Äôs Vimeo page. In late 2014, Team Me released their second studio album Blind as Night in Norway. In January 2015 Blind as Night was released in the rest of the world on CD and MP3. In November 2015, the band announced that they were ending Team Me and each member would be going to make music \\"in their own directions\\". ==Reunion (2019-present)== On 21 February 2019, the band updated their Facebook and Instagram profiles with teasers to what could be coming next. This then led to the official announcement of the band reforming the next day. Along with their reunion they released a single called \\"Blurry Precise\\" and revealed that they would be performing at festivals in the summer including Traena Music Festival, Trollrock, Fres Festival and Pstereo. On 5 April they released a follow-up single \\"The Future in Your Eyes\\" and on 14 June their third single of 2019 \\"Does Anyone Know How To Get To The Heart Of This\\" was released. On 10 January 2020, the band released fourth single \\"Into the Wild\\". ==DiscographyAlbums=== * To the Treetops!

S. Settles, E. Krause, and H. F√ºtterer: Theodor Meyer ‚Äì Lost pioneer of gas dynamics, Progress in Aerospace Sciences 45 (6‚Äì8), pp. 203‚Äì210, 2009.J. D. Anderson: Modern compressible flow: With historical perspective, New York:McGraw-Hill, 2003. ==Biography== As a youth, Meyer studied mathematics and physics. He was privileged to learn from several of the great minds in these fields, including David Hilbert, Carl Runge, Hermann Minkowski, and Ludwig Prandtl. He and Prandtl made a great team, for Prandtl's intuitive and experimental approach to fluid mechanics has become legendary,J. C. Rotta: Die Aerodynamische Versuchsanstant in G√∂ttingen: ein Werk Ludwig Prandtls, G√∂ttingen:Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1990. and Meyer complemented his advisor's strengths with a formidable mathematical talent. During the first decade of the 20th century, Meyer worked under Prandtl's guidance at the Georg-August University in G√∂ttingen, Germany on the theory of supersonic gas flows, then a brand-new field of study that we now call compressible flow or gas dynamics.H. W. Liepmann and A. Roshko: Elements of gasdynamics, New York:Wiley, 1957 (reprint available from Dover Publications). In particular, Meyer developed the theory for how gases traveling at supersonic speed slow down abruptly through oblique shock waves, and how they accelerate smoothly through what we now call a Prandtl‚ÄìMeyer expansion fan. Prandtl first showed images of such flows captured by Schlieren photography,L. Prandtl: Neue Untersuchung √ºber die str√∂mende Bewegung der Gase und D√§mpfe, Physicalische Zeitschrift 8 (1), pp. 23‚Äì30, 1907 then the underlying theory appeared in Meyer's Ph.D. dissertation,T. Meyer: √úber zweidimensionale Bewegungsvorg√§nge in einem Gas, das mit √úberschallgeschwindigkeit Str√∂mt, G√∂ttingen University, 1908, Ph.D. Dissertation. hence the present terminology for the Prandtl‚ÄìMeyer function and the Prandtl‚ÄìMeyer expansion fan. Although the names of Prandtl and Meyer are now universally connected with fans of expansion or compression waves in high- speed gas flows, their leading role in the discovery of oblique-shock waves has been forgotten. Present-day textbooks on compressible flow and gas dynamics simply present the oblique shock theory without attribution. The last textbook to properly acknowledge Prandtl and Meyer for oblique-shock theory was apparently written in 1947.R. Sauer: Theoretical gasdynamics, Ann Arbor, MI:J. W. Edwards, 1947. Nonetheless, the Ph.D. dissertation of Theodor Meyer in 1908 is arguably one of the most influential in the entire field of fluid mechanics. Until recently, nothing was known about Theodor Meyer's life after he finished his Ph.D. research in 1908. We now know that he served as a junior officer in the German infantry during World War I. He was injured in trench warfare on the infamous Western Front, and he came into contact with Fritz Haber, later a Nobel Prizewinner and now known as the \\"father of chemical warfare.\\" After the war, Meyer sought further employment in theoretical physics but could not find it in depression-era postwar Germany. Ludwig Prandtl was not financially able to hire him, but Meyer did design the de Laval nozzle for a supersonic wind tunnel that Prandtl wanted to build. Prandtl sought funding from the German military to build this advanced aerodynamic test facility, but he did not succeed. Meyer subsequently worked as an engineer and as a high-school teacher of math and physics. By the time of his death at almost age 90 in 1972, not even his family or his neighbors in Bad Bevensen, Germany were aware of the formative role he had played, with Ludwig Prandtl, in the scientific discipline known as compressible flow or gas dynamics. ==References== Category:German physicists Category:20th-century physicists Category:1972 deaths Category:1882 births Category:Fluid dynamicists ","title":"Theodor Meyer"},{"id":"35909881","text":"C√≠ntia \\"Tui√∫\\" Silva dos Santos (born 31 January 1975 in Mau√°) is a Brazilian former basketball player.

Retrieved 23 May 2012. ==Biography== After attending Vermehren's drawing school until 1908, Fischer studied painting at the Danish Academy (1908‚Äì1913) under Viggo Johansen but as a sculptor he was largely self-taught. From 1913 to 1933, he lived in Paris where he crafted statuettes and busts which are among the first examples of Danish sculpture inspired by Cubism. They include Ellen Fischer (walnut, 1917) and Fransk Soldat (limestone, 1918), depicting a soldier with a face made up of two halves, each with its own expression. Another early work which shows his appreciation of \\"the moment\\" is his bronze statuette Fodboldspiller (Football Player, 1915), an unusual subject for sculpture. The figure's head, arms and legs are created in two different positions, rather like a photograph taken by a camera which has moved.Hans Edvard: Dansk kunst: tusind √•rs kunsthistorie, Copenhagen, Gyldendals Bogklubber, 2006, p. 483 and 590. . From 1920, influenced by Diego Rivera and Aristide Maillol, he adopted a naturalistic idiom based on principles of Constructivism. He created a number of works consisting of women bearing jars, either in walking or sitting positions. From 1922, Fischer was a member of the Gr√∏nningen artists cooperative.\\"Adam Fischer\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 23 May 2012, One of his most important works is the memorial to Prime Minister Ove Rode in Ove Rode Square, Copenhagen, with a statue of a woman bearing a child and carrying a basket. He also created some fine busts including Diego Rivera (1918), Drenghoved (Boy's Head, 1922) and Astrid Noack (1928). His interest in ceramic glazes can be seen in a series titled Ung pige fra Kreta (Young girl from Crete). ==Awards== Fischer was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1936, for his bust Eva la Cour, the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1950 and the Prince Eugen Medal in 1960. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Inge Vibeke Raaschou-Nielsen, Marianne Br√∏ns, Gitte Valentiner: \\"K√∏benhavn/Paris/retur\\", Copenhagen, 1982, Statens museum for kunst, 48 pp. ==External links== *Examples of Adam Fischer's work from Statens Museum for Kunst *Fischer's Fodboldspiller from Fuglsang Museum Category:1888 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Prince Eugen Medal Category:20th-century Danish sculptors Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Adam Fischer (sculptor)"},{"id":"35909899","text":"Xin Bu Liao Qing may refer to * Xin Bu Liao Qing (film) or C'est la vie, mon ch√©ri, a Cantonese film ** Xin Bu Liao Qing (TV series) or C'est La Vie, Mon Ch√©ri, a series starring Fiona Sit and Aloys Chen based on the film *** \\"Xin bu liao qing\\", the series theme song by Jane Zhang and Fiona Sit, included on It's My Day * \\"Xin bu liao qing\\", a song by Jam Hsiao from Love Moments == See also == * Bu liao qing (disambiguation) ","title":"Xin buliao qing"},{"id":"35909932","text":"Vivian Cristina Lopes (born 7 January 1976) is a Brazilian former basketball player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of Brazil Category:Basketball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics ","title":"Vivian Cristina Lopes"},{"id":"35909942","text":"Hadia may refer to : * Handia (drink), a rice beer popular in Northern India * Hadia Tajik, a Pakistani-Norwegian jurist, journalist and politician.

In the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, he is called king (rex). == Biography == Visvaldis's date of birth is unknown. His origins, too, are unclear: some scholars think that he was a son of Boriss Davidovic, Duke of the Principality of Polotsk and a Latgalian mother. The first written record of him dates from 1203 and tells of how he, together with the Lithuanians attacked the newly established city of Riga.Chronicle of Henry of Livonia Although he was a vassal of Principality of Polotsk, he was married to a daughter of the Lithuanian duke Daugerutis and thus became also Lithuania's ally. Between 1203 and 1208 Visvaldis, together with the Lithuanians repeatedly raided Livonian lands and tried to gain full control of the River Daugava. In 1209, Bishop Albert of Riga led German crusaders and the allied Livonian army against the Principality of Jersika. They did not meet significant resistance and plundered Visvaldis's capital, the Jersika hillfort, taking his wife prisoner. Visvaldis, however, managed to escape but he was forced to surrender and became a vassal of Albert of Riga. He was forced to submit his kingdom to Albert as a gift to the Bishopric of Riga, and received only a portion of it as a fiefdom. Visvaldis's feudal charter is the oldest such document surviving in Latvia, and calls him \\"the king of Jersika\\" (\\"Vissewalde, rex de Gercike\\").http://www.historia.lv/alfabets/A/AL/ALBERTS/dokumenti/1209.04.10.latinuhtm.htm In 1214, Jersika castle was again destroyed by the German knight Meinhard from Koknese because Visvaldis was still supporting the Lithuanians. In later years, Visvaldis's lands were repeatedly divided among Bishop Albert of Riga and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. Visvaldis's date of death is unknown, and is probably between 1230 and 1239. The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia describes Jersika hillfort as abandoned in 1239. == References == Category:13th-century rulers in Europe Category:Medieval Latgalian people Category:People of the Livonian Crusade ","title":"Visvaldis"},{"id":"35910002","text":"Maria Ang√©lica Gon√ßalves da Silva (born 10 January 1966) is a Brazilian former basketball player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of Brazil Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for Brazil Category:Olympic medalists in basketball Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics ","title":"Maria Ang√©lica"},{"id":"35910009","text":"Cl√°udia Maria Pastor (born 15 July 1971) is a Brazilian former basketball player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of Brazil Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for Brazil Category:Olympic medalists in basketball Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics ","title":"Cl√°udia Maria Pastor"},{"id":"35910022","text":"Roseli do Carmo Gustavo (born 25 July 1971 in Araraquara) is a Brazilian former basketball player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Araraquara Category:Brazilian women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of Brazil Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 1991 Pan American Games Category:Olympic silver medalists for Brazil Category:Olympic medalists in basketball Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games medalists in basketball Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil ","title":"Roseli Gustavo"},{"id":"35910049","text":"He Jun (born 3 March 1969) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics and in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball players from Beijing Category:Chinese women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for China Category:Olympic medalists in basketball Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics ","title":"He Jun"},{"id":"35910053","text":"The via D'Amelio bombing () was a terror attack by the Sicilian Mafia which took place in Palermo, Sicily, Italy on 19 July 1992. It killed anti-mafia magistrate Paolo Borsellino and five members of his police escort: Agostino Catalano, Emanuela Loi (the first Italian female member of a police escort and the first to be killed on duty), Vincenzo Li Muli, Walter Eddie Cosina and Claudio Traina. The so-called agenda rossa, the red notebook in which Borsellino used to write down details of his investigations and which he always carried with him, disappeared from the site in the moments after the explosion. A carabinieri officer who was present when the explosion occurred reported he had delivered the notebook to Giuseppe Ayala, the first Palermo magistrate to arrive at the scene. Ayala, who said he had refused to receive it, was later criticized for saying escorts to anti-mafia judges should be reduced, despite evidence of further failed attempts to kill them in subsequent years. ==Bombing== The bombing occurred at 4:58 p.m. on 19 July 1992, 57 days after the Capaci bombing, in which Borsellino's friend, anti- mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, had been killed with his wife and police escort. The only survivor of the escort in the bombing, Antonino Vullo, said the judge had stayed in his summer residence outside Palermo from 1:30 p.m. to around 4:00 p.m., when he and the escort drove to Via D'Amelio in the Sicilian capital, where he was to meet his mother. When they arrived, Vullo and the other agents noticed nothing unusual except some parked cars. The car in which Borsellino had been travelling exploded, along with one of the escort cars, while Vullo was sitting in a third car.Interview of agent Vullo the day after the massacre. The bomb, containing some of TNT, had been placed in a Fiat 126. Normal procedure when Borsellino travelled was to clear the road of cars before his arrival, but this was not allowed by the administration of the comune of Palermo, as reported by another anti-mafia judge, Antonino Caponnetto. Gaspare Spatuzza, a mafioso who later became a pentito, eventually revealed he had stolen the Fiat 126 on the orders of the Graviano and Brancaccio mafia clans. The bloodbath provoked outrage. The night after, protesters peacefully besieged the prefecture of Palermo. Borsellino's funeral saw vehement protests by the crowd against the participants; the national police chief, Arturo Parisi, was struck while trying to escape. A few days later, questore (local police commander) Vito Plantone and prefetto Mario Jovine were transferred. The chief prosecutor of Palermo, Pietro Giammanco, resigned. Meanwhile, 7,000 soldiers were sent to Sicily to patrol roads and possible locations for attacks. ==Aftermath== Borsellino used to carry a red notebook, the so-called agenda rossa, in which he wrote down details of his investigations before making an official record in judicial reports. His colleagues were not given access to the agenda rossa. Carabinieri officer Rosario Farinella said later that, after recovering the agenda rossa from the car, he gave it to Ayala. Ayala said he was staying in a hotel nearby and rushed to the place after hearing the explosion. He initially stumbled on the corpse of Borsellino without recognizing it, as the dead judge was limbless. Ayala said \\"an officer in uniform\\" had offered him the notebook, but that he had refused it because he lacked authority. Carabinieri captain Arcangioli said he was not wearing uniform at the scene. In September 2005, Ayala changed his version, saying he took the agenda rossa while exploring the destroyed car and later gave it to a carabinieri officer who was there. Ayala's subsequent statements speak of an agent alternately in uniform and not in uniform. On 1 July 1992 Borsellino had held a meeting with Nicola Mancino, who at the time had just been appointed Minister of the Interior. Details of the meeting have never been disclosed, but it is likely that Borsellino had annotated them in his agenda. Mancino, however, always denied having met Borsellino. In a television interview of 24 July 2009, Ayala said, \\"Mancino himself told me that he had met Borsellino on 1 July 1992. Moreover, Mancino showed me his appointments book, with the name of Borsellino on it.\\" Ayala repudiated this account in an interview in Sette magazine. A video showing Arcangioli holding the agenda rossa while inspecting the bombing area was aired in news on Italian state channel Rai 1 in 2006. A personal diary in the possession of Borsellino's family has an annotation by the judge that reads: \\"1 July h 19:30 : Mancino\\". Vittorio Aliqu√≤, another magistrate, later said he had accompanied Borsellino \\"up to the threshold of the minister's office\\". A memorial in Via D'Amelio ==Investigations and sentences== In July 2007 the prosecutor's office in Caltanissetta opened an investigation into the possible involvement of agents from SISDE, Italy's civil intelligence service, in the massacre. At the same time, a letter from Borsellino's brother Salvatore was published. Entitled 19 luglio 1992: Una strage di stato (\\"19 July 1992: A state massacre\\"), the letter supports the hypothesis that Minister of the Interior Mancino knew the reasons for the magistrate's assassination. Salvatore Borsellino wrote: Investigations held by police telecommunications expert Gioacchino Genchi attested the presence of an undercover SISDE installation in Castello Utveggio, an art nouveau castle on Monte Pellegrino, a mountain overlooking Palermo and Via D'Amelio. This was discovered by analyzing the phone calls of mafia boss Gaetano Scotto, who called a SISDE phone in the castle.After the revelation, Genchi was removed from the investigation and the Castello Utveggio case was archived by the Tribunal of Caltanissetta. Scotto's brother Pietro had done maintenance work on phone lines in Via D'Amelio; it was later discovered that Pietro had tapped Borsellino's mother's phone to obtain confirmation of Borsellino's arrival before the massacre. All trace of SISDE disappeared from Castello Utveggio immediately after the assassination. Mafia boss Tot√≤ Riina spoke about the presence of the Italian intelligence service on Monte Pellegrino on 22 May 2004, in the trial relating to the Via dei Georgofili bombing. In an interview on the Italian state TV documentary show La storia siamo noi (History is Us), Borsellino's widow said he, in the days before the massacre, had her close the shutters on the windows because \\"they can observe us from Castello Utveggio\\". The first investigations led to the arrest of Vincenzo Scarantino on 26 September 1992, accused by pentiti of having stolen the car used in the explosion. (Scarantino later became a pentito himself.) The magistrates also discovered the phone of Borsellino's mother had been tapped. A first trial for the massacre ended on 26 January 1996, with Scarantino sentenced to 18 years in prison, while Giuseppe Orofino, Salvatore Profeta and Pietro Scotto, those who prepared the bomb and intercepted the phone, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Scotto and Orofino, however, were acquitted on appeal. A second trial was started in 1999 after Scarantino changed his statements; this time, Salvatore Riina, Pietro Aglieri, Salvatore Biondino, Carlo Greco, Giuseppe Graviano, Gaetano Scotto and Francesco Tagliavia were sentenced to life imprisonment. A third trial in 2002 involved 26 other mafia bosses who had been involved in the massacre in various ways, ending with life sentences for Bernardo Provenzano, Pippo Cal√≤, Michelangelo La Barbera, Raffaele Ganci, Domenico Ganci, Francesco Madonia, Giuseppe Montalto, Filippo Graviano, Cristoforo Cannella, Salvatore Biondo and another Salvatore Biondo. In 1992 the Italian political world was shaken by the Mani Pulite (clean hands) corruption scandal, after which most of the parties that had been the traditional political supporters of the mafia would disappear. In 2009 Massimo Ciancimino, son of the mafioso former mayor of Palermo Vito Ciancimino, said the Italian establishment and the mafia had been negotiating a pact in those days. Among other things, the agreement would involve the creation of a new party, Forza Italia, with the help of founder Silvio Berlusconi's chief collaborator, Marcello Dell'Utri, who was later convicted of allegiance to the mafia. After the new revelations, Sicilian attorneys started new investigations based on the hypothesis that Borsellino knew of the negotiations between the mafia, SISDE and senior politicians, and that he was assassinated because of this knowledge. The existence of negotiations between Italian institutions and the Sicilian mafia was confirmed in 2012 by Caltanissetta prosecutor Nico Gozzo as \\"by now an established fact\\". ==ReferencesSources== * Category:1992 crimes in Italy Category:1992 murders in Europe Category:1990s murders in Italy Category:1990s trials Category:2000s trials Category:20th century in Sicily Category:20th- century mass murder in Italy Category:Car and truck bombings in Italy Category:False flag operations Category:History of Palermo Category:History of the Sicilian Mafia Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in 1992 Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Italy Category:July 1992 crimes Category:July 1992 events in Europe Category:Mass murder in 1992 Category:Massacres in Italy Category:Murder in Sicily Category:Murder trials Category:Organized crime events in Italy Category:Trials in Italy Category:Violent non-state actor incidents in Italy ","title":"Via D'Amelio bombing"},{"id":"35910055","text":"David Barden is a Gaelic footballer from County Longford, Ireland.

Duct tape is found in his pocket and in his van there are tranquilizers and a ransom note‚Äîall indications that he had intended to kidnap her. Jack is arrested. Angry with Ana for defying him, Christian cuts short his New York business trip and returns to Seattle. Furious that Ana reneged on her promise to have Kate over rather than go out, an upset Christian sulks while Ana sleeps. Eventually, the two argue and Ana berates him for being overly controlling and possessive. She demands more freedom and access to her friends. Christian finally relents after realizing how much Ana's friends mean to her and that Ana did the right thing by staying with Kate rather than at home. Soon after, Christian surprises her with a trip to Aspen, with Kate, Elliot, Mia, and Kate's brother, Ethan. While there, Elliot proposes to Kate, and she accepts. Ana's step-father, Ray, is in a medically-induced coma after a car accident. When he awakens a few days later, Ana and Christian arrange to move him to Seattle to recover. It is also Ana's birthday weekend, and Christian surprises her with all her family and friends at a dinner. He gives her a charm bracelet with the charms representing all their \\"firsts\\" including an ice cream cone to represent their \\"vanilla\\" relationship. Christian also gifts her with an Audi R8. Soon after, Ana learns she is pregnant. Christian angrily accuses her of getting pregnant on purpose and leaves. He returns early the next morning drunk, claiming Ana will choose the baby - whom he believes to be a boy - over him. Ana says it could be a girl, though Christian refuses to accept that due to his sexist and chauvinistic nature. Ana becomes furious when she discovers a text message on Christian's phone from his ex-lover Elena Lincoln, the woman who seduced him when he was fifteen and introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. The message indicates they met for a drink. The next two mornings, Anastasia and Christian barely speak to each other: Christian is angry over the unplanned pregnancy; Anastasia is upset about his late-night encounter with Elena, though Christian insists their relationship is long-since over. When Christian is away on a business for a few days, Ana receives a call from Jack Hyde. He has kidnapped Mia Grey and demands $5 million in two hours. He warns Ana not to tell anyone or he will kill Mia. Anastasia feigns illness and returns home to escape her bodyguard, Sawyer. She takes a gun and goes to the bank. While collecting the money, the suspicious bank manager calls Christian, who believes Ana is leaving him. To protect Mia's life, Ana lies to Christian, saying she is leaving him to raise the baby alone. Hyde instructs Ana to leave her phone but she tricks him by taking the bank manager's phone instead and dropping it in the trash. She leaves via the back entrance to a waiting car, shocked that Hyde's accomplice is Elizabeth Morgan, her co-worker. When handing over the money, Hyde tries to kill Ana out of vengeance for losing his job, causing Elizabeth to feel guilty for being involved. Angered by his behavior and his hurting Ana, Elizabeth argues with Hyde. On the ground and bruised, Ana shoots Hyde in the leg. As Ana starts to black out she hears Christian calling her name. Ana wakes three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though he is angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, he realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Ana returns home the next day. Christian learns from his private investigator, Welch, that he and Hyde had the same foster family. He tells Ana about how he met and was seduced by Elena. By introducing him to the world of BDSM, Elena helped Christian learn to take control of his life. If she had not intervened, he would still be plagued with horrible memories of his mother and would never have been able to control his life. Ana feels guilty for her behavior when he explains how he ended up seeing Elena. He had been looking for his psychiatrist, Dr. Flynn, because he needed help and when he could not contact Flynn, Christian wound up at Elena's salon to talk to someone about his problems. Elena happened to be at the salon while she was closing. She knew Christian and Ana had had a fight about the pregnancy. Elena took him to her favorite bar for a drink and to help him relax. Although she made a pass at him, Elena realized that Christian loved Ana and finally agreed to leave on good terms. He reassures her that she did the right thing to call him out for his behavior because Dr. Flynn had been right that he still has a lot of growing up to do. The next day, a furious Christian discovers from Welsh that Elena's ex-husband, Eric Lincoln, had bailed Jack from jail out of spite for her affair with Christian. Christian tells Ana that after learning about the affair, Eric severely beat Elena and divorced her. Despite Christian's urging, Elena refused to press charges against Eric out of guilt for the affair. Christian retaliated by buying out Eric Lincoln's logging company to sell it off. It is also learned Elizabeth confessed to police that she was blackmailed by Hyde to be his accomplice. (However, her ultimate fate remains a mystery.) 7 months later Ana and Christian have a son named Theodore Raymond Grey, nicknamed Teddy. 2 years later Ana is six months pregnant with their second child, a daughter whom they decide to name Phoebe. Elliot and Kate have married and have a two-month-old daughter named Ava. At the end, after having BDSM sex, Ana and Christian are getting ready to celebrate Teddy's second birthday with their family and friends. ==CharactersReception== Fifty Shades Freed entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number three.

In town, he encounters civil insurrection following the killing of an American soldier, presumably by one of his colleagues who is now missing. When Mei returns to his home and his dog Monk in a half-destroyed church, the missing soldier appears from behind a curtain and points a gun at him. His leg is injured, supposedly by the real assailant's firearm. Since the soldier (Gill) is African-American, Akira is convinced that he will appreciate the jazz record he bought and tries to use it as a way of communication. He plays a few songs on the record, but the G.I. responds badly and, in a fit of restlessness, attacks and kills Mei's dog. Eventually, the soldier asks Mei to take him to the sea, for unknown reasons, and on their way there, they form a bond and become close friends. However, eventually they encounter MPs. In a moment of despair, the soldier sings \\"Six Bits Blues\\" as its original blues dirge, affecting Mei. Mei and Gill find their way to the top of a building, overlooking the sea, where Gill ties himself to a balloon. He asks Akira to cut the rope, hoping to float up in the air and from there, to see his mother one more time. Mei reluctantly fulfills his request and they all watch the soldier, buoyed on his airborne balloon, as he approaches the sea. ==Music== The film featured music by the American jazz drummer Max Roach.http://www.criterion.com/films/27761-black-sun ==References* Chico Lourant, the Black Sun of Shibuya on The Tokyo Files Category:1964 films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Films directed by Koreyoshi Kurahara Category:Japanese films ","title":"Black Sun (1964 film)"},{"id":"35910163","text":"__NOTOC__ Charaxes andranodorus is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Here, \\"residual\\" means in excess of any opportunity costs measured relative to the book value of shareholders' equity; residual income (RI) is then the income generated by a firm after accounting for the true cost of capital. The approach is largely analogous to the EVA/MVA based approach, with similar logic and advantages. Residual Income valuation has its origins in Edwards & Bell (1961), Peasnell (1982), and Ohlson (1995). ==Concept== The underlying idea is that investors require a rate of return from their resources ‚Äì i.e. equity ‚Äì under the control of the firm's management, compensating them for their opportunity cost and accounting for the level of risk resulting. This rate of return is the cost of equity, and a formal equity cost must be subtracted from net income. Consequently, to create shareholder value, management must generate returns at least as great as this cost. Thus, although a company may report a profit on its income statement, it may actually be economically unprofitable; see Economic profit. It is thus possible that a value deemed positive using a traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) approach may be negative here. RI-based valuation is therefore a valuable complement to more traditional techniques. ==Calculation of residual income== The cost of equity is typically calculated using the CAPM, although other approaches such as APT are also used. The currency charge to be subtracted is then simply :Equity Charge = Equity Capital x Cost of Equity, and :Residual income = Net Income ‚àí Equity Charge. ==Valuation formula== Using the residual income approach, the value of a company's stock can be calculated as the sum of its book value and the present value of its expected future residual income, discounted at the cost of equity, r, resulting in the general formula: : V_0 = BV_0 + \\\\sum_{t=1}^{\\\\infty} { RI_t \\\\over (1+r)^t } Here various adjustments to the balance sheet book value may be required; see Clean surplus accounting. Typically, the above formula will be applied such that the company is assumed to achieve maturity, or \\"constant growth\\". (Note that the value will remain identical: the adjustment is a \\"telescoping\\" device). Here, analysts commonly employ the Perpetuity Growth Model to calculate the corresponding terminal valuehttp://www.bus.sfu.ca/homes/poitras/jacced_resinc_01.pdf (although various, more formal approaches are also applied). Then, assuming long-run, \\"constant\\", growth g from year m, the terminal value is : T_{m} = {RI_{m} \\\\over (r-g)} , and the RI valuation would then be: : V_0 = BV_0 + \\\\sum_{t=1}^{m-1} { RI_t \\\\over (1+r)^t } + {T_{m} \\\\over (1+r)^{m-1}} . ==Comparison with other valuation methods== As can be seen, the residual income valuation formula is similar to the dividend discount model (DDM) (and to other discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models), substituting future residual earnings for dividend (or free cash) payments (and the cost of equity for the weighted average cost of capital). However, the RI-based approach is most appropriate when a firm is not paying dividends or exhibits an unpredictable dividend pattern, and / or when it has negative free cash flow many years out, but is expected to generate positive cash flow at some point in the future. Further, value is recognized earlier under the RI approach, since a large part of the stock's intrinsic value is recognized immediately ‚Äì current book value per share ‚Äì and residual income valuations are thus less sensitive to terminal value. At the same time, in addition to the accounting considerations mentioned above, the RI approach will not generally hold if there are expected changes in shares outstanding or if the firm plans to bring in \\"new\\" shareholders who derive a net benefit from their capital contributions. Although EVA is similar to residual income, there will be technical differences between EVA and RI, specifically Stern Stewart & Co, originators of EVA, recommend a fairly large number of adjustments to NOPAT before the methodology may be applied.

The Griqualand West Annexation Act (Act 39 of 1877), was the act, passed in the Cape Colony Parliament on 27 July 1877, authorising the union of the Cape Colony with Griqualand West. ==Background== Nicolaas Waterboer, Griqua Kaptejn and leader. Griqualand West, one of the states created by the semi-nomadic Griqua people, was brought under British rule, as a separate colony, on 27 October 1871. It contained the newly discovered diamond fields of Kimberley and was beginning to attract large numbers of prospectors. With possession of this land being claimed by the Orange Free State, and contested by the arriving diamond diggers, the Griqua leader Nicolaas Waterboer requested that the Cape Colony incorporate Griqualand West, as this would give his people representation in the Cape Parliament and a certain degree of political empowerment. The Cape Colony, under Responsible Government from 1872, explicitly adhered to a policy of incorporating \\"natives\\" into the Cape's political and economic system. This was quite unlike the policy in the Orange Free State which was vying for control of the diamond fields and the other southern African states which generally segregated their populations and excluded non-white peoples from political participation. This factor no doubt influenced Waterboer's decision, however the Cape government initially decided against incorporating the territory, due primarily to objections from both the European settlers and from certain portions of the indigenous population. Upon the Cape's initial refusal to incorporate it in 1873, Griqualand West became a separate British Crown Colony, with Sir Richard Southey as its Administrator and Lieutenant Governor. There followed bitter land disputes between the white diggers, the Griqua people and the Orange Free State. A land court was set up, under Judge Andries Stockenstrom, but this did little to resolve the disagreements. In 1875 Southey was replaced as Lieutenant Governor by Major William Owen Lanyon, who publicly professed a great dislike for the Griqua people and for Griqualand West overall, which he dubbed a \\"hideous and disgusting place\\". He oversaw a systematic dispossession of the Griqua people. The Cape finally agreed to incorporate the territory four years later in 1877, following agreement by the British government on compensation to the Orange Free State for its competing land claims. The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno still had serious doubts about annexing the heavily indebted region, but, after striking a deal with the Home Government and receiving reassurances that the local population would be consulted in the process, he passed the Griqualand West Annexation Act on 27 July 1877.Roberts, Brian. 1976. Kimberley, turbulent city. Cape Town: David Philip, p. 155. ==Provisions== Map showing the Cape Colony, with the Griqua and Boer states in green and pink respectively. The act specified that Griqualand West would have the right to elect four representatives to the Legislative Assembly of the Cape parliament, two for Kimberley and two for the Barkly West region. It would also elect one representative to the Legislative Council, the smaller upper house. In the judiciary, the local Griqua attorney-general reported to the Cape Supreme Court, which got concurrent jurisdiction with the Griqualand West Supreme Court in the territory.http://www.sabar.co.za/law- journals/2010/april/2010-april-vol023-no1-pp42-and-44.pdf The act was not without controversy however. The seats were allocated according to population, but Kimberley representatives argued that the number should be increased to represent the relative wealth of the area. The Cape Government also enforced its non-racial Cape Qualified Franchise system. This meant that all resident males could qualify for the vote, with the qualifications for suffrage applied equally regardless of race. This was welcomed by the Griqua and Tswana majority, but rejected by the diggers, who comprised much of the white minority.L Waldman: The Griqua Conundrum: Political and Socio-Cultural Identity in the Northern Cape, South Africa. Oxford. 2007. The promulgation of the act was set for 18 October 1880, when the last Lieutenant Governor, James Rose Innes stepped down and direct British imperial rule over the territory ended. Many spent (obsolete) sections of the act were repealed on 19 May 1934 by the Cape Statute Law Revision Act, 1934. Another section was repealed on 14 June 1967 by the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act, 1967, and the remainder of the act was repealed on 2 September 1970 by the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act, 1970. ==References== Annexation Act Category:Cape Colony law Category:Repealed South African legislation Category:Treaties of the Cape Colony Category:1877 in Griqualand West Category:1877 in law Category:Historical constitutions of South Africa Category:Former countries in Africa Category:Governance of the British Empire Category:Legal history of South Africa Category:Political history of South Africa Category:Politics of the Cape Colony Category:South Africa and the Commonwealth of Nations Category:1877 in the Cape Colony ","title":"Griqualand West Annexation Act"},{"id":"35910192","text":"Qiu Chen (ÈÇ±Êô®, Pinyin: Qi≈´ Ch√©n; born 1 June 1963) is a Chinese former basketball player who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Medisin) Hans Henrich Maschmann was born in Oslo, Norway. He was the son of Johan Heinrich Maschmann (1719-1785) who had re-located from Hamburg, Germany. From 1773, his father had been the owner-operator of the pharmaceutical firm, Elefantapoteket i Christiania. In 1786, Hans Maschmann was sent to school in Hamburg which was followed three years later with a four-year apprenticeship at a pharmacy in Halden in √òstfold. Later he traveled to Kongsberg, where he attended lectures of the Danish chemist Nicolay Tychsen (1751-1804). In 1796, he took his examen pharmaceuticum. In 1797, following the death of both of his parents, Maschmann received his license to acquire and operate the pharmacy. Nicolai Tychsen (Dansk Biografisk Leksikon) When Denmark-Norway was drawn into the Napoleonic wars in 1807, the resulting British naval embargo limited the supply of goods, including pharmaceuticals. Maschmann worked with other pharmaceutical wholesaler in the country to avoided medical shortages during these crisis years which extended until the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. In 1839, he turned over management of the pharmacy firm to his eldest son Carl Gustav Maschmann, who died in 1848. He managed the pharmacy until 1856 when his younger son, Bernt Sverdrup Maschmann joined the firm. Maschmann was a member of Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1825. He was appointed Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1853 and also knighted in the Swedish Order of Vasa. ==ReferencesRelated Reading== *Glenthoj, Rasmus; Morten Nordhagen Ottesen (2014) Experiences of War and Nationality in Denmark and Norway, 1807-1815 ( Palgrave Macmillan) ==External links== * Diary entries written Professor HH Maschmann on a journey to Germany and France, 1800-1801 Category:1775 births Category:1860 deaths Category:Norwegian businesspeople Category:Order of Vasa Category:Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters ","title":"Hans Henrich Maschmann"},{"id":"35910227","text":"The 1959 Ballon d'Or, given to the best football player in Europe as judged by a panel of sports journalists from UEFA member countries, was awarded to Alfredo Di St√©fano on 15 December 1959.

It was founded by Ajami Nakhchivani in the 12th century.Encyclop√¶dia Iranica.  øAjamƒ´ The mausoleums of Yusif ibn Kuseyir (the first in 1162) and Momine Khatun (the second in 1186), constructed by him in Nakhchivan are a classical example of constructions of this school. ==History and peculiarities== Small feudal states were established in the territory of modern Azerbaijan because of weakening of the Caliphate. At that times, in such cities as Barda, Shamakhi, Beylagan, Ganja, Nakhchivan and others were appeared different architectural schools, among which were observed a general similarity of architectural style:–ö. –ú. –ú–∞–º–µ–¥-–∑–∞–¥–µ. –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω–∞ styles of Arran, Nakhchivan, Shirvan-Absheron and also Tabriz, which was developed later in the territory of Iranian Azerbaijan. The first dated monuments of Nakhchivan School belong to the 12th century. Among them were tower-shaped mausoleums and also memorial constructions erected for glorification of wealth and power of feudal. Origination of architectural type of the Caucasian tower-mausoleums is dated to ancient times, but it hasn‚Äôt been studied sufficiently yet. Unlike the tower-mausoleums in the southern parts of Iran and some regions of Middle Asia the tower-mausoleums in Azerbaijan have a many-sided and cross-shaped underground mausoleum in terms of burial vault. Such burial vaults have a low and smooth arch. Underground part consists of socle built of a faced stone, the main volume of the tower and a cone-shaped or pyramidal ceiling. The inner part of the towers has the high, frequently many sided space covered with cupola. Architectural school of Nakhchivan was based on the scientific count techniques. The landmarks were built by exact estimation and measures, plans, area, and accurate plan of the inscriptions and ornaments. The architecture of Nakhchivan is not only known for its stone architectural monuments, but also for its monuments built by red and violet bricks. In the second half of the XVII century, restoration took place in Nakhchivan, Ordubad and Julfa. According to Ovliya Chalabi, the Turkish historian, in the XVII century, there were 20.000 houses, 70 religious structures, 20 caravansaries, 7 bathhouses and markets in Nakhchivan. Imamzadah architectural complex, Ismail Khan's bathhouse, Khan's home, caravansaries, and bathhouses were built in Ordubad. Architectural monuments of the XVIII century have reached the XXI century. The International symposiums such as \\"Nakhchivan in International Resources\\" in 1996, \\"Prophet Noah, World Storm and Nakhchivan\\" in 2009, \\"Nakhchivan: as the essential settlement and urban working\\" in 2011, \\"Nakhchivan: the essential city and Duzdagh\\" in 2012 played a crucial role in protection of architectural school of Nakhchivan. There are 1,200 registered architectural monuments listed during 2006-2012. == Features == The upper part of the two-layer buildings has a shape of cylinder, cube, and prism and is covered with a double dome. The two architectural monuments created by Ajami Nakhchivani are the prismatic burial tomb. Ahmed ibn Eyyub al-Hafiz Nakhchivani created round cylindrical tombstones. == Ornamentation == Architectural school of Nakhchivan is characterized by brick masonry, brick-built structures, the use of various brick, and the architectural ornaments of colorful tassels and ghost elements. The Nakhchivan architects used a geometric ornament structure.Qiyasi, C. (1999) ‚Äì Az…ôrbaycan xatir…ô memarlƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ±n t…ôkam√ºl prosesind…ô Nax√ßƒ±van memarlƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ±n rolu.

The Agnelli family spent their holidays here for more than thirty years, commissioning an underground passage to give direct access to the beach, without having to cross the crowded boulevard. This secret passage remains unique in the Versilian territory. The bathing establishment, initially, consisted of a tool shed and garage for the family's hydroplane. Today it is one of the most emblematic structures of Forte dei Marmi, preserving the charm that Susanna Agnelli described in her autobiography We always wore sailor suits (1983). Today, the Villa Agnelli is one of the central areas of the Augustus Hotel & Resort complex, built in the '50s on the foundation of another famous mansion, constructed in the 1930s. The nucleus of the hotel was the Villa Pesenti, a jewel of modern architecture, designed in 1939 by renowned architect Osvaldo Borsani. It is a good example of rationalist architecture, embellished with typical Mediterranean finishes. In 1953 the family added a storey to the Villa, transforming it into the only Luxury Hotel & Resort in Versilia for more than twenty years. Around the main structure, seven villas were built in the following years, by different artists and architects. ==Famous people== Many important artists, actors, sportsmen and prominent cultural figures have spent their vacation in the villas of the Augustus Hotel&Resort;: Jimi Hendrix, Charlton Heston, Oriana Fallaci, Eugenio Montale, Francesco Messina, Mario Monicelli, Paul Anka, Vittorio Gassman and many others.

Thus, from his early childhood on, he was well acquainted with the art of carving. After graduating from the Urtij√´i Art School, he continued to improve his skills in his father's workshop. From 1964 to 1968 he studied at the Brera Academy in Milan with the well known professors Francesco Messina, Marino Marini and Alik Cavaliere. He graduated from the academy with first-class degrees in sculpture and art history. ==Early career== During his stay in Milan he met with many artists and being a regular visitor to their workshops he discovered his love for painting. From 1972 to 1974 Wilfried worked with an architect in Augsburg, Germany. Meanwhile he published a pocket book of satirical cartoons \\"Wirr Warr\\", for which he got a prize. Back in Italy, he started a ten-year-long career as art teacher at different schools in Urtij√´i and S√´lva. ==Art years== In 1984 he decided to settle down as a freelance artist. His oevre expresses his versatility and taste for experimenting with different techniques, like fresco painting on houses and church facades or enamel painting for the restoration of altars etc. In Germany he created huge altars in various styles (ranging from Gothic to modern art). From 1967 on, he exhibited his works in either individual or collective exhibitions and participated in competitions, where he won a number of awards. In his last years of life, previous to his fatal skiing accident, he worked at a frenetic pace on a multitude of projects in Italy and abroad. His works are to be seen in churches all over Europe.

It was one of three institutions founded by T E Ravenshaw, the other two being the Ravenshaw Girls' School and the Ravenshaw College, the latter now having become Ravenshaw University. ==History== Ravenshaw Collegiate School was founded in 1851 though there are some confusions regarding the exact date of establishment. It was founded in the then-largest city of Odisha, Cuttack. In the initial years of the school, the Ravenshaw Junior College also used to function from the same campus until Ravenshaw College (now Ravenshaw University) was established. A new building was constructed in 1905, and the school is still operating from this heritage building. This is also the first institution of Odisha at this much large scale ==Campus and building== The current building in which the school operates was established in the year 1905. Before 1905 the school operated from adjacent buildings of the Odisha Bar Council. In 2006 Government of Odisha sanctioned Rs. 4 Crores for the school development but later on it was scrapped due to some unknown reasons. The campus of the school is spread across 8 acres of land in the River Bank of Kathajodi. In the near vicinity of the school some high-profile offices like High Court of Odisha, District Collectorate of Cuttack, State Treasury of Odisha and Odisha Revenue Board are also present. The school has a playground inside its campuses and own another mini stadium known as Sunshine Fields a few kilometers away from the school. The school has two hostels with a combined capacity of 200 inmates. The school has also two auditoriums inside the campus. ==House system== The school has one section in Class IV and V. In Class VI and VII it has two sections each. From Class VIII onwards each class comprises three sections. Each section can have a maximum of 65 students. ==School activitiesSports=== The school has an on-campus playground of about 2 acres which is used for day-to-day activities of students. The school also has a dedicated stadium which is used for special sporting events. The school has a recognised state-level cricket team. Sports include football, badminton and indigenous games like khokho and kabbadi. ===Clubs and societies=== Clubs include a science club, computer club, cultural club and sports club.

Its goal is to lead the sector-wide approach to the UN on how we think the Australian Government is faring in its commitment to children. The Child Rights Taskforce is made up of advocates, service providers, individuals and experts all focused on achieving child rights in Australia. It meets regularly to discuss upcoming opportunities and events to promote and protect child rights in Australia. One of the main roles of the Taskforce is to hold the Australian government to account on its commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). == Members == The following organisations play a leadership role as the \\"steering committee\\" of the coalition: * Australian Youth Affairs Coalition * Human Rights Law Centre * King & Wood Mallesons * National Children‚Äôs and Youth Law Centre (NCYLC) * NATSILS * Save the Children Australia * SNAICC * UNICEF Australia == The \\"Listen To Children\\" Report == When Australia ratified the CRC in 1990, our government committed to making sure that every child in Australia has every right in the convention. This is monitored by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, a panel of independent experts who the Australian Government reports to every five years. The Australian Child Rights Taskforce is also given the opportunity to submit an independent report to ensure the UN is briefed on the whole story. In 2011, the Child Rights Taskforce published the Listen to Children Report, compiled following consultations with over 750 children and young people and over 100 organisations and subject matters. It found that while Australia is a wonderful place for most of its children, certain children are disadvantaged by the failure of governments. Despite Australia‚Äôs ratification of the CRC in 1990, Australia has yet to effectively incorporate human rights into policy and legislative framework to benefit children and there are unacceptable gaps in the legal protection of children‚Äôs rights. Three groups of children are especially disadvantaged by the failure of governments: ‚Ä¢ Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have child mortality rates of three times their non-aboriginal peers and are the least consulted in Australian policy; they Aboriginal children aged 10‚Äì17 are 24 times more likely to be jailed than non-Aboriginal children and Aboriginal children are almost 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care. ‚Ä¢ 428 children of asylum seekers remain in detention facilities in direct contravention to UN convention (At the time of publication, 1,048 children were in immigration detention) ‚Ä¢ The numbers of children in out-of-home-care has increased by 51.5 per cent since 2005, yet Australia collects no data on the reasons why children are placed in care; The Report also acknowledged that there has been some progress over the past five years. Positive developments include: commitment to the National Early Childhood Development Strategy, its implementation of a National Framework for Protecting Australia‚Äôs Children, the Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, and the commitment to Closing the Gap on Aboriginal health and education. A total of 84 organisations and individuals endorsed the Report in whole or in part. The Listen to Children report became the primary reference document to challenge the Australian government representatives when they came before the UN in June 2012. The Listen to Children report seeks to parallel the Australian Government's report on its implementation of the convention on the Rights of the Child. It writes about Australia's legal and administrative implementation of the convention, and on whether the implementation has been effective. A summary of its conclusions are as follows: === Legislation === The convention on the Rights of the Child creates international benchmarks for child rights. However, because the convention is not fully integrated into Australian law, there are no enforceable remedies for many child rights violations in Australia. Australia needs nationally consistent legislation based on the convention. === Coordination === Under our federal system, responsibility for many children‚Äôs rights, such as education, child protection and juvenile justice fall to the states. Because the UN Convention is not the underlying framework, state policies are inconsistent. For example, Queensland detains children over the age of 17 in adult facilities ‚Äì in contravention of international law. A National Plan of Action would have an important function to ensure states and territories meet international obligations. === Consultation === Mechanisms for involving children in decision-making in Australia are poor. From finding out what makes a good school, to understanding the special needs of indigenous, rural, or refugee children, or children with a disability or in out-of home care; Australia does not follow best practise for finding out and incorporating the views of children. Where legislation does require children to participate in the decisions made about them, there tends to be no evaluation of how effectively this is achieved. Australia needs to learn more from examples of best practise for children‚Äôs participation and implement these mechanisms across public policy. === Data and Monitoring === The catalogue of things Australia does not know about its children is surprisingly large. Australia does not know the different reasons why its children live in out-of-home-care, we do not know about the reasons for and occurrence of suicide or attempted suicide in children and young people. Australia doesn't have nationally consistent data on indigenous communities and children. In order to begin creating and implementing policies and systems that help children, we need more information on their health, wellbeing, experiences and opinions. == Reporting == The National Child Rights Taskforce, alongside the University of Technology, Sydney's Law Students' Society sent Janani Muhunthan as a \\"youth reporter,\\" amongst other Taskforce members, to Geneva to monitor the Australian Government's Child Rights review in front of the UN. ==United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child National Review of Australia in 2012== On 4‚Äì5 June 2012, the Australian Government came before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to respond to questions on its commitment to improving the fundamental rights and welfare of its children. ==External links== * National Child Rights Taskforce webpage * Listen to Children Report * Youth Reporter Blog == References == Category:Children's rights authorities ","title":"Child Rights Taskforce ‚Äì Australia"},{"id":"35910375","text":"Charaxes numenes, the lesser blue charaxes, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

It features Mieko Takamine, Shin Tokudaiji, Shinichi Himori, Bakudan Kozo, Shin Saburi, Takeshi Sakamoto, Hideko Kasuga, Munenobu Yuri, Yoshitaro Iijima, Tsumeo Osugi, and Shotaro Akagi. The movie follows Toku a blind masseur and a woman from Tokyo that he meets. ==Plot== The movie opens on Toku and his fellow blind masseur friend Fuku walking down a mountain path talking about how they take pride in how many people they pass on their walks even though they are blind. They are walking north to work in a village of inns. Once there they perform their jobs and Toku encounters a woman from Tokyo who had ridden in a carriage that passed them on the road. He recognizes her by her distinct Tokyo smell. The next few scenes are comedic encounters with other customers and in particularly with a boy and his uncle. This boy meets the lady from Tokyo and she meets his uncle who becomes smitten with her. This makes Toku sad. All the while there is a rash of thefts of guest's money while they take baths. Toku believes the woman is doing this and tries to have her escape, but finds out that she is not the one doing it. Instead all the reasons he thought it was her she explains as that she was a mistress of a man she didn't like and was on the run from him. The next day Toku finds her sitting in a carriage, they say nothing but a man with a police officer also enters the carriage. It is unsaid but assumed that the man is her patron and the carriage takes off as a saddened Toku watches.https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1038-eclipse- series-15-travels-with-hiroshi-shimizu ==Cast== * Mieko Takamine as Michiko Misawa * Shin Tokudaiji as Tokuichi * Shinichi Himori as Fukuinchi Misawa * Bakudan Kozo as Kenichi * Shin Saburi as Shintaro Omura * Ayuko Hirano as Hiking girl * Toru Hirose as Hiking student * Zentaro Iijima as Kamekichi * Akio Isono as Hiking student * Hideko Kasuga as Okiku * Toshiaki Konoe as Hiking student * Chieko Kyotani as Oaki (credited as Chieko Kyoya) * Fusako Maki as Hiking girl * Mitsuko Miura as Hiking girl ==Home media== The Criterion Collection released the film in the US on DVD in 2009 as part of the Eclipse Series 15: Travels with Hiroshi Shimizu.https://www.criterion.com/films/1088-the-masseurs-and-a-woman ==References * *Blakeslee, David, A Journey Through the Eclipse Series: Hiroshi Shimizu‚Äôs The Masseurs and a Woman, Criterioncast Category:1938 films Category:Films directed by Hiroshi Shimizu Category:Japanese-language films Category:Japanese films Category:Films about blind people Category:Films with screenplays by Hiroshi Shimizu Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese black-and-white films Category:1938 drama films ","title":"The Masseurs and a Woman"},{"id":"35910394","text":"Charaxes fuscus is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Iquitos is mentioned as a metonym of cinema in the Peruvian Amazon. The most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the Loreto Region is Antonio Wong Rengifo, also a pioneer of film art in Peru, with his most important work being Bajo el sol de Loreto. Alongside this, other filmmakers such as Werner Herzog, Armando Robles Godoy, Nora Izcue, Federico Garc√≠a, and Dorian Fernandez Moris prolonged the cinematic presence in the city. ==HistoryOrigins=== In the Iron House, the first film projection was presented with an Edison machine in 1900. Until around the 1880, Iquitos did not have a film set. Interest in film production grew alongside the film industry booming elsewhere in the world. There is not enough accurate visual record the exact birth of cinema in Iquitos. In 1890, following the rhythm of the European organization of the city, scientific technology began arriving. The first film made in 1900 was recorded. A movie was projected for the first time in the Iron House with an Edison machine, which reproduced the images using a carbide lamp and the constant movement of an operator. Before the fact, in 1898, Clement Alcala and Francisco de Paula Secada obtained land on the north side of the Plaza de Armas, and built a rustic-roof building, naming it Alhambra. They installed a tiny carousel brought from Manaus, Brazil. In 1902, with the rubber boom and its international impact, Edward Fuller purchased Alhambra. It hence became the first movie theater in town with Lumi√®re brand projectors. In the continuous city growth following the success of the rubber extraction, and its connection with Europe, the bourgeoisie grew in the city. Arnaldo Reategui traveled to France in 1905, and bought a projector with a large collection of movies--in black-and-white and technicolor--from cinema house Path√© Freres and L√©on Gaumont. He was affiliated with Luis Pinasco and built a cinema called Jard√≠n Strassburgo, located on the first block of Sargento Lores street. The first stage of Iquitos film concluded in 1914, with a prominent presence of French filmmakers. Georges M√©li√®s and Gaumont sent several films on celluloid for the aristocratic film billboard of Iquitos. The film making attracted audiences, and blockbusters were reaching ¬£4,500. ===Rubber crisis and the prominence of Antonio Wong=== Although the crisis hit Iquitos and had its effect on the industry, the arrival of new films did not stop. Films with a theatrical demeanor were gradually replaced by those more directed towards fiction. The filmmaking attracted new aspirations and acting talents, and the star system was present in the market. The distribution of Charlie Chaplin silent films were introduced by the Spanish businessman Jose Altimira. The most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the Loreto Region in general was , also a pioneer of film art in Peru. It is mainly known for shaping their ideologies, aspirations and other thoughts in his films. Wong Rengifo, in the course of his film making, followed the changing technology in the United States. In 1936, he premiered his film Bajo el sol de Loreto, a film which examines the main economic engine, and the valuation of the Peruvian Amazon (called \\"Selvak\\" in the film). He is thought to give an active representation of the amazonian culture in his films. Wong worked as a cameraman, developed his own films and edited them, and wrote his scripts inspired by Iquitos culture. ===Developments to date=== In October 1957, Wong started the production of a film, with Mexican actress Amalia Aguilar, to be shown at the First International Fair of Iquitos. Due to a fire, however, his film study was consumed by fire and never made it to cinemas. The same year, a group of filmmakers came from Hollywood, accompanied by Harma Lewis and Keith Larsen, to shoot 29 short films for the anthology Adventure in the Amazon, directed by Tom McGowan (a little-known, recherch√© filmmaker in database), and produced by Warner Bros. The series was eventually canceled due to transportation spending. By the 1960s, film was representing the beauty and calm of the jungle, and Iquitos was home to most regional and international filmmakers. In the 1970s, the cinema of Iquitos was influenced by Decree Law Number 19327, entitled \\"Law for the Promotion of Film Industry.\\" The decree facilitated the production of new films, and the presentation of the Amazon image. The film went on to a more complex film language with themes about the richness of the jungle, the imperialist power, mining and resource processing, and use of the natives as a portrait of tourism. During these years, there were notable films such as No Stars in the Jungle (1966) and The Green Wall (1969) by Armando Robles Godoy; Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) and Fitzcarraldo (1982) by Werner Herzog; The Ayahuasca Wind (1983) by Nora Izcue and The Partner of God (1986) by Federico Garcia. In 1990, Iquitos was gradually used as a stage for national and international soap operas; it was the backdrop for Anaconda (1997) by Luis Llosa; Captain Pantoja and the Special Services (2000) by Francisco Lombardi; The Motorcycle Diaries by Walter Salles and Daughters of Bel√©n (2004) by Javier Corcuera. In 2002, publicist Dorian Fernandez-Moris founded Audiovisual Films--founded as Audiovisual--and began with a team of twenty people. He began with short films like El otro lado, Runamula and 501, and subsequently made a series of workshops to increase interest in Iquitos cinephile. In 2006, he released Chullachaqui (based on an Amazon known legend), Immortal, and the film El √∫ltimo piso (18 February 2010). The latter was filmed at the tallest building in the city. In 2012, Audiovisual Films produced General Cemetery in Iquitos, and is scheduled for release in October 2012. == List of films == {  width=\\"100%\\" + \\"align=bottom\\"  ‚Ç™ - Filmed in Iquitos F - Filmed outside Iquitos T - Filmed in Iquitos and the Peruvian Amazon ! colspan=\\"2\\"Year ! style=\\"width:17%;\\"Title ! style=\\"width:16%;\\"Studio !

It opened in 1896 and was officially closed in 1996. It was managed by NHS Greater Glasgow. ==History== In January 1889 the City of Glasgow acquired the Gartloch Estate for the purpose of building a hospital. A foundation stone for the hospital, which was designed by Thomson and Sandilands, was laid in November 1892. It accepted its first patients in 1896 and was officially opened as the Gartloch District Asylum in June 1897. A nurses' home was completed in June 1900 and a tuberculosis sanatorium opened in December 1902. Bed capacity reached a peak of 830 in 1904. It served as an emergency hospital using hutted accommodation during the Second World War and joined the National Health Service in 1948. Robin Farquharson was an inmate at the hospital at the time he joined the Scottish Union of Mental Patients in the early 1970s. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1996. Many of the surrounding buildings were subsequently converted into homes or demolished to create Gartloch Village but the Category A listed administration building remains intact but derelict. ==In popular culture== In 1993, the hospital was used in the BBC television series Takin' Over the Asylum starring David Tennant and Ken Stott where its distinctive French Renaissance style architecture served as the exterior of the fictional St. Jude's Hospital. In 2005 a film Gartloch Hospital was released which gave an account of the history of the hospital. It was the winner in the Best Factual Film at the Scottish Mental Health Art and Film Festival, 2007. ==References * Gartloch page on Monklands Online has a rare image of hospital with steeples intact Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1896 Category:1896 establishments in Scotland Category:1996 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Listed hospital buildings in Scotland Category:Hospitals established in 1896 Category:Former psychiatric hospitals in Scotland Category:Category A listed buildings in Glasgow Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct hospitals in Scotland Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:NHS Scotland hospitals ","title":"Gartloch Hospital"},{"id":"35910760","text":"Olga Fyodorovna Barysheva-Korostelyova (; born 24 August 1954) is a Russian former basketball player who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics and in the 1980 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Russian women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of the Soviet Union Category:Basketball players at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for the Soviet Union Category:Olympic medalists in basketball Category:Soviet women's basketball players Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics ","title":"Olga Barysheva"},{"id":"35910766","text":"The Monastery of Sendomir (German: Das Kloster von Sendomir) is a 1919 German silent drama film directed by Rudolf Meinert and starring Ellen Richter, Ernst Deutsch and Eduard von Winterstein.

The main part of the film is told in a flashback by a monk to two visiting noblemen on their way to Warsaw in the 17th century. He tells them how a mighty count named Starschensky once ruled Sendomir (Sandomierz), but after an intrigue in which his wife was unfaithful with her own cousin he had to use all his resources to build the monastery where they are now staying.

The fight occurred despite Dereck Chisora having had his British boxing licensed removed by the British Boxing Board of Control in March 2012. David Haye won the fight by TKO in the 5th round. ==Mayhem in Munich== Dereck Chisora's previous fight laid the foundation for his clash with Haye. That bout, on 18 February 2012, ended in a unanimous decision defeat by Vitali Klitschko while challenging for the World Boxing Council (WBC) Heavyweight title in the Olympiahalle, Munich. The fight was overshadowed by controversy. Chisora slapped Klitschko in the face at the weigh-in on 17 February. Then, as he entered the ring on 18 February, Chisora spat water in the face of his opponent's brother Wladimir Klitschko, before being defeated on a unanimous decision. ===Haye and Chisora brawl=== David Haye was present in the crowd at the Klitschko vs Chisora post-fight press conference. During the conference, Haye began a verbal confrontation with both Vitali Klitschko and his manager Bernd Boente, challenging the WBC World Heavyweight champion to a fight. Boente claimed that Haye had already turned down the opportunity to fight Vitali Klitschko and that he would not get a second opportunity. Chisora then intervened, calling Haye an \\"embarrassment\\", to which Haye responded that Chisora had lost \\"three fights in a row\\". Haye continued his verbal assault. Chisora then left the stage to confront Haye face to face and, in front of the assembled media, the two British fighters and several bystanders became involved in a mass brawl. Haye threw punches at Chisora whilst holding a bottle in one hand, leading to Chisora to accuse Haye of glassing him. Chisora's trainer Don Charles was also involved in the brawl and Haye's long-time trainer Adam Booth received a cut to the forehead whilst trying to break things up; Booth would later accuse Chisora of striking him with a bottle during the confrontation, though the cause turned out to be a camera tripod that had been picked up and brandished by Haye at the end of the melee, whilst in the aftermath, Chisora was caught on video threatening to \\"shoot Haye\\". German authorities sought both Haye and Chisora following their involvement in the brawl. On 19 February, Dereck Chisora was arrested by German police at Munich Airport. Chisora was later released without charge. On 21 February, both boxers released formal statements about the incident. While Chisora \\"wholeheartedly\\" apologised for his involvement, Haye was less contrite, refusing to issue a direct apology for his involvement, claiming he had acted in self-defence. Subsequent to a hearing in March regarding the incident, Chisora had his British boxing license revoked, and the WBC initiated a motion to ban the British fighter indefinitely and fine him for his involvement. ==The fight is announced== The fight was announced on 8 May, from the Boleyn Ground in London. A steel fence was put in place to keep the two boxers separated during the announcement. It was announced that the two men would fight at heavyweight. It was also announced that Alexander Povetkin would defend his WBA (Regular) World Heavyweight Championship against Hasim Rahman on the undercard. The fight was announced as being promoted by BoxNation in association with Team Sauerland and would be held at the Boleyn Ground, one of the largest football stadia in London, capable of hosting 40,000 spectators. Tickets went on sale on the 9 May, with over 17,000 tickets being sold on the first day of sale. On 18 May, it was announced that the fight had been sanctioned by both the WBO and WBA, and licensed by the Luxembourg Boxing Federation. On 11 July, it was announced that the fight would be just a 10 rounder rather than the traditional 12 rounder, with the winner receiving approximately ¬£20,000 for charity from the loser. ==Reaction to the fight== Several fighters, boxing officials and organising bodies criticised the fight after it was announced. In particular, the WBC adopted a firm stance against the contest, threatening to revoke the licenses of anyone involved in the fight, including promoters, trainers, timekeepers, referees and undercard fighters. The fight also garnered plenty of support. Former British boxer Ricky Hatton said that the fighters were not breaking any rules and Dereck Chisora's manager Frank Warren stated that it was the \\"biggest fight of the year\\". ==The fight== In front of a packed Boleyn Ground, in which 30,000 spectators attended, Dereck Chisora was the first to enter the ring, hooded and masked, to the theme from Gladiator. David Haye delayed his entrance, not beginning his approach until after his entry music, \\"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\\", had begun. The fight started slowly, with both boxers moving cautiously, though it was Haye who took the attacking initiative first. The bout heated up at the end of the third round, when Chisora caught Haye with a fierce left hook after the bell had already gone, which appeared to shock Haye. Chisora emerged at the start of the fourth round with more confidence, aiming punches towards Haye's chin. Towards the end of the fifth round, Haye connected with a series of punches, knocking Chisora to the floor. At the eighth count, Chisora regained his feet, only for Haye to land further punches. Chisora was knocked down for a second time by a left hand from Haye, and though he regained his feet again, referee Luis Pabon stepped in and awarded the bout to Haye by TKO. ==References== Category:Boxing matches Category:2012 in boxing Category:Boxing in London Category:Sport in the London Borough of Newham Category:2012 sports events in London Category:July 2012 sports events in the United Kingdom ","title":"David Haye vs. Dereck Chisora"},{"id":"35910778","text":"Michael D.

An account, for instance, described a contest of valor at Sittakene for hypaspists where six pentakosiarch and three chiliarch were selected. In the Roman army, the equivalent of pentakosiarch was the primicerius, who led 512 men. ==Modern Greece== The rank was revived for the irregular forces of the Greek rebels during the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1829).

It is the district capital of the Aminuis electoral constituency. ==Economy and Infrastructure== Aminuis features a post office and police station. Many government ministries have dependencies in the settlement. The Catholic Church operates a parish, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Aminuis; it belongs to the Archdiocese of Windhoek. The Roman Catholic Church is the oldest church in Aminuis. Other churches include Oruuano Church, Zion Christian Church (ZCC), St Phellips, and a Born Again church. The village is riddled by poverty and joblessness. The main economic activity is subsistence farming with cattle, goats and sheep but frequent droughts make this difficult. The Tswana people used to mine salt from a nearby pan but went out of business after they could not meet the demand that it be iodised. ==Education== There are a number of schools in the Aminuis area: * Roman Catholic Mokaleng Combined School, a school founded by missionaries in 1902 * Rietquelle Junior Secondary School at Rietquelle, founded in 1935 as first government school for the indigenous population. Founder and at first sole teacher at the school was Otto Schimming.Otto Schimming: A self-made man (1908 to 2005) New Era, 22 October 2010 * Motsomi Primary School * Hosea Kutako Primary School, built in 1974 with a capacity of 900 learners *Dr. Fisher Primary School. ==History== The area around Aminuis was inhabited by San since at least the 18th century. In the 1880s Tswana people settled at Aminuis with the permission of Andreas Lambert of Leonardville, Kaptein of the Kai«Äkhauan (Khauas Nama). In 1902 the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a congregation of the Roman Catholic Church, founded a missionary station and a school. On 1 December 1905 at the height of the Herero and Namaqua War of 1904‚Äì1907, Imperial Germany Schutztruppe (\\"protection force\\", the unit deployed to the German colony) and fighters of the Red Nation clashed south-east of Aminuis in the Battle of «ÉGu- «Éoms. Manasse «ÉNoreseb, leader of the Red Nation and today regarded a hero of the struggle against colonisation in Namibia, died in this battle. The Herero and Namaqua War of 1904‚Äì1907 saw tens of thousands of Herero killed, almost its entire population.UN Whitaker Report on Genocide, 1985, paragraphs 14 to 24, pages 5 to 10 Prevent Genocide International Survivors had lost their land and cattle, and the land originally in the hands of the Herero was now farmland in the possession of white settlers. When after World War I Germany lost all its colonies and South-West Africa became mandate territory of South Africa, the new administration was unable, perhaps unwilling, to undo the land transfer. A South African administrator writes: > \\"Seeing that the whole Hereroland was confiscated by the Germans and cut up > into farms and is now settled by Europeans it would be an impossible project > ... to place them back on their tribal lands.\\" To accommodate the Ovaherero, the South African administration created eight \\"native reserves\\" for them of which the Aminuis Reserve was one. After the Aminuis Reserve was declared in the 1920s, landless Herero people migrated into the area and soon formed the vast majority of its inhabitants. The administrative structures of the reserves existed until the 1970s. Allocation of Land to bantustans according to the Odendaal Plan. Tswanaland is the rectangle in eastern central South-West Africa When the apartheid government of South Africa devised the Odendaal Plan in the 1960s, part of Aminuis was designated to belong to Tswanaland, a bantustan intended to be a self- governing homeland for the Tswana people. Unlike all other homelands, it was never implemented that way. The Ovaherero were allowed to stay in the area, and the Tswana remained a minority. Tswanaland nevertheless got an ethnic Tswana, Constance Kgosiemang, as political leader between 1980 and 1989. ==People== The area of Aminuis is inhabited by Ovambanderu and a Tswana minority counting approximately 500 people in 2005. Ovambanderu and Herero people share the same ancestry. Herero see the Mbanderu as one of their clans while Mbanderu regard themselves as a distinct group. This difference is the cause of a decades‚Äìold rift between the two, with one faction, the Ovambanderu Council of Epukiro and Aminuis seeking recognition of the Mbanderu as a distinct tribe. The other faction aims for a strong and united Herero people under the Tjamuaha-Maharero Royal House and accuses the Mbanderu of artificial division. Today the Ovambanderu Traditional Authority is the heir of the Ovambanderu Council. Their headquarters is situated at the small settlement of Omauozonjanda which belongs to Epukiro but is 40 km east of its centre. The royal homestead is located at Ezorongondo. After the death of Mbanderu paramount chief Munjuku Nguvauva II in 2008 the rift in the Ovambanderu community deepened. One faction calling themselves the \\"Concerned Group\\" supported Keharanjo Nguvauva as successor to the throne. They crowned him in 2008 because he was born in wedlock of Munjuku and his wife Aletta. The other faction of the Ovambanderu Traditional Authority favoured his older half- brother, Deputy Minister of Fisheries Kilus Nguvauva. A government enquiry commission confirmed Keharanjo as chief in 2009. ===Notable people from Aminuis=== * Constance Kgosiemang, leader of Tswanaland between 1980 and 1989 and member of Namibia's Constituent Assembly * Steve Mogotsi, politician, the first ethnic Tswana to serve in any Namibian cabinet * Kuaima Riruako (1935‚Äì2014), politician, paramount chief of the Herero and president of the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) * Hulda Shipanga, first black nurse in Namibia to be promoted to matron, the highest rank * Razundara Tjikuzu, former professional footballer who played for Werder Bremen and various other clubs in Bundesliga * Ebson Uanguta, deputy governor of the Bank of Namibia ==References== Category:Populated places in the Omaheke Region ","title":"Aminuis"},{"id":"35910902","text":"Tone Hulb√¶kmo (born 27 September 1957) is a Norwegian singer and musician, married to the traditional folk flutist Hans Fredrik Jacobsen, and the mother of Jazz drummer and vibraphonist Hans Hulb√¶kmo (b. 1989) and pianist Alf Hulb√¶kmo (b. 17 March 1992). ==Discography== *1983: K√•mm√• No *1985: Kalenda Maya *1986: Svevende Jord *1988: Langt Nord I Skogen *1989: Norske Middelalderballader *1995: Konkylie *1997: Pilgrimsreiser (Kalenda Maya) *1999: Kyrja *2012: Nordic Woman (Grappa Music) *2016: Stifinner (Heilo Records). ==Awards== *1984: Spellemannprisen 1983 in Folk album category for album K√•mm√• no .. *1989: Spellemannprisen 1988 in Music for children category for albumet Langt nord i skogen together with Hans Fredrik Jacobsen *2004: Skj√¶raasenprisen, together with Hans Fredrik Jacobsen *2006: Gammleng Award in folk music category. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Norwegian female singers Category:Heilo Music artists Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Tolga, Norway ","title":"Tone Hulb√¶kmo"},{"id":"35910904","text":"Orquesta Francini-Pontier was an Orquesta t√≠pica formed in 1945 in Argentina by the violinist Enrique Mario Francini and the bandoneonist Armando Pontier.

He played minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire from 1929 to 1939, making a total of 48 appearances for the county, the last of which came against Cambridgeshire at Wardown Park, Luton. In 1931, he was selected to represent a combined Minor Counties cricket team in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders at the Rose Brothers Ground, Gainsborough. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Minor Counties made 191 all out, with Ward the last man out, dismissed for 4 by Cyril Allcott.

He was a great-nephew of Simon I, a bishop of Paderborn. In 1302 he was defeated in a territorial dispute against the bishops of M√ºnster, Osnabr√ºck and Paderborn, the Count of Counts of Ravensberg and the City of Herford. He was forced to raze Enger Castle, which he owned. The dispute was triggered by complaints about raids against Osnabr√ºck, allegedly originating from this castle. Louis of Ravensberg, who was the Bishop of Osnabr√ºck, created an alliance with his brother, Count Otto III of Ravensberg, the Bishops of M√ºnster and Paderborn and the City of Herford. Alliance troops laid siege to Simon I's castle in 1302, took the castle, captured Simon I and held him in the Bucksturm tower in Osnabr√ºck.

It is currently Alfa Romeo's best-selling model, with roughly 43,000 sold in 2018. The Stelvio uses FCA's Giorgio platform, shared with the mid-size Giulia saloon. The name Stelvio derives from the Stelvio Pass, Italy's highest mountain pass, noted for its 48 circuitous switchbacks. ==History and development== Stelvio Q Racing Edition Stelvio Q Racing Edition Preceded by Alfa Romeo's first off roader, the Matta, in the 1950s and the Kamal concept car in March 2003, the Stelvio is Alfa Romeo's first production SUV, using a modified version of the Giorgio platform, shared with the Giulia, and available in both rear and all-wheel drive configurations. The high- performance trim of the Stelvio, the Quadrifoglio, was unveiled on 16 November 2016 at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The European versions of the Stelvio were presented at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2017. The car's engine lineup is similar to that of the Giulia's, with a turbocharged 2.0 litre inline-four and a 2.2 litre diesel inline four. The Quadrifoglio trim level offers a 2.9 litre F154 twin-turbo V6 rated at , developed for Alfa Romeo by Ferrari. On January 18, 2017, Alfa Romeo began accepting orders for the Stelvio First Edition in the EMEA region. On November 2, 2017, the Stelvio Quadrifoglio went on sale in Italy. For the 2019 model year, diesel engines of the Stelvio were updated to meet the Euro 6d emissions standards, with AdBlue technology introduced to tackle particulates in the exhaust. Both the and versions got more from this change. In addition, Alfa Romeo introduced a new trim level for Europe: the Ti (Turismo Internazionale). Slightly different than the similarly-named Stelvio Ti on sale in the United States, the Euro-spec Ti is fitted with the TBI-M 2.0-litre inline-four, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, with power sent to all four wheels through Alfa Romeo's Q4 all wheel drive system.2019 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti Euro Spec  Top Speed, accessed 3 March 2019 All models feature an 8.8 inch infotainment system with Apple Car Play and Android Auto as standard, while small tweaks have been made throughout the ranges. In Europe, consumption standards use the WLTP measuring system, which increases accuracy for consumption and emission figures. == Chassis, mechanics and suspensions == The Stelvio uses the same Giorgio platform already used by the Giulia, but slightly modified and raised by . The Stelvio has also the same engines and most of the mechanics, including a carbon fiber driveshaft. In addition, its track width has increased by in the rear and in the front. It has a boot capacity of . It has a 50/50 weight distribution and a drag coefficient of 0.32 (Cd).2018_AR_Stelvio_Specifications.pdf: 2018_AR_Stelvio_SP - 2018_AR_Stelvio_Specifications.pdf, accessed 10 November 2018 To help keep the Stelvio's weight in check, Alfa Romeo uses aluminum for body parts, such as the fenders, hood, and tailgate, as well as for mechanical parts such as the suspension, brakes, and engine. The suspension, called AlfaLink, implements double wishbones in the front, and an aluminum multi-link configuration in the rear. The springs are longer than those in the Giulia, but stiffer to account for the extra weight and ride height. The driver sits higher from the road than in the Giulia. Rear-wheel drive as standard, the Stelvio can be optioned with Alfa Romeo \\"Q4\\" all wheel drive system, which can send up to 50% of power to the front in low-grip conditions. The Stelvio weighs with all fluids, less than an equivalent BMW X3 and less than a four cylinder Porsche Macan. ==Models== In North America, the Stelvio is available in seven different trim levels: Stelvio, Stelvio Sport, Stelvio Ti (for Turismo internazionale; this trim has four levels: Ti, Ti Lusso, Ti Sport, and Ti Sport Carbon), and the top-of-the-line Quadrifoglio. At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, a limited edition (only 108 examples) NRING trim of the Stelvio (N√ºrburgring-inspired special edition) was unveiled. === Quadrifoglio NRING Edition === The NRING edition has carbon-ceramic brakes, Sparco seats, carbon- fiber interior trim, and a Mopar-branded gear shifter and floor mats. The cars are differentiated on the exterior by NRING badges as well as carbon-fiber mirror caps and side skirts. Equipment is upgraded to include adaptive cruise control, and a premium sound system. === Nero Edizione === In April 2018, NYIAS unveiled a Nero Edizione Package for the Stelvio. This edition grants a new exterior appearance through special blacked out wheels, badging, and other touches. The Nero Edizione package is available only for the 280 horsepower, 2.0 litre model. === Quadrifoglio Racing Edition === At the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show, Alfa Romeo Racing limited edition was introduced, which celebrate Alfa Romeo's legendary racing history and the entry of a new Italian driver onto the Formula 1 scene: Antonio Giovinazzi joins the \\"Alfa Romeo Racing\\" team with World Champion Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen. This special edition has exclusive paintwork, as a tribute to the Alfa Romeo Racing C38 Formula 1 car.

The retuned engine now produces . ==Safety== The Stelvio was crash tested in July 2017 by Euro NCAP. Overall, the Stelvio achieved five star results. For adult protection, the Stelvio did \\"exceptionally well\\" , with its near perfect 97% matching that of the Volvo XC90 (all tests are not comparable because Euro NCAP updated its protocols in 2017). The Stelvio is also fitted with an autonomous emergency braking system (AEB) as standard. == Facelift (2020) == Alfa Romeo introduced the newly updated Stelvio in China, with both the Giulia and the Stelvio featuring updated interiors, a new 8.8 inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, which now offers a WiFi hotspot, over the air software upgrades, integrated emergency call function, and call assistant function.

J. Surya, making his comeback as a director after a 10-year hiatus since 2005. The film stars himself in the lead role with debutant Sulagna and Sathyaraj. The story is about the tiff between Vetriselvan (Sathyaraj) and A. K. Shiva (Surya), the two music composers in the film industry. The film marked the debut of S. J. Surya, as a music director, with cinematography handled by Soundararajan and editing by K. M. Riyas.

A. K. Shiva (S. J. Surya), who works as an assistant under Vetriselvan, gets an opportunity to compose music for a small-time film. When Shiva introduces new techniques and pioneers the use of synthesizers, his music gets the attention of all music lovers. Due to the freshness and modernity that his music possesses, he becomes the most sought after musician and overtakes Vetriselvan. Shiva becomes the number one musician and builds his own studio. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Jenny (Sulagna Panigrahi) and marries her. When it seems everything he touches turns to gold, Vetriselvan displays his true psychopathic form. Vetriselvan decides to pull down Shiva by any means. Vetriselvan wants to disturb Shiva's peace of mind so that he could not concentrate on music. Vetriselvan enters into a deal with Shiva's car driver, manager, cook, and studio front office staff to get their help in bringing down Shiva. One day, Shiva's car driver parks the car amidst peak traffic and suddenly runs away, which confuses Shiva. He gets disturbed by the continuous honking sound. Shiva's manager also confuses him by giving some fake incidents which did not happen. Jenny gets conceived but gets aborted as Shiva's cook mixes some medicine in her food. Shiva is worried because of Jenny's miscarriage and cries aloud. He thinks that he is mentally disordered and goes to a mental hospital. Shiva's strange behavior gets the attention of media, and his image is tarnished amid public. Vetriselvan feels happy seeing this and in the meantime, film directors start approaching him again. Vetriselvan thinks that his lost glory is recovered now. Finally, it is revealed that Jenny is none other than Vetriselvan's daughter who was sent by him so that he can accomplish his plan. Knowing this, Shiva gets furious and comes to kill Jenny. But she reveals that she has really fallen in love with Shiva for his kindness and she is conceived again now. Vetriselvan comes there and persuades to kill Jenny knowing that she really loves Shiva. In the meantime, Vetriselvan stabs Shiva with a knife. Suddenly, S. J. Suryah wakes up, and it is revealed that the entire story was his dream. Madhu (Nila) (from Anbe Aaruyire) is his wife, and she says that fans are eagerly awaiting for a S. J.

He was a political activist, who, at election times, turned his poetical abilities to writing election songs, etc. to aid the candidates of his choice. The initial information seemed to point to him having been a shoemaker by profession, but a letter printed in the Gazette stated that this was untrue (see family and business details). At one time he lived in the Groat Market, Newcastle. He was very popular as a singer and songwriter, and had started his own company, but this failed. So in c1823 he sailed for London. In 1826 he wrote to his brother Nathaniel informing him that he had also sent a parcel of manuscripts and asking Nathanial to arrange to have them printed. He adds that several of the songs have been well received when he had sung them in the capital. There is no evidence of these being published as a song book of his own compositions, but some of his songs appeared in composite collections of mixed songwriters. His \\"Newcastle Races\\" appeared in John Marshall's \\"A Collection of Songs, Comic, Satirical, and Descriptive\\" of 1827, the remainder in Fordyce's Newcastle Song Book, or, Tyne-side Songster\\" of 1842. == Family and business details == An item appeared in the Evening Chronicle in 1885 in which the words to the song \\"Dance to thy Daddy\\" appeared together with a brief details of William Watson, including the fact that he had been a shoemaker. In response, the newspaper received, and printed a letter dated 23 November 1885, from a Mr John Brown, a previous works colleague of Watson, clearing up a few points. These included: He was not a shoemaker, but a fellow-painter and decorator working for John Richardson, painter, of 29 St. Nicholas' Churchyard, Newcastle.

The work was commissioned by J. Irwin Miller, his wife Xenia Miller, and E. Celementine Tangeman (Miller's sister) in late 1971 for The Commons, an enclosed public space designed by Cesar Pelli. The artwork is often simply called Chaos and is occasionally referred to as Chaos No.1. ==Description== Chaos I as it is today Chaos I stands 30 feet tall, weighs 3 tons, and originally had 12 motors that operated 13 individual functions. Tinguely designed the artwork to have a ‚ÄúJekyll and Hyde‚Äù personality so visitors can experience it being peaceful, sometimes with only a few functions working and other times with all of them working and it being noisy and loud. Chaos I was fabricated from new and scrap material purchased in or from Columbus: scrap metal was acquired from Kroot Corporation, the large bearing used on the base was purchased from Southern Machine, Inc, many of the spinning metal shapes were created by Noblitt Fabricating, and the original 12 motors were provided by Daniel-Hayden Electric Co. ==Historical information== Jean Tinguely's Heureka The architect for the original building, Cesar Pelli, wanted to have a sculpture in the center of The Commons by Tinguely and with the generosity of two Columbus families, the Millers and Tangemans, this idea became a reality. Pelli envisioned an artwork that would be a meeting place that drew visitors to surprises. Tinguely, who had recently completed a similar sculpture Heureka in Zurich, Switzerland was Pelli's first and only choice. The sculpture was made in Columbus, Indiana from 1973 to 1974 by Tinguely and his assistant, Josef Imhof, who constructed the artwork in what was then the Southern Machine Company's shop, the former Columbus Pump House building located on Second and Lindsey Streets. Many from Columbus helped provide materials and expertise needed to fabricate, transport, and then install the artwork in its present location, where it has always remained. The Commons was rebuilt in 2011 by Koetter Kim & Associates, but the sculpture remained in place during the building process; it was switched back on June 4, 2011. ==See also== * List of public art in Bartholomew County, Indiana *List of public art in Indiana ==References== Category:Jean Tinguely Category:Columbus, Indiana Category:Kinetic art Category:Art in Indiana Category:Tourist attractions in Bartholomew County, Indiana Category:Public art in Columbus, Indiana Category:Kinetic sculptures in the United States ","title":"Chaos I"},{"id":"35911263","text":"Military History Matters is a bi-monthly military history magazine, published by Current Publishing.

As of 2018, the firm employs approximately 135,000 people in China and overseas with 200 subsidiaries and over 60 overseas branches. Midea Group is listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange since 2013. It has been listed on the Fortune Global 500 since July 2016. Midea produces lighting, water appliances, floor care, small kitchen appliances, laundry, large cooking appliances, and refrigeration appliances. It also has a long history in producing home and commercial products in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). In the summer of 2016, Midea made a highly publicized move to acquire German robotics company KUKA. It is the world's largest producer of robots and appliances. ==History== Starting with only CN¬•5,000 to open a workshop for the production of bottle lids in Beijiao, Shunde in 1968, He Xiangjian (), the founder of the company, has since turned Midea into one of the most successful private companies in China, with sales revenue for the entire Group declared at US$ 22.2 billion for 2011 financial year, as well as listed on the main board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. After its initial period of manufacturing bottle lids and car parts, the company focused on the manufacture of fully finished goods; specifically, electric fans beginning in 1980. Five years later, Midea produced its first air conditioner, a product which remains the core component of Midea's business today. Over the following 15 years though, the company gradually expanded into a wide variety of other electrical home appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, and microwave ovens. In 1993, the subsidiary which handled the core businesses of the company, known as \\"Guangdong Midea Electric\\", proceeded with a public offering of shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The Guangdong Midea Electric's parent company, known today as \\"Midea Group\\", remained a privately held company at that time. Midea opened its first overseas production facilities in 2007, in the Vietnam Industrial Park outside of Ho Chi Minh City. This would mark the beginning of a period of international expansion for the company. In the very next year, Midea formed a manufacturing joint venture with Belarusian microwave producer Horizont (rus.), in order to break into the various CIS markets. 2010 would see the first of several overseas joint ventures between Midea and American air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier Corporation. Their first joint venture is based in Cairo, Egypt, under the name of Miraco Carrier. The next year, Midea and Carrier continued on this course, forming a collection of closely networked joint venture companies in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, and another one separately in India. In August 2012, the board of Midea Group announced that the company's founder, He Xiangjian, had informed them of his resignation as Chairman of Midea Group. Subsequently, Guangdong Midea Electric Chairman and President Paul Fang was named as the new Chairman of Midea Group. A restructuring plan of the company structure was announced in April 2013. In September 2013, the whole entity was publicly listed in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as Midea Group. At the same time, Guangdong Midea Electric was privatized by Midea Group. At the end of 2014, the Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi invested CN¬•1.2 billion by acquiring 1.2% shares of Midea Group. A cooperation between the two companies was also announced at the same time. In 2016, Midea made three major acquisitions, the first of which was Toshiba's home appliances business for US$ 477 million, followed by the even larger purchase of KUKA, the German robotics company. Lastly, acquiring Eureka, the brand that specializes in floorcare, from Electrolux AB in December. ==Products== VRF air conditioner Midea's main business is producing home appliances and commercial air conditioners. It sells products domestically under its own name, while the majority of its export business is as an OEM and ODM for many well-known global brands. In recent years, Midea has begun launching its own brand in a growing number of foreign markets, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, India, Egypt, and most countries in southeast Asia. The company's main product category is air conditioners, both residential and commercial. It manufactures other major home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, and dishwashers. Midea also offers a wide range of smaller appliances, such as microwave ovens, kettles, water dispensers, and vacuum cleaners. Midea annually wins 40+ design awards across a variety of reputable global design shows such as Red Dot, iF and other design competitions. Beyond Midea's eponymous brand name, the company also employs a series of other brands. The Little Swan brand was adopted when Midea acquired the Little Swan company in 2008. Little Swan products are mostly laundry and refrigeration appliances. Hualing is a brand used by Midea for air conditioners and refrigerators, and was also adopted in 2008. MDV is one of the brands used by Midea for its line of commercial air conditioners, active since 1999. The Pelonis brand is used for heaters. ==Projects== During the last decade, Midea has landed several increasingly high-profile projects, peaking with the most recent wins to install large-scale HVAC solutions in all the 12 stadiums for the Olympic games in Brazil in 2016, as well as 9 of 12 stadiums for the World Cup in Brazil in 2014. ==Research and development== Courtyard of Midea's Research and Development Institute Recently, Midea has maintained a policy of scaling R&D; by consistently reinvesting 4% of company-wide revenues back into research and development efforts. In terms of intellectual property, Midea has been pursuing registration of its achievements in innovation more recently than before: the number of patent and utility applications made by Midea between 2000 and 2004 grew from 2 to more than 40. ==References * Category:Companies listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Category:Companies in the CSI 100 Index Category:Civilian-run enterprises of China Category:Shunde District Category:Companies based in Foshan Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1968 Category:Electronics companies of China Category:Home appliance manufacturers of China Category:Home appliance brands Category:Chinese brands Category:Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning companies Category:Chinese companies established in 1968 Category:Multinational companies headquartered in China ","title":"Midea Group"},{"id":"35911396","text":"The Forecourt of the Temple of Edfu Finsterm√ºnz Pass in the Tyrol, 1830 Borsig Ironworks, Berlin, 1847 Karl Eduard Biermann (1803‚Äì92) was a German landscape painter. ==Biography== He was born in Berlin.

The station has also previously run sheep on its pastures. Covering an area of , the station is situated in a BTV quarantine area and runs a herd of Brahman cattle most of which are exported to Indonesia. The station consists mostly of open plains that are well covered in Mitchell, Bundle-bundle and other grasses. The plains are interspersed with broken hilly country studded with saltbush. The homestead and outbuildings are situated on a level plain overlooking the George River from the eastern bank. King's Pyramid, the hill from which the station takes its name, is located to the south. The station was initially established in 1865 by Alexander Robert Richardson, his elder brother John Elliott Richardson and their cousin A.E. Anderson. The Richardsons were among the seven shareholders in the Portland Squatting Company. The group left Victoria aboard the Maria Ross along with 1600 ewes and set up the station along the George River then peacock runs out along other watercourses. In 1869 the group divided their flock with the Richardsons and Jack Edgar controlling 4500 sheep at Pyramid and buying out the other partners from 1869-1872. Another previous owner of the station was Eva Broadhurst who was much admired by the explorer Frank Hann, who named several geographical features after her. Her grave is situated not far from the station homestead. Her husband H.T Broadhurst had arrived at Pyramid in 1893 and the couple lived there until Eva died at 38 years of age in 1909. The station suffered damages to the cost of ¬£300 following a storm and resulting floods in 1894. The Broadhurst family then sold the station in 1910, J. G. Meares sold his share of the nearby Sherlock Station in 1910 to Samuel Peter Mackay and bought Pyramid Station. Meares paid ¬£28,000 for the station, which was considered good value at the time. The station encompassed an area of and supported 20,000 sheep, 400 cattle and 200 horses. The manager of the station att he time was Mr Crofton who later went on to manage Balfour Downs Station. In 1911, MacKay unsuccessfully bid ¬£25,000 for the Croydon Station which adjoins Pyramid. Meares expanded his land-holding when he purchased Woodbrook and Andover Stations for ¬£32,000 in 1912. Woodbrook adjoins Pyramid in 1912, Meares purchase included all the stock for both properties. 1914 was a dry year with the district receiving little rain, but 33,000 sheep were shorn that year under the supervision of the Meares family who still owned the station. In 1915 Meares received 34 stud rams which arrived from interstate aboard the SS Charon on its last sea voyage. The station was owned a pharmacist named Peter Cook in 2012. Cook also owned four other stations in the Pilbara. The station was managed by Glenn Connell and sold about 500 head of cattle per year which are shipped out via Port Hedland. Pyramid is operating under the Crown Lease number CL927-1965 and has the Land Act number LA3114/492.

According to the bill, BRAI will have a Chairperson, two full-time members and two part-time members; all will be required to have expertise in life sciences and biotechnology in agriculture, health care, environment and general biology. The bill also proposes setting up an inter-ministerial governing body, to oversee the performance of BRAI, and a National Biotechnology Advisory Council of stakeholders to provide feedback on the use of biotechnology products and organisms in the society. The regulatory body will be an autonomous and statutory agency to regulate the research, transport, import, and manufacture biotechnology products and organisms. ==Criticism== Suman Sahai, founder of the Gene Campaign, has called the bill flawed. According to her, the bill is proposing new institutes without clearly defining their powers and responsibilities. She has also stated that the bill was introduced without consulting the people who will be affected by the bill. P. M. Bhargava, founder of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, has also opposed the bill. He has called the bill unconstitutional, as agricultural policy is the domain of state governments. He pointed out that the bill proposes formation of several subdivisions and has argued that they will consist of bureaucrats with no scientific knowledge. He has accused the Department of Biotechnology, which will be involved in selection of members, as a promoter of genetic technology in India. He has pointed out that the broadly defined term \\"confidential commercial information\\" has been kept outside the purview of the Right to Information Act. He had stated that the bill uses vague wordings which would criminalize sequencing or isolation of DNA and PCR techniques, requiring approval for each usage. Thus, hindering research and education. He pointed out the bill has no provision for mandatory labelling of GM foods. He criticized giving the body power to punish parties making false or misleading statements about GM crops, calling it unprecedented. In September 2010, Jairam Ramesh, then Environment Minister, pointed out that the body is only deals with safety and efficacy of biotechnology products. The issue of commercialization has been left unaddressed. The decisions regarding commercialization can fall under the purview of Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, or Department of Science and Technology. On the other hand, Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises (ABLE) has supported the bill. J.S. Rehman, an entomologist and a former member of the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation, has stated that most protesters associate genetic engineering with Monsanto, as a result development of Indian biotech is being hindered. ==See also== * Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms * Bt brinjal * Genetically modified food controversies * BT cotton * Anti GM v/s Pro GM * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Proposed laws of India Category:Biotechnology in India Category:Regulators of biotechnology products Category:Life sciences industry Category:Regulatory agencies of India ","title":"Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India"},{"id":"35911449","text":"A Fear of Strangers is a 1964 British TV drama starring Stanley Baker who portrays a racist police inspector who attempts to coerce a black suspect into confessing to a murder he did not commit.A Fear of Strangers from IMDb Although written in 1958 it was banned for six years.A Fear of Strangers at BFI Screenonline The program was produced by Associated Television (ATV) a British-based television broadcasting company. ==References * Category:British films Category:British television films Category:1964 films Category:1964 drama films Category:British drama films ","title":"A Fear of Strangers"},{"id":"35911459","text":"Shudokan Aikido is a school that teaches Yoshinkan Aikido. Established by Thamby Rajah in Seremban, Malaysia, during the early 1950s.Ben Sheard and Joe Thambu, \\"Joe Thambu Wiki Page Notes\\", Thambu Notes, date Whilst in Japan Thamby Rajah trained with Shioda Gozo and returned to Malaysia as the first Malaysian shodan black belt in Judo and in AikidoMalaysian Book of Records, 2007 - Thamby Rajah was awarded records for Malaysia's first Aikido School, being Malaysia's first blackbelt in Judo, and being Malaysia's oldest & longest practising Aikido teacher The words \\"Shudokan Aikido\\" have sometimes been misconstrued as a separate style to Yoshinkan Aikido. Some online sources suggested incorrectly it is a derivation from Aikido and Karate (perhaps due to the similarity in name between Shudokan and Shotokan). However, video and anecdotal sources suggest that Thamby Rajah has always taught a natural derivation of the techniques he learned at Yoshinkan Hombu Dojo (circa 1959). Thamby Rajah's technique is also influenced by extensive experience in Judo at the Kodokan, and his earlier Jujutsu training under Walter De Silva in Malaysia during the post war years. Thamby Rajah's Aikido is fundamentally the same as Yoshinkan Aikido, but is more reflective of the early days of Shioda Gozo's Aikido. ==Etymology== The name of Shudokan was given to Thamby Rajah by Shioda Gozo (please confirm in the Thamby Rajah article the name is given by Mifune). The word \\"Shudokan\\" is formed of three kanji: * ‚ÄìShu ‚Äì Study, learn * ‚Äì d≈ç ‚Äì Way, path * ‚Äìkan ‚Äì House, place Therefore, from a purely linguistic point of view, shudokan is the 'place to learn the way' (of the Yoshinkan). ==Style== Shudokan Aikido is the Yoshinkan style of Aikido. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the \\"soft\\" version when compared to the \\"hard\\" Yoshinkan. It is a dynamic and combat-effective system of throwing, joint- locks, strikes and pinning techniques. It emphasizes practical efficiency and is the style used to train women and anti-riot teams of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. There are no tournaments and it is not classed as a sport. ==Lineage== The Aikido Shudokan has a clear lineage to traditional Aikido. Ueshiba Morihei a student of Takeda Sokaku was the founder of Aikido a form of budo. Shioda Gozo was a prominent student of Ueshiba. After the lifting of the ban of martial arts in the mid-1950s Shioda became the first person to demonstrate aikido to the general public at the very first post war demonstration of budo, attended by around 15,000 people, Shioda won the award for the most outstanding demonstration among almost 150 others, it was soon after this Shioda established the Yoshinkan. In 1961 Shioda became the first person to be awarded a 9th dan rank by Ueshiba. In the mid-1950s a young Malaysian, Thamby Rajah moved to Japan to learn the art of Judo having already trained in gymnastics and some Ju-Jitsu. He trained for a year at the kodokan with world- renowned teachers Haruyoshi Ichijima and Kyuzo Mifune becoming the first Malaysian to attain the rank of Shodan in Judo. Before his year was up Thamby Rajah chanced upon some senior Judo students practising unfamiliar techniques, and upon asking where they learnt such techniques they revealed they were studying Aikido under Shioda of the Yoshinkan. Prior to his departure Thamby Rajah visited the Yoshinkan himself and decided he would soon return to study this art. In the late 1950s Thamby Rajah returned to Japan and under Shioda attained Shodan in Yoshinkan Aikido. Thamby Rajah returned to Malaysia, as the first Malaysian with a shodan in both Aikido and Judo, he set up his first school under the name of Shudokan, the name given to him by Shioda, the first aikido dojo in Malaysia and one of the first Yoshinkan Dojo outside Japan.History of the Shudokan DVD (2005), Aikido Shudokan, ==Shudokan in Australia== At the age of 11 Joe Thambu began his training at the Shudokan, the dojo of his uncle Thamby Rajah and at the age of 18 he received his shodan black belt. Thambu established his full-time dojo Aikido Shudokan in Australia in 1980 and since 2018 is the chief instructor (Shuseki Shihan) of the Aikido Shudokan International organization. He spends his time teaching at the Aikido Shudokan in Melbourne, but also at dojos affiliated with the ASI in places such as the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia, Canada and Poland.History of Aikido in Australia Encyclopedia of Aikido, Stanley Pranin (online) ==Shudokan in the UK== Eddie Stratton had a long history in the martial arts. Having trained and taught in numerous countries around the world, teaching martial artists, police and military personnel. At 19 he found himself in Malaysia where he met Thamby Rajah. After watching Thamby Rajah, he thought that as a boxer he could easily overcome him. He was amazed at how this slight man handled and controlled him. At this point he began taking instruction in aikido directly from Thamby Rajah and on his return from Malaysia, he introduced Yoshinkan aikido for the first time to Great Britain in the early 1960s. He travelled to Japan and trained under Shioda Gozo who later came to England and stayed with Stratton. In 1998, after one of Thamby Rajah's visits to the UK, Stratton received his 9th Dan in aikido. He died on 9 March 2000 after a long fight against cancer. With the passing of Stratton the responsibility of the Shudokan moved to his prodigy Ken Robson who set his base up in Nottingham and operates his full-time dojo from there. Until 2015 Phil Musson's (a fourth dan student of Ken Robson) dojo, The Eagle Dojo, hosted the annual Shudokan event \\"Summer School\\" where Joe Thambu, Robert Mustard and Ken Robson taught a 4 day long seminar including dan gradings.

However, his happiness is short-lived as he soon realizes that he now has two fathers-in- law. Life becomes miserable for Gautam with both his fathers-in-law enforcing their influence and their crazy ideas to his everyday life. Gautam laments that one can afford to have two living wives, but not two living fathers-in- law. To make matters worse, Gautam's first wife returns as a spirit. With the constant appearance of the first wife's spirit, visible only to Gautam, events take a more uproarious turn. A series of mind-boggling comic interludes develop and utter confusion reins amidst the family members. ==Cast== *Venu Arvind as Gautham * Nagesh Krishnamoorthi as Chandrababu, Gautham's father * Revathi Sankaran as Mohana, Gautham's mother *Ramji as Akash (Gautham's friend) *Bharathi as Sapna, Akash's wife *Indhu as Arundhati, Gautham's first wife *Delhi Kumar as Sundaram, Arundhathi's father *Sriranjini as Rathi, Gautham's second wife *Jaiganesh as VPS, Rathi's father *Bombay Gnanam as Rathi's grandma *Bhargavii Mani as Ramani, Gautham's sister *Master Rahul as Rajini raja, Gautham's younger brother * Kuyili as Mathangi, Mohana's cousin * K.

She received primary education in different cities of Turkey, since her father Osman Nuri Tekeli was working as a governor in various provinces. She is a graduate of American Girls' High School of Uskudar. She obtained a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy at Ankara University. She was attracted to the history of science during her undergraduate studies under the influence of Aydin Sayili. ==Academic career== Sevim Tekeli began her career as a research assistant of Prof. Dr. Aydƒ±n Sayƒ±lƒ± at the Department of Philosophy in Ankara University in 1952. ==Works== Sevim Tekeli's works mainly focus on the history of Ottoman astronomy, particularly on the works of the famous astronomer Taqi al Din. When Professor Tekeli started her doctoral studies, it was very hard to find any scientific study and materials in Turkey concerning the history of Ottoman science. She determined to overcome such problems. Eventually, Tekeli overcame all these challenges and completed her doctoral thesis, \\"The comparison of the observational instruments of Nasir al Din al T√ªs√Æ, Tycho Brahe and Taqi al Din\\", under the supervision of Aydƒ±n Sayƒ±lƒ± in 1956. Her doctoral thesis in which she made comparisons between Nasir al Din al T√ªs√Æ, Tycho Brahe and Taqi al Din in terms of observational instruments they had used was later published with the same title. She was also interested in the development of scientific endeavour in the 17th century Western Europe and also, in comparing the developments in Russia at the time and in the Ottoman Empire in terms of scientific activities and achievements. She also examined the effects of the Ottoman Empire on Renaissance. She particularly analyzed the reasons behind the superiority and leadership of the Ottoman Empire in the Islamic World at the beginning of the 17th century. She continued her research on Taqi al Din and published another book, The Brightest Stars of Construction of the Mechanical Clocks that was based on her professorial thesis. In this book, she revealed that Taqi al Din was one of the most important astronomers of the 16th century. She has also studies concerning the map of Piri Reis and Muhyi al Din. She was one of the earliest Turkish scholars uncovering the astronomy activities during the period of Ottomans. ===Articles=== Some of her articles are given below: *(1970).

Codec 2 compresses speech using sinusoidal coding, a method specialized for human speech. Bit rates of 3200 to 450 bit/s have been successfully created. Codec 2 was designed to be used for amateur radio and other high compression voice applications. ==Overview== The codec was developed by David Rowe, with support and cooperation of other researchers (e.g., Jean-Marc Valin from Opus). Codec 2 consists of 3200, 2400, 1600, 1400, 1300, 1200, 700 and 450 bit/s codec modes. It outperforms most other low- bitrate speech codecs. For example, it uses half the bandwidth of Advanced Multi-Band Excitation to encode speech with similar quality. The speech codec uses 16-bit PCM sampled audio, and outputs packed digital bytes. When sent packed digital bytes, it outputs PCM sampled audio. The audio sample rate is fixed at 8 kHz. The reference implementation is open source and is freely available in a GitHub repository. The source code is released under the terms of version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). It is programmed in C and current source code requires floating-point arithmetic, although the algorithm itself does not require this. The reference software package also includes a frequency-division multiplex digital voice software modem and a graphical user interface based on WxWidgets. The software is developed on Linux and a port for Microsoft Windows created with Cygwin is offered in addition to an Apple Macintosh version. The codec has been presented in various conferences and has received the 2012 ARRL Technical Innovation Award,ARRL Technical Innovation Award in 2012 and the Linux Australia Conference's Best Presentation Award. ===Non-Coherent PSK=== Rowe has also created a frequency-division multiplex (FDM) modem which carries the digital voice (DV) in only 1.3 kHz of radio bandwidth. The codec and FDM modem are used every day on amateur radio shortwave bands using both the SM1000 hardware implementation, and the FreeDV application. This modem operates at 50 Baud with a bit rate of 1600 bit/s. This is sent using sixteen QPSK FDM carriers (2 bits each), or 32 bits 50 times a second. 64 bits are needed to make a vocoder frame, thus it has a 25 Hz effective rate. The 64 bits contain 52 bits of vocoder data, and 12 bits of Forward Error Correction (Golay). Thus an effective 1300 bit/s is used for the vocoder. A separate BPSK carrier is sent in the middle of the spectrum (1500 Hz) for synchronization. The ITU emission designation is J2E for phone payload, and J2D for data payload. ===Coherent PSK=== A second FDM modem waveform was developed for the 700 bit/s vocoder. This modem operates with a symbol rate of 75 Baud, using Coherent Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) with seven subcarriers. A duplicate set of subcarriers are used as a diversity channel. This diversity channel is used to combat the effects of fading with shortwave propagation. The modem will still perform well with a ¬± 40 Hz tuning error. The FDM modem sends and receives a row of subcarriers 75 times a second. However, it takes six of these rows to make up a modem frame. First, two pilot reference-phase rows (28 bits), then two speech vocoder rows (28 bits), and finally two more rows for the second speech vocoder frame (28 bits). The process then repeats as long as the transmitter Push-To-Talk (PTT) is keyed. Thus, a modem frame is 84 bits total. 56 bits are used for speech, and 28 bits are used for the reference- phase pilots. These pilots are what makes this a coherent modem. They are used to correct the received data bit phases. The data rate is 1050 bit/s (75 Baud √ó 14 bits). The effective data rate is 700 bit/s (75 Baud / 6 or 12.5 Baud √ó 56 bits). Each row of 14 bits is sent as seven QPSK carriers (2 bits per carrier). The modem timings are also relevant, in that each speech vocoder frame outputs 28 bits every 40 ms. Since the modem has an 80 ms modem frame, it can transport two speech vocoder frames. There are 100 complex IQ (In-Phase and Quadrature-Phase) audio samples for each row, at a 7500 Hz rate. 600 samples total for the modem frame. Thus, 100√ó6 * 12.5 equals the 7500 Hz sample rate. Using a rate conversion filter, the application is provided an 8 kHz interface, which is much more compatible with sound cards. There are 640 complex audio samples at the 8 kHz rate. This rate conversion would not be necessary in firmware. The FDM modem operates with a center frequency of 1500 Hz. The initial FDM subcarrier frequencies are set using a spreading function. This changes the spacing of each subcarrier a little bit more each subcarrier further to the left. About 105 Hz apart on the right, to about 109 Hz apart on the left. This design, along with spectrum clipping, improves the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The measured Crest factor is about 8.3 dB with clipping, and about 10.3 dB without clipping. The FDM modem waveform consumes a different amount of bandwidth, depending on whether the diversity channel is enabled. About 750 Hz per group of seven subcarriers. Normally you would want to use diversity on shortwave, but optionally on VHF and above. The ITU emission designation is J2E for phone payload, and J2D for data payload. ===Orthogonal PSK=== In 2018, a third modem was released which was based on Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). This modem operates at 50 baud, with a default number of 17 QPSK carriers. This parameter and many others were made adjustable to satisfy other OFDM waveform designs. The modem can operate with up to a ¬± 60 Hz tuning error. With 17 carriers it uses a Cyclic prefix duration of 2 ms and a symbol time of 18 ms. The symbol time produces a modulation symbol rate of 55.556 baud. With a sampling rate of 8 kHz this produces 144 symbol samples and 16 Cyclic prefix samples, for a total of 160 samples for each of seven rows, and requiring 994 Hz of bandwidth. The number of carriers is low enough that a Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is used instead of a Fast Fourier transform (FFT), which operates with enough speed on 32-bit floating point firmware devices (such as the STM32 as used in the SM1000 device). The difference in this modem from many other OFDM designs, is it uses multiple data rows to send all the bits. With 17 carriers this results in seven data rows producing 238 bits total. These bits contain the four 700 bps vocoder words of 28 bits each, and the same number of Low-density parity-check code (LDPC) bits, plus four text bits, and a 10 bit unique sync word. Each data packet is preceded by a 19 carrier BPSK pilot signal. The two extra carriers are used to bracket each QPSK carrier with three pilots to average phase and provide coherency. This particular modem was written in the C99 standard so as to use the modern complex math features. The ITU emission designation is J2E for phone payload, and J2D for data payload. ==Technology== Internally, parametric audio coding algorithms operate on 10 ms PCM frames using a model of the human voice. Each of these audio segments is declared voiced (vowel) or unvoiced (consonant). Codec 2 uses sinusoidal coding to model speech, which is closely related to that of multi-band excitation codecs. Sinusoidal coding is based on regularities (periodicity) in the pattern of overtone frequencies and layers harmonic sinusoids. Spoken audio is recreated by modelling speech as a sum of harmonically related sine waves with independent amplitudes called Line spectral pairs, or LSP, on top of a determined fundamental frequency of the speaker's voice (pitch). The (quantised) pitch and the amplitude (energy) of the harmonics are encoded, and with the LSP's are exchanged across a channel in a digital format. The LSP coefficients represent the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) model in the frequency domain, and lend themselves to a robust and efficient quantisation of the LPC parameters. The digital bytes are in a bit-field format that have been packed together into bytes. These bit fields are also optionally gray coded before being grouped together. The gray coding may be useful if sending raw, but normally an application will just burst the bit fields out. The bit fields make up the various parameters that are stored or exchanged (pitch, energy, voicing booleans, LSP's, etc.). For example, Mode 3200, has 20 ms of audio converted to 64 Bits. So 64 Bits will be output every 20 ms (50 times a second), for a minimum data rate of 3200 bit/s. These 64 bits are sent as 8 bytes to the application, which has to unwrap the bit fields, or send the bytes over a data channel. Another example is Mode 1300, which is sent 40 ms of audio, and outputs 52 Bits every 40 ms (25 times a second), for a minimum rate of 1300 bit/s. These 52 bits are sent as 7 bytes to the application or data channel. == Adoption == Codec 2 is currently used in several radios and Software Defined Radio Systems * FreeDV * FlexRadio 6000 series * SM1000 * Quisk * M17 Codec2 has also been integrated into FreeSWITCH and there's a patch available for support in Asterisk. There was a FM-to-Codec2 digital voice repeater in earth orbit on amateur radio CubeSat LilacSat-1 (call sign ON02CN, QB50 constellation), which was launched and subsequently deployed from the International Space Station in 2017. ==History== The prominent free software advocate and radio amateur Bruce Perens lobbied for the creation of a free speech codec for operation at less than 5 kBit/s. Since he did not have the background himself, he approached Jean-Marc Valin in 2008, who introduced him to lead developer David Grant Rowe, who has worked with Valin on Speex on several occasions. Rowe himself is also a radio amateur (amateur radio call sign VK5DGR) and has experience in creating and using voice codecs and other signal processing algorithms for speech signals. He obtained a PhD in speech coding in the 1990s and was involved in the development of one of the first satellite telephony systems (Mobilesat). He agreed to the task and announced his decision to work on a format on August 21, 2009. He built on the research and findings from his doctoral thesis.http://www.itr.unisa.edu.au/~steven/thesis/dgr.pdfhttp://www.rowetel.com/blog/?p=128 The underlying sinusoidal modelling goes back to developments by Robert J. McAulay and Thomas F. Quatieri (MIT Lincoln labs) from the mid-1980s. In August 2010, David Rowe published version 0.1 alpha.http://www.rowetel.com/blog/?p=839 Version 0.2 was released towards the end of 2011, introducing a mode with 1,400 bits/s and significant improvements in quantization. In January 2012, at linux.conf.au, Jean-Marc Valin helped improve the quantization of line spectral pairs, which Rowe is less familiar with.http://jmspeex.livejournal.com/10446.html After several changes to the available bit rate modes in winter and spring 2011/2012, 2,400, 1,400 and 1,200 bit/s modes were available after May of that year. Codec 2 700C, a new mode with a bit rate of 700 bit/s, was finished in early 2017. In July 2018 an experimental 450 bit/s mode was demonstrated, which was developed as part of a master thesis at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. By clever training of the vector quantization the data rate could be further reduced based on the principle of the 700C mode. == References  External links == * Official website * Various Speech Coding Links * FreeDV Category:Speech codecs Category:Free audio codecs ","title":"Codec 2"},{"id":"35911569","text":"The Other People (also known as Sleep is Lovely and I Love You, I Hate You) is a 1968 British film.

The game was a 2013 Facebook Game of the Year in the Staff Picks category and a winner of a 2013 Friendie Award. The game is an adaptation of the novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin and the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, and is the first such social network game. According to Martin, the game features \\"alliance building, treachery, marriages, murders, and most of all the constant struggle to be the greatest house in Westeros.\\" The game includes the ability to engage in the dynamic political and social intrigue featured in the books and television show. The game has over 9 million registered players though daily activity suggests 3 thousand active players. Disruptor Beam released the first expansion for the game, titled \\"The Long Night\\", in October 2014. The expansion allows players to travel beyond \\"The Wall\\" and offers upgrades to the game's Alliances system, along with new quests to complete and items to collect. On October 5, 2018, it was announced that Game of Thrones: Ascent would be shutting down on January 3, 2019. The lack of explanation regarding why the game was shut down left fans disappointed.https://www.reddit.com/r/GameofThronesAscent/comments/9lnnwb/rip_game_of_thrones_ascent_january_3rd_2019/ Some have suggested this resulted from NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) between HBO and Disruptor Beam.https://talk.tidbits.com/t/game-of-thrones- ascent-sudden-closure-leaves-fans-high-and-dry/6410/3 ==Gameplay== Game of Thrones Ascent was a point-and-click casual, role-playing/strategy video game. The player takes on the role of the head of a minor house, swearing allegiance to one of the Great Houses of Westeros, building and managing a keep and army of Sworn Swords. Players complete quests and build their holdings as solo play, making choices that influence their alignment and affect future quests. They can also engage in player versus player conflict, both one-on-one with individual players, or as part of an Alliance in larger-scale wars. These wars are scheduled in 5-week \\"cycles\\", beginning with a week of low-conflict preparation, followed by three weeks of Alliance-versus-Alliance combat competing for ranks across eight of the nine major geographical areas of Westeros, and concluded with a week-long cooperative event. ==Setting== The game closely followed the HBO television series, with weekly content updates following the airing of each episode. Quests allowed the player to participate in major events from the story in various ways, as well an original storyline exploring your character's past and current events at your holdings. The player selected their primary location by swearing fealty to House Stark, House Lannister, House Greyjoy, House Baratheon, House Targaryen, House Tyrell, House Tully, or House Martell. However, the character visits many notable locations through the course of the game, including several famous places in Essos. ==References * Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Facebook games Category:Google Chrome games Category:IOS games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games based on A Song of Ice and Fire Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Game of Thrones Ascent"},{"id":"35911573","text":"Titanic 2020 is the first novel of the Titanic 2020 series by Northern Irish author, Colin Bateman, published on 19 July 2007 through Hodder Children's Books. ==Plot== The novel in based in the year 2020 and follows a stowaway named Jimmy Armstrong and his journey on the brand new and purportedly \\"unsinkable\\" cruise ship Titanic.

Charles followed his brother William \\"Willie\\" in John L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, where he proved an apt pupil, being prominent at most prizegivings between 1857 and 1861. He was sent to England for further education; first at Clifton College in Bristol, then at Moorfields Hospital where he served as a Clinical Clerk and gained his M.R.C.S. in 1870. He studied medicine at Charing Cross Hospital, was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1870, and graduated with Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery from the University of Aberdeen in 1872. He returned to Adelaide in 1873 and was promptly taken into partnership with his father. on North Terrace, and received his M.D. from Aberdeen in 1875. He was appointed to the Board of Management of the Adelaide Hospital in 1877. He was appointed ophthalmic surgeon to the Adelaide Hospital in 1881 and made the third member of its Medical Committee in 1883. South Australia had at the time a poor record of childhood mortality, with some 20% of infants dying within three months of birth, and Charles Gosse made it the subject of his special interest. On 29 June 1885 he was involved in a serious accident: he was riding in one of John Hill & Co's \\"victoria\\" carriages, driven by one John Lambert (who died in 1889 as the result of an unrelated accident), along Hutt Street with his daughter when one of the two horses shied, a pair of wheels broke, and the vehicle overturned, crushing his ankle under a footplate. Despite attention from the best medical men of the day, gangrene set in and Dr. Gosse died two days later after amputation of his leg. His successor as ophthalmic surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital and elsewhere was Dr. Mark Johnston Symons (1853 ‚Äì 26 February 1927). ==Interests== Charles Gosse was a keen and accomplished cricketer. He was elected to the committee of the Institute for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb in 1881 and the Home for Incurables in 1883. He was appointed to the Medical Board in 1884 but retired in favour of Dr. Mayo. He was a vice-president of the Church of England Institute He was a director of Mutual Life Assurance of Australasia. He was a connoisseur of fine china, especially Minton ware, of which he had a fine collection, all auctioned after his death. ==Family== On 11 May 1880 he married Mary Blanche Hawker (1858 ‚Äì 10 December 1945), daughter of George Charles Hawker M.P. *daughter (17 March 1881 ‚Äì ) Their home was on North Terrace and he had a summer residence \\"Thorpe\\" at Waverley Ridge, Mount Lofty. After his death, his widow and daughter left for Italy then London, where they remained. ==Recognition== On his death a committee was formed to establish a Charles Gosse Memorial fund, which established a Chair of Ophthalmic Surgery at the University of Adelaide. From 1916 an annual Dr. Charles Gosse medal was awarded to the best candidate in the ophthalmology. Among the recipients of this enduring award was Neville Way, who was also a noted player of Australian Rules football and Percival Francis Leitch Hussey who was also a noted yachtsman. His portrait was photographed by Townsend Duryea around 1880. John Alfred Upton (1850‚Äì) was commissioned by the Charles Gosse Memorial committee to paint his portrait in oils from a photograph, to be hung in the Ophthalmic ward of the Adelaide Hospital. == References == Category:1849 births Category:Australian ophthalmologists Category:Australian people of English descent Category:Road incident deaths in South Australia Category:1885 deaths ","title":"Charles Gosse"},{"id":"35911579","text":"Nicholas Costantini (born 31 July 1989) is an Italian footballer who plays for Lega Pro Foligno. ==Biography== Costantini was a member of Genoa C.F.C. reserve team from 2006 to 2009.

Spurrier was born on May 27, 1932 in the rural farming community of Douglas County, Missouri. He was one of six children of John and Golda Spurrier, who migrated to the Central Valley of California during the Dust Bowl, eventually settling in the agricultural town of Delano, about a half-hour north of Bakersfield. Following in the footsteps of his two older brothers, he loved playing sports, and by the time he graduated from Delano High School in 1950 he had established himself as an all-around athlete playing varsity football as halfback, basketball (named outstanding defensive player of the year), and both baseball and track. Lon was also active socially in high school where he was Student Council president and voted by classmates as best all-around senior boy. In his senior year, he was encouraged by his high school coach to switch from baseball to track, where he participated in a wide variety of events. Track proved a natural fit, and by the end of the season he‚Äôd set the school record in the low hurdles, and finished 6th place in the CIF California State Meet in the 440, the third time he‚Äôd ever ran that distance. It was at the University of California at Berkeley, under the tutelage of legendary Cal track coach Brutus Hamilton, that Spurrier‚Äôs newfound interest in track flourished. He won the Pacific Coast Conference 800 title in 1952 and tied for third in the NCAA that year. In 1954, in a remarkable event, he was on one of two college relay teams that broke the 4x880 (2 mile relay) world's record time. The Cal relay team (Al Baeta, Ed Wilson, Len Simpson, and anchored by Spurrier), finished in 2nd place, with a time of 7:28.5, just 1.2 seconds behind the Fordham team. Both teams broke the world's record time that had been previously set by a group of Olympians. He was named an All-American. On March 26, 1955, on the clay and cinder track at UC Berkeley‚Äôs Edwards Stadium, Spurrier set the world‚Äôs record in the half-mile with a time of 1:47.5. Just two weeks earlier, on March 12, 1955 he had won a silver medal in the 800 at the Pan American Games in Mexico City, and ran on the gold medal winning 4√ó400 relay team (see Athletics at the 1955 Pan American Games). His coach, Brutus Hamilton, felt that if he could run 1:50.5 at altitude in Mexico City, that Spurrier might be able to break 1:48 at sea level in Berkeley. His hunch proved correct when Spurrier finished at 1:47.5 in Berkeley later that month, breaking the world's record. In 1956, he ran on two world's record setting USA relay teams: the 4 x 440 yard (mile relay), and he anchored the 4 x 880 yard (two-mile relay) record setting team. And, in the 1956 Olympics, Spurrier finished 6th in the 800 meters while also one of six members of the US 1,600 meter relay team that won the gold medal. He was inducted into the Cal Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998. After graduating from UC Berkeley, he joined the US Air Force where he earned his wings as a jet pilot and the rank of Captain. He attended Harvard Business School, and moved to Manhattan where he began his career in financial management on Wall Street, before returning to the San Francisco Bay Area and making his home in the East Bay. ==References== Category:Place of birth missing Category:1932 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American male sprinters Category:American male middle-distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:California Golden Bears men's track and field athletes Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1955 Pan American Games Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:People from Delano, California Category:People from Douglas County, Missouri ","title":"Lonnie Spurrier"},{"id":"35911621","text":"The Crookston Daily Times is an American daily newspaper published weekday afternoons in Crookston, Minnesota.

The generic name combines a Greek ·º†œéœÇ, (eos), \\"dawn\\", with the name Abelisaurus, in reference to the fact it represents an early relative of the latter. Only one species is currently recognized, E. mefi, from which the specific name honours the MEF, the Museo Paleontol√≥gico \\"Egidio Feruglio\\", where discoverer Diego Pol is active. It is characterized by reduced forelimb proportions that show primitive characteristics of the Abelisauridae family. == Discovery and naming == Holotype skull, seen from the left side, with scale bar In 2009, Argentinian paleontologist Diego Pol discovered the skeleton of a theropod near the village of Cerro C√≥ndor in Chubut Province. The remains were found in the Jugo Loco locality that is placed in a series of fine beds of mudstone, marlstone, and limestone in the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation. In 2012, based on these remains, the type species Eoabelisaurus mefi was named and described by Pol and his German colleague Oliver Rauhut. Before discovery, the oldest known abelisaurids were represented only by fragmentary remains from the late Early Cretaceous of South America and Africa and older records of abelisauroids in general were questionable. With the discovery of Eoabelisaurus, the temporal range of the clade was extended for more than 40 million years into the Middle Jurassic. The existence of a derived ceratosaur at the time indicated a rapid diversification of ceratosaurs during that time period, as all the major ceratosaurian lineages (ceratosaurids, noasaurids, and abelisaurids) had been established. == Description == Size comparison It was a bipedal carnivore that was estimated to have reached in length, although a comprehensive analysis of abelisaur size conducted in 2016 yielded a size estimate of . Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 7.5 meters (25.6 ft) and 445 kg (981 lbs). The holotype specimen, MPEF PV 3990, was uncovered in a layer of the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation, a lacustrine deposit dating from the Aalenian-Bajocian, roughly 170 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, of a subadult or adult individual. The posterior half of the skeleton was found in articulation and the anterior dorsal and cervical vertebrae and forelimbs were found partially disarticulated prior to burial. The skull was discovered slightly separated from the vertebral column. The skull and anterior presacrals were also exposed at the time of discovery and had been partially been destroyed by erosion. From the material known of the snout, only a small fragment of the right maxilla has been recovered and shows that the interdental plates are fused, but not striated. The known posterior part of the skull is high, with an oval orbit and an enlarged infratemporal fenestra, similar to other ceratosaurs. The skull roof is not notably thickened and no cranial ornamentation is present. Restoration Both humeri from the known material are poorly preserved, but show primitive characters. The articular head is slightly rounded, but not a globular shape that is commonly seen in noasaurids and abelisaurids. The radius and ulna are short and the ulna has a large olecranon process. The manus is very foreshortened, retains four digits, and has short metacarpals. Metacarpal I is about half the length of metacarpal II and considerably more slender. The arm also bears a stout phalanx that is slightly longer than the metacarpal. The non-terminal manual phalanges are about as long as wide and lack any constriction between the articular ends, and manual unguals are reduced. It is these reduced limb proportions that demonstrate Eoabelisaurus was indeed a primitive abelisaurid. The exact number of vertebrae is unknown due to several gaps in the holotype's spine, but its cervical vertebrae are short and have two pneumatic foramina on either side of the centra. The length of vertebral centra remains constant over the preserved portion of the tail, but middle and posterior caudals are considerably lower. == Classification == Restoration Lower leg bones Eoabelisaurus was assigned to the basalmost position in Abelisauridae by its describers. It would, then, be the oldest abelisaurid species known by forty (40) million years. The describers indicated that in the cladistic analysis a difference of only a single trait would have resulted in a position lower in the evolutionary tree, basal in the Abelisauroidea. The following cladogram follows their analysis. == Paleobiology  Reduced forelimbs === Comparison between Carnotaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Eoabelisaurus forelimbs demonstrating gradual reduction starting at the distal elements Before the discovery of Eoabelisaurus, abelisaurid anatomy was only known from a handful of Late Cretaceous taxa that were aberrant in their morphology, such as their unusual skull structure and reduction of their forelimbs. Eoabelisaurus shows what was previously an unknown stage in the evolution of abelisaurids, having only some of the cranial modifications and a unique combination of features in its forelimbs. The manus of Eoabelisaurus have a derived morphology, with short and robust metacarpals, non-terminal phalanges, and reduced manual unguals. The humerus is unreduced, and the ulna and radius are shortened but do not differ from more basal ceratosaurs. Therefore, the modification of the forelimbs in the evolution of abelisaurids seems to have occurred in a modular fashion, starting with the distal elements such as the fingers, and only later affecting the more proximal elements. It is with this evidence that Eoabelisaurus confirms a recently proposed evolutionary scenario of abelisaurid limbs based on the incomplete evidence of Cretaceous abelisauroids. == See also == * Timeline of ceratosaur research == References  External links == Category:Abelisaurids Category:Dinosaur genera Category:Middle Jurassic dinosaurs of South America Category:Jurassic Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 2012 ","title":"Eoabelisaurus"},{"id":"35911710","text":"R v Shein1925 AD 6. is an important case in South African law, heard in the Appellate Division, Bloemfontein, on 15 September 1924, with judgment handed down on 3 October.

For shorter of longer periods the club also offered rugby, cricket, baseball, gymnastics, boxing, amateur wrestling, swimming, rowing, skiing, speed skating, equestrianism and harness racing. The club saw its athletics heyday before 1930, with Jonas Solheim, August Pettersen and Bjarne Stangeland as prominent athletes; in 1931 Christian Anker-Larsen became 1500 metres champion. Liv Paulsen was among the national pioneers in women's athletics. The football team pioneered the sport in Stavanger, and became nationally prominent from 1925, when they reached the semi-final in the Norwegian football cup. The best player was Reidar Kvammen, and other international players during its first fifty years were Torgeir Torgersen, William Danielsen, Bernhard Lund, Inge Paulsen, Arthur Kvammen, Sverre Kvammen and Karsten Johannessen. A chairman for the football section was Einar Diesen. The club was also successful in amateur boxing. In 1987 the multi-sports club was discontinued as it was split into three; the football club Viking FK, the ice hockey club Viking IK, the handball club Viking HK and an athlete's club which included boxing.

During a feud between the Hanseatic League and the Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, he killed a member of the House of Isenburg with a pistol shot. He retired in 1622 ‚Äî turning down offers to become a general in the Danish, English or Swedish army ‚Äî and focussed on the administration of his own barony. == Reign== The Lordship of Fleckenstein came to feel the full force of the Thirty Years' War in 1622, when commander Ernst von Mansfeld spent the winter in the Upper Rhine area. Georg tried to follow the example of Counts Johann Reinhard I and his cousin Philipp Wolfgang of Hanau-Lichtenberg (1595‚Äì1641) and remain neutral. However, when the imperial side grew stronger, he found it impossible to maintain this policy. He sold the Dagstuhl part of his territory to Archbishop Philipp Christoph of Trier. Georg II went into exile in Strasbourg, where he was joined by the ruling family of Hanau-Lichtenberg. He resided at \\"Fleckenstein Court\\" on M√ºnstergasse street. Fleckenstein was administered by a member of the Fleckenstein-Bickenbach-Sulz line of his family. == Regency of Hanau  Hanau-Lichtenberg === In Strasbourg, Count Philipp Wolfgang of Hanau- Lichtenberg wrote his will, in which he made his son Friedrich Casimir his sole hier and successor, based on the primogeniture decree, which was in force in the ruling family of Hanau since 1375. In case Friedrich Casimir was still underage when he inherited the county, his regents would be Georg II and Count Johann Ernst of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. Georg II was selected, because there were no male-line members of the Hanau-Lichtenberg line left, and Georg II was related in the female line, his grandmother being Anna Sibylle of Hanau-Lichtenberg, a daughter of Count Philipp IV. This was the only case in the history of Hanau where a regent was appointed who was of lower rank than his ward. However, Count Johann Ernst, who was the closest living relative, and had the proper feudal rank, however, he lived in faraway Hanau. Philipp Wolfgang died on . He was survived by his second wife, Dorothea Diana of Salm and his underage children Friedrich Casimir, Johann Philipp, Johann Reinhard II, Sophie Eleonore and Agatha Christine. As these children were underage, a guardian was needed. Georg II took up this task, although he had been offered an attractive alternative: to become governor of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg, which had been confiscated by the Emperor. === Hanau-M√ºnzenberg === Count Johann Ernst died on 12 January 1642, leaving Georg II as the only remaining guardian and regent. His ward, Count Friedrich Casimir, inherited Hanau-M√ºnzenberg in a politically precarious situation: * Even travelling to Hanau-M√ºnzenberg through enemy territory was difficult. Friedrich Casimir had to travel in disguise, with only a numerically small company, including Georg II.Ferdinand Hahnzog, Georg II. von Fleckenstein, Freiherr zu Dachstuhl. Ein Hanauer Administrator in der Endphase des Drei√üigj√§hrigen Krieges, in: Hanauer Geschichtsbl√§tter, vol. 18, 1962, p. 223‚Äì242. * The liege lords of several of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg's possessions, especially the Archbishop of Mainz, but also the Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, and the Abbey of Fulda, held that Friedrich Casimir was only distantly related to Johann Ernst and saw this as an opportunity to terminate the fief. Their legal position was fairly weak, since there was a clear family relationship between Johann Ernst and Friedrich Casimir, and moreover the inheritance treaty from 1610 between the Hanau-Lichtenberg and Hanau- M√ºnzenberg lines clearly applied. However, in the confusion of the Thirty Years' War, things were decided by a nobleman's military power, not by the legality or otherwise of his legal position. Georg II acknowledged the problem and ensured his position was supported by Hesse-Kassel. Landgravine Amalie Elisabeth, the widow of Landgrave Wilhelm V who had been born a Countess of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg and was Regent of Hesse-Kassel at the time, provided Georg II with diplomatic and political support. She aimed to preserve all of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg's territory, because the county was heavily indebted to Hesse- Kassel. In return, Georg II as regent of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg, signed an inheritance treaty with Hesse-Kassel, promising that if the House of Hanau were to die out in the male line, then Hanau-M√ºnzenberg would fall to Hesse- Kassel. He also gave Hesse-Kassel the district of Schwarzenfels and the territory of the former monastery in Naumburg as securities for the debt. * Hanau, the capital of the county, consisted to two legally separate cities: The old and the new town. The latter had been created at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries to settle Calvinist refugees from France and the Spanish Netherlands (today's Belgium). City politics in New Hanau were dominated by wealthy merchants and traders who had acquired a very strong position in Hanau-M√ºnzenberg due to their economic power.Reinhard Dietrich: \\"...wegen gef√ºhrten gro√üen Staats, aber schlechter Zahlung der Schulden...\\" ‚Äî Zur finanziellen Lage der Grafschaft Hanau im 17. Jahrhundert, in: Hanauer Geschichtsbl√§tter, vol. 31, 1993, p. 123-147 They intended to use the weak position of the new count and his regent to demand some concessions before he would accept his inheritance. After negotiating for ten days, Georg II concluded that he had no option but to give in to their demands. Their main demand was continuation of the religious status quo. Friedrich Casimir, like all counts from the Hanau-Lichtenberg line, was a Lutheran. Hanau-M√ºnzenberg, however, had been Calvinist since the reign of Count Philipp Ludwig II (1576‚Äì1612). Fifty years earlier, Philipp Ludwig II had been able to prescribe the confession in his county under the principle . Georg II, however, found himself forced, not only to allow Calvinists to worship freely, but even to limit Lutheranism to the chapel in Hanau's city palace. Only in 1658 was Friedrich Casimir able to build a Lutheran church in Hanau, the St. Johann's church. In 1670, Hanau-M√ºnzenberg officially became bi-confessional, although that did not stop the fierce debate among the confessions. It wasn't until 140 years later that the two churches in Hanau-M√ºnzenberg could be united. == Death == Georg II of Fleckenstein died on 31 January 1644 at Hanau, the last baron of the Fleckenstein-Dagstuhl line. He was buried in St. Mary's Church, Hanau. Count Friedrich Casimir of Hanau was still considered underage in 1644, as the coming of age only happened at age 25. Count Georg Albrecht of Erbach was appointed as the new regent. == Ancestors  References == * Reinhard Dietrich: Die Landesverfassung in dem Hanauischen, in: Hanauer Geschichtsbl√§tter, vol. 34, Hanau, 1996, * Ferdinand Hahnzog, Georg II. von Fleckenstein, Freiherr zu Dachstuhl.

He was awarded honorary DCL by University of Oxford & LL.D by University of Edinburgh. He was a renowned figure in promoting Science and Technology education in contemporary India. ==Early life== Son of Nandalal Sarkar, a native of Jaynagar, he was born in the house of his maternal uncle in Netra village of South 24 Parganas district, on 1 October 1861. His father came from an impoverished family in Jessore and later settled in Jaynagar. However, as his mother often suffered from ill health, Sarkar and his siblings spent much of their growing years with their maternal family in Netra village and subsequently moved there. His mother died while he was still a child from what was later believed to be cancer. Sarkar was reported to have shared with grandchildren that it was this early loss of his mother to an unknown disease that led him to study medicine, as he wanted to know the cause of her death. ==Education== Sarkar passed the entrance examination for Chatra Nandalal Institution in Hooghly and matriculated there. Despite the family's modest means, Sarkar moved to Calcutta to pursue his career in medicine. His efforts caught the attention of an Englishman who sponsored his study at the Campbell Medical College in the formative years from where he obtained vernacular diploma in medicine in 1879. Later, he went on to win a scholarship, and earned the M.B. degree in 1888. The following year he earned his M.A., and in 1890 he obtained the M.D. degrees from the University of Calcutta. ==Family life== In 1888, Sarkar married Nirmala, daughter of Girishchandra Mazumdar of Barisal, a scholar and a Brahmo missionary, and became a member of the Brahmo Samaj. The couple went on to have six children, five daughters and one son. ==Medical career== Dr Sarkar soon grew a large practice and was, for many years, a leading Indian consulting physician, travelling far and wide to treat some of his patients, who included the ruling heads of state in neighbouring countries. ==Educational endeavours == Aside from his contribution to the field of medicine, Dr Sarkar also contributed greatly to the causes of education, commerce, and politics during his lifetime. He was directly or indirectly involved in the foundation and administration of various national institutes of science in Bengal: === Bose Institute === Sir Nilratan Sarkar was the Chairman of the first Governing Body of Bose Institute, which is Asia's first modern interdisciplinary research centre. === Carmichael Medical College === Sir Nilratan Sarkar became the president of Medical Education Society of Bengal in 1922 and remained in the position until 1941. The society was formed for better management of the Carmichael Medical College.Official website of R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital Batch 1982‚Äì1987 , History of R. G.

He was elected Fellow in 1893 and was responsible for the expansion of post graduate science teaching facilities and research in medical education as well as the introduction of students' health examination and welfare work. He served as the President of the University of Calcutta's Council for Post Graduate Teaching Arts from 1924 to 1929, the President of the Post Graduate teaching in Science from 1924 to 1942 and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta from 1919 to 1921.Official Website of University of CalcuttaVice Chancellors of University of Calcutta In 1920 he travelled to England to represent the University of Calcutta at the Empire Universities Conference in London. ===Other institutes=== Sarkar was also closely associated with the Jadavpur Tuberculosis Hospital and Chittarajan Seva Sadan. ===Academic clubs and societies=== Sarkar served as the President of the Calcutta Medical Club and was for many years remained the Editor-In-Chief of its Journal. He was also one of the founders of the Physiological Society of India established in 1934. During the anti-partition movement in Bengal, Sarkar became involved in establishing the National Council of Education. In 1906, Taraknath Pandit and Dr Sarkar launched the Society for the Promotion of Technical Education which established the Bengal Technical Institute. ==Political life== This was also a time of great enormous political turmoil in the Indian subcontinent. The Independence movement was slowly but surely gaining momentum and here too, Sircar was at the helm of affairs. He was closely associated with several leading luminaries of that time, including Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Motilal Nehru, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. He was a member of the Indian National Congress between 1890 and 1919, Sircar also served as a member of the Bengal Legislative Congress under the reform scheme. ==Promotion of national trade== His enthusiastic support for the Swadeshi movement saw him set up the National Soap Factory and the National Tannery at Beliaghata in 1905.

Corbett CJ, Hoexter JA, Nestadt JA, Steyn JA and Nicholas AJA. == Facts == The appellants, being the Administrator of the Cape and the Minister of Police, the respective heads of the Cape Provincial Administration and the South African Police (the CPA and the SAP respectively), appealed the grant against them of a mandament van spolie by a Provincial Division at the instance of the respondents. The respondents were among a group of squatters who had occupied land, part of which was owned by a local authority and part of which was privately owned, until, after several meetings between the owners, the CPA and the SAP, they and their possessions and dwellings were cleared from the site in an operation carried out by numerous members of the SAP, and removed to a township in transport provided by the CPA. The order granted by the court a quo against the owners, the CPA and the SAP was to the effect that they were \\"directed to restore [the squatters] to undisturbed possession of the [...] sites\\" from which they had been cleared. In the appeal, the CPA and the SAP argued, inter alia, that the mandament should not have been granted against them, in that # neither of them had participated in the demolition of any squatter dwellings, their respective roles being merely supportive; and # since neither of them had dominium or a right of control over the sites from which the squatters had been removed, they had no means, legal or otherwise, of giving effect to the mandament. == Judgment == The court held, as to the first argument, on the facts, that, without the assistance of the CPA and the SAP, there could have been no removal of the squatters. The CPA and SAP had therefore been co- spoliators with the owners of the respective properties; as joint wrongdoers, they were liable. As to the second argument, the court held that the order made by the court a quo, when applied to the facts, was solely prohibitory in content. Neither the owners nor the CPA and SAP had been required to do anything; there was therefore no room for an argument that the order had been impossible of performance. The court decided, accordingly, that the mandament had correctly been granted against the appellants, and so confirmed the decision in Ntshwaqela v Chairman, Western Cape Regional Services Council.1988 (3) SA 218 (C). == Principles == In legal usage, the court noted, the word \\"judgment\\" has at least two meanings: a general meaning and a technical meaning. When used in the general sense, the word comprises both the reasons for judgment and the judgment or order; when used in its technical sense, it is the equivalent of \\"order.\\" When a judgment has been delivered in court, whether in writing or orally, the registrar draws up a formal order of court which is embodied in a separate document signed by him. It is a copy of this which is served by the sheriff. There can be an appeal only against the substantive order made by the court, not against the reasons for judgment. The basic rules for interpreting the judgment or order of a court are no different from those applicable to the construction of documents. The court's intention has to be ascertained primarily from the language of the judgment or order as construed according to the usual well-known rules. The judgment or order, and the court's reasons for giving it, must be read as a whole in order to ascertain its intention. If, on such a reading, the meaning of the judgment or order is clear and unambiguous, no extrinsic fact or evidence is admissible to contradict, vary, qualify or supplement it. If any uncertainty in meaning does emerge, however, the extrinsic circumstances surrounding or leading up to the court's granting the judgment or order may be investigated and regarded in order to clarify it. The dicta in Firestone South Africa v Gentiruco1977 (4) SA 298 (A) at 304D-H. was here applied. The order with which a judgment concludes has a special function: it is the executive part of the judgment, which defines what the court requires to be done or not done, so that the defendant or respondent, or in some cases the world, may know it. While it may be said that the order must be read as part of the entire judgment, and not as a separate document, the court's directions must be found in the order and nowhere else. If the meaning of an order is clear and unambiguous, it is decisive, and cannot be restricted or extended by anything else stated in the judgment. The rationale underlying the grant of a mandament van spolie is that no person is entitled to take the law into his own hands. An applicant for a spoliation order need not, therefore, as part of his case, prove that the spoliator had acquired possession of the property. Co-spoliators are, as a matter of principle, liable as joint wrongdoers. It is trite that a court will not engage in the futile exercise of making an order which cannot be carried out. In the context of a mandament van spolie, impossibility is a question of fact and, where it is contended that an order should not be granted because it cannot be complied with, it must be shown that compliance is impossible on the facts. Where an order to restore possession of immovable property has been granted, there can be, in the nature of things, no physical handing over of the property. Such an order may be mandatory in part (for example, where it requires the spoliator to vacate the property), and it can be prohibitory, in that it requires the spoliator to forebear from preventing or hindering the spoliatus in resuming possession. == See also == * Crime in South Africa * Law of South Africa * South African criminal law == References  Case law === * Administrator, Cape, and Another v Ntshwaqela and Others 1990 (1) SA 705 (A). * Firestone South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Gentiruco AG 1977 (4) SA 298 (A). * Ntshwaqela and Others v Chairman, Western Cape Regional Services Council, and Others 1988 (3) SA 218 (C). == Notes == Category:Appellate Division (South Africa) cases Category:1989 in South African law Category:1989 in case law ","title":"Administrator, Cape, v Ntshwaqela"},{"id":"35911955","text":"Alanizini is a beetle tribe in the Cerambycinae subfamily, containing the single genus Alanizus and the single species Alanizus tortuosus.Bezark, Larry G.

He unsuccessfully stood as the Labour candidate for Ashton-under-Lyne at the 1924 general election. The Liberal candidate, Sydney Cope Morgan had not contested the last election. A fourth candidate entered the contest in the figure of a 53-year-old Manchester baker, E.A. Hailwood.

The winner, Rev. Frederick Storrs-Turner, announced his intent to set up a society to oppose the trade, and at a meeting in November of that year the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade was formed. Rev. Storrs-Turner became the society's secretary, and the funds for its foundation were provided by Quaker and industrialist Edward Pease (1834‚Äì1880) (brother of Sir Joseph Pease, who was later to be president of the society). The first president was the Earl of Shaftesbury, although he was not elected to the post until 1880. An early publicity stunt was the enrollment of Donald Matheson, who had left his family's firm Jardine, Matheson & Co. due to the company's involvement in the opium trade. The society quickly became a focal point for the anti-opium movement. Initially, it campaigned on two fronts: lobbying for the British Government to cease its military and diplomatic pressures on China to allow opium imports and removing direct government involvement in the trade in India. After the Chefoo Convention of 1876, when the British Government ceased to pressurise China into allowing opium imports, the Society turned its attention to the Indian production of opium, advocating total prohibition in India except for medical use. The Society commanded considerable support in China, partly as a result of its connections to Quaker missions and partly due to the diplomatic efforts of the Society's secretary, Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848-1918),J.G. Alexander's writings are listed in the catalogue of the Religious Society of Friends, London who travelled to China in 1894 and met with many government representatives there to discuss the opium issue. As a result of his report, the Society adopted the view that Chinese condemnation of the opium trade was widespread, a belief at odds with that of the British public. Like many similar organisations, the Society was composed largely of upper- and middle-class politicians, landowners and clergy, and its aims were largely irrelevant to the majority of the British working population. Because of its large Quaker membership, the Society often had a religious tone to its meetings, with prayers and discussion of Biblical content being common. Other Christian organisations, such as the Church of England, were also active in the anti-opium movement. Whilst there were agnostic crusaders against the trade, such as John Morley, this religious sentiment was seized upon by the pro-opium movement, who dismissed the Society's message as histrionic \\"hellfire and brimstone\\" preaching. In his capacity as the Society's president, Sir Joseph Pease attempted to pass a motion in the House of Commons in 1891 to declare the opium trade \\"morally indefensible\\" and remove Government support for it. The motion failed to pass (despite majority support in the House) due to an amendment calling for compensation to India, but it brought the anti-opium campaign into the public eye and increased opposition to the trade. The Society's campaigning resulted in the creation of a Royal Commission on Opium, but although a member of the Society (Arthur Pease) was on the Commission, its findings were firmly in favour of the trade. As a result, the aims of the anti-opium movement were set back considerably; it was fifteen years before the issue was again debated in Parliament. In 1906, the motion proposed by Pease in 1891 was once again put before Parliament. This time it was successful, and in response the Chinese passed laws prohibiting the manufacture of opium. The Society disbanded in 1917, having achieved its goals when the British finally ended the opium trade between India and China in 1913. ==Publications== The society published a regular newspaper, The Friend of China, which appeared, on average, eight times each year and was circulated both in the United Kingdom and among missionary communities in China.

A transition government under first Adm. Wolfgang Larraz√°bal and then Edgar Sanabria was put in place until December 1958 elections saw Democratic Action candidate R√≥mulo Betancourt elected and take office on 13 February 1959. One of Caracas' neighbourhoods, Barrio 23 de Enero (23 January neighbourhood), is named for the event. == Events Background=== In December 1957 there was a referendum to extend the mandate of P√©rez Jim√©nez to solidify his regime and legitimize the armed forces. The closest precedent for the coup occurred on New Year's Day, 1 January 1958, when Venezuelan Air Force fighter planes soared into the sky over waking Caracas. The shock was tremendous, even for the supporters of the government, after the recent referendum. The causes that led to the fall of P√©rez Jim√©nez were twofold. Firstly, the military crisis, originating from the above event on 1 January 1958, disrupted the absolute power that until then had belonged to the National Armed Forces. A crisis occurred in the leadership of both the Air Force Base in Boca de R√≠o, near the city of Maracay, and the 1st Armored Battalion commanded by Lt. Col. Hugo Trejo of the Army. Secondly, the coup was caused by the political crisis within the government itself from the breakdown and fragmentation caused by the December 1957 plebiscite resulted in two successive cabinet changes on 10 and 13 January 1958. Since the events of 1 January, the P√©rez Jim√©nez government had begun to publish various manifestos against shaky government that were signed by men and women representing different fields of economic activity, professional, cultural and public, as well as pronouncements of national institutions such as the College of Engineering, the Venezuelan Association of Journalists, labor federations and business sectors, which, until then, had not openly expressed their rejection of the dictatorship. All street actions against the regime peaked in the general strike on 21 January, mobilized by the union of the various political parties, along with students, business leaders and the poor and working class residents of the capital. === Popular unrest === The first open demonstration against the regime occurred on 27 March 1957, at a performance of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait directed by the composer. Actress Juana Sujo read the text in Spanish translation in the presence of P√©rez Jim√©nez. Near the conclusion, as Sujo quoted from the Gettysburg Address, the audience cheered her and began shouting against the president so vociferously that Copland could not hear the music. An American foreign service officer told Copland that his Lincoln Portrait as read by Sujo had, in effect, started the revolution. === Coup actions === alt=In the early hours of 23 January, despite having the support of an important sector of the Armed Forces, P√©rez Jim√©nez decided to abandon the Miraflores Palace and move to La Carlota Airport, located in the city of Caracas, to embark upon a plane to the Dominican Republic. At news of the overthrow, the people took to the streets, looting the houses of the regime's supporters, attacking the headquarters of the National Security and lynching officials. Also destroyed was the headquarters of the government newspaper El Heraldo. Moreover, in a few hours the Miraflores Palace became the meeting place of the rebels and many political leaders, who proceeded to appoint a Provisional Government Junta that replaced the ousted regime. The Board constituted Adm. Wolfgang Larraz√°bal, Commanding General of the Navy, as president along with Cols. Luis Carlos Araque, Pedro Jos√© Quevedo, Roberto Casanova and Abel Romero Villate. At dawn of 23 January, Venezuelans celebrated the fall of P√©rez Jim√©nez, while protesting the presence of the Governing Board perejimenismo members including Romero Casanova Villate, who eventually were forced to resign and were later replaced on 24 January by businessmen Eugenio Mendoza and Blas Lamberti. ==Aftermath== To facilitate the work of the Governing Board and the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, a caretaker cabinet was established, composed of lawyers, businessmen and executives and Col. Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Castro Le√≥n of the Ministry of Defence. Subsequently, the Governing Board called elections for December of that year, released political prisoners across the country, expanding the Patriotic Council with representatives of independent sectors, appointing journalist Fabricio Ojeda as chair. It also began the process of punishing returning Jimenista exiles. ==See also== * History of Venezuela, 1948 - 1958 ==References== Venezuela Coup D'√©tat Category:Military coups in Venezuela Category:January 1958 events ","title":"1958 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat"},{"id":"35912102","text":"Carol Schlosberg (14 June 1957 - 29 March 1998) was an American painter who was born in Newton, Massachusetts, and had been an art instructor at Yale University where she earned her Master of Fine Arts in 1992.

It is about a modern-day plastic surgeon (Kim Hee-sun), who is kidnapped and travels back in time to the Goryeo period, 700 years in the past. There, she falls in love with her kidnapper, a warrior who is the leader of the royal guard (Lee Min-ho). ==Title== The title Sin-ui, can mean faith, as in belief in justice. The Hanja means Divine Doctor, but in Hangul it also means divine healer or great doctor. ==Synopsis== After King Gongmin of Goryeo (Ryu Deok-hwan) marries the Yuan princess Noguk (Park Se-young), they return to Goryeo. On the way, they are attacked and the queen is fatally injured. According to the advice of his royal advisor, the king orders royal bodyguard Choi Young (Lee Min-ho) to pass through a mystical portal (\\"heaven's gate\\") and find the \\"heaven's doctor\\". Choi Young travels to the future and brings back Yoo Eun-soo (Kim Hee-sun), a modern-day doctor from Seoul, who saves the queen's life. He makes a promise that he will return her to her world, but the scheming royal advisor persuades King Gongmin to force Eun-soo to stay as she can be useful to him. As Eun-soo accustoms herself to her new surroundings, gradually she and Choi Young fall in love with each other. But problems arise as others become fascinated with her as the \\"Heaven's doctor\\", and Eun-soo becomes a pawn in the political power plays between King Gongmin, the Yuan overlords, the sociopathic nobleman Ki-chul (Yu Oh-seong) and Prince Deok-seung (Park Yoon-jae), King Gongmin's uncle. Constantly risking his life, Choi Young thwarts numerous attempts by Ki-chul and Deok-seung to kidnap and possess Eun-soo, which almost resulted in the death of the king and queen. Choi Young brings Eun-soo to the portal before it closes so that she can travel back and bid farewell to her loved ones and join Choi Young permanently. Ki-chul attacked them and Choi Young suffers a life-threatening wound. Ki-chul then drags Eun-soo to the portal, and Eun-soo enters it hoping to save him by gathering medical supplies from the future. When she passes through the portal again, she finds herself in an era a hundred years before Choi Young's time. There, she spends a few years waiting for the portal to open again, while leaving hints for her future self. One day, \\"heaven's gate\\" opens again and Eun-soo enters, only to find herself again back in modern-day Seoul. She re-enters the portal and travels to the time period five years after she left Choi Young, a time during which he has brilliantly won a number of military battles and reclaimed lands of Goryeo. Finally, she and Choi Young reunite. ==CastMain=== * Lee Min-ho ‚Äì General Choi Young :In the mid-1300s, approximately 1352, Choi Young is a bodyguard to King Gongmin of the Goryeo Dynasty.

The production of \\"Faith\\" was riddled with problems. The initial budget was 10 billion won (about US$10 million) but the series got its budget slashed, and was pushed back multiple times because of the leading actor. The drama was announced in 2009 with Lee Joon-gi as a main lead. However, the actor had to be replaced because he was drafted in the army. Born in 1982, Lee would normally have time to enlist until the end of 2010 but he received his papers early, shortly after beginning his new film project. This forced him to drop \\"Faith\\", as well as his horse-racing movie Grand Prix, which had already begun shooting. Lee had tried to postpone enlistment to finish these two projects by the end of the year, but was unable to do so. He was replaced by Kang Ji-hwan (Coffee House) who, however, had to withdraw after a request by the Entertainment Management Association because of his ongoing contract dispute and legal fight with his former and current management companies. The antagonist, Kim Seung-soo, also left, with the majority of the original cast at that time. This was a severe blow to the budget, as 10 million won had reportedly been spent on promotion with Kang as the lead. Actors like Oh Ji-ho and Lee Sang-yoon were considered for the main role, before finally deciding for Lee Min-ho. It seems that at that time the story itself was rewritten to some extent. A released trailer with Kang Ji- hwan showed a different atmosphere, much darker, more epic and dramatic than what was finally filmed. Filming for \\"Faith\\" began on May 24, 2012 and it aired from August 13 to October 30, 2012. The ratings were mediocre but rarely dropped below 10%. On October 19, a little before the end, the news was published that Lee Phillip (who played Dr. Jang Bin), sustained an eye injury and had to pull out of the drama. The injury did not arise during drama filming, but because he was scheduled for surgery next week he wouldn't be able to continue shooting. Many viewers agreed that \\"It's too bad that he leaves so close to the drama's finale without getting to be a part of it. On the other hand, it's both fortunate for the drama and a damn shame for him that he's barely a presence in the show to begin with, despite the setup hinting at a much meatier role\\". The writer Song Ji-na uploaded the original script on her website and it was obvious that there were considerable changes in the final product, some of them because of lack of money. However, Faith had financial problems almost from its start and they didn't finish after the drama wrapped. Six months after the end of its airing, many of the cast and crew of that drama had not been paid. The acting, editing, and producing salaries which hadn't been paid amounted to 1.7 billion won. Drama producer and direction Kim Jong-hak, whose credits include Eyes of Dawn, Sandglass, Daemang (2002) and Legend (2007), was accused of double-contracting the Faith OST rights (to two separate companies) in the fall of 2012 became the subject of a police investigation for embezzlement and breach of trust. Kim was sued in February 2013 under the charge that he had embezzled 2 billion for personal use and summoned by police for ongoing investigation. He took his own life on July 23, 2013, by carbon dioxide, in a gositel room. This tragic death and many of the \\"ills\\" of Korean dramas have been attributed to the outsourcing of production to independent companies which struggle to cover the exorbitant cost of writers and stars. ==Awards and nominations== {  - !

The company is market leader in each country, with the exception of Belgium and Tunisia. ==History== Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont was formed in 2001 when the French film production and distribution companies Path√© and Gaumont merged their cinema operations, respectively owned by J√©r√¥me Seydoux and Nicolas Seydoux. Gaumont owned 34% and Path√© owned 66% of the shares in the joint venture. During the first years of operation the company was called Europalaces, but it was later changed to Les Cin√©mas Gaumont Path√©. On 1 March 2017, it was announced that Gaumont sold its 34% stake in Les Cin√©mas Gaumont Path√© to Path√© for ‚Ç¨380 million, Gaumont wanted to focus more on the production and distribution of content. The name of the company changed shortly thereafter to Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont. The Europalaces logo The company grew its circuit with several acquisitions throughout the years, notable acquisitions were MGM Cinemas in 1995, Minerva Cinemas in 2010 in The Netherlands; CinePointCom in 2015 in Belgium; EuropaCorp Cinemas in 2016, CineAlpes in 2019 in France and Euroscoop Cinemas in 2019 in The Netherlands and Belgium. The majority of the acquired cinemas were - or are in the process of being - converted to the Path√© brand. Until 2010 the company operated several cinemas in Italy, but these locations were closed due to difficulties in the Italian market. In 2018 Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont entered the African market by opening a cinema In Tunis, Tunisia, with plans in progress to open locations in Ivory Coast, Morocco and Senegal. ==Technologies== The company uses different technologies in their operations, like IMAX. The IMAX Corporation stated that it will strengthen its relationship with Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont. They will do that by expanding the total number of locations and also by upgrading existing locations to IMAX Laser with IMAX's 12-channel sound technology. The expanding and upgrading will start in 2018 and all locations will be upgraded by 2023, making Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont the first multi-territory network to be fully powered by IMAX Laser. The company also partnered with Dolby using their Dolby Atmos and Dolby Cinema products. In 2017 they partnered with the Korean company CJ 4DPlex to open the first 4DX location in France. During the Cannes Film Festival, it was announced that Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont will open 30 4DX cinemas throughout France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium before 2020. On 22 December 2017 CJ 4DPlex announced in a press release that they have extended their agreement by adding an additional 20 locations, bringing the total to 50. With the opening of the 500th 4DX location worldwide at Path√© Belle √âpine in April 2018, the company announced that they extended their partnership with CJ 4DPlex once with the opening of two ScreenX auditoriums in Paris in June 2018. Additionally, it has installed the first 4DX Screen theater, a combination of 4DX and ScreenX, outside the Asian region in Paris. ==Cinemas== A list of all current and future (green) theaters operated by Les Cin√©mas Path√© Gaumont. { class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\\" + class=\\"nowrap\\"  77 (+2) Cinemas !City !Cinema !Screens !Seats !

Since it was first synthesized in 1996, NAGly has been a primary focus of the relatively contemporary field of lipidomics due to its wide range of signaling targets in the brain, the immune system and throughout various other bodily systems. In combination with 2‚Äêarachidonoyl glycerol (2‚ÄêAG), NAGly has enabled the identification of a family of lipids often referred to as endocannabinoids. Recently, NAGly has been found to bind to G-protein coupled receptor 18 (GPR18), the putative abnormal cannabidiol receptor. NaGly is an endogenous inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and thereby increases the ethanolamide endocannabinoids AEA, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) levels. NaGly is found throughout the body and research on its explicit functions is ongoing. == Biosynthesis and degradation == The biosynthesis and degradation of NaGly is not completely understood. Using biochemical approaches, two proposed pathways include: 1) enzymatic conjugation of arachidonic acid and glycine and 2) the oxidative metabolism of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. In support of the former \\"direct\\" pathway of arachidonic acid and glycine conjugation and hydrolysis, the secreted enzyme PM20D1 and the intracellular amidase FAAH has been identified as enzymatic regulators of NAGly metabolism in mice. == Research  Effects on the nervous system=== NAGly has been hypothesized to have a neurophysiological function of pain suppression, supported by evidence that it suppresses formalin-induced pain behavior in rats. In particular, peripherally administered NAGly inhibited phase 2 pain behavior, suggesting either a direct suppression of nociceptive afferents on the nerve or an indirect modulation of the afferents' interstitial environment. In either case, these findings hold promise for NAGly as a means of mitigating postoperative or chronic pain. NAGly is also effective in acute pain models, reducing mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by intraplantar injection of Fruend's complete adjuvant. Similar mechanical allydonia induced by partial ligation of the sciatic nerve was also reduced by NaGly. Other arachidonic acid-amino acid conjugates did not have the same effects and the actions of NaGly were not affected by cannabinoid receptor agonists in either study, suggesting a novel non-cannabinoid receptor mediated approach to alleviate inflammatory pain. NaGly was shown to be endogenous ligand for the G-protein couple receptor GPR92 along with farnesyl pyrophosphate. In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where GPR92 was found to be localized NaGly increased intracellular calcium levels in DRG neurons, indicating a role of NaGly in the sensory nervous system through the activation of GPR92. === Effects on the immune system === NAGly has been the focus of research on the immune system because of its antinociceptive effects and inhibitory action on components of the immune system. Specifically, it significantly inhibited TNFŒ± and IFNŒ≥ production, and it shows potential as a therapeutic treatment for chronic inflammation. Moreover, NAGly has been shown to act as a substrate for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the enzyme primarily known for producing prostaglandins associated with increases in inflammation and hyperalgesia. In many mammalian tissues that express COX-2, significant levels of NAGly are naturally present, and in these tissues COX-2 selectively metabolizes NAGly prostaglandin (PG) H2 glycine and HETE-Gly. === Cell migration === NAGly has been hypothesized to induce cell migration in BV-2 microglia cells. The same research suggests that this migration occurs through GPR18. This was verified using GPR18 transfected HEK-293 cells. The same migration wasn't witnessed using non-transfected and GPR55 transfected HEK-293. Additionally, tetrahydrocannabinol and NaGly are full agonists at the GPR18 receptors and induce migration in human endometrial HEC-1B cells. Understanding functions of NaGly in such structures provides a promising future in helping treat diseases such as endometriosis. === Cellular respiration === NAGly powerfully stimulates oxygen consumption in multiple cell lines, including murine C2C12 myoblasts and human HEK293T cells. This respiratory bioactivity of NAGly is by increased uncoupled (state4u) mitochondrial respiration and depends on the presence of fatty acid desaturation. NAGly respiration bioactivity can be also abrogated in the presence of serum albumin, which functions as an NAGly carrier in murine blood plasma. ===Other targets=== Insulin secretion NaGly was identified as a novel insulin secretagogue and was shown to increase intracellular calcium concentration through stimulation of voltage dependent calcium channels. Additionally, this action was dependent on extracellular glucose level. Additional biochemical interactions NaGly has been shown to inhibit the glycine transporter GLYT2a in a non-competitive fashion with arachidonic acids and secondary messenger systems of GLYT2a, suggesting a novel recognition site for the N-arachodnoyl amino acids, especially because other conjugated amino acids had similar effects. == References == Category:Endocannabinoids Category:Fatty acid amides Category:Glycine reuptake inhibitors ","title":"N-Arachidonylglycine"},{"id":"35912302","text":"The Castle of Saignes facade The Ch√¢teau de Saignes is a ruined castle in the commune of Saignes in the Lot d√©partement of France.Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau de Saignes The castrum of Saignes, with its ancient chapel outside the enceinte, became the property of the Lagarde family in the 14th century.

He studied until 1916 at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts before participating as a soldier in the First World War, upon returning his painting teachers were Richard M√ºller and Otto Gussmann and in 1919 he began to teach as a professor at the private school Der Weg. In 1923 he had his first exposition in the gallery Der Sturm in which he showed photograms. When Der Weg opened a new academy in Berlin in 1927, he moved to the capital. He formed relations with other vanguardists in Berlin and practiced various experimental techniques such as solarization, multiple images and photograms, for which reason twelve of his works were considered degenerate art by the Nazi regime and were prohibited. Among the artists with whom he interacted are Kurt Schwitters, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, El Lissitzky and Alexander Archipenko. At the end of World War II he formed part of a Dresden artistic group known as K√ºnstlergruppe der ruf - befreite Kunst (Call to an art in freedom) along with Karl von Appen, Helmut Schmidt-Kirstein and Christoph Hans, among others. In this city he made an experimental report named Dresdner Totentanz (Dance of death in Dresden) as a condemnation of the bombing of the city. In 1946 he was named a member of the Academy of Art in the city. He participated in the controversy between socialist realism and formalism that took place in the German Democratic Republic, therefore his work was not realist and could not be shown in the country between 1949 and 1959. In 1955 he began to experiment with chemical painting, making photographs without the use of a camera and only with the use of chemical products such as the developer and the fixer and photographic paper, for which he made exposures to light using masks and templates. Between 1956 and 1967 he was a professor at the Academy of Cinema and Television of Potsdam.

Ballet folkl√≥rico is not just one type of dance, it encompasses each region's traditional dance that has been influenced by their local folklore and has been entwined with ballet characteristics to be made into a theatrical production. Each dance represents a different region in Mexico illustrated through their different zapateado, footwork, having differing stomps or heel toe points, and choreography that imitates animals from their region such as horses, iguanas, and vultures. ==History== Aztec nobles dancing as depicted in the post-Conquest Tovar Codex. Mexico's modern folk dance tradition is a blending of elements from its Indigenous, African, and European heritage. Before the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous dance developed with strong ties to the religious practices. For the Aztecs, there were two levels of dance, one for the common people, often related to the agricultural cycle and those for the elite. After the Conquest, the Spanish initially worked to eradicate indigenous dances, considering them ‚Äútoo pagan‚Äù and succeeded with a number of forms, especially those associated with the priest and ruling classes. However, they were unable to eradicate the more popular forms, especially in the rural and more inaccessible regions of New Spain. Instead, evangelizers worked to adapt dances to Christianity, giving them new meanings. For this reason, most of these dances have suffered at least some modification since the pre Hispanic era. Representation of indigenous dance of the 19th century. Dance evolved drastically from 1520 to 1750, mostly among the indigenous and mestizo descendants. One of the first adaptations was allowing the indigenous to continue dances with religious aspects but in homage to the Virgin Mary or other Catholic personage. One of the first areas to begin innovation was Tlaxcala, were dances to reenact the Conquest are traced. In addition, a number of European dances, music and instruments were introduced including Moros y cristianos (a mock battle between Moors and Christians brought t the central states), Los Archos, Las Escadas, Los Machetes, El Paloteo, Las Cintas and Los Doce Pares. Other European dances include La Zambra, La Zarabanda, La Contradanza, seguidillas, fandangos, huapangos, jotas, boleros, zambras and zapateados. In some cases, these dances were modified or given entirely new choreography in Mexico. Most of the traditional dances performed today took on their forms during the colonial period but they were not firmly part of Mexican identity until after the Mexican War of Independence when it received its first surge in popularity. For example, the jarabe dance of Jalisco, became a political tool to evoke feelings of patriotism and ‚Äúliberty.‚Äù In fact, this dance became intricately linked to the independence movement, causing it to be called the Jarabe Mexicano. Its popularity led to interest in other Mexican traditional dances, especially those danced to son music. Volador Despite modern and foreign influences in Mexico's culture in the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of nationalism have kept much of the country's folk dance tradition alive to the present day. The next wave of popularity came after the Mexican Revolution, which also created new songs in folk styles such as the still popular La Adelita, La Valentina, and La Cucaracha. The years after the Revolution also sparked interest in Mexico's indigenous heritage shifting away from the European emphasis of the Porfirian era. This was reinforced by the muralists and other artists of the 1920s and 1930s whose political aims were to forge a Mexican identity, rejecting foreign influences and politics. In the 1930s, the popularity of the dance prompted education and more formal training in it, with educational centers all over Mexico offering classes including the Departamento de Bellas Arts (Fine Arts Department) of Mexico City. Interest in folk dance declined in the 1950s and 1960s, but the Mexican government continued to subsidize it for its aesthetic and social value. This included the support of folk dance or ballet folkl√≥rico companies, the most famous of which is the Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico founded by Amalia Hern√°ndez in 1952. Dance as depicted in \\"Mexico, California and Arizona; being a new and revised edition of Old Mexico and her lost provinces\\" (1900). Today, traditional Mexican folk dance is a defining element of Mexico's popular culture nationally and internationally. Preservation and promotion of dances nationally have depended on whether they are seen as part of Mexico's national identity. It is one of the few areas where indigenous practices are conserved and promoted rather than depreciated or eliminated. One reason for this is ‚Äúindigenismo‚Äù the ongoing struggles of a number of indigenous communities to resist outside influences into their cultures and Mexican government efforts to assimilate them to create a homogenous national identity. Since the 1990s, these efforts have become more political in nature and have resulted in more interest in preserving pre Hispanic cultural forms. ( The government also works to preserve and promote a number of dance forms, with folk dance mandatory in public schools. In September 2011, 457 people set a Guinness record for the largest folk dance performance at the International Mariachi and Charreria Conference in Guadalajara, accompanied by over 300 mariachi musicians from Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia and the United States. Mexican folk dance has had an important impact on the culture of the United States, especially in Mexican American communities. This has not only included the preservation of dances that existed before the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in the US Southwest, but other dances, such as the Aztecas or Concheros, dance have migrated north since the 1970s. ==Diversity== Huapango dance Sinaloa Carnival of the Ballet Aztlan in Ottawa , Canada. Mexican folk dance is an uneven synthesis of different cultural traditions. Its historical roots is the synthesis of indigenous, European and African cultural influences but it continues to evolves with influences from modern pop culture. It is not one particular style but rather a collection of various regional and ethnic traditions. Dance traditions vary widely over Mexico's expanse. In some areas, such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Yucatan Peninsula, the pre Hispanic elements have almost completely disappeared. In others, such as Totonacapan (in the states of Veracruz and Puebla), among the Nahuas of Guerrero and State of Mexico, the Huastecs of San Luis Potos√≠ and areas in the northwest of the country, indigenous elements have been strongly maintained. Those considered native or indigenous include Los Voladores, Los Quetzales, and the Deer Dance. Dances that survive relatively intact are in areas that were remote from colonial authorities. However, their ‚Äúpurity‚Äù is under debate. Most of the ancient dances have been modified in various ways, although most of these are superficial with the basic movements remaining intact from the pre Hispanic period. The aspect to change most has been costuming. The materials used to produce dance costumes, adapting to new materials and the loss of old ones. The use of hides and feathers is the oldest of costuming traditions, but today costumes can be made of synthetic fabrics and other modern elements. One common substitution is the use of mirrors on costumes to replace polished stones. Jalisco jarabe Woman doing typical dance of the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Instruments used to accompany the dancers have changed to include those from Europe, but pre Hispanic ones, especially drums and flutes, are still used. However, as many dances are still tied to religious events, knowing how to play the traditional songs and dance the traditional dances still gives dancers and musicians social stature, as they are keepers of tradition and expected to pass it along to the next generation. Conchero dance blowing conch shell in Amecameca. Traditional dance generally involves the history and/or the cosmology of the people who perform it, and is a part of the social cohesion of that group. While varying widely, many folk dances in Mexico share some common elements. Animals that appear in these dances are generally those that were religiously significant to pre-Hispanic indigenous people. These animals include deer, serpents, eagles, and jaguars. After the Conquest, dancers added other animals--such as horses, bulls, and roosters. Masks are used in various ways in Mexican dance. They can be used to ‚Äútransform‚Äù the dancer into a character, either metaphorically or religiously, it can be used to hide the dancer's identity for festivals such as Carnival to allow for pranks and/or it can be used for social commentary, for example a farmer wearing a mask and military-style clothing to protest corrupt police. The use of mirrors on costumes are to represent the life force of the sun as its light is reflected as the dancers move. Most Mexican traditional dance shows indigenous and/or European heritage, but there are some that show the country's African past, especially in Veracruz and the Costa Chica region in Guerrero and Oaxaca. Like indigenous dances, African based ones often involved the use of masks, costumes and other props that carry various meanings with the dances themselves function as a form of social cohesion. In Veracruz, best known ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù dances include Los Negritos, along with various huapangos and sons. In the Costa Chica, the best known of these dances include Los Diablos, Las Tortugas and Toro de Petate. Generally, folk dance is popular and well supported by various government efforts, but not all to the same extent. Those considered representative of the country and popular outside their home region, such as the jarocho or jarabe receive regional and federal support. Those without that type of popularity are performed mostly in local and regional religious events. While much support is geared to preserving dance forms, art forms outside of Mexico still have influence. Traditional dance is taught alongside more modern dance such as salsa, merengue and hip hop in various schools and cultural centers across the country with some crossover effect. ==Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico== Ballet Folkorico de Mexico 1970. Typical Mexican dance. Representation in Culture Week. Jarana yucateca Mexico's best known folk dance troupe is the Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico, which was founded by dancer Amalia Hern√°ndez in 1952. The troupe consists of forty dancers, a mariachi band and sixteen other musicians. Counting support staff such as costume and set designers, the organization involves over 600 people. The group began with eight dancers with sporadic performances until they were invited to perform on television for a program called Funci√≥n de Gala. Since 1959, it has performed regularly at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. In 1970 was named the official folk dance company of Mexico. Amalia Hern√°ndez was a pioneer in ballet folkl√≥rico, she experimented with traditional Mexican dances that were originally created for religious purposes. Hernandez infused Mexican folk legends with ballet influences such as pointed toes, exaggerated movements, and highly choreographed routines. Hernandez was able to shift the dances from their original religious purposes, not meant to be watched, into the theatrical production that ballet folkl√≥rico is known for today. Hernandez has become a cultural ambassador for Mexico through her work with the dance troupe, choreographing more than forty different ballets covering sixty regions of Mexico. It wasn't until her death in 2000 at the age of 84, that the troupe gained a new director her grandson Salvador L√≥pez. The repertoire maintains the traditional dances although somewhat updated with the choreography of L√≥pez. Dances include the Jarabe tapat√≠o, the Deer Dance and the Aztecs/Concheros. It also has ‚Äúnew‚Äù dances such as Adelitas, which honors the women of the Mexican Revolution. The group has performed over 15,000 times in sixty counties and 300 cities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. It has an average of 250 performances per year. ==Dances in Central Mexico Queretaro === Concheros dancer in Ixcateopan de Cuauht√©moc. The Concheros dance is also known as Apaches, Indios and Chichimecas. It is a ritual dance that likely developed after 1522 as a means of preserving some elements of pre Hispanic culture. Members of these dance troupes are part of formal societies and unlike some other groups admit women. These troupes perform at annual festival mostly in honor of patron saints-- especially in the Villa de Guadalupe, Amecameca, Chalma and Los Remedios. These are located north, east, south, and west of Mexico City, a remnant of the importance of the cardinal directions to indigenous people. Dancers dress in indigenous style garb that can include loincloths, feathered headdresses body paint and more. They are accompanied by indigenous drums, flutes and small lutes made from armadillo shells (showing European influence). The symbolism and most of the steps are indigenous. === Mexico City === Chinelos in Colonia Doctores, Mexico City The Chinelos dance is derived from Carnival celebrations in what are now the south of Mexico City, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Since Carnival celebrations allow the wearing of masks for anonymity and behaviors not normally tolerated, a tradition arose for the indigenous to make fun of the Spanish elite and their dress through the dance. The word ‚Äúchinelos‚Äù is derived from the Nahuatl word zineloquie, which means ‚Äúdisguised.‚Äù Chinelos dancers wear masks imitating the fair skin and beards of the Spanish along with elaborate dress and gloves. They are the best known Carnival dancers in Mexico with Morelos have the most groups. The Chinelo dancers are now a symbol of the state of Morelos, with the tradition increasing with more towns having dance troupes and it is possible to see troupes dancing at times other than Carnival. It is even possible to hire Chinelos dancers for special occasions. The Danza de los Quetzales is performed in Puebla. The Huehues dance is performed by the Totonaca and is similar to the Quetzales dance. The headdress is smaller and less ostentatious. The Ocho Vicios (Eight Vices) involves a number of dancers who represent the eight vices as well as an angel, a devil, a doctor and a priest. It involves a number of movements and spoken text. It is similar to a dance called the Siete Pecados (Seven Sins). Danza de los Tres Poderes (Dance of the Three Powers) is a moral tale similar to Siete pecados and Ocho vicios, which was introduced by the evangelizers to the indigenous. The main protagonists are the Archangel Michael, the Devil and a personification of death. Segadores contains a number of characters, which includes the ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù who pays his workers with money from the Mexican Revolution called ‚Äúbilimbiques,‚Äù workers who become lazy and a woman who tends a store but in reality is a man. This dance is performed in some small communities in the State of Mexico. === Puebla === Acatlaxquis is an Otomi dance with pre Hispanic origins but uses a pan-style flute for accompaniment. The dancers form and arch with sugar cane stalks forming a kind of cupola. This dance is most often performed in the Pahuatl√°n municipality, along with the Voladores. The Danza de los Arcos is done by men who carry large arches decorated with paper flowers and dance in rows. Their costumes are white with colorful sashes across the chest. It is mostly performed in Hidalgo, State of Mexico and Puebla. Arrieros dancers Arrieros dancers wear white costumes, sometimes with leather chaps, and ride decoratively dressed donkeys.

The castle belonged for eight centuries to the Viscounts of Turenne who built the two towers, the only vestiges of the construction, after the sackings of the French Wars of Religion. Louis XI was the owner. It passed into the ownership of the Noailles family, and was bought by Lafon du Verdier in 1895 who completed the remaining buildings of the current manor. The castle was transformed by Jean Lur√ßat who, in 1945, set up his tapestry studio there. ==Description== The castle ruins consist of parts of the enceinte and two square towers, one dating from the 13th century and the other from the 15th. The corps de logis, rebuilt in the 19th century in a neo-medieval style, was acquired by the painter and tapestry maker Jean Lur√ßat, who set up his workshop there, decorating the walls, ceilings, doors and windows. Numerous works of the artist are preserved here, including tapestries, paintings and ceramics made between 1943 and his death in 1966. The logis and the furniture were given to the d√©partement by his widow. The castle is the property of the d√©partement. It is open to the public for six months of the year.

McIntosh and S.M. McKay. (1975). \\"Alvar vegetation in Southern Ontario.\\" Ontario Field Biol. 29(2):1-25.Brunton, D.F. (1986). A life science inventory of the Burnt Lands.

(2002). \\"Plant community composition and relationships of disturbed and undisturbed alvar woodland.\\" Canadian Field-Naturalist 116: 571-579. Because of its significance, The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has designated ca of the alvar as an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. A smaller parcel of several hundred hectares is protected within the Burnt Lands Provincial Park (Nature Reserve). It is a popular destination with local naturalists, including bird-watchers and photographers. ==Description== Some of the distinctive plants found here include Cooper's milk vetch and Ram's-Head Ladyslipper. There are 82 breeding bird species and 48 butterfly species. The alvar is thought to have existed in some form since the end of the last ice age, since it has globally rare snails (Vertigo hannai) and even a kind of carabid beetle found nowhere else in the world.https://www.ottawagatineaugeoheritage.ca/subsites/22 The CFS Carp Almonte Detachment, a decommissioned military radio receiver, is located in the Alvar. Threats to the alvar include urban sprawl, subdivisions, quarries, illegal dumping of household trash and construction materials, illegal sand quarrying,Immerseel, JM (2001). Burnt Lands Interim Management Statement page 6. http://files.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/parks-and-protected- areas/mnr_bpp0319.pdf and all-terrain vehicles. There is also a problem with jack pine trees, once planted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, that are now shading out some of the rare plant species; some experts suggest that these trees need to be removed.Keddy, P.A. (2008). Earth, Water, Fire: An Ecological Profile of Lanark County. Motion Creative Printing, Carleton Place, ON. General Store Publishing House Renfrew, ON. 73 p., p.57 A fire in 1999 removed some of the encroaching forest and produced open meadows, which, in 2008 had nearly twice the number of plant species as in adjoining unburned areas.Catling, Paul M. (2009). \\"Vascular plant biodiversity in burned and unburned alvar woodland: more evidence of the importance of disturbance to biodiversity and conservation.\\" Canadian Field-Naturalist 123(3): 240‚Äì245. ==Burnt Lands Provincial Park== The alvar is protected within the Burnt Lands Provincial Park. The park consists of two non-contiguous parcels of land, totaling of land. It is a non-operating park without any visitor activities or facilities. ==See also== *Panmure Alvar - nearby similar alvar == References  * Ontario Parks official website Category:Protected areas of Lanark County Category:Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest Category:Parks in Ottawa Category:Alvars (landform) ","title":"Burnt Lands alvar"},{"id":"35912449","text":"Piero Luigi Vigna (1 August 1933 - 28 September 2012) was an Italian magistrate.

Knighted for services to business and charity in 2011, Reed is a high-profile charity donor and organiser. His various charitable initiatives have given away over ¬£112m, mostly in support of women, addiction, overseas development, education and the arts. Reed has founded seven charities, several companies, two schools and is the author of four business books. His current job title at Reed is Founder at Large. ==Early life== Reed was born in 1934 in Hounslow, Middlesex.David Teather, 'Alec and James Reed: recruitment is just the job for father and son', Guardian.co.uk, 3 June 2010; retrieved 10 July 2012. His father Leonard was a lithographic artist for the UK's Ministry of Information during WWII, supervising the production of a number of government information posters, including the original version of the Ministry's \\"Keep Calm and Carry On\\" poster. Reed's mother Nancy was a housewife and former employee of the Prudential Insurance firm. In his autobiography, Reed writes that his earliest memory is listening with his family to Neville Chamberlain's 1939 speech declaring war on Germany, a speech that so alarmed his parents that they fled London in a neighbour's car the same day, thinking invasion imminent, only to return \\"...before teatime\\" after concluding that nowhere in the country would be safe. A child of The Blitz, Reed has described his childhood as generally \\"secure\\", though he has also said that much of his early motivation came from feeling overshadowed by his older brother. Along with a milkround, Reed's first business venture was started alongside his brother while both were still children: the pair made and sold toy soldiers forged from lead that had been salvaged from local bombed-out houses. Reed attended Drayton Manor Grammar School. At the end of his first year his school report said: \\"Conduct very unsatisfactory. He is lazy, inattentive and exerts himself to prevent his neighbours from working. He could do much better if he were more ambitious\\". Reed failed his 11-Plus exam; he left school aged 16 to work for a motor vehicle exporter in London's Fenchurch Street, having also failed to get the grades to enter agricultural college and pursue his ambition of becoming a farmer. Reed's mother encouraged him to study a Chartered Secretary's course in the evenings during his day job at the exporters. He was called up to National Service in 1952. He tried for a commission with the Royal Engineers but was rejected after his Brigadier deemed him to be a \\"...muddled thinker\\". Reed left the army in 1954 to work as a trainee accountant for Gillette in Osterley, having passed his Chartered Secretary qualification the year before, at the third attempt. Keen to be self-employed, Reed pursued a number of sideline businesses while still at Gillette, including making his own brand of aftershave that he brewed in his mother's kitchen and sold door-to-door. Reed also began working evenings and weekends in an estate agency in Hounslow, again while still at Gillette. The agency‚Äôs premises was split into two businesses, with one side selling property and the other side selling carpets. Noticing that the carpet business was struggling, Reed approached the owner (who was the father of Reed's then-girlfriend) and offered to rent the carpet portion of the premises for his fledgling employment agency, funding the launch with ¬£75 taken from his Gillette pension fund. On 7 May 1960, the 26-year-old Reed opened the first branch of Reed Employment. It went on to become one of Britain's largest privately owned businesses, with 441 business units in 163 locations worldwide, employing over 3,000 people.Reed profile, princes-trust.org.uk, accessed 10 June 2014. ==Career at Reed== First branch of Reed Employment agency, 1960Reed has held the positions of Chief Executive, Executive Chairman, non-executive Chairman and Founder at Large during his career at the Reed group of companies. In 1997 he stepped down as Chief Executive to become Chairman, handing control of the company to his son James; to mark the handover, Reed presented his son with a conductor's baton in a glass case. Reed became non-executive chairman in 2000 and Founder at Large in 2004, a position he still holds and which he assumed after his son James succeeded him as chairman in the same year. Reed remains a significant minority shareholder, through both his personal holding and that of the Reed Foundation, to which he donated 18% of all shares in the company. === Other business ventures === In 1970, Reed founded Inter-Company Comparisons, now ICC PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of a Swedish business group. In 1974, he also founded Medicare Limited, a 50-branch drug store with 500 employees, now part of Superdrug.\\"Why Choose Reed Business School?\\" , Reed Business School Website; accessed 10 June 2014. Reed would later write that he started Medicare simply to smooth out the cash flow performance of his then-publicly quoted companies. He is a noted critic of the administrative burden of running public companies, and has compared his experience of running the Reed group as a public company to being an \\"...unpaid greyhound on a racetrack called the stock market\\". He would later blame the stress of running Medicare for his diagnosis of colon cancer; the business was sold as part of his recuperation, at his wife's insistence. From 1985 to 1989 Reed was the honorary chairman and chief exec of Andrews and Partners Estate Agency. He took the business from a loss of ¬£297,000 in 1985 to profits of just over ¬£1m in 1986. The profits were used to buy out the existing shareholders and transfer ownership to three Christian charities. He writes in his autobiography that \\"Most of the non- executive directors were also devout Christians who prayed before every meeting. Despite this, I found them extremely difficult to deal with in subsequent negotiations...that episode may have been the beginning of my disillusionment with Christianity\\". ==Philanthropy== Reed has described encouraging philanthropy as his ‚Äú‚Ä¶main mission now\\". He is the founder of seven charities, including Womankind Worldwide, Ethiopiaid, Reed Restart at Holloway Prison, Women at Risk, and the Alec Reed Academy. In 1985, he established The Reed Foundation, a charitable foundation that provides much of the seed funding for his charity work. In 2007 he launched TheBigGive.co.uk, now one of the UK's foremost charitable giving sites. ===The Reed Foundation=== The Reed Foundation is the main vehicle for Reed‚Äôs philanthropic activities. It was founded in 1985 with Reed's ¬£5m entire personal proceeds from the ¬£20m sale of Medicare. The Foundation owns 18% of Reed Group, hence Reed‚Äôs remark that the firm‚Äôs employees \\"work one day a week for charity\\". As of 2012 it reported total funds of ¬£13.91m. Reed is one of four Foundation trustees, along with his three children. The Foundation has financed numerous charitable initiatives, including: The Big Give Founded in 2007, TheBigGive.org.uk is a non-profit, charitable website which enables donors to find and support charity projects in their field of interest. Reed has referred to it as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a Wikipedia for big givers\\" and \\"his biggest success\\". It reports raising in excess of ¬£129m for charities and supporting 9500 ongoing charity projects. The site now hosts ¬£1.3bn worth of projects in need of funding. The Big Give inverts the traditional model of charity funding in which donors are contacted by charities, to a model in which donors effectively \\"compare and shop\\" for charity projects, and then have their donations matched by other donors. Reed founded the site in response to receiving an unmanageable number of appeals from charities seeking donations from high-profile philanthropists. The project was designed to encourage wealthy philanthropists potentially seeking to make donations between ¬£100,000 and ¬£10m. Having attracted few donors at that level, Reed switched to a match funding model, in which he put up ¬£1m and requested other donors to match him; reportedly the site‚Äôs users matched Reed‚Äôs ¬£1m within 45 minutes of it going live. The site now makes use of \\"challenge matching\\", in which donors effectively compete to be the first to kickstart a given charity project. In addition to projects uploaded by charities, the site also runs emergency appeals (such as for victims of the 2014 Philippines hurricane and the 2013 Syrian refugee crisis, and an annual Christmas Challenge), in which Reed‚Äôs funds (and those of external foundations) are joined with pledges from charities' own major donors, in order to double online donations made by the public. The 2013 Christmas Challenge raised ¬£11m for 387 charities and included match funding from the Cabinet Office, The Prince‚Äôs Trust and The Jamie Oliver Foundation. The Big Give also helps charities to find trustees and runs educational programmes in schools in order to raise children‚Äôs awareness of philanthropic giving. The organisation's Board of Philanthropists include Lord Bell, Lord Gavron CBE, Lord Haskins, Sir Adrian Cadbury, Sir Charles Dunstone, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho, Jon Snow and Michael Spencer Ethiopiaid Ethiopiaid works with local community partners in Ethiopia to alleviate poverty, support the elderly, empower women and girls, help children with disabilities and increase access to health care and education. Reed founded the charity with a ¬£1m donation in 1989, having visited the Ethiopian capital in 1987 on a fact-finding tour organised and accompanied by Jembra Teferra, a relative of Haile Selassie and wife of a former mayor of the city. Reed had initially planned on promoting entrepreneurship in the area, but upon arrival was struck by Addis Ababa‚Äôs poor public sanitation, especially in the \\"kebeles\\" (poor urban neighbourhoods). Reed subsequently underwrote a two-year project to develop the kebeles, and arranged pledges for additional financial assistance from Water Aid, Help the Aged and Band Aid. Ethiopiaid has gone on to donate ¬£28m in funding and match-funding. The charity now partners with around 14 local Ethiopian organisations, providing around ¬£2m in donations. One of Ethiopiaid's best-known and longest-standing partners is the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, which helps to treat Ethiopian women marginalised by the social and medical complications arising from post- birth fistula. Ethiopiaid also funds reconstructive operations for sufferers of facial disfiguration caused by noma (a facially disfiguring disease caused by malnutrition and poor sanitation), animal bites and tumours. Womankind Worldwide As with Ethiopiaid, Womankind Worldwide was set up with a ¬£1m donation from Reed in 1989. The charity supports women suffering from abuse, neglect and illness; it also educates against female circumcision and child marriage. Patrons include Kate Adie, Sandi Toksvig and Lady Helena Kennedy QC. In 2006 WomanKind Worldwide was merged with Women at Risk, a UK charity founded by Reed in 1997 which works in support of women suffering physical and mental abuse. Women at Risk generated over ¬£1million for beneficiaries, including female survivors of acid attacks. the charity work with more than 40 partner organisations in 15 countries and claims to have reached millions of women and their families worldwide. Reed Restart Founded in HMP Holloway in 1993, Reed Restart was a not-for-profit charity dedicated the rehabilitation and assistance of women prisoners, helping them to become more employable on release. The pilot scheme at HMP Holloway was extended to provincial gaols, including Eastwood Park Women‚Äôs Prison. The Alec Reed Academy This 4-18 coeducational establishment in Northolt, England was one of the first academies to be created under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. It is composed of the former Compton High School and Northholt Primary School. Both areas are close to Reed‚Äôs childhood home in Hounslow, and to his former school, Drayton Manor Grammar. Reed‚Äôs involvement with the Academy began in November 2001, when he sponsored Compton High School. In 2012 the West London Academy was renamed The Alec Reed Academy, in honour of its sponsor. The school has a sports and enterprise specialism. Its catchment area has a high percentage of Indian, Pakistani and Polish families; 52% of pupils do not speak English as a first language. 60% of its pupils achieve Level 4 or above in reading, writing and maths. A 2010 Ofsted inspection saw the school rated as \\"Good\\"; Ofsted‚Äôs 2014 inspection, which was marked under Oftsed‚Äôs revised scoring regime, saw the school listed as \\"requiring improvement\\". The 2014 report noted that ‚Äú‚Ä¶senior managers and leaders have accurately identified the areas of the academy requiring further improvement. Their actions are beginning to have an impact on improving teaching and raising standards\\" Reed has spoken of the \\"tremendous freedom\\" he was given to shape the Academy‚Äôs approach, noting that he decided the school‚Äôs aims and ethos, chose its headmaster and commissioned the design of its buildings, from Foster & Partners. Reed contributed ¬£2m of the ¬£40m required to launch the Academy. He has also described his involvement as ‚Äú‚Ä¶an interesting lesson in what happens when private-sector culture meets state-funded culture\\". He writes of incurring criticism for his ideas on education, notably his view that the school did not need a significant library in the internet age, nor should it teach foreign languages, owing to the multilingual composition of the school's intake and the primacy of the English language in global business. === Other philanthropic projects === Reed is the founder of a number of not-for-profit initiatives prior to the Reed Foundation, including the Reed Business School and Addicts Rehabilitation: Reed Business School Reed Business School Reed Business School is a not-for-profit residential accountancy college specialising in qualifications such as ACCA, CIMA, ICAEW and CII. The school is based in Reed‚Äôs former home, a 15th Century Jacobean manor house in Little Compton, England. The house was purchased with the proceeds of the Reed Group‚Äôs stockmarket flotation in 1971, after which Reed donated the house to the Reed Charity. It opened in 1972 as The Reed College of Accountancy, changing its name to Reed Business School after the formation of the Reed Educational Trust in 1980. The school‚Äôs trading profits are donated to the Trust and distributed to numerous educational charities. Addicts Rehabilitation Reed‚Äôs first charity was set up in the 1970s to help the recovery and rehabilitation of drug addicts. In a 2011 interview with CIMAGlobal.com, Reed said > \\"About ten years after we started Reed, the company had become big enough to > be made public. I was based in Bond Street and at about that time the > Observer newspaper ran a series of articles about people who were having > difficult lives. They invited potential volunteers to contact charity > organisations, and because I was in Bond Street, I went to work with a drug > addiction charity in Covent Garden. Then people began to find out that I was > an employment agent and they were all after me to help them get jobs. A lot > of them weren't job ready, though, so we started an employment agency for > drug addicts [ARC ‚Äì Addicts Rehabilitation Charity]. Our best support came > from small and medium sized companies, where the manager really owned the > company and could make the decision ‚Äì 'yes, I can give this guy a chance.' > The big companies were more bureaucratic and weren't able to do that so > readily\\" In the 1970s Reed bought Keveral Farm in Cornwall where addicts could spend time in recovery. From 1989 to 1992, Reed served on Oxfam's fundraising committee. Reed described his approach to philanthropy in a 2013 interview with Coutts: > \\"I believe it‚Äôs better for donors to separate the decision about how much > money to spend on charitable giving, from the act of giving to charity. By > deciding how much you want to give away and ring-fencing it in a foundation, > you can elevate the satisfaction you get from giving and make it easier to > make the gift. Once you‚Äôve done that, you can continue your research and > decide which good causes you wish to support. I call this 'Disneyland > Giving': theme park visitors pay once at the gate and are then free to enjoy > the rides. I'm still enjoying giving away money I 'spent' on charity 20 > years ago.\\" Reed is currently serving as an Enterprise Fellow for The Prince's Trust. ==Awards and honours== * Made a Knight Batchelor for services to business and charity in the 2011 New Year's Honours List.\\"The Charity Insight Interview with Sir Alec Reed\\" , by Becky Slack, charityinsight.com; 24 January 2011. * Invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his charitable services in 1994. * A Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA; awarded its outstanding contribution to business performance award. * Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). * Fellow of the Beacon Charitable Trust, an Honorary Fellow of Royal Holloway, University of London and an Honorary Doctor of The Open University. * Professor of Enterprise and Innovation at Royal Holloway until 2001; visiting Professor to London Guildhall University, which merged with the University of North London to become London Metropolitan University in 2002, where he also has an Honorary Doctorate; an Honorary Professor of Warwick University. * Awarded a Beacon Fellowship and overall winner of the 2010 Beacon Prize.\\"Sir Alec Reed Joins RI's Hall of Fame\\" , recruitment- international.co.uk; accessed 10 June 2014. * Recruitment International's Hall of Fame, inducted 2011.\\"Sir Alec Reed awarded at CIMA's annual bash\\", by Kevin Reed, Accountancy Age, 23 November 2011; accessed 10 June 2014. ==Arts patronage== link=https://eacartawards.org.uk/galleries-pg2.aspx?cp=4Reed credits his wife Adrianne as being responsible for his interest in the arts. He is a ballet enthusiast and a noted donor to the Royal Ballet. He also reports donating ¬£100,000 to the Royal Opera House. Reed also invested in noted English choreographer Matthew Bourne's original ballets \\"Dorian Gray\\" and \\"Cinderella,\\" with profits on the former production enabling a large investment in the latter. Bourne's \\"Cinderella\\" is notable for setting the classic story during World War II and transforming the prince of the traditional fairy tale into an injured RAF pilot. The ballet played to full houses at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Reed has described Bourne as \\"a creative genius\\". In his autobiography Reed expresses interest in moving The Royal Ballet from its current home at the Royal Opera House to the London Coliseum, though he calls this ambition \\"probably a pipe dream\\". Reed is an amateur painter, with a focus on portraits. He wrote that painting \\"...particularly helped me get through chemotherapy after my second run-in with cancer\\". He studied with portrait painter Ken Payne and at the Heatherley School of Fine Art. Reed won a national prize for those over sixty years old for his self- portrait Nice Hat, in which he is portrayed wearing a trilby. ==Teaching== Reed became a member of the governing council of Royal Holloway, University of London, in 1979, subsequently becoming the chairman of the college's finance committee. After the formation of the Royal Holloway School of Management in 1990, Reed recruited high-profile guest speakers and donated to the library. He also taught an interactive entrepreneurship course for undergraduates at the school called LIES (Leadership, Innovation and Enterprise Studies). Reed made his students turn up on time \\"...to introduce them to the basics of business life\\"; latecomers were fined ¬£1, paid into a fund which purchased confectionery for the class. In 1999 Reed was asked by Tony Blair to investigate a decline in teacher training enrollment. ==Publications== Reed is the author of several books, including: * Returning to Work (1989), published by Kogan Page: * Innovation in Human Resource Management (2001), published by CIPD: * Capitalism is Dead: Peoplism Rules (2002), published by McGraw-Hill: * I Love Mondays ‚Äì Autobiography (2012), published by Profile Books; ==Personal life== Reed is married with three children and 11 grandchildren. He and his wife live in a two-bedroom house in Kensington and a converted cottage in Little Compton, Warwickshire. Debretts list his interests as family, portrait painting, theatre, cinema, tennis, riding, ballet and bridge. He has a lifelong interest in farming and equestrianism, having joined the Young Farmers aged 14. In 2009 he purchased at auction nine lots of land comprising 1600 acres of the estate of Kiddington Hall in the Cotswolds, Oxfordshire; Reed has written of plans to turn the land into a residential equestrian estate. Reed has said that his early charity work was informed by his conversion to Christianity in his 20s. He is now an atheist and a member of Humanists UK. The Reed Foundation does not fund religious organisations. He has twice recovered from cancer, after receiving a diagnosis of colon cancer in 1986 and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. The latter left a significant scar on his forehead, which he refers to as his \\"Mail On Sunday headline\\", after being in dispute with the newspaper at the time of his diagnosis. When asked how he would like to be remembered, Reed said: > \\"I hope people will remember me as both entrepreneurial and lucky - someone > who laughed a lot and attempted to improve the lives of others. I do not > just mean the poor in Africa...I also mean those rich people suffering from > financial obesity. I hope I have been able to direct their giving in a more > fulfilling way and to introduce them to charities with which they feel a > strong bond but which they might never have encountered were it not for The > Big Give...

Another imposing piece from before the war is his Avismanden Leitriz (1935), depicting a newspaperman dressed in the clothes he wore when selling newspapers in the streets of Copenhagen.\\"Knud Nellemose (1908-97): Avismanden Leitriz, 1935.

Highly productive in both stone and bronze, Nellemose created the Marble Church statues of S√∏ren Kierkegaard (1972) and Bernhard Severin Ingemann (1988) as well as many groups of footballers. Among his many portraits, some focused on the face, others as half figures, are those of the archaeologist Peter Vilhelm Glob (1979) and the architect Steen Eiler Rasmussen (1988). Under the German occupation during the Second World War, Nellemose was a member of the Frit Danmark resistance group. As a result, he received many commissions for war memorials including those for Silkeborg (1946) and for the 4th of May Dormitory in Aarhus (1953). His Erindring (Remembrance) from 1987 is a striking representation of a prisoner from a concentration camp. From 1939, Nellemose exhibited as a member of the Decembrist artists and from 1946 at Den Frie Udstilling. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

It organizes national, international and friendly tournaments for national and club teams / representatives, amateur events and competitions for the disabled. He also organized the Topolino Trophy five times (from 1992 to 1996), in collaboration with The Walt Disney Company Italia, as well as the Mediterranean Cup (male and disabled) and the Mundialito Cup. It is based in Milan and the current President is Axel Paderni, in office since July 2009. It is the only Italian sports federation recognized by the Asociaci√≥n Mundial de Futsal (AMF) and, therefore, the only one authorized to use international trademarks and logos. == History of the Federation == The Associazione Italiana Football Sala (AIFS) was founded in 1987 by a group of shareholders led by Giovanni Conticini. Following the recognition by the European Popular Movement, in 1988 the new president Giovanni Caminiti changed the name to Federazione Italiana Football Sala. It was immediately recognized by the international futsal governing body Federa√ß√£o Internacional de Futebol de Sal√£o (FIFUSA). It was among the founders of the Union Europea de Futsal (UEFS) . In 1991, the Federation got even to organize the World Championship in Milan and in 1992 it took part in the European Championship held in Porto (Portugal) from the old Spanish UEFS. In 1994, it took part for the last time in a World Cup organized by FIFUSA, but the result was disappointing because the Italian national team ranked in last place. It organized 5 times (from 1992 to 1996), in collaboration with The Walt Disney Company Italy, the Trofeo Topolino (Mickey Mouse‚Äôs Trophy), besides Mediterranean Cup (male and disabled) and the Mundialito Cup. Concerning the clubs‚Äô competitions, from 1988 to 1998 FIFS sent the teams who won the national championship to participate in the Champions League Cup: in the 1991‚Äôs edition the AS Milan ranked seventh, in 1992 and 1993 the same placement was reached by GS Danypel Milan, while in 1995 Sporting Turro finished the tournament in the eighth place. At the end of the 1990s, due to President Caminiti‚Äôs serious health problems, the Federation stopped its agonistic activity and remained dormant until the summer of 2009 when, with the advent of Axel Paderni, its activities started again. In 2009, it joined the International Futsal World League Association, created in Switzerland with the goal to preserve and promote in the world futsal, working to make more and more athletes play it. It was composed by 15 countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Monaco, Seborga, Switzerland, Tunisia. The history of this association lasted only three years: in September 2012, after the European Mediterranean Cup‚Äôs carrying out in Imperia, its dissolution was decreed. In July 2012, after the AMF‚Äôs World Ordinary Congress in Asunci√≥n (Paraguay), FIFS received an invitation from Asociaci√≥n Mundial de Futsal to take part to the world scene: in October 2012, in fact, its entry is ratified.AMF's Official Website , Official news of FIFS‚Äô affiliation to AMF. In November 2013 after 19 years of absence, it participates in the World Female Championship AMF in Barrancabermeja in Colombia, reaching the 12th position and the victory of the Fair Play Cup. From September 29 to October 3, 2014 it has been engaged in the European UEFS Qualification in LLoret de Mar to participate in the World Championship AMF on April 2015 in Belarus where it has not reached to the National Italian Football Hall Major qualification finishing in 4th place. The Italian National Under20 participated in October 2014 to the AMF World Cup in Chile finishing the event on the 10th place and, after 20 years of absence from European competitions Officers, it participated in December 2015 at the European Championship for National U21 in Lloret de Mar in Spain finishing at 5th place. The National Italian Male after 21 years of absence earns a memorable Second place in the European Championship UEFS which was played in Russia in Moscow on May 23 to 28 2016. ==Events in Italy== Each year the Federation organizes the Italian Championship for men‚Äôs club teams and, at the same time, the \\"Coppa Italia\\" (Italian Cup). After the regional phases - that take place between April and May -, the winners of each group will meet in June to stake the trophy in a place that changes every year (in 2012 it took place in Agrate Brianza). The winners of the two events will compete for the Italian Super Cup at the start of next season, while the champions of Italy will have the right to participate in the European Cup, organized every year too (in 2012 in Imperia). During the season there are various tournaments such as Lombardy Cup, Piedmont Male Cup, the women's teams of the Epiphany Cup, the Carnival Cup, the Mediterranean Cup and the Trofeo San Rocco. In addition, the Italian National Futsal AMF participated in several events organized by the AMF (Asociacion Mundial de Futsal) and its affiliates. The Federation is very attentive to the disabled and it decided to set up a special National Male participating also with excellent results in several tournaments, so as to give an opportunity of integration to who is often unfairly discriminatedd. It is so decided to organize a national championship dedicated to them: from October to February are played the Phases Center / North and Central / South, while in April it is played the national final. Every year in November, the Federation organizes a conference with a different theme intended to education, which was also joined by prominent members of the CIP (Italian Paralympic Committee). === Gold book of FIFS' Championship === {  - !

We would pick mussels and winkles from the rocks, gather the seaweed > laverbread, or search the cliffs for wild mushrooms.

Pressdee goes on to recount that the family had a fishing hut at Rhossili where they caught and cooked everything. The fishing hut was ‚Äúaptly named Kitchen Corner‚Äù and was the last point before the causeway to Worms Head:Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 10 Kitchen Corner, Worm‚Äôs Head, Rhossili > We would have hut feasts of the catch, cooked on a small Primus stove and a > feeble two-burner Calor Gas hob.

His books include London Oyster Guide, Food Wales and Streetwise Cookery. ==Restaurants== Pressdee ran two restaurants in Swansea which were probably the first to reference the Cuisine of Gower: The Drangway ('Drangway' being a word from the Gower dialect), which was located near Wind Street and The Oyster Perches, which was located in the Uplands and was named after the perches on which oysters are farmed. Oyster farming was a local industry off the coast of Mumbles in Gower until the early twentieth century (see: Cuisine of Gower). ==Shellfish== Pressdee has a particular interest in shellfish and has been a member of the Shellfish Association of Great Britain for over thirty years. He also promoted oysters in his own restaurants and presented programmes on oysters on the show Great Food Live on UKTV.

Jonathan Cape) Ultramarine is the first novel by English writer Malcolm Lowry. Published in 1933, the novel follows a young man aboard a steamer in the early 20th century and his struggle to gain acceptance from his crew mates. Lowry tinkered with the novel until his death, adapting it also to make it fit with his second novel, Under the Volcano (1947). ==Plot== Ultramarine is the story of Dana Hilliot, a young man of a well-to-do family who signs up to sail to the Far East on the Oedipus Tyrannus. The crew, and especially Andy, the \\"chinless cook\\", don't readily accept him as one of theirs because Dana is from a different socio-economic class: they all saw how his father, driving a luxury car, dropped him off at the ship, and they know that Dana doesn't need to work for a living as they do. Moreover, Dana is a mess-boy who is not particularly good at his work. The novel's action comes to a head when during shore leave, Dana has found enough courage in liquor to insult Andy, after which the two develop a kind of friendship. Along the way, Dana writes to and pines for his virginal girlfriend back home, Janet; his dedication to her is another challenge to him during shore leave, when his crew mates visit bars and brothels. ==Background and development== The novel was written from Lowry's own experience; he had sailed at age 18, starting as a deck hand, on a tramp steamer, and like Hilliot he had gotten permission from his father to delay entrance into university and go to sea for a year. Like Hiliot, Lowry was dropped off at the quay from the family limousine. Lowry's notes made during his voyage were the basis for two short stories (his first publications) that appeared in Experiment, a Cambridge magazine, in the early 1930s. According to Margerie Bonner, Lowry's wife and editor, these two stories were worked into the novel Ultramarine. The history of the novel's manuscript is muddled and contradictory: Lowry said he'd finished the novel at a friend's house but lost the manuscript, and the friend, Martin Case, later claimed to have found it in his trash can; according to Conrad Aiken, Lowry's idol and friend, a version was kept at his house and Lowry knew about it. The novel was published in 1933 by Jonathan Cape. Afterward, the name of the ship was changed from Nawab to Oedipus Tyrannus, \\"to conform with Hugh's ship in Under the Volcano.\\" ==References== Category:1933 British novels Category:British autobiographical novels Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:1933 debut novels ","title":"Ultramarine (novel)"},{"id":"35912717","text":"Cotyclytus is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

Best known as the father of Australian rules footballer Chris Lewis, a member of the West Coast Eagles' AFL premiership-winning teams in 1992 and 1994, he has been described as \\"something of a celebrity in Perth\\". ==Early life== Lewis was born on 21 April 1939 in Morawa, Western Australia, a mid west country town approximately 400 kilometres (250 mi) north of the state capital, Perth. A Yamatji, and the second-born in a family of eight children, he undertook his primary and early secondary schooling at the Morawa State School. In 1953, the Anglican Schools Board awarded Lewis a scholarship, to attend Christ Church Grammar School in Perth as a boarder, commencing in the second year of secondary school. His move to Perth was also supported financially by his parents, the Morawa branch of the Country Women's Association and the Department of Native Welfare. Lewis was dux of the Junior School, and obtained a Junior Certificate, in 1954. He was awarded a Leaving Certificate two years later. In his final year at Christ Church in 1956, he was a school prefect, and the captain of both the First XI cricket team and First XVIII Australian rules football team. After a minor academic setback, he also satisfied the requirements for matriculation. In March 1957, with the assistance of a Commonwealth Scholarship, and another scholarship from the National Union of Australian University Students, Lewis became the first Aboriginal student to attend the University of Western Australia (UWA). At UWA, Lewis enrolled in the Faculty of Arts, and was a prominent cricketer and footballer. However, he left UWA in 1958 to take up a position in the public service. ==Adult life== In the early 1960s, Lewis played in the West Australian Football League, for the Claremont Football Club. He was a member of Claremont's premiership-winning team in 1964. His teammates in that team included Ian Brayshaw (father of James Brayshaw) and John McIntosh (father of Ashley McIntosh). Between the late 1950s and late 1980s, Lewis became one of Australia's leading indigenous public servants. Meanwhile, his three sons, Clayton, Cameron and Chris, followed their father into the Claremont football team. The best known of the sons, Chris, was also a member of the West Coast Eagles' AFL premiership-winning teams in 1992 and 1994, and, like his father, played in a Claremont premiership-winning team, in 1996. After working in a variety of areas in Indigenous welfare and development, Lewis retired from the public service in 1989. ==Artist career and death== At about the time of his retirement, Lewis commenced a new career as an artist, working as a painter and with ceramics. He was a multiple finalist in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, and a finalist in numerous other contemporary art awards. In January 2020, the Claremont Football Club announced that he had died at the age of 80. ==Collections== Lewis's work is included in the following collections: *Aboriginal Affairs Department Collection *Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth *Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra *Australian National Maritime Museum, Sydney *Berndt Museum of Anthropology, University of Western Australia, Crawley *City of Stirling Collection, Stirling, Western Australia *City of Wanneroo Collection, Wanneroo, Western Australia *King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women Collection, Subiaco, Western Australia *National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne *Royal Perth Hospital Collection, Perth *Town of Victoria Park Collection, Victoria Park, Western Australia ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Australian Aboriginal artists Category:Australian painters Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:Claremont Football Club players Category:Indigenous Australians from Western Australia Category:People educated at Christ Church Grammar School Category:People from Morawa, Western Australia Category:University of Western Australia alumni ","title":"Irwin Lewis"},{"id":"35912888","text":"Batetsky (masculine), Batetskaya (feminine), or Batetskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Batetsky District, a district of Novgorod Oblast, Russia *Batetsky (rural locality), a rural locality (a settlement) in Novgorod Oblast, Russia ","title":"Batetsky"},{"id":"35912895","text":"The Ch√¢teau de Lastours is a ruined castle in the commune of Sainte-Croix in the Lot d√©partement of France.Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau de Lastours The castle dates from the 13th century, with additions and alterations form the 14th and 17th centuries.

The Observer. 5 October 2003. Retrieved 23 May 2012Full name and date of birth are taken from police mugshots as pictured in David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company, Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, 2004 is a Northern Irish loyalist and a former member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). He was best known as the commander and chief enforcer of West Belfast Brigade leader Johnny Adair's notorious C Company which operated on the Shankill Road. ==Early years== Born into a Protestant family in Belfast, Northern Ireland in May 1963, Hodgen grew up on Albertville Drive in the loyalist Lower Oldpark area, which is close to the Lower Shankill.Lister & Jordan, p. 30 In the early 1980s he joined a racist skinhead gang based in the Lower Shankill and Lower Oldpark areas which included Johnny Adair, Sam McCrory, \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson, James and Herbie Millar amongst its membership.Wood, pp. 155‚Äì156 Hodgen, Adair, McCrory and Thompson were all classmates at the Somerdale School on the Crumlin Road.Lister & Jordan, p. 27 and, although the gang still officially attended the school, they would frequently skip school, catch a public bus into the near-countryside and consume large quantities of cider. This was always procured by Hodgen, who was much taller than the rest of the gang and so appeared older than he actually was.Lister & Jordan, p. 28 Hodgen formed a close friendship with Adair during their time together in the skinhead gang. The gang began to gather outside the Buffs Club on the corner of the Crumlin Road and Century Street, where their numbers were swollen by other young men from in and around the Shankill. The imposing Hodgen, who for a time had a red-white-and-blue mohican and had tattoos on his head of the Union Flag and the legend \\"Oi! Skins\\", became the most recognised face of the gang.Lister & Jordan, p. 34 The gang became involved in petty crime, progressing steadily into more violent activities and even formed a Rock Against Communism-styled band called \\"Offensive Weapon\\". Although Hodgen did not play with the group he and another skinhead called Marty, who was English-based and more usually worked for Skrewdriver, were the band's road crew for their gigs. Part of the Offensive Weapon's performance would see Hodgen and Marty invade the stage at the end of the band's set and attack the band members, to the delight of the audience.Lister & Jordan, p. 36 The gang, which was part of a wider group in loyalist north and west Belfast known as the \\"NF Skinz\\" because of their vague support for the National Front, gained widespread notoriety on 14 January 1981 when \\"Seig Heiling\\" members launched a brutal attack on anti-racist fans of The Specials and The Beat when the two bands played a concert at the Ulster Hall.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 167‚Äì168 Hodgen was present at this event as well as the August 1983 \\"Gluesniffers March\\", when 200 skinheads descended on Belfast City Hall determined to riot with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament members, who were themselves holding a rally. The march took its name from the prevalence of solvent abuse among the skinheads.McDonald & Cusack, p. 169 The gang was not sanctioned by the UDA leadership, and their activities led to South Belfast brigadier John McMichael declaring that he wanted the gang members \\"run out of town\\". ==Ulster Defence Association C Company== In 1984 Hodgen and the rest of the Century Street gang, whose low-level criminal and anti-social activity had inspired complaints by some locals to the UDA, were recruited into that organisation after being effectively told that if they did not join they would face the wrath of the local brigade.Lister & Jordan, p. 47 Along with Adair, McCrory and Thompson, Hodgen was assigned to C8, an active unit that formed part of the West Belfast Brigade's C Company, which covered the lower Shankill. The young members early duties mostly consisted of rioting, along with occasional gun attacks on heavily armoured police vehicles or arson attacks on local businesses felt to be employing \\"too many\\" Catholics.Lister & Jordan, pp. 51‚Äì52 The unit however was eager to become more active and from an early stage plotted to kill solicitor Pat Finucane, although the plan was initially vetoed by the brigade leadership.Lister & Jordan, p. 78 The \\"Diamond Jubilee\\", UDA C Company's favourite bar on the Shankill Road Things changed however in 1990 when Tommy Lyttle was removed as West Belfast brigadier and, under new leadership, Adair and C8 began to emerge as the leading unit in the brigade. Adair formed a so-called \\"Dream Team\\" of active gunmen with Hodgen a charter member of this group.Lister & Jordan, p. 88 Hodgen, who had a reputation for being taciturn in contrast to the vocal Adair, regularly accompanied Adair on most of his activities, acting as his unofficial bodyguard.Lister & Jordan, p. 161 The pair were together on 6 March 1993 when Adair's Vauxhall Cavalier was shot up by a Provisional IRA gunman as it sat on a Shankill back street. Hodgen was shot in the shoulder and Adair in the leg but both men survived the attack despite the car being riddled with bullets.Lister & Jordan, p. 169 According to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie \\"Legs\\" Robinson, Hodgen was also present at the killing of Noel Cardwell, a glass collector in C Company's favourite bar the \\"Diamond Jubilee\\", whom the group accused of being an informer. Cardwell, who suffered from learning difficulties, had been hospitalised after having his drink spiked with ecstasy by a C Company member and had named the members to police who visited him in hospital, not realising the Omert√†-style code that C Company operated under. Cardwell was taken to a house used for interrogations and knifed on the evening of 12 December 1993, his body being discovered the next morning.Lister & Jordan, pp. 194‚Äì196 In 1993 Adair took over as West Belfast Brigadier following the arrest of incumbent Jim Spence. Adair had been commander of C Company at that point and so he promoted Hodgen to that role, with Winkie Dodds serving as Hodgen's second in command.Lister & Jordan, p. 208 Under Hodgen's command C Company continued to be a highly active outlet for sectarian killings and he became known as Adair's chief enforcer.Lister & Jordan, pp. 208‚Äì209\\"Adair Brigade; Men still loyal to Mad Dog on the run in Scotland\\". Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland) via The Free Library. 11 February 2003. Retrieved 24 May 2012 Hodgen's command came to an end on 16 May 1994 when he was arrested as part of a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) operation in which around twenty leading members of the West Belfast Brigade were arrested on terrorism charges.Lister & Jordan, p. 214 It was standard practice in the UDA that an office-holder vacated their position whenever they were taken into custody. Whilst some members, including Adair, were imprisoned as part of this operation Hodgen was released soon after his arrest.Lister & Jordan, p. 226 Activity in west Belfast diminished somewhat due to Adair's imprisonment and the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire. However this began to change in 1999 when a released Adair began to expand into the drugs trade and also looked to rearm C Company for future activities.Lister & Jordan, pp. 282‚Äì284 In November 1999 Adair and his wife Gina moved into a house on Boundary Way in the \\"Beirut\\" area of the lower Shankill, with Hodgen among a number of leading C Company figures who became Adair's neighbours as a consequence.Lister & Jordan, p. 285 A loyalist feud with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) soon ensued, although this was ended by Adair's return to prison in 2000. Hodgen remained loyal to Adair's leadership until the end, attacking Winkie Dodds' brother in late 2002. The attack followed a falling out between Dodds and Adair over a debt owed by Dodds' brother-in-law to C Company.Lister & Jordan, p. 323 Hodgen did however have some private reservations about Adair's increasingly erratic behaviour at this period and in early 2003 when he learned that Adair intended to kill another C Company member Mo Courtney ‚Äì due to suspicions that he was an informer ‚Äì Hodgen tipped Courtney off about the plan, allowing him to escape before any hit could take place.Lister & Jordan, p. 329 By this point however Hodgen had effectively retired from the UDA and when Adair was returned to prison in January 2003 the two old friends had no further contact. He dropped out of the public eye altogether and as such was not part of the group of C Company die-hards forced out of the Shankill Road by the mainstream UDA that same year. Hodgen's lack of involvement in this incident led to Adair condemning him and Jackie Thompson, who fled the Shankill before the arrival of around 100 UDA members after hearing about the plan in advance, as \\"the cowards at the top\\".Johnny Adair and Graham McKendry, Mad Dog, John Blake, 2007, p. 223 Following the purge of Adair supporters Hodgen was said to be living in Portavogie with the sister of fellow C Company veteran Tommy Potts.Lister & Jordan, p. 337 ==Bibliography== *Lister, David & Jordan, Hugh (2004).

(Photo by Bruce Maston, 2007) The Aeromedical Isolation Team (AIT, or SMART-AIT) of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland was a military rapid response team with worldwide airlift capability designed to safely evacuate and manage contagious patients under high-level (BSL-4) bio-containment conditions.Christopher, G. W. and E. M. Eitzen, Jr, ‚ÄúAir evacuation under high-level biosafety containment: the aeromedical isolation team‚Äù; Emerg Infect Dis, 1999: Mar-Apr; 5(2): 241‚Äì246. Created in 1978,Marklund, LeRoy A., ‚ÄúPatient care in a biological safety level-4 (BSL-4) environment‚Äù; Crit Care Nurs Clin N Am: 15 (2003), 245‚Äì 255. during its final years the AIT was one of MEDCOM‚Äôs Special Medical Augmentation Response Teams (SMART teams) comprising a portable containment laboratory along with its transit isolators for patient transport. Contingency missions included bioterrorism scenarios as well as the extraction of scientists with exotic infections from remote sites in foreign countries. The AIT trained continuously and was often put on alert status, but only deployed for ‚Äúreal world‚Äù missions four times. The AIT was decommissioned in 2010 and its mission assumed by one of the US Air Force‚Äôs Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATTs). ==History== The AIT was created in 1978 for purposes of contingency air evacuation of a hypothetical USAMRIID researcher who might become exposed to a highly infectious pathogen while undertaking endemic surveillance in remote areas of the world where a suspected or known disease outbreak was occurring. At the core of AIT operations was its specialized equipment, notably the Aircraft Transit Isolator (ATI). Developed by Vickers in the U.K. in the 1970sClayton, A.J., ‚ÄúContainment aircraft transit isolator‚Äù; Aviat Space Environ Med, 1979: Oct;50(10):1067-72. ‚Äî and manufactured in later years by Elwyn Roberts Isolators, Shropshire, UK, until 2007 ‚Äî the ATI was a self-contained unit capable of transporting a patient with a highly virulent disease and at the same time providing maximum microbiological security while full nursing care and treatment are rendered. It was designed to minimize the risk of transmission to air crews and caregivers, whether military or civilian. The interior of the isolator was maintained at a pressure negative to the external environment by a high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered blower. The isolator could be attached directly to a transfer port, situated on the external wall of the main USAMRIID building, to allow movement of the patient into a BSL-4 medical care suite without exposing the environment to the patient. While moving the isolator, team members wore protective suits and positive-pressure, HEPA- filtered Racal hoods (manufactured by Racal Health & Safety, Inc, Frederick, Maryland). Throughout its existence the AIT was associated with a BSL-4 Medical Containment Suite (MCS, called ‚Äúthe Slammer‚Äù) at USAMRIID for ICU- level patient care under biocontainment. The MCS was built in 1969 and became operational in 1972; it was the destination to which contagious patients were to be removed by the AIT. Over the years the scope of the AIT/MCS mission was expanded to include U.S. military personnel, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and U.S. citizens or foreign nationals deemed to be in need of service by the U.S. Department of State. Occasionally, the AIT trained with similar teams of foreign allies.Fleming-Michael, Karen (2005), ‚ÄúTraining Day‚Äù , Fort Detrick Standard (28 Sep 2005 issue). In 2007, due to the death of Mr Roberts, the ATI and associated products ceased to be manufactured. During 2008-2010, the AIT began preliminary training with, and testing of, a new transit isolator product ‚Äî the Patient Isolation Unit (PIU) ‚Äî developed by the Gentex Corporation under a contract with the U.S. Air Force. The AIT was decommissioned ‚Äî along with the MCS ‚Äî in 2010 and its mission was assumed by one of the US Air Force‚Äôs Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATTs).

star-like, suggesting the radial arrangement of inflorescences), is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. ==Range and habitat== It is the only member of the genus to occur in Africa, where it has an extensive but easterly range, from northern South Africa to Sudan, Ethiopia and on to Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula. They are found on rocky slopes and kopjes, riparian floodplains, or along forest margins. ==Description== Young plants are hairy on the stems and leaves, while mature plants have scrambling rope-like branches that are armed with recurved thorns or conical knobs.cf. Zanthoxylum capense The alternate and bipinnately compound leaves consist of 5 to 13 paired primary leaflets (pinnae), and 7 to 16 paired leaflets per pinna. The underside of the rachis carries pairs of recurved thorns, or solitary straight ones. They produce cream-coloured inflorescences composed of dense compound racemes (panicles). These are sweetly scented and attract quantities of bees and butterflies. They produce colourful brick-red to scarlet samaroid fruit, typical of their genus, which turn brown with age. The species may be confused with Caesalpinia decapetala, which however has larger yellow flowers, and clusters of brown seed pods. ==Uses== The shrubs are planted to provide impenetrable live fences, and shoots are collected for livestock fodder. In Ethiopia an infusion of the pounded bark has been used as a component in tanning leather, while providing it with a red colour. The leaves contain 20% tannin and yield a dark red dye when crushed, which has been used in textiles, basketry and as an ingredient in black ink. The plant is employed in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties have not been formally investigated. ==Local names== * Amharic: kanteftef * Tigrinya: qontaftafo (The ethiopic names are in line with the first scientific name of the species Cantuffa exosa J.F.Gmel. 1791) * nickname: forget-me-not-bush ==Notes * Range and synonyms: Pterolobium stellatum, African Plant Database, Jardin botaniques * Pterolobium stellatum, Flora of Zimbabwe S Category:Flora of Northeast Tropical Africa Category:Flora of Southern Africa Category:Flora of the Arabian Peninsula Category:Flora of East Tropical Africa Category:Flora of South Tropical Africa Category:Flora of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"Pterolobium stellatum"},{"id":"35913142","text":"The International Journal of Developmental Biology is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal covering research in developmental biology.

Shortly after his release he attempted to rape a young girl at knifepoint in Kemerovo, but the victim survived and Martynov was placed on a wanted list by police. In June 2007, Martynov murdered a woman and dismembered her body in Glazov, Udmurtia, and the following month he raped an 8-year-old girl in Vyazovka, a village in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. In May 2008, Martynov killed a man during a robbery, and the following month killed an elderly woman in a forest, dismembering her body. In November he murdered a woman in Oryol Oblast. In August 2010, Martynov raped and killed a 70-year-old woman in Bashkortostan, where he left a note stating that he is not afraid of the police and would be in Chelyabinsk at 12:00. In late 2010, Martynov killed his final victim, a woman in Voronezh Oblast. ==Arrest and conviction== Martynov was arrested on 18 November 2010, after the police tracked down his location when he activated a mobile phone that he had stolen from one of his victims. During the arrest Martynov did not try to resist, stating that he had wanted to be caught. According to prosecutors, Martynov is believed to have committed violent crimes across at least 10 oblasts in western and central Russia since his release from prison until his arrest, killing seven women and one man, and assaulting numerous others. Among the other victims were two minor girls, one of which was the victim of violent sexual abuse, and the other sustained serious injuries. Martynov often mutilated his female victims by removing their breasts and genitalia. On 23 May 2012, prosecutors for the first time publicly disclosed details about the case. He has been charged with intentional infliction of a grave injury, hooliganism, murder of two or more persons, and violent sexual actions. Prosecutors said Martynov acted \\"daringly and cynically\\", leaving letters at crime scenes and making no effort to conceal evidence. He later claimed his killing were motivated by his wish for a \\"cleaning of the society\\". During his time in jail, when he was waiting for trial, Martynov asked to have another inmate in his cell so he could kill him \\"because he was bored\\". Martynov was convicted for eight murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. ==See also== * List of Russian serial killers ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Russian rapists Category:People convicted of murder by Russia Category:Russian serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Russia Category:Russian murderers of children Category:Violence against women in Russia ","title":"Sergei Martynov (serial killer)"},{"id":"35913194","text":"Ben May (born 1984) is an English semi-professional footballer.

Taney The Taney Court (the Supreme Court of the United States under Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, 1836‚Äì1864) heard thirty criminal law cases, approximately one per year. Notable cases include Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), United States v. Rogers (1846), Ableman v. Booth (1858), Ex parte Vallandigham (1861), and United States v. Jackalow (1862). Like its predecessor, the Taney Court exercised only limited appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases. Like its predecessor, it heard original habeas petitions, writs of error from the state courts, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In addition, unlike its predecessor, the Court heard two writs of error from the territorial courts and three prerogative writs of mandamus and prohibition in criminal matters. The Court denied every petition for a prerogative writ that it received, habeas or otherwise. ==Background== The basic structure of the federal criminal system remained the same during Chief Justice Taney's tenure as it had been during Chief Justice Marshall's tenure. The Judiciary Act of 1789 divided original jurisdiction for the trial of federal crimes between the United States district courts and the United States circuit courts. The district courts were given jurisdiction over all federal crimes \\"where no other punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, is to be inflicted.\\"Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 9, 1 Stat. 73, 76‚Äì77. The circuit courts were given concurrent jurisdiction over these crimes, and exclusive jurisdiction over all other federal crimes.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 11, 1 Stat. 73, 78‚Äì79. The circuit courts also exercised appellate jurisdiction over the district courts, but only in civil cases.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 22, 1 Stat. 73, 84‚Äì85. The Judiciary Act of 1789 also placed the responsibility for prosecuting federal crimes in the United States Attorney for each United States federal judicial district. The Act provided that \\"there shall be appointed in each district\\" a \\"person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, cognizable under the authority of the United States.\\"Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92‚Äì93. ==Sources of jurisdiction== In Ex parte Gordon (1861), the Court summarized its jurisdiction in federal criminal cases thus: > [I]n criminal cases, the proceedings and judgment of the Circuit Court > cannot be revised or controlled here, in any form of proceeding, either by > writ of error or prohibition, and, consequently, we have no authority to > examine them by a certiorari. And the only case in which this court is > authorized even to express an opinion on the proceedings in a Circuit Court > in a criminal case is, where the judges of the Circuit Court are opposed in > opinion upon a question arising at the trial, and certify it to this court > for its decision.Ex parte Gordon, . ===Writs of error=== Although the Supreme Court could not issue writs of error to examine criminal convictions in the lower federal courts,. it could issue such writs with regard to the state courts and territorial courts. State courts slavery. Pursuant to its power‚Äîunder ¬ß 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789‚Äîto review the judgments of state courts on federal questions by writs of error, the Marshall Court had twice reversed criminal convictions obtained pursuant to a criminal statute that violated the federal constitution.; . The Taney Court continued this trend. In Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), the Court invalidating a state kidnapping conviction as in conflict with the Fugitive Slave Clause, which the Court found to authorize self-help.. In Thurlow v. Massachusetts (1847), known as the License Cases, the Court invalidated state liquor laws.Thurlow v. Massachusetts (License Cases), . But, in Fox v. Ohio (1847), the Court sustained state counterfeiting statutes, even though the power to punish counterfeiting had been explicitly granted to Congress.Fox v. Ohio, . And, in Moore v. Illinois (1852), the Court upheld state laws that punished those who harbored escaped slaves, even though the same conduct was punishable by the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.Moore v. Illinois, . In United States v. Booth (1855)United States v. Booth, . and Ableman v. Booth (1858),. the Court held that state courts have no authority to issue writs of habeas corpus to free federal criminal defendants. Booth had been indicted under the federal Fugitive Slave Act. Territorial courts Article Four, Section Three, Clause Two of the Constitution provides that \\"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory\\". art. IV, ¬ß 3, cl. 2. Pursuant to this authority, Congress had created territorial courts outside of the Article Three courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and its progeny. Although the Marshall Court had heard some civil appeals from the territorial courts, no criminal appealed had been attempted. In Forsyth v. United States (1850)Forsyth v. United States, . and Simpson v. United States (1850),Simpson v. United States, . the Court held that its authority to hear writs of error from the Florida territorial courts‚Äîwhich was defined by the organic statute of those courts‚Äîextended to criminal cases. Forsyth and Simpson found invalid criminal cases transferred of criminal cases which had begun with indictments by grand juries in the territorial courts and then been transferred to the newly created state courts within re-indictment. ===Original habeas=== The arrest of former Congressman Clement Vallandigham (D-OH) The Marshall Court had heard six original habeas petitions in criminal matters, all involving the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Its precedents established that the Court could grant the writ in pre-conviction situations,; Ex parte Burford, . but could not grant the writ in post-conviction situations,Ex parte Watkins, ; Ex parte Kearney, . unless the sentence of conviction had run.Ex parte Watkins, . The Taney Court heard seven additional such petitions. In Ex parte Wells (1855), over the dissents of Judges Curtis and Campbell, the Court affirmed the holding of the Marshall Court that original habeas petitions were a constitutionally permissible exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction.Ex parte Wells, . In Ex parte Dorr (1845), the Court held that it had no power to issue the writ to state prisoners serving sentences pursuant to a state conviction (except for the limited purpose of obtaining their in-court testimony).Ex parte Dorr, . The holding of Dorr was abrogated by a Reconstruction-era statute granting federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners.Eric M. Freedman, Milestones in Habeas Corpus: Part I: Just Because John Marshall Said It, Doesn't Make It So: Ex Parte Bollman and the Illusory Prohibition on the Federal Writ of Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners in the Judiciary Act of 1789, 51 531, 539 & n.19 (2000) (citing Act of February 5, 1867, 14 Stat. 385). The current version of this statute is found at . In In re Metzger (1847), the Court held that it had no original habeas jurisdiction to review the case of a prisoner held in custody pursuant to the order of a district judge, awaiting foreign extradition.In re Metzger, . In In re Kaine (1852), by a 5-3 decision, the Court extended this holding under the 1848 extradition act which authorized commissions to play part of the role previously exercised by a district judge.In re Kaine, . In Ex parte Gordon (1861), the Court held that it had no original habeas jurisdiction to review a post-conviction sentence of death. In Ex parte Vallandigham (1863), the Court held that it had no original habeas jurisdiction to review the judgements of military commissions; because the military courts were not one of the courts authorized to consider habeas petitions by ¬ß 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, any such jurisdiction would be constitutionally original rather than appellate, and thus unconstitutional.. ===Certificates of division=== The Marshall Court heard thirty-one criminal cases under the certificate of division procedure authorized by ¬ß 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802. However, the Court had held that the sufficiency of the evidence could not be certified‚Äîwhether on a motion for a new trial or a motion for a directed verdict.United States v. Bailey, ; United States v. Daniel, . In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.United States v. Briggs (Briggs I), . ===Other prerogative writs=== Prior to the Taney Court, no reported decision recorded an attempt by a party to obtain review in a criminal case by means of a prerogative writ other than habeas corpus. In Ex parte Gordon (1861), the court held that it had no power to issue a writ of prohibition to examine a death sentence issued by an admiralty court for piracy (the Court did possess the power to issue writs of prohibition in civil admiralty cases). The Taney Court also heard and rejected to petitions for mandamus in criminal cases. In Ex parte Taylor (1852), denied a petition on the merits, holding that federal bail in D.C. depended on federal law, not Maryland law.Ex parte Taylor, . In Kentucky v. Dennison (1860), the Court denied another mandamus petition, holding that‚Äîeven though the Extradition Clause of the Constitution obliged states to extradite criminals to other states for trial‚Äîthis provision was not enforceable in the federal courts.. Dennison was overruled by Puerto Rico v. Branstad (1987).. ==Defining federal crimesCounterfeiting=== Section 20 of the Crimes Act of 1825 prohibiting counterfeiting.Crimes Act of 1825, ¬ß 20, 4 Stat. 115, 121. In United States v. Marigold (1850), the Court held that this was a Constitutional exercise of Congress's power to punish counterfeiting.United States v. Marigold, . ===Indian country=== Section 25 of the Nonintercourse Act of 1834 provided federal crimes governing areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction would apply in Indian country, with an exception for Indian-on-Indian crimes.June 30, 1834, ¬ß 25, 4 Stat. 729, 733. In United States v. Rogers (1846), the Court held that the exception did not apply to defendants who were white persons who were adopted by Indians.. ===Naval timber=== An 1831 statute prohibited the taking of trees reserved for the use of the United States‚Äîspecifically, \\"any life oak or red cedar tree or trees, or other timber\\".Act of March 2, 1831, 4. Stat. 472. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs II) (1850), the Court held that the \\"other timber\\" language was not limited to trees used for naval purposes, even though that was the purpose of the statute.United States v. Briggs (Briggs II), 50 U.S. (9 How.) 351 (1850). ===Shipwreck theft=== Rockaway Beach (pictured). Section 9 of the Crimes Act of 1825 prohibited removing goods from a wrecked ship \\"within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction of the United States\\".Crimes Act of 1825, ¬ß 9, 4 Stat. 115, 116. In United States v. Coombs (1838), the Court held that the act did not extend to a defendant who had purloined several textile goods from a beached boat above the high tide line because there was no federal criminal admiralty jurisdiction beyond that point.United States v. Coombs, . ===Slave trading=== The Slave Trade Act of 1800 prohibited U.S. citizens from participating in the international slave trade.Slave Trade Act of 1800, 2 Stat. 70. In United States v. Morris (1840), the Court held that the offense could be charged even if the vessel‚Äîfitted out for slave trading‚Äîwas apprehended before slaves were taken aboard.United States v. Morris, . ==Criminal procedure== In United States v. Reid (1851), the Court held that ¬ß 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789‚Äîalso known as the Rules of Decision Act (RDA)‚Äîapplied only in civil, not criminal, cases. Whereas the RDA would have incorporated post-1789 changes in state law, the Court held instead that the Judiciary Act of 1789 adopted state rules of criminal procedure as they exited in 1789, unless inconsistent with a more specific federal statute. ===Constitutional issues=== Double jeopardy In the Taney Court, for the first time, the Court was asked to apply the criminal provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states. In Fox v. Ohio (1847) and Moore v. Illinois (1852), the Court reject the argument that the Double Jeopardy Clause was violated by permitting the state and federal government to criminalize the same conduct (which could hypothetically lead to duplicative prosecutions).Moore v. Illinois, ; Fox v. Ohio, . Justice McLean dissented in both cases on constitutional grounds. The Court was not called on to consider a case in which dual prosecution had actually occurred. In United States v. Nickerson (1854), a federal case, the Court held that a second indictment after acquittal should be dismissed because of double jeopardy. The statute at issue punished false statements on an application for a subsidy for cod fishing vessels. The defendant had submitted multiple false statements. The issue was whether the first indictment‚Äîwhich referred only to statements required by the subsidy statute‚Äîreached all the statements named in the second indictment. The Court held that all the statements were required by the statute and thus prior jeopardy barred the second prosecution.United States v. Nickerson, . Vicinage United States v. Dawson (1854) concerned a murder committed in the Indian Territory by a non-Indian defendant, a crime which by statute was triable in Arkansas. Between the murder and the trial, the District of Arkansas had been subdivided into the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas. The Court held that the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which requires a jury drawn from the state and district wherein the crime was committed, had no application to crimes committed outside of a U.S. state.United States v. Dawson, . Venue Article Three, Section Two, Clause Three of the Constitution provides: \\"The Trial of all Crimes ... shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\\" art. III, ¬ß 2, cl. 3. In United States v. Jackalow (1861), the Court held that Article Three venue must be established by facts found by a jury. The act of piratical murder by Jackalow was alleged to have occurred on the high seas, between the waters within the jurisdiction of the states of New York and Connecticut; New Jersey was the first state into which Jackalow was brought upon capture. An 1820 anti-piracy statute provided that, if the crime occurred on the high seas, venue was proper in the first state into which the defendant was brought after capture.May 15, 1820, ¬ß 3, 3 Stat. 600, 600. The Court held that‚Äîalthough the boundary of New York and Connecticut state waters were a question of law for the judge‚Äîthe location of the crime was a question of fact for the jury. Thus, Jackalow was granted a new trial.. ===Evidence=== Best evidence In United States v. Wood (1840), the Court held that the false statement (in connection with customs) could be proved up by the entries in the customs house logs, as opposed to testimony, without violating the best evidence rule.United States v. Wood, . Competence In United States v. Murphy (1842), the Court held that a victim of theft was competent to testify in a criminal theft prosecution because the victim is not formally an interested party; even if the victim might later file a civil suit, any fine or forfeiture would pass to the government.United States v. Murphy, . In United States v. Reid (1851), the Court held that a jointly-indicted, separately- tried codefendant was not competent to be called as a witness.United States v. Reid, . ===Other=== Sufficiency of an indictment In United States v. Hardyman (1839), the Court held that an indictment for knowingly possessing treasury notes stolen from the mail was insufficient if it misdescribed the interest rate printed on the note.United States v. Hardyman, . In United States v. Staats (1850), the Court held that an indictment for fraud need not charge \\"felonious intent\\" in addition to fraudulent intent.United States v. Staats, . External influence on jury In United States v. Reid (1851), the Court held harmless the fact that two jurors had read a newspaper article that summarized the evidence in the case, determining that the newspaper article did not influence the verdict. Clemency In Ex parte Wells (1855), the Court held that the President has the power to grant a conditional pardon (i.e. the power to commute a sentence of death to life imprisonment); Judge McLean dissented on the merits. Prosecutorial peremptory challenges The Crimes Act of 1790 gave 20 peremptory challenges to capital defendants and 35 to treason defendants. An 1840 statute provided that federal jury selection should follow state procedures in the absence of a more specific federal statute.July 20, 1840, 5 Stat. 394. In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the Court held that‚Äîwith regard to peremptory challenges by prosecutors in capital and treason cases‚Äîthe Crimes Act controlled, and thus prosecutors were to be given no peremptory challenges, even if they would have such challenges under the laws of the relevant state.United States v. Shackleford, . Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory challenges unchanged.Act of March 3, 1865, ch. 86, ¬ß 2, 13 Stat. 500, 500. ==FootnotesNotes== * Category:Taney Court Category:United States Supreme Court criminal cases by Chief Justice ","title":"Criminal law in the Taney Court"},{"id":"35913288","text":"The following article is a summary of the 2011 football season in Kenya, the 48th competitive season in its history. ==Domestic leaguesPromotion and relegation=== ;Promoted to Premier League * Bandari * Congo JMJ United ;Relegated from Premier League * Mahakama * Red Berets ===Premier League=== The 2011 Kenyan Premier League began on 26 February 2011 and ended on 26 November 2011. ===Nationwide League=== The 2011 Kenyan Nationwide League began on 13 March 2011 and ended on 27 November 2011.

Instead of going into exile like many other activists, Hussain remained in Bahrain. He was arrested twice under the State Security Law, which allowed the government to arrest individuals without trial for a period of up to three years of administrative detention for crimes relating to state security.\\"Bahrain: A Human Rights Crisis\\".

The government reportedly also agreed that at a later stage after establishment of security, the government would start a political dialogue with opposition. However, the government denied such an agreement existed, which led to worsening the situation again. ===Second arrest=== Hussain was arrested for the second time in January 1996 along with 7 other opposition leaders including Abdul Amir al-Jamri and Hasan Mushaima.

Though the Thornton family has lived at Fall Hill since the early 18th century, the present house was built in 1790 for Francis Thornton V (1760‚Äì1836). The land on which Fall Hill is located is part of an land patent obtained by Francis Thornton I (1657‚Äì1727) around 1720. The present-day town of Fredericksburg, Virginia is located on that original patent. ==The mansion at Fall Hill== The mansion at Fall Hill (pictured) is a Georgian two-story home with a central hall and two large rooms on either side. Its roof is hipped and there are interior chimneys at each end. The outside walls are randomly glazed Flemish bond brickwork. In keeping with the Georgian design of the exterior, second floor window openings are proportionately smaller than those of the first floor. The home was remodeled around 1830 and, as a result of replacements to door and window frames, doors and sashes, the only original parts of the exterior are the walls, roof, and chimneys. During this remodeling, two windows on the front of the house were bricked over on both the first and second floors. Doric columns on the porches on the west front and south end were added in the 19th century. More recently, a larger Doric porch on the east front was removed. During renovations, Greek Revival fireplace mantels were installed in the northwest and southwest rooms. These have since been removed to expose the original segmental fireplace openings. The grounds surrounding the house contain many old trees in a wide variety of species. There are a number of gravel walks around the 'park-like' grounds. A hillside west of the house provides a view of nearby Fredericksburg. ==History== The land on which Fall Hill was established is believed to have been included in a grant of in Spotsylvania County patented by Francis Thornton I (1657‚Äì1727) around 1720. Thornton belonged to one of Virginia's distinguished Colonial families. Upon settling in the area, Thornton established a home at The Falls, a plantation at the foot of Fall Hill within the present-day town of Fredericksburg. The family ran a grist mill on the Rappahannock River. It is said that Francis Thornton III (1711‚Äì1749) built the house on Fall Hill in order to escape the heat of the house at The Falls laying lower in elevation near the river. Francis Thornton III married Frances Gregory, daughter of Mildred Washington Gregory, aunt and godmother of George Washington. He served as a burgess, a trustee of Fredericksburg, and Colonel of the Spotsylvania militia. In 1749, Fall Hill was inherited by Colonel Thornton's son, Francis Thornton IV (1737‚Äì1794). However, he and his wife, Ann Thompson, maintained their primary residence at The Falls. The present mansion at Fall Hill is believed to have been built by Francis Thornton V (1760‚Äì1836) probably around 1790 when he married Sally Innes. This belief is supported by architectural evidence in the design of the houses common to the period. Francis Thornton V was a Justice of the Peace in Spotsylvania County. Their son, James Innes Thornton, was born at Fall Hill. He moved to Alabama, became its third secretary of state, and established his own plantation, Thornhill. Francis Thornton V died in 1836 without a will. For nine years, until the estate was settled in 1845, Fall Hill was maintained by family slaves. Ultimately, the estate was deeded to Dr. John Taylor in 1845. Dr. Taylor had married Elizabeth Fitzgerald Forbes, a daughter of Sally Innes Thornton and Murray Forbes, and a granddaughter of Francis Thornton V, in February 1842. It was Dr. Taylor that renovated the home in the 1840s. Its proximity to the Rappahannock River made Fall Hill a strategic point during the Fredericksburg Campaign of the Civil War. Fortifications were built along the river at the house to protect the crossing. The breastworks were built by General Robert E. Lee's soldiers. According to long-time resident, Butler Franklin, at one point Lee ordered the mansion destroyed by cannon fire so he could better see the approach of the Union Army across the river. However the house was saved when the Union Army's advance changed direction. In 1870 Dr. Taylor's son, Murry Forbes Taylor, married Butler-Brayne Thornton, a cousin of his mother, and also a descendant of Francis Thornton V, which again reinforced Fall Hill as a part of the Thornton family legacy. Taylor and his wife lived with Doctor Taylor at Fall Hill from 1875 to 1877. In 1877, Murray Taylor and his wife moved to California where Taylor managed the estate of Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst (mother of William Randolph Hearst) at San Simeon, California. To show her gratitude to Murray Taylor when he retired from his job at San Simeon in 1908, Mrs. Hearst purchased Fall Hill for $25,000 as a gift for him. It was Mrs. Hearst's wish that Butler-Brayne Thornton Robinson Franklin (granddaughter of Murray Forbes Taylor and Butler Brayne Thornton) inherit the estate. During the period from 1845‚Äì1870, when Dr. Taylor was deeded the property, it was technically still in the Thornton family, through his wife. So the property that Fall Hill was built on, had been in possession of the Thornton family, for over 280 years. Butler Franklin, who died in 2003 at the age of 104, was the last of the Thorntons to own the property. Fall Hill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1973. ==NotesReferences== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Georgian architecture in Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1790 Category:Houses in Fredericksburg, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fredericksburg, Virginia ","title":"Fall Hill"},{"id":"35913326","text":"Raymond Perry Ahlquist (July 26, 1914 - April 15, 1983) was an American pharmacist and pharmacologist. He published seminal work in 1948 that divided adrenoceptors into Œ±- and Œ≤-adrenoceptor subtypes. This discovery explained the activity of several existing drugs and also laid the ground work for new drugs including the widely prescribed beta blockers. ==Early life and education== Ahlquist was born on July, 26 1914 in Missoula, Montana. Both of his parents came from Sweden. His father was an auditor at the Railway Company Northern Pacific Railway. In 1940, Ahlquist graduated with a Ph.D. degree in pharmacology from the University of Washington in Seattle, the first person to be awarded such a degree from that institution. ==Career and research== Ahlquist spent four years as a faculty member at South Dakota State University in Brookings. In 1944 he became Assistant Professor of Pharmacology at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. In 1946 he was appointed Associate Professor in the same institution and from 1948 to 1963 he was the chair of pharmacology. In 1963 he was appointed Associate Dean for Basic Sciences and Research Coordinator for the medical college. Between 1970 and 1977 he was again Chair of Pharmacology and in 1977 he was appointed Charbonnier Professor of Pharmacology, a post he held until his death. ===Adrenoceptor=== In South Dakota, Ahlquist searched for a substitute for the Chinese plant-derived and scarce ephedrine. It has similar activity to that of adrenaline and noradrenaline - a sympathomimetic, i.e. a substance that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. The actions of the sympathomimetics confused pharmacologists and physiologists at that time who could not explain how a single agent could have both excitatory and inhibitory effects. In his famous work Ahlquist chose six agonists, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, Œ±-methyl noradrenaline and isoprenaline, and examined their effects on several organs, including blood vessels and the heart. He found that the six substances possessed different rank orders of potency that differed depending on the tissue. For example, the rank order of potency was \\"adrenaline > noradrenaline > Œ±-methyl noradrenaline > isoprenaline\\" in promoting contraction of blood vessels, but the rank order was \\"isoprenaline > adrenaline > Œ±-methyl noradrenaline > norepinephrine\\" in the heart. Ahlquist concluded that there are two different receptors for agonists. The receptors with the first rank order (that is, for example, for blood vessel contraction), he called Œ±-adrenoceptors (alpha adrenotropic receptor) receptors while the second rank order (for instance, for the promotion of cardiac activity), he called Œ≤-adrenoceptors. Simultaneously both cautious and forward-looking, he wrote: \\"At the moment can be said about the nature of the adrenoceptors and the difference between the Œ±-and Œ≤-types do not say much, but should the subdivision concept be useful in exploring the various effects of adrenaline and other sympathomimetic agents and the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.\\" The publication was initially dismissed, but went on to have a major impact on pharmacology. The manuscript was first rejected by the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, but was subsequently accepted for publication by the American Journal of Physiology. As for Ahlquist's inquiry into the nature of adrenoceptors, we now know that they are G protein-coupled receptors and humans possess a total of nine different adrenoceptors (Œ±1A, Œ±1B, Œ±1D, Œ±2A, Œ±2B Œ±2C, Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≤3). In the field of drug therapy, his discovery laid the foundation for the development of beta blockers to treat heart disease and also reduce high blood pressure. ===Other work=== Ahlquist's other scientific work also includes the pharmacology of the sympathetic nervous system. His research contribute to the discovery of tolazoline, a substance with a completely different chemical structure than the adrenaline and noradrenaline and in 1958, dichloroisoprenaline the first clinically useful beta-blocker. It was discovered with his help that the peristalsis is enhanced by Œ±-adrenoceptors and conversely inhibited by Œ≤-adrenoceptors. In his most recent essay in 1980, he looked back to the 1948 publication. The impact of the 1948 publication is evident by the number of times it has been cited (2766 times as of 2011). ==Awards== Ahlquist was awarded the Oscar B. Hunter Memorial Award in Therapeutics, the Ciba Award for Hypertension Research and the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. ==Personal== Ahlquist met his wife Dorothy Duff Ahlquist in Seattle. ==Death== Ahlquist died on April 15, 1983 in Augusta, Georgia ==References * Biography on southalabama.edu Category:1914 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th- century scientists Category:American people of Swedish descent Category:Recipients of the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award Category:American pharmacologists ","title":"Raymond P.

One clich√©, in position 33 (row 5, stamp 1), was replaced upside down relative to its neighbours and is paired with the correct orientation stamp from position 41 (row 6, stamp 1). ==History== Stamps known as the Barquitos issue, named for the little ships that form the central image of the stamps, were first issued in April 1858 denominated in 2, 3, 4 and 5-peso values in blue, green, red and orange. In October postal rates were reduced, making it necessary to produce two additional stamps. Owing to time constraints it was decided to modify the 4 and 5-peso denominations to make the 1 peso and 4 reales (half- peso) respectively. Forgeries of the regular stamps exist and were already well documented in 1882. The original plates were constructed of 48 stereotype clich√©s, eight stamps wide and six stamps deep, affixed to a wooden base with a small brass nail in each corner of the clich√©s. The nails show up as white holes in the design, having been recessed below the level of each metal clich√©. The value tablets remained solid on the master dies and from these four matrices the four values were made. Each matrix had the denomination cut into the solid areas: \\"Dos Ps\\", \\"Tres Ps\\", \\"Cuato Ps\\" [sic] and \\"Cinco Ps\\". From these the 48 clich√©s were stereotyped and affixed to the wood base. Unique affixing holes and flaws make it possible to identify different plate positions. In June 1864, the fact that there were some modifications to the plates of these stamps was already mentioned in the world's first dedicated stamp journal, Stamp Collectors' Review and Monthly Advertiser. Even the regular stamps were considered a great classic and highly prized, as evidenced by being the highest priced stamps listed in the 1868 issue of the Scott Postage Stamp Catalogue, and by the 1940 edition were valued at $3,000. ==Modifications== To make the two new denominations, each clich√© was altered. The 5-peso value was turned into a 1-peso by modifying the text \\"Cinco Ps\\", removing the \\"C\\" and \\"co\\" to make it read \\"In Ps\\". The 4-peso was turned into a 4-reales by removing part of the \\"Cuato Ps\\" text. First the lower curve of the \\"P\\" was excised, making it read \\"rs\\", and later it was modified again by removing the \\"Cu\\" and \\"o\\" of \\"Cuato\\", making it read \\"T rs\\", the closest approximation of \\"1 rs\\". ==Provenance== This pair were exhibited in 1986 as part of the Aristocrats of Philately displays at Ameripex and again at Anphilex in 1996. They were previously owned by Alfred H. Caspary until 1958, Lars Amundsen, Joseph Schatzk√©s, John Robert Boker, Jr., and Gabriel Sanchez. They were also illustrated in Leon Norman Williams' Encyclopedia of Rare and Famous Stamps. The Caspary vertical tete-beche pair sold in 2008 at auction for $575,000 dollars. ==A second example== The only example known is the vertical pair, but another pair, in horizontal format, being positions 33 and 34, was recorded in Philipp von Ferrary's collection. It was acquired by Alfred F. Lichtenstein, who exhibited it in 1940 at the centenary celebrations of the postage stamp, by the Collectors Club of New York. It has not been seen since and was not in the Lichtenstein estate, so is assumed to no longer exist. ==References== Footnotes Other sources * The Postage Stamps of Buenos Aires, by F. J.

His personal name was L√º Huan (ÂëÇÁí∞), ancestral name Jiang (Âßú), and Duke Ling was his posthumous title. Duke Ling succeeded his father Duke Qing of Qi, who died in 582 BC after 17 years of reign. ==Attack from Jin== In 572 BC, Duke Dao of the State of Jin attacked Qi. Duke Ling made peace with Jin by sending his son Prince Guang (later Duke Zhuang II of Qi) to Jin as a hostage. Nine years later Prince Guang was made the crown prince of Qi. ==Annexing the State of Lai== In 567 BC, the fifteenth year of Duke Ling's reign, the State of Lai attacked Qi but was decisively defeated. The Qi army counterattacked, killed the Lai ruler Duke Gong, and conquered the entire state. Chapter VI. Lai was a large Dongyi state to the east of Qi, and the state of Qi more than doubled the size of its territory after annexing Lai. ==Battle of Pingyin== In 555 BC, Duke Ling switched his alliance from Jin to its enemy State of Chu. To punish Qi, Duke Ping of Jin invaded and inflicted a crushing defeat on Qi. The Jin army, led by general Zhonghang Yan, occupied large swathes of Qi territory, besieged the Qi capital Linzi, and burned down the outer portion of the city. This was the worst defeat that Qi had suffered during the Spring and Autumn period. ==Succession== Duke Ling's main wife was Yan Yi Ji, a princess of the State of Lu, who had no son. His original heir, Crown Prince Guang, was the son of Sheng Ji, niece of Yan Yi Ji. Duke Ling also had at least two other concubines, Zhong Zi and Rong Zi, who were both princesses of the State of Song. Zhong Zi bore a son named Ya, while Rong Zi had no son but took Prince Ya under her wing. Duke Ling favoured Rong Zi, who asked him to make Prince Ya the new crown prince. Although Zhong Zi objected, Duke Ling still deposed Prince Guang and made Prince Ya his heir. In 554 BC, the 28th year of his reign, Duke Ling fell ill and died in the fifth month. The powerful minister Cui Zhu installed Guang, the original crown prince, on the throne, to be known as Duke Zhuang II of Qi. Cui Zhu and Duke Zhuang killed Rong Zi, Prince Ya, and rival minister Gao Hou, who supported Prince Ya. Duke Ling also had another son named Chujiu, born to another of Duke Ling's concubines, who was the daughter of Shusun Xuanbo, leader of the Shusun clan of Lu.

A contemporary of Thomas Church, Geoffrey Jellicoe and Luis Barrag√°n he was a leading figure in the first generation of Modernists in landscape design. He is best known for designing the first Adventure playground (in partnership with Hans Dragehjelm) in Emdrup, Copenhagen. ==Career== S√∏rensen was a prolific author producing eight books, editing two volumes and writing hundreds of articles. Only one short book has been translated into English and another into German and Dutch. His books covers open space in urban life, horticulture, the history of garden art, principles of garden design, education and autobiography. S√∏rensen worked with Copenhagen schoolteacher Hans Dragehjelm (1875-1948) on the first ever adventure playground in Emdrup, a district of the Danish capital Copenhagen in 1940. Photos from the time show children playing with bricks, digging in the mud and building dens with wood and nails. In his book ' (Park Politics in the parish and market town), S√∏rensen stated his belief that \\"children's playgrounds are the city's most important form of public plantation\\". He believed children needed sun and open space to play in and hated the trend for dark, shady courtyards as play spaces. He called them ' (\\"junk playgrounds\\"). His designs reflected the Modernist movement and include strong geometric shapes and graceful landforms. He started teaching at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in 1940 and was professor of landscape architecture there from 1954 to 1963.

The mnemonic PHACE stands for Posterior fossa brain malformations, Hemangioma, Arterial lesions, Cardiac abnormalities, and Eye abnormalities. PHACE syndrome should be considered in infants with large plaque-type facial hemangiomas. Children presenting with this dermatologic manifestation should receive careful ophthalmologic, cardiac, and neurologic assessment. According to one study in infants with large hemangiomas, one- third have extracutaneous manifestations consistent with the diagnosis of PHACE syndrome. The most common are cerebrovascular and cardiovascular anomalies. ==Signs and symptoms== Hemangiomas associated with PHACE syndrome are usually small or not visible at birth, but are easier to see during the first days to weeks of life. They can grow rapidly. Hemangiomas linked with PHACE syndrome tend to cover a large area of the face, head or neck, either as one lesion or as many single lesions. Patients who suffer from PHACE syndrome may also experience symptoms such as: * Anomalies of the aortic arch * Narrowing, abnormal growth, or absence of a major cerebral artery * Presence of the trigeminal artery, an important artery that supplies the brain with nutrients during fetal development, as well as others after birth * Abnormalities of the cerebellum * Blood clots in the blood vessels around the heart and brain * Abnormal structure of the back of the eye * Abnormal sternum * Gaps in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart * Anomalies of the pituitary and thyroid glands ===Complications=== As it grows, the hemangioma can break down skin, distort facial features or get in the way of other vital functions, such as breathing, vision, and hearing. Other complications will depend on what other structures are involved. These could include developmental delay, seizures, headaches, and abnormal muscle tone if the brain is involved. ==Cause== The cause of PHACE syndrome is currently unknown. Researchers believe that it is caused by a postzygotic somatic mosaic mutation or a mutation that can occur on any autosomal chromosome. Due to its mosaic pattern it may be harder to determine the cause since a fraction of the cells in the body contain the mutated DNA while the rest contain unaffected strands. The disorder may also be caused by several genetic, but also environmental factors. ==Diagnosis== Since the initial sign of PHACE syndrome is usually a large facial hemangioma, infants that are born with such a sign should be further analyzed to diagnose or rule out PHACE syndrome. A series of radiologic tests such as a magnetic resonance images (MRI) or a magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) of the head, neck, and chest. Following the series of imaging tests, the physician should perform an echocardiogram on the infant to observe any abnormalities. If there are any abnormalities detected on these scans, the infant may suffer from PHACE syndrome . ==Treatment== Due to the disorders rare occurrence there is no standardized treatment or protocol. There were no clinical trials conducted on patients that suffer from PHACES syndrome, therefore, we are unaware of the safety or potential treatment for such a condition. At this moment we can find a series of single case reports of patients. Physicians treat specific syndromes of the disorder in order to improve the lives of patients. Testament usually involves a collaboration of many medical professionals. These medical professionals include, but are not limited to: dermatologists, doctors who have specialized in diagnosing and treating skin disorder; ophthalmologists, specialists of the eyes; cardiologist, doctors of the heart; endocrinologists, specialists of the endocrine system; neurologists and or neurosurgeons, specialist in treating and diagnosing conditions of the brain; otolaryngologists, specialists of the ear, nose, and throat; dentists, who are specialized in treating conditions of the teeth, speech pathologists; psychiatrists, and many others. ===Management=== PHACE syndrome needs to be managed by a multidisciplinary team of experts. Additional specialties such as cardiology, ophthalmology, neurology, and neurosurgery may need to be involved. The team of experts pay close attention to how these children develop throughout the school age period. PHACE syndrome Handbook - Dr. Beth Drolet In 2013, the PHACE syndrome Community was formed. The non-profit entity was developed to raise awareness about the condition, support patients and families of those with the condition and raise money for research into causes and treatment. ==History== PHACE syndrome is the uncommon association between large infantile hemangiomas, usually of the face, and birth defects of the brain, heart, eyes, skin and/or arteries. It is an acronym that stands for the medical names of the parts of the body it often impacts: *Posterior fossa abnormalities and other structural brain abnormalities *Hemangioma(s) of the cervical facial region *Arterial cerebrovascular anomalies *Cardiac defects, aortic coarctation and other aortic abnormalities *Eye anomalies Sometimes an \\"S\\" is added to PHACE making the acronym PHACES; with the \\"S\\" standing for \\"Sternal defects\\" and/or \\"Supraumbilical raphe.\\" In 1993, an association between large facial hemangiomas and brain defects among 9 subjects was reported. 3 years later, a larger case study was published showing a wider spectrum of grouped malformations. The association of anomalies and the PHACES acronym was first coined by Dr. Vail Reese and Dr. Ilona Frieden in 1996, making it a newly described syndrome. A diagnosis is generally made from the physical examination, along with imaging of the head and chest, and an eye examination. PHACE is most commonly diagnosed among female infants. Long-term quality of life varies. Hemangioma growth phase can last anywhere from 6 to 18 months. Then involution, or healing, of the hemangioma begins. Laser and other surgeries usually are able to make a substantial positive impact on appearance. Long after the hemangioma recedes, any damage it or the other defects caused, may remain. Migraines are common, as are developmental delays. == See also == * Sternal cleft * Rosenthal‚ÄìKloepfer syndrome * List of cutaneous conditions == References  External links == Category:Cutaneous congenital anomalies ","title":"PHACE syndrome"},{"id":"35913821","text":"Mary‚ÄìAnn Eisel (born November 25, 1946) is an American former tennis player.

He published Rethinking Christianity in India, as an Indian Christian answer to the Hendrik Kraemer's The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World. He along with his brother-in-law Vengal Chakkarai were the founders of Madras Christo Samaj, influenced by Calcutta Christo Samaj founded by K.C. Banerjee and J.G. Shome‚ÄîBoth Madras Presidency and Calcutta were British East India Company provinces - later part of British Raj. ==Biography== Chenchiah was born into a Hindu Brahmin home in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh (India), in 1886. He was the oldest of 12 children who grew up together. At the age of 15, Chenchiah converted to Christianity, along with his family and he was baptized by William Miller, a Scottish Missionary. Chenchiah went on to marry Matilda Raghaviah, and had 1 son and 4 daughters. Chenchiah got his education from Madras Christian College that grew enormously under William Miller ‚Äî Scottish missionary, principal. He received a degree in philosophy in 1906, where he received a Gold medal for \\"proficiency in Philosophy.\\" He then did his Bachelor of Laws degree (BL) in 1908, and a Master of Laws degree (ML) in 1913, from Madras Law College. He started his practice as an advocate of High Court of Madras, served as government servant in various offices. One source states that Chenchiah became the Judge of the district of Pudukottah, in the Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu), in 1928. Another source provides a later date, saying that Chenchiah became a Judge in 1935.Herwig Wagner, Erstgestalten einer einheimischen Theologie in Sudindien, (Munich: Kaiser, 1963), 13. According to V. Devasahayam, Chenchiah \\"retired from that position after refusing to yield to Government pressure to pass a verdict in their favor.\\" Chenchiah rejoined the Madras High Court, and became the Chief Examiner of the Law exams for the Madras and Andhra Universities. Chenchiah was a \\"voracious reader,\\" and \\"it was through this interest in philosophy and ethics that Chenchiah grew in prominence in Christian circles.\\" He pursued \\"active friendships with people of others faiths\\" and was involved in several formal and informal inter-faith discussions. Chenchiah \\"wrote for two prominent Christian journals, Guardian and The Pilgrim,\\" and served as the editor of The Pilgrim from 1949 to 1952. He was also on the editorial committee of the Christian Patriot, an Indian Christian nationalistic organ, between 1916 and 1924. He was a member of Board of Directors of YMCA, Madras(present Chennai). He also served as a member of Executive committee of the National Missionary Society. He was one of the founders of Madras Christo Samaj in Madras Presidency, and has been actively associated with the Bangalore Continuation conference for the discussion association with problems of Indian Christian life. Apart from this, Chenchiah represented the South Indian Union Church at the International Missionary Conference at Jerusalem (1928) and was listed as a \\"Judge\\" at the International Missionary Conference at Tambaram (1938). His most significant association was with the \\"Madras Rethinking Group,\\" which produced the book Rethinking Christianity in India. Some have pointed out that it was William Miller, who played a major role in encouraging Chenchiah and his brother-in-law Vengal Chakkarai Chetti to rethink Christianity within the Indian context, possibly in an effort to integrate Hinduism and Christianity. Chenchiah died on April 19, 1959, in Madras. ==Writings== Chenchiah was a prolific writer and wrote on several themes, but mainly about rethinking Christianity in the Indian context. His literary contributions are in the form of numerous articles he contributed to the periodicals, \\"The Guardian,\\" \\"The Patriot,\\" and two books he co-authored with others, \\"Rethinking Christianity in India,\\" and \\"ƒÄsramƒÅs Past and Present.\\" Two of his most significant works are long reviews of two books. The first is his review written as an Indian reply to Hendrik Kraemer‚Äôs Barthian broadside, \\"The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World,\\" appeared in 1938 on the eve of the International Missionary Council‚Äôs world conference at Tambaram, Madras, South India. This review is included in the book \\"Rethinking Christianity in India.\\" His other major review of Marcus Ward‚Äôs \\"Our Theological Task\\" appeared in The Guardian 1947.P. V. Joseph, Indian Interpretation of the Holy Spirit. Delhi: ISPCK, 2007, p. 67. ==Theology== Chenchiah is one of the Christian theologians featured in Robin Boyd's Introduction to Indian Christian Theology. In it, Boyd states that Chenchiah was primarily Christological in his thinking and focussed upon the integration of Hinduism and Christianity. ===Rethinking Christianity in India=== Chenchiah spoke against the Western Christian theology and Church practice; inspired by the teachings of Aurobindo Ghose, Teilhard de Chardin, and Master C.V.V, and also basing his thoughts on New Testament, he developed a new interpretation of Christian doctrine. He was one of the founders of Christo Samaj of Madras in 1908 with an aim of coordinating the country, the church, and the mission to the supreme purpose of Jesus Christ. Its leaders, including V. Chakkarai, S.K. George, P.A. Thangasami, and others met every year in South India to discuss political, economical, and religious issues. The members of this group later came to be known as The Rethinking Group. He was instrumental in the formation of Rethinking Christianity Group in India, after the publication of Rethinking Christianity in India, in 1938, as Indian Christian's reply to Church-centered missiology of V.S. Azariah and Hendrik Kraemer's The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World, a Barthian theology. He led the group of Indian Christians along with Vengal Chakkarai, and formed Rethinking Christianity Group in Madras that argued that Indian Christian community could not ignore the common Hindu heritage, its culture, and traditions. In his article Rethinking Christianity in India, Chenchiah countered Kraemer's understanding of religion. He believed there are two possible realities at the core of every religion; one, a pivotal personality like Rama, Krishna, Jesus, or Budha; two, the discovery of a truth or principle as the all-inclusive nature of Brahman. According to Chenchiah, \\"A religion grows up around one or both of these realities, providing different means to comprehend the principle and follow and emulate the personality.\\" Though Chenchaih agreed Kraemer's belief that religion is a human creation, both Chenchaih and Kraemer took different approaches to the study of religion; Kraemer on one hand, advocated missionary's approach‚Äîthe missionary perceives Christianity as the one means to understand God and studies other religions either out of curiosity or to affirm his conviction of Christianity's superiority - Christian revelation is the only means to understand God, an approach pivotal to the Kraemer's missiology; Chenchaiah on the other hand, being a second generation convert, seems to had grown dissatisfied with what the Church had to offer in response to the Indian context in which he lived and through which he was trying to understand the faith. He, like other Indian indigenous converts, studied other religions to rediscover the message of Christianity. In addition, Chenchiah seems to had interest in comparing religions as systems and then showing what they have in common and where they differ. ===New Creation=== He considered Christianity to have represented a new stage in the evolution of man; hence, with the power of the Holy Spirit, Christians can become one with Him, and so become a \\"new creature.\\" He advocated his entire life the policy of \\"Christian policy\\"‚Äîto live Christ is to preach Christ. According to him, human history has begun a new revolutionary chapter in Jesus‚Äîthe fact of Christ is the birth of a new order in creation; Christianity is not primarily a doctrine of salvation but the announcement of the advent of a new creative order in Jesus‚ÄîThe Christian is a new creation - The Holy Spirit is the new cosmic energy - the kingdom of God is the new order - the children of God, the new type that Christ had inaugurated. He was baptized along with his father, when he was a boy and raised as a Christian from infancy; however, he believed that the Christian faith must be open to receive new insights from Indian culture. He felt uneasy with Western concept of Church and advocated for a new indigenized Christ-ism from the gospels, using his Hindu perspective. ==Criticism== Critics pointed Chenchiah for giving undue weightage to the epic figures like Krishna and Ramaof Hinduism. Both Chenchiah and Kraemer differed the way Christian religion is differentiated with Christian faith. According to Chenchiah: ==Works Co-authored books === * Chenchiah, P., V. Chakkarai and A. N.

Sprague de Camp, about an apparently immortal Neanderthal Man surviving into the present day. ==Publication history== The story was first published in the magazine Unknown for June, 1939 and first appeared in book form in de Camp's collection The Wheels of If and Other Science Fiction (Shasta, 1948).Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, pages 168-169. It later appeared in the subsequent de Camp collections The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (Doubleday, 1978), Aristotle and the Gun and Other Stories (Five Star, 2002), and Years in the Making: the Time-Travel Stories of L. Sprague de Camp (NESFA Press, 2005). The story has also appeared in the magazines Fantastic Story Magazine for July, 1953 and Jim Baen's Universe for April, 2007, and the anthologies Human? (Lion Books, 1954), The Unknown (Pyramid Books, 1963), The Freak Show (Rapp & Whiting, 1970), The Great Science Fiction Stories Volume 1, 1939 (DAW Books, 1979), Dawn of Time (Elsevier/Nelson Books, 1979), Isaac Asimov Presents The Golden Years of Science Fiction (Bonanza Books, 1983), Neanderthals (Signet/NEL, 1987), Unknown Worlds: Tales from Beyond (Galahad Books, 1988), Modern Classics of Fantasy (St. Martin's Press, 1997), and My Favorite Fantasy Story (DAW Books, 2000). The story has been translated into Dutch, French, German and Italian. ==Plot summary== Visiting a freak show, scientist Dr. Matilda Sandler takes an interest in the ape-man \\"Ungo-Bungo\\", who appears to exhibit genuine atavistic features. After the show she goes backstage and meets the man behind the role to ask if he will agree to be examined for scientific purposes. Ungo-Bungo, who calls himself Clarence Aloysius Gaffney, proves affable but reticent about his past and reluctant to submit to examination. In time, however, he warily consents in return for surgery to correct some old injuries. Eventually it comes out that Gaffney is actually Shining Hawk, a Neanderthal Man over 50,000 years old, whose aging process was frozen early in life when he was struck by lightning. He had survived by his wits on the periphery of human society since the extinction of his own kind, using a succession of false identities and getting by as a blacksmith or in menial professions like his present one. He has been a witness to much of history from the margins, making little personal impact on it‚Äîthough it is suggested that he may have been the original basis for the tales of the divine lame blacksmith Vulcan (his leg injury is very old). As it happens, however, Gaffney's caution proves well-founded; not only does Sandler develop an unwelcome crush on him, but the revelation of his secret brings out the worst in some of the scientists to whom it is confided. Discovering that the surgeon who is to perform his operation secretly intends to dissect him, Gaffney skips out. Later, from an undisclosed location, he sends his apologies and regrets to those who have befriended and aided him. ==Reception== According to Sam Moskowitz, the story \\"broke ground for an entirely new approach on the treatment of such material,\\"Moskowitz, Sam. \\"L. Sprague de Camp: Sword and Satire,\\" in Amazing Stories, v. 38, no. 2, February 1964, p. 100.Moskowitz, Sam. Seekers of Tomorrow: Masters of Modern Science Fiction (New York : Ballantine Books, 1967), p. 160. which was \\"most notably emulated by Philip Jos√© Farmer in 'The Alley Man'.\\" Don D'Ammassa wrote \\"[t]he forthrightly sentimental \\"The Gnarly Man\\" is one of the most moving portraits ever to appear in the [science fiction] field.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"de Camp, L. Sprague\\" in Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers, Third Edition, Noelle Watson, Paul E. Schellinger, eds. (Chicago: St. James Press, c1991), p. 192. More recently, Robert Wilfred Franson called the work \\"a good specimen of the distinct category of stories about Neanderthal Man in science fiction (or fantasy if you prefer).\\" He notes it \\"is a humorous story, but it may make you think even while you're enjoying it,\\" and observes that \\"[d]e Camp obviously has fun here thinking through the likely practical concerns of someone living so long.\\" He rates \\"[t]he character of Clarence [as] very well sketched in the space of a novelet,\\" going on to say \\"[h]e brings to my mind a comparison with the title character, a speaking gorilla, in Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The advantage is all Clarence's, as he is a man; whereas poor Ishmael is an ideological mouthpiece.\\"Franson, Robert Wilfred. \\"The Gnarly Man by L. Sprague de Camp\\" (review) on troynovant.com, Dec. 2008. ==Relation to other works== De Camp wrote that he got the subject for the story from his friend P. Schuyler Miller, who was also writing a story about a Neanderthal man in modern times. The Miller piece, \\"Old Man Mulligan,\\" appeared in the December, 1940 issue of Astounding Science-Fiction. De Camp noted that the two stories were completely different, and used the incident to illustrate the principle that two science fiction writers, using the same idea, will write different stories, so there is nothing wrong with copying someone else's idea.De Camp, L. Sprague. Science-Fiction Handbook, New York : Hermitage House, 1953.De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"On The Gnarly Man and Old Man Mulligan.\\" In Amra, v. 2, no. 15, May 1961, pp. 21-22. De Camp also featured Neanderthals in his later fantasy novel The Pixilated Peeress (1991). In the parallel world of that novel the species forms a relict population pushed by humanity into the higher elevations of the Alps. The fugitive hero Thorolf Zigramson takes refuge among a tribe of these \\"trolls,\\" as they are known, and is adopted into their society and aided by them. ==Importance== \\"The Gnarly Man\\" is one of de Camp's most notable works.\\"Locus Online News: L.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1970. He featured in the BBC Radio 4 series Great Lives in May 2012, nominated by singer Tom Robinson. Robinson had attended Finchden Manor after a suicide attempt when aged 16, and said that Lyward saved his life. ==Early life and education== Lyward grew up in the Clapham Junction area of south London. His father was an opera singer but left home while Lyward was very young, and his mother worked as a primary school teacher. He had three sisters. He won a scholarship to Emanuel School in Battersea, and there became a prefect, Head of House, and a sergeant in the Officers' Training Corps, and played rugby in the first XV despite a history of childhood polio which had left him with a weak leg. After leaving school he taught in two prep schools and at Kingston Grammar School and then returned to Emanuel as a master, before winning in 1917 a choral scholarship to study at St John's College, Cambridge where he took a history degree. In 1918 he obtained the post of house-tutor at The Perse School in Cambridge in order to supplement his modest choral scholarship funds. In 1920 he started studying for ordination at Bishop's College, Cheshunt, but abandoned this two weeks before his planned ordination. He taught again at Emanuel, then in 1923 moved to Trinity College, Glenalmond to work with the sixth form students, developing his ideas about teaching this age group. In 1928 a broken engagement led to a breakdown and treatment by Hugh Crichton-Miller, who later asked Lyward to help with some of his own boy patients. This work led directly to Lyward's work at Finchden Manor. Lyward married Sarah (Sadie) whom he met in 1931, and she accompanied him to Finchden, but she died an early death at 54 from cancer in 1967. ==Finchden Manor== Finchden Manor is a grade II* listed building, described as \\"A large C16 timber-framed house with modern additions at the north west end\\", and having been used in the 19th century as a Benedictine priory. Lyward opened a therapeutic community in a farm building at Guildables, Edenbridge, Kent in 1930, and by 1935 he moved it to larger premises at Finchden Manor. With the exception of WW2 years, when Finchden Manor was requisitioned by the army, he continued to work there until his death in 1973. During the war, Finchden continued at Marrington Hall, Chirbury, Shropshire. Former students at Finchden Manor include Tom Robinson, Alexis Korner, Francis Lickerish, Robert John Godfrey, Matthew Collings and Danny Kustow. Robinson, writing in 2005, refers to Finchden Manor as \\"long closed\\", and the Friends Reunited entry says that it closed in 1974, within a year of Lyward's death.

The church and college were built for the Society of Jesus of Lutsk in the 17th century. The cathedral is the main church in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lutsk, the college part of the National university of Food Technologies. ==History== The Society of Jesus mission in Lutsk was established in the first decade of the 17th century. King Casimir III of Poland, bishops Marcin II Szyszkowski and Pawe≈Ç III Wo≈Çucki founded the church which was designed by architects M. Gintz and Giacomo Briano. In 1616 the construction of church was started. There has been a segment of a castle on the site since the 15th century. In late 1630 the Renaissance church was completed. The plan was in the form of a Greek Cross. The construction of the college was completed in the middle of the 17th century. The architect was Benedetto Molli. Initially 150 students studied at the college. Later there were probably more than 300. Education was free and conducted at a high level. For this reason, there were large numbers of students from Lviv, Ostroh and Kiev. The curriculum covered moral theology, philosophy, mathematics, physics, ethics, fencing, languages, dance and theatre. In the 1620s and 1630s, there were conflicts between Jesuits and members of the Lutsk orthodox church. Some clashes and court cases are known. In 1627‚Äì1628 and 1639, Jesuit students attacked orthodox monks. Wojteh Helpovski tried to drown Serapion, a member of the orthodox fellowship. College students killed the monk Serapion. The Jesuit church was damaged in a fire on 14 June 1724. Architect Pawel Gizycki radically reconstructed the building over a six-year period, giving the building a new appearance. New walls were built around the old church and two towers were added near the corners of new walls. The west tower was square in plan, the east tower octagonal. In general, the new Jesuit church was in the Classicist style. A decree signed by Pope Clement XIV in July 1773 suppressed the Order leading to the closure of the college too. The Commission of National Education became the new owner of former Jesuit church which was soon elevated to a cathedral after the Holy Trinity cathedral on the same street was destroyed by fire and dismantled. The former Jesuit church the became Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral. The third partition of Poland took place in 1795. Volyn was annexed by the Russian Empire. The Russian government oppressed Catholics for various reasons. Thus many Catholic orders were turned back from empire territory. Many Catholic monasteries and churches were appealed during the 19th century. Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral was the only active Catholic church in Lutsk. In 1946, the Soviet government close the cathedral. Church was robbed, many icons, furniture and other church valuables were lost. The large organ was destroyed. The church used to be The Museum of Atheism in the 1980s. The cathedral was restored after the dissolution of the USSR. A new German organ was installed in 1999. Marcjan Trofimiak became a bishop the following year. ==Architecture== Cathedral The basilica consists of three naves, a bypass gallery and two corner towers. The main facade is decorated with five sculptures and Latin inscription boards. The three-storey college is situated behind the church. The most prominent is south-west facade. It is adorned by five massive avant-corps with triangular pediments and tiled roofs. The ruins of the old castle remain close to the south corner of the college. They consist of part of the wall and the 15th-century Czartoryski. The interior of church is decorated with paintings, epitaphs, commemorative plaques, old furniture, sculptures, reliefs, monograms, and etchings. There are very few paintings in the sacristy and chapel. Some paintings were restored and fitted to a niche in the wall. The oldest were completed in the 18th century. Some of them were moved from other churches. A few of the paintings were specifically prepared for the church. The oldest is by K. Willani, painted in 1801. The few paintings in sacristy show the Catholic churches of Lutsk: Dominican, Trinitarian, Bernardine and Carmelitan. The former Jesuit church is the main church in the diocese of Lutsk maintaining Volyn and Rivne oblasts. Marcjan Trofimiak is the bishop. The college building is used for the Volyn technikum which is part of the National University of food technologies. The three-level dungeon is open for tourists and can be accessed from behind the square tower. ==Gallery== File:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–ö–æ—Å—Ç–µ–ª–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ2.jpgSaint Paul File:Luzk-Kathedrale.jpgNapoleon Orda File:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–ö–∞—Ñ–Ñ–∑.jpgCollegium ==Sources== * Mieczys≈Çaw Or≈Çowicz, Ilustrowany przewodnik po Wo≈Çyniu. ≈Åuck 1929 * Grzegorz RƒÖkowski, Przewodnik po Zachodniej Ukrainie, czƒô≈õƒá I, Wo≈Çy≈Ñ * Adam Wojnicz. ≈Åuck na Wo≈Çyniu. ≈Åuck, 1922, s. 52-53 * ≈Åuck w S≈Çowniku geograficznym Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, t. 1, pod red.

This series of The Punisher continues the tradition of Matt Fraction's War Journal series and Rick Remender's previous Punisher series and places the character firmly in the ongoing Marvel Universe inhabited by superheroes such as the Avengers and Spider-Man. Although the series' first issue was released at the time of the Fear Itself event, Rucka stated his intent to focus the series solely on the Punisher's exploits without having larger Marvel U events interfere with the flow of the series, although because the series takes place within the shared universe, it allows him to interact with the super heroes and villains that inhabit it. ==Story== The series, although being a self-titled Punisher ongoing, does not have many internal monologues, nor does Castle speak often throughout the series. It's instead focused on the impact that the Punisher's actions have on those around him, and the repercussions those actions create for other characters involved in the story. In the first arc, Castle is committed to taking down a criminal organization known as \\"The Exchange,\\" and is later joined by a former Marine whose husband was murdered on the couple's wedding day. The grief-stricken wife, Rachel Cole, seeks the Punisher out and the two create a bond due to their mutual time in the United States Marine Corps. Cole (who insists on being addressed by her married name of Alves) serves under Castle's command, and the two treat each target they seek to kill as a two-man military operation with Castle maintaining a command structure. Midway through the series, Cole and the Punisher become involved in one of Daredevil's exploits, who is holding a device called the \\"Omega Drive\\" containing damning information on all the major crime organizations in the Marvel Universe. The Punisher wants the device for obvious reasons, as it would give him a multitude of new targets to neutralize. Spider-Man also becomes involved, and the story is told in one issue of Avenging Spider-Man, one issue of Daredevil, and one issue of The Punisher. ==Follow-up== The series concluded with issue #16, at which point Rucka and Checcetto moved on to a 5-issue mini-series entitled Punisher: War Zone to finish their story. The War Zone series involves the Punisher's operations in the final issues of the ongoing series attracting the attention of the Avengers.

He was indicted in the profanation of the Eleusinian mysteries in 415 during the Peloponnesian War, causing him to flee Athens. He is best remembered for his depiction in the dialogues of Plato. His philosophically erotic role in his eponymous dialogue and the Symposium inspired later authors, from the ancient comedic playwright Alexis to contemporary philosophers like Robert M. Pirsig and Martha Nussbaum.Martha Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001; pp. 200‚Äì224 ==Life== Phaedrus, here in the original Greek from the Codex Clarkianus manuscript. Phaedrus, whose name translates to \\"bright\\" or \\"radiant\\",John Sallis, Being and Logos, Indianapolis: University of Indiana Press, 1997; pp. 104‚Äì172 was born to a wealthy family sometime in the mid-5th century BC, and was the first cousin of Plato's stepbrother Demos. All sources remember him as an especially attractive young man.e.g., Plato, Phaedrus, 228c His depiction in the writing of Plato has led scholars to assume that he did not have his own system of philosophy, despite his interest in such contemporaneous movements as rhetoric, tragedy and sophism.Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002; pp. 233‚Äì234 He is present for the speeches delivered in Plato's Protagoras,Plato, Protagoras, 315c whose dramatic date of 433/432 suggests that Phaedrus was involved in prominent Athenian intellectual circles from a young age; the dialogue also notes his early interest in astronomy and long-standing friendship with the physician Eryximachus. The Symposium's certain dramatic date of 416 suggests his close association with Socrates by this time. Further details in Plato's writing point to Phaedrus' interests in mythology and natural science. On the Mysteries, an extant speech of Andocides, names Phaedrus as one of the individuals indicted by the city of Athens, at the behest of the metic Teucrus, in the profanation of the Eleusinian mysteries,Andocides, On the Mysteries, 1.15 a major domestic event preceding the calamitous Sicilian Expedition in 415. Archaeological evidence and a speech of LysiasLysias, 32 further attest to his role in this event. Phaedrus fled Athens at this time along with the other accused parties, losing his wealth and property in the process. Some scholars had previously interpreted Andocides as naming Phaedrus in his list of mutilators of the Herms, a contemporaneous Athenian scandal, but this is generally dismissed within present scholarship. Phaedrus married his first cousin, whose name is unknown, circa 404. After his early death in 393, his wife remarried Aristophanes, son of Nicophemus. ==Depiction in literature and influence== In his eponymous Platonic dialogue, Phaedrus recites a speech attributed to Lysias, while he calls upon several classical myths to construct a tragic account of Eros in the Symposium. His character in Plato, along with the ill-fated implications of his oncoming exile, has long exerted influence on literature and philosophy. Among the ancients, Alexis' mid-late 4th century comedic play Phaedrus depicts a man philosophizing on the nature of eros, while Diogenes La√´rtius assumes Phaedrus to be Plato's \\"favorite\\" individual.Diogenes La√´rtius, 3.29 Modern scholars such as Nussbaum and John Sallis have interpreted his character as an embodiment of the fecundity and potential tragedy of philosophical eroticism. ==See also== *List of speakers in Plato's dialogues ==References== Category:5th-century BC Athenians Category:4th-century BC Athenians Category:Ancient Greeks accused of sacrilege Category:Plato Category:Pupils of Socrates Category:440s BC births Category:393 BC deaths ","title":"Phaedrus (Athenian)"},{"id":"35914072","text":"Goatacara boliviana is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Goatacara.Bezark, Larry G.

Located in the Jewish quarter, it was the religious, educational and community centre of Lutsk () Jews until the invasion of Poland in the Second World War. It was built in 1626 and is a good example of a fortress synagogue.The Jews and Europe: 2000 Years of History, By Elena Romero, Uriel Mac√≠as Kap√≥n, Henry Holt, 1994, p. 150. Partially destroyed in 1942, the synagogue was restored in the 1970s. It is now used as a sports club. ==History== King Sigismund III Vasa The first records of the Jews in Lutsk date from 1388. Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted privileges for Lutsk Jews. Towards the end of the 15th century, the Jewish community of Lutsk had acquired considerable wealth and influence, and some of its members figured prominently as tax collectors. The Jews were generally engaged in trade but they also owned a brewery and operated guilds. Scientific research indicates that the first brick synagogue was built in second half of the 16th century. It is assumed the synagogue must have been destroyed by fire during the Tatars raid in 1617. The new synagogue was then built on the ruins of the old building. King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland approved the construction of a new synagogue and school on 5 May 1626. However construction of the synagogue was opposed by its Dominican neighbours. Under Christian rules, synagogues could not exceed a certain height. However, the king confirmed his approval and the Jewish community was victorious. The Dominicans had fallen from favor with the royal court. The height of synagogue was not to exceed that of the Dominican church. The cube-shaped prayer hall representing architecture of the Italian-Polish Renaissance was the main part of new synagogue. The walls were up to 1.5 m thick. There were two additional sections used by women and for the Jewish school or Yeshiva. A defensive tower containing the arsenal with loopholes was built on the southern corner of the prayer hall according to the wishes the king. The tower formed part of city walls, allowing the synagogue to contribute to defences in addition to its religious and educational roles. ===Modern era=== Lutsk Jews in the 19th century In 1869, the synagogue was damaged by fire. It was restored in 1886. In the 19th century, the way of life of the Jewish community of Lutsk had changed due to the economic and legislative features of Russian Empire. In accordance with the trends of the time, the Jewish community was segmented. New Jewish quarters with synagogues appeared in Lutsk. The old quarters were generally populated by poor Jews living in dirty wooden houses built close to each other. As a result, the main synagogue lost its central role. The synagogue was shelled during the First World War but not seriously damaged. In the Second Polish Republic, the city of ≈Åuck became the capital of the Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship (1921‚Äì39) and in 1936 the provincial administration contributed funds for its restoration. ===World War II=== The invading Soviets annexed the city to the Ukrainian SSR in 1939 along with the entire region. After the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Lutsk () became the sight of a pogrom organized by the Ukrainian People's Militia and the synagogue along with the Jewish district were set on fire.YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe, Lutsk. Following the Soviet liberation in February 1944, only about 150 Jews returned. By 1959, just 600 Jews were living in Lutsk. The fortified synagogue was turned into a movie theater and later into a sports hall. A residential area was constructed on the site of the Rabbinite and Karaite cemeteries. In December 1941 the Lutsk Ghetto was established. In August and September 1942, about 17,000 prisoners of the ghetto were killed by Order Police battalions. The ghetto was liquidated in December 1942. The former main synagogue building stood empty. Many years after the war it was reconstructed as a movie-house and a gym.Dr Pawel Goldstein, Lutsk (Luck) Ghetto. Geni.com. Retrieved 23 July 2015. ==Architecture== Building of the Synagogue remaining today Some researchers and museums have investigated the history of the synagogue. The Nahum Goldmann Museum of the Jewish Diaspora Beth Hatefutsoth located on the Tel Aviv University campus has a model of synagogue. The model reveals architectural details which were lost during the World Wars. The Center for Jewish Art in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem created a 3D-model of the exterior and interior. On 30 May 1995, a commemorative plaque dedicated to the lost Jews was erected on the synagogue wall. The former synagogue is a cube-shaped building with a tower. Rational clarity, brevity, and restraint in decoration contribute to its Renaissance style. No individual feature the synagogue reveals the building's religious character owing to the public functions of old synagogues. There are unexplored dungeons under the building. ==Gallery== File:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–°–∏–Ω–∞–≥–æ–≥–∞–†—É–π.jpgWartime destruction Image:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–°–∏–Ω–∞–≥–æ–≥–∞–ü–ª–∞–Ω.jpgPlan of the Synagogue File:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–°–∏–Ω–∞–≥–æ–≥–∞–í–∏—Å.jpgSynagogue (background) and Jesuit roof today File:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–°–∏–Ω–∞–≥–æ–≥–∞–ó–Ω–∞–∫.jpgPlaque File:–õ—É—Ü—å–∫–ì–∞–ª–°–∏–Ω.jpgSynagogue today ==References== * The Great Synagogue of Lutsk by Haim F.

The casino is owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties and operated by Penn National Gaming, and has of gaming space, with 2,002 slot machines, 60 table games, and 20 poker tables. ==History== After four failed attempts since 1990 to legalize casinos in Ohio, a fifth proposal was placed on the ballot in 2009 to allow casinos at four specific sites, one in each of the state's largest cities. The major backers were Penn National, which would build the casinos in Toledo and Columbus, and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, who would develop the Cleveland and Cincinnati properties. Critics charged that Penn National did not truly intend to build the Toledo casino, which would face stiff competition from Detroit casinos, and only wanted to generate support from local voters. Nevertheless, the measure passed, with 53 percent support both in Lucas County and the state as a whole. Days before the election, Penn National had struck a deal with Lakes Entertainment, a Minnesota-based gaming operator whose 2008 Ohio casino proposal Penn had fought hard to defeat. Lakes paid for 10 percent of the referendum campaign, and received an option to invest in up to 10 percent of the Toledo and Columbus casinos. Penn National bought out Lakes's interest in the projects for $25 million before construction began, after Lakes had paid $1.9 million. After the measure passed, Penn National exercised its option to buy the 44-acre property on the Maumee River at Interstate 75, site of a former Pilkington glass plant, for $2.5 million. Construction began in August 2010. In 2011, Governor John Kasich agreed to allow video lottery terminals at Ohio's seven racetracks, including Penn National's Raceway Park in Toledo. To avoid having its own racino compete with the Hollywood Casino, Penn sought state approval to move Raceway Park to the Youngstown area. In 2015, Hollywoodcasino.com was introduced as the digital casino for all Hollywood properties. ==References * Category:Casinos in Ohio Category:Tourist attractions in Toledo, Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Toledo, Ohio Category:2012 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Hollywood Casino Toledo"},{"id":"35914205","text":"Eburella is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.

Commissioned in 1942, he served as a Naval Aviator in the Pacific Theater in World War II, and was seriously burned when his aircraft was shot down during the Marianas Campaign. He made a full recovery from his injuries, and went on to serve in a variety of staff positions, attended the Naval War College, and commanded three attack squadrons and two ships. Beling was commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal (CVA-59) at the time of the July 29, 1967 fire that killed 134 Sailors, injured 161, and caused $72 million (1967 dollars) in damage to the ship. The Navy investigation into the fire cleared Beling of wrongdoing. After retiring from the Navy as a rear admiral in 1973, Beling worked as a Department of Defense civilian, as well as for a defense contractor, before retiring for good in 1985. He died November 5, 2010 in Reston, Virginia. ==Early life and career== John Kingsman Beling was born in New York City on October 29, 1919, and was raised in Harrington Park, New Jersey. He was the son of Aelian Arnold Beling, born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 31 December 1879 and Mable Ashe Jackson (b.1886). Aelian Arnold Beling was a Ceylonese Burgher or Dutch Burgher, the son of William Wright Beling I (Proctor) and Maria Elizabeth Prins, who were married in the Dutch Reformed Church, Wolvendahl, Ceylon on 1 February 1864. Aelian was also the younger brother of the Ceylonese artist William Wright Beling II (1867 - 1928). John Kingsman Beling graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology in 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Beling joined the Naval Reserve as an aviation specialist, and was commissioned an Ensign upon completion of flight training in 1943, after which he headed to the Pacific theater as a dive bomber pilot with Bombing Squadron ONE (VB-1). Beling was shot down over the island of Yap during the Marianas Campaign in 1944. Although badly burned, Beling was able to make his way out to open sea, where a seaplane from the cruiser USS Biloxi spotted him. After being hospitalized for his burns, he rejoined the fleet as a fighter pilot. Beling received a Ph.D in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951, and afterwards served in a variety of operational, research & development, testing, and evaluation assignments, including a tour at the Office of Naval Research in London and at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. He also served in Air Test and Development Squadron FIVE (VX-5), and twice served in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, in roles pertaining to weapons development. He also served as Assistant Chief of Staff and Force Training Officer at the headquarters of Commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic (COMNAVAIRLANT) at NAS Norfolk, Virginia. Aside from his command of Forrestal, from May 1966 to September 1967, Beling commanded two attack squadrons and the stores ship USS Alstede (AF-48). Beling was promoted to rear admiral in 1968. ==Forrestal fire== Then-Captain Beling was commanding officer of USS Forrestal on July 29, 1967, when a Zuni rocket accidentally fired while on deck, striking another aircraft. In the initial moments of the disaster, which eventually killed 134 sailors and injured 167 more, including then-Lieutenant Commander and future U.S. Senator John McCain, Beling‚Äîwho had been in his cabin at the time and was clad only in a t-shirt and uniform pants‚Äîordered the ship slowed, to reduce the force of wind gusts blowing across the flight deck, and gave directions for incoming helicopters, sent to transport wounded Sailors off Forrestal, to land at the front of the deck to keep rotor wash from fanning the flames. Beling would personally direct damage control efforts from the bridge throughout the ten-hour ordeal. As night fell, Beling recited a prayer to the surviving crew: The subsequent Navy investigation absolved Beling of responsibility for the fire. While Forrestal was in the shipyard for repairs, Beling was temporarily assigned to work in the office of Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, then the Chief of Naval Operations. While there, he was sent for further temporary duty on the staff of Admiral Ephraim P. Holmes, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet; Holmes disagreed with many portions of the Navy's report into the Forrestal disaster, including the section clearing Beling, and had him assigned to his staff so he could issue a letter of reprimand, in essence both holding Beling responsible and ending his career. The reprimand was attached to the final report, and was subsequently rescinded by Admiral Holmes on direct orders from Admiral Moorer after the latter endorsed the report. ==Later career and death== Beling was promoted to rear admiral in 1968, and was given orders to command a carrier battle group out of San Diego. However, his orders were cancelled by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Moorer's successor as Chief of Naval Operations, who, in a move perceived as a way of holding him responsible for the Forrestal fire, instead sent him to Iceland, where he would retire as Commander, Iceland Defense Force, based at Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland. He retired from active duty in 1973, at which time he went to work as director of the Net Technical Assessment Office, responsible for comparing and contrasting U.S. and Soviet weapons systems for the Secretary of Defense. In 1977, Beling joined the McLean, Virginia-based TRW, working as a strategic analyst directing studies until retiring again in 1985. After his final retirement, Beling took up farming, and served as director of the USS Forrestal Museum, a group dedicated to preserving the carrier, which was decommissioned in 1993, as a museum ship. Admiral Beling died of complications from pneumonia at Reston Hospital Center in Reston, Virginia on November 5, 2010. He was 91 years old.

A graduate of North Carolina State University, Braunskill is an 11x NCAA D1 All- American, World Junior champion, World Cup champion, Pan American Champion all at 200m. He was also a 10x USA National championships finalist in the event with a best time of 20.01 and highest world ranking of 6. He received a 1-year suspension after he tested positive for a PED at the New York Games on May 22, 1994. USA Track and Field exonerated Braunskill of any wrongdoing, but the suspension came from IAAF and effected his Eorpean competitions. He went on to compete for another 10 years in the sport. Braunskill is probably best known for what he did those next 10 years. He took advantage of a bad situation and vowed to do right by it. His belief was that \\"you wont be great until you do more without the spikes on your feet than you do with the spikes on your feet.\\" Remarkably, Braunskill never lost his Home Depot or Champion Apparel sponsors. In fact, he used this platform to travel more than any other track and field athlete. He donated 100% of his appearance fees to whatever organization that had kids in the town and country he competed in. From giving teddy bears to the sick youth at a children's hospital in Tel Aviv, Israel to providing South Africa's poverty stricken housing developments with anti fire paint to paint their homes. Braunskill has definitely become an ambassador around the world and can definitely say he has done more to influence without his spikes than with his spikes. He is a Bronze Star decorated retired Army Officer. Braunskill is married to Shantal Braunskill of Cape Town, South Africa and they have two children, Kevin jr and Chelsea. ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:American male sprinters Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1991 Pan American Games Category:Universiade bronze medalists for the United States Category:Medalists at the 1989 Summer Universiade ","title":"Kevin Braunskill"},{"id":"35914330","text":"Susuacanga is a genus of beetles in the family Cerambycidae, containing the following species:Bezark, Larry G.
