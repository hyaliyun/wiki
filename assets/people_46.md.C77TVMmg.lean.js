The Chinese minority is a small proportion of the East Timorese population, and most are Hakka. Many Chinese left during the mid-1970s. ==Pre-Colonial Era== As early as the 10th century CE, Timorese sandalwood was being transported to China through the Straits of Malacca. The Chinese official Zhao Rukuo in 1225 CE mentioned Timor in his collected notes from traders as a location rich in sandalwood. Although Santalum album is found across many parts of the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, the highest quality white sandalwood was considered to come from Timor, the Sunda Islands and Solor. Around 1350, Chinese authors wrote in the Tao-i chin-lueh: In Timor's mountains the only trees that grow are sandalwood. The wood is traded with those further west for silver, iron, goblets and coloured fabric. In total, there are twelve locations that are used as harbours. The Chinese traded porcelain, glass and silver with the Timorese for the sandalwood, which was used in China for ritual and medicinal purposes. For centuries the Chinese traders remained the only foreigners who ventured into the interior of the island of Timor, although they generally only remained in Timor as long as it took to do business, it being located too far from the trade routes between China, India and the larger islands for them to settle there. ==Colonial Era== The Jiajing Emperor forbid all trade by sea in 1551. The Portuguese had recently reached East Asia, filling the gap in the trade routes between the Lesser Sunda Islands and China. However, the Chinese traders returned soon after, predominantly via the Portuguese-controlled port of Macau in southern China. In the middle of the 17th century CE around twenty Junks visited the island of Timor each year, bringing rice and other goods. Chinese traders from Macau established trade relationships with the Timorese in the areas controlled by the Portuguese, and later also in the areas controlled by the Dutch. From this point, they also began settling in Timor, initially in Kupang und Lifau, then later also in Atapupu und Dili. They were so successful that in 1614 that the Dutch traders complained that the Chinese traders were outcompeting them with their goods, which were produced in China at a much lower cost. Another Dutch source reported that traders from Macau were making profits of 200% on Timorese sandalwood, stating in 1646 that 1000 Bahar of Sandalwood being transported to Macau annually. Yongzheng Emperor permitted outside trade again in 1723, which allowed the creation of the trade triangle Canton – Timor – Batavia (today known as Jakarta), but which made trade via Macau unprofitable. In 1775 there existed a Chinese quarter in Kupang, from where food production and supply was controlled. In addition the Chinese continued to control the sandalwood trade via Macassar to China and also the trade in beeswax to Java, where it was required in the production of batik. Wax was also used to produce candles for trade. Other trade products included honey and slaves, and a great deal of smuggling was also conducted. Some Chinese from Kupang and Atapupu later began also took up business as roaming traders in the interior of Timor. At this time, around 300 Chinese families lived in Kupang, Atapupu and Dili, mainly originating from Macau. ===19th century=== In the 19th century, Portuguese Timor was administered from the colonial authorities in Macau. The colony in Timor ran at a financial loss, and was financed by funds from the relatively wealthy Macau. In 1832, there were around 300 Chinese families in the Portuguese half of Timor alone. In the late 19th century, Portuguese governor José Celestino accused Chinese traders and smugglers from Atapupu in Dutch-controlled West Timor of supplying arms to native Timorese in the eastern half, who were mounting rebellions and insurgencies against Portuguese colonial rule. However, for the most part the Chinese shared a similar fate to that of the Portuguese colonial population. When in 1861 Dili was threatened by native Timorese rebels, governor Afonso de Castro himself armed the Chinese inhabitants of the city so that they could join in defence of the city. During a revolt of native troops serving in the colonial military, the leader of the Chinese community of Dili, the Capitão China, was murdered. A. Marques Perreira, commissioner for Chinese migration from Macao to Portuguese Timor, attested to the Chinese community that they were the most useful section of Dili's population conducting important crafts such as woodworking, of which the native Timorese had no knowledge. In addition to this, they conducted a large section of the trade through the city. In 1877, a missionary of Chinese descent was given charge of educating the Chinese schoolchildren in Dili. ===20th century=== With the beginnings of steamship traffic between Macau and Dili, the migration of Chinese to Portuguese Timor increased. Among the migrants were some fleeing the rule of the Manchu emperors. By 1912, the Chinese community was well-organised, possessing a Chinese Society Building, and Buddhist temple and their own school. Clube Chum Fuk Tong Su, the first Chinese school in the colony, offered classes in Chinese and taught further subjects including English, Zoology and Botany. In 1926 a statue of Buddha was brought over from China, and from 1928 onwards stood in the new Guan Yu Temple which neighboured the government palace. This state and temple still exist today, as does the old Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Before the beginning of the Second World War, around 2000 Chinese lived in the colony. The island of Timor was occupied by the Japanese in 1942, following the Battle of Timor, which saw a great deal of suffering inflicted on both the Chinese community and the indigenous Timorese. 60 Chinese were killed by the occupiers, with a further 200 dying of hunger and mistreatment. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, East Timor was returned to Portuguese colonial rule. In the 1960s, the Republic of China (Taiwan), which at that point represented China at the United Nations, opened a consulate in Dili. Estimates of the Chinese population of Portuguese Timor during this era vary - in 1970 the official number of Chinese inhabitants was 6,120, however other sources give higher figures. In 1975, it was estimated that up to 20,000 Chinese lived in the colony, many of whom possessed Taiwanese citizenship. ==1975 Declaration of Independence and Indonesian invasion== When East Timor unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975, the People's Republic of China was one of the few countries which granted it official recognition. The Hakka Chinese community in Dili were guaranteed full citizenship in the new country by the FRETILIN government. However, only nine days later the Indonesian military occupied East Timor, with many of the Chinese community being killed or fleeing to Australia during the invasion. For example, several members of the Chinese community took refuge in the Toko Lay building in Dili. Members of the Chinese minority were also victims of ethnic persecution by the occupying forces in the years which followed. According to research by Loro Horta, son of José Ramos-Horta, the People's Republic of China attempted to support the FALINTIL resistance with delivery of weapons. However, an ocean blockade by Australian and Indonesian warships stopped this from being successful, and the armaments, including weaponry for 8,000 soldiers, artillery and anti-tank weapons were instead sent to Mozambique, where they were given to rebels fighting against the RENAMO. After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the engagement between China and East Timor dropped away, having almost entirely ceased by 1978 except for some limited contact via individuals and financial assistance for the Timorese resistance which was helped through by Chinese businesspeople. ==Independence era 2002–present== Chinese cemetery of Dili The majority of East Timorese Hakka migrated to Australia during the era of Indonesian occupation, mainly living in Darwin, with smaller communities in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Furthermore, in the aftermath of the riots that followed the independence process in 2002, many businesses owned by ethnic Chinese in Dili were targeted for arson attacks. A small number have since returned, including politicians Pedro Lay, who had fled to Australia in 1975. Since the renewed independence of East Timor in 2002 and the United Nations administration, the People's Republic of China has again become one of the most important partners of East Timor, being the first nation to begin diplomatic relations in 2002. The Chinese government has taken part in peacekeeping missions. Besides trade connections, China also provides assistance for East Timor in the military and cultural fields. This has including training and equipment for East Timorese farmers, police, soldiers and medical teams, inviting East Timorese students to study in China, and financing the construction of the presidential palace and foreign ministry in Dili and of the army headquarters in Metinaro. Attempts on the part of the Taiwanese government to make connections with East Timor have met with resistance from the PRC government. Around 500 East Timorese list Chinese as their mother tongue, with a further 2,342 citizens of the People's Republic of China living in the country in 2008, according to the Chinese Embassy. The department of immigration estimates that there may actually be as many as 3,000, including a number who reside in the country illegally. The Chinese community mainly operation small businesses and restaurants in the capital, as well as small stores in rural areas, where there are often no other shops. ==Notable People of East Timorese Chinese descent== * Lin Jong * Jeffrey Lay * Pedro Lay * Francisco Kalbuadi Lay * Simon Jong * Edwin Lay == See also == * Toko Lay * Chinese Temple of Dili * Chinese cemetery of Dili == References and footnotes == East Timor Category:Ethnic groups in East Timor ","title":"Chinese people in East Timor"},{"id":"42026882","text":"Collin, Dumfries an Gallowa Collin is a small village between Dumfries and Gretna in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.

Built between 1919 and 1921, the project was Wils' breakthrough as an architect. Today the Papaverhof is a Rijksmonument that is one of the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites. The complex was restored in 1958, 1971, 1989, and 2006. The Papaverhof includes 128 middle- class homes built in horseshoe fashion around a sunken garden. Besides the communal garden in the middle, each home has its own yard with enclosing wooden fence and cement flower pots in matching architectural style. == Architect == Cement homes in the complex The architect of the Papaverhof, Jan Wils (Alkmaar, Netherlands 1891 - Voorburg, Netherlands 1972), was the son of a building contractor in Alkmaar. Wils worked extensively with his father and took evening courses for construction drawing. In The Hague, he worked for Hendrik Berlage, who encouraged Wils' social engagement and introduced him to Frank Lloyd Wright’s work. In 1916, Wils established his own architectural firm in The Hague, hiring hired Piet Zwart as a drafter in 1919. == Construction == Two houses at the back of the complex In 1917, the Cooperative Residential Construction Association Garden City Neighborhood ‘Daal en Berg’ decided to build the Papaverhof, a complex of houses and apartments between The Hague and Loosduinen. The association originally planned to sponsor a competition for the project design, but the association commissioner, Hendrik Berlage, objected to it. The association originally chose M.J. Granpré Molière and P. Verhagen to be the architects. However, their design was missing a municipal extension plan. At Berlage's suggestion, the association finally selected Wils' design for Papaverhof. The cooperative had great respect for Wils, allowing him to design atypical housing for that period. Wils configured the Papaverhof housing units as two horseshoes around a lawn square, creating the spatial effect of a garden city. The inner ring contained 68 two story high family houses. The outer contained 60 apartments. Wils placed the units in a ‘back to back’ configuration that multiplied the facades with light and air supply for the kitchen and bedrooms without lowering the density of the neighborhood. In the Papaverhof interior design, Wils created a rhythmic composition of cubes and planes without a specific front nor back. The interior breaks as well with the classical patterns of an underused best room and tiny back room by designing one big living room of 7 x 4,25 meter. Because of the 60 centimeters interior floor difference between the side entrance and the living area, also the exterior detachment of the main mass jumps out. With the repetition of the module it creates a rhythmical collective façade with two singular ends. Map of the complex Balcony on one of the houses at the opposite of the Papaverhof, also built by Jan Wils The builders used cinders concrete for the first 30 Papaverhof homes. However, the poor quality of this material and its minimal cost benefit moved them to change to brick for the remaining houses. The builders then covered the brick family houses with cement to make them look like the cinder concrete houses. The technical innovations of the Papaverhof design are demonstrated by the pivoting windows, intercom for the main door, automatically dimming lights and waste disposal chutes. Such innovations illustrate Wils' forwarding thinking. == Reception == In 1920, while the Papaverhof was still under constructions, its design was exhibited in the Royal School of Art, Technology and Craft in 's-Hertogenbosch. And although almost financially ruining Jan Wils’ design office, the Papaverhof quickly was internationally known. The German journal Wasmuths Monatshefte für Baukunst wrote in 1921 that the Papaverhof grouped houses were very detailed and innovative. “The houses don’t have facades anymore, but each building part is expressed in detail and brought into relation with the surroundings through proportion and dimensions in contrast and harmonious in the same time.” The Papaverhof design may contain references to other contemporaneous architects. Oud’s design for a strand boulevard in Scheveningen (1917) has many similarities. It is remarkable that the explanations they have for their design are both related to ‘planes and masses with rhythmic ordering’. Frank Lloyd Wright’s Lexington Terraces (1894) project in Chicago, Illinois are often linked with the Papaverhop design, as this housing complex with light wells is also configured around a rectangular courtyard. But the closed façade makes the spatial feeling rather massive than planar of fragmented. The Papaverhof can be an example for color use and architecture of De Stijl, but its brick surroundings could fit better in the descriptions of The Hague School. The New Hague School is a style from the interwar period, that distinguishes itself through the sleek design of the Modern Movement and luxurious implementation. == Restorations == In 1971, the Daal en Berg association completed an extensive renovation of the Papaverhof. However, by 1986, the complex was suffering extensive problems with water infiltration and needed another renovation. The association commissioned the restoration firm Franso and Partners Architects to study the Papaverhof's building history. The 1958/1960 renovation eaves that many critics pointed out as being an example of Frank Lloyd Wright style, actually deviated from the original plan and were removed. External isolation was applied with respect for the proportions. The association restored the original vivid blue and yellow colors to the inner circle, but kept the non-original white and black colors of the outer ring for esthetic reasons. The contractors Boele & van Eesteren realized the plans and in October 1989 the definitive acceptance took place. This renovation was largely covered in the journal press in the Netherlands, and received a nomination for the National Renovation Price and the National Painting Price in 1991. ==Notes References == *Bergeijk, Herman van.

Special corners on the upper floor are dedicated to the life and works of around 50 renowned authors native to Istanbul, with busts of some, including Nedîm (1681–1730), Yahya Kemal Beyatlı (1884–1958), Nâzım Hikmet Ran (1902–1963), Necip Fazıl Kısakürek (1904–1983), Aziz Nesin (1915–1995), Orhan Pamuk (born 1952), Ayşe Kulin (born 1941), Zülfü Livaneli (born 1946) and Doğan Hızlan (born 1937) in addition to Tanpınar. It is also a place for discussions on various authors, poetry performances, literature award ceremonies, and writing workshops. The library of the museum accommodates over 8,000 books, including about 1,000 books on Istanbul as well as volumes of more than 100 periodicals on literature and other fields of the arts. The museum hosts also temporary art exhibitions. It is the fourth of its kind in Turkey after the literature museums in Ankara, Adana and Diyarbakır. The museum library is accessible by the public transport line Tram T1 (Kabataş–Bağcılar), and is open on weekdays between 10:00 and 19:00 local time. One enters the museum by climbing a ramp inside the Gülhane park walls. ==Gallery== File:Alay Kiosk 5806.jpgProcession kiosk exterior File:Alay Kiosk 2569.jpgProcession kiosk Entrance ramp from park File:Alay Kiosk 2219.jpgProcession kiosk Interior File:Alay Kiosk 2231.jpgProcession kiosk exterior File:Alay Kiosk 3781.jpgProcession kiosk interior File:Alay Kiosk 3782.jpgProcession kiosk Wall painting File:Alay Kiosk 3786.jpgProcession kiosk Downstairs area ==Gallery== File:Alay Kiosk 5806.jpgProcession kiosk exterior File:Alay Kiosk 2569.jpgProcession kiosk from park File:Alay Kiosk 2219.jpgProcession kiosk Interior File:Alay Kiosk 2231.jpgProcession kiosk exterior File:Alay Kiosk 3781.jpgProcession kiosk interior File:Alay Kiosk 3782.jpgProcession kiosk Wall painting File:Alay Kiosk 3786.jpgProcession kiosk Downstairs area ==See also== * Ahmet Arif Literature Museum Library, Diyarbakır * Mehmet Akif Literature Museum Library, Ankara ==References== Category:Museums in Istanbul Category:Museums established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Turkey Category:Literary museums in Turkey Category:Libraries in Turkey Category:Literary archives Category:Turkish literature Category:Topkapı Palace Category:Fatih ","title":"Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar Literature Museum Library"},{"id":"42026912","text":"Toxicocalamus is a genus of snakes in the family Elapidae. The genus is endemic to New Guinea. ==Description== Most species of Toxicocalamus are relatively small, the largest specimen known being the holotype of the recently described Toxicocalamus ernstmayri, which measures snout-to-vent length (SVL) and in total length (TTL). The second longest is the holotype of T. grandis, which measures SVL, TTL. Most species are under TTL, and several are the thickness of bootlaces. In general females have longer bodies than males, but much shorter tails. ==Venom== Members of genus Toxicocalamus are venomous, with fixed front-fangs (a dental arrangement known as proteroglyphous), but are not known to be a threat to humans, being unaggressive, of modest size, and secretive. However, the venom of T. longissimus is believed to be fairly toxic, since it contains three-finger toxins (3FTx), Type-I phospholipase A (PLA) and snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP), while T. buergersi possesses long venom glands than extend backwards into the body cavity. ==Behaviour== Although most species of Toxicocalamous are believed to be diurnal, they are fossorial, or semi-fossorial, in habit and rarely encountered.O'Shea, M. (1996). A Guide to the Snakes of Papua New Guinea. Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea: Independent Publishing. vii + 239 pp. .. ==Geographic range== Many species of Toxicocalamus are localised in their distribution and associated with particular islands or mountain ranges. Several species are poorly known, with four known only from their holotypes. Toxicocalamus is probably not closely related to the Australian Elapidae, being endemic to the island of New Guinea, northern coastal offshore islands, i.e. Seleo Is. (Sandaun Province, PNG); Walis Is. and Tarawai Is. (East Sepik Province, PNG), and Karkar Is. (Madang Province, PNG), and the archipelagoes of Milne Bay Province to the southeast, i.e. d'Entrecasteaux Archipelago (Goodenough Is., Fergusson Is., and Normanby Is.), Woodlark Is., and the Louisiade Archipelago (Misima Is., Sudest Is., and Rossel Is.). ==Diet== The prey of snakes in the genus Toxicocalamus appears to consist almost entirely of earthworms, particularly the giant earthworms of the Megascolecidae, hence the adoption of the term \\"worm-eating snakes\\" for species within this genus. ==Reproduction== In common with other tropical elapids, Toxicocalamus is believed to reproduce by oviparity, with clutch sizes of 3–7 recorded, dependent on species and size of the female. ==Natural history== The natural history of many species of Toxicocalamus is almost entirely undocumented, due to a paucity of specimens and the infrequence of their encounter in the field. ==Species== The following 15 species, and single subspecies, are currently recognised as being valid in the genus Toxicocalamus:at The Reptile Database * Toxicocalamus buergersi (Sternfeld, 1913) (in German). Torricelli Mountains snake * Toxicocalamus cratermontanus Kraus, 2017 Crater Mountain snake * Toxicocalamus ernstmayri O'Shea, Parker & Kaiser, 2015 Star Mountains snake * Toxicocalamus grandis (Boulenger, 1914) Setakwa River snake * Toxicocalamus holopelturus McDowell, 1969 Rossel Island snake * Toxicocalamus longissimus Boulenger, 1896 Woodlark Island snake * Toxicocalamus loriae (Boulenger, 1898) Common worm-eating snake * Toxicocalamus mintoni Kraus, 2009 Sudest Island snake * Toxicocalamus misimae McDowell, 1969 Misima Island snake * Toxicocalamus nigrescens Kraus, 2017 Fergusson Island worm-eating snake * Toxicocalamus pachysomus Kraus, 2009 Cloudy Mountains worm-eating snake * Toxicocalamus preussi (Sternfeld, 1913) Preuss' slender worm-eating snake :* Toxicocalamus preussi preussi (Sternfeld, 1913) Preuss' slender worm-eating snake :* Toxicocalamus preussi angusticinctus Bogert & Matalas, 1945 Fly River slender worm-eating snake * Toxicocalamus pumehanae O'Shea, Allison & Kaiser, 2018 Managalas Plateau snake * Toxicocalamus spilolepidotus McDowell, 1969 Krakte Mountains spotted snake * Toxicocalamus stanleyanus Boulenger, 1903 Owen Stanley Mountains snake Nota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Toxicocalamus. These former genera, Apistocalamus, Apisthocalamus, Pseudapistocalamus, Pseudapisthocalamus, Ultrocalamus, and Vanapina, are now synonyms of Toxicocalamus. The former species Pseudapisthocalamus nymani Lönnberg, 1900; Apisthocalamus pratti Boulenger, 1904; A. loennbergii Boulenger, 1908; and A. lamingtoni Kinghorn, 1928; are synonyms of T. loriae, Vanapina lineata De Vis, 1905 is a synonym of T. longissimus, and Ultrocalamus latisquamatus Schüz, 1929 (in German). is a synonym of T. preussi. Most of the described species are poorly known and rarely encountered. The most widely distributed, and most commonly encountered, species is T. loriae (itself a possible species complex), which accounts for 66% of all Toxicocalamus specimens in museum collections. T. loriae is frequently encountered in the Highlands, where large numbers have been collected in village gardens along the Wahgi River valley of Simbu Province, PNG. The next most frequently encountered and widely distributed species are T. preussi and T. stanleyanus. All the other species are much less well known and localised in distribution. Also on mainland New Guinea, T. buergersi is known from only six specimens, from the Torricelli Mountains in the Sepik region (Sandaun and East Sepik Provinces), PNG; T. spilolepidotus is known from two specimens, from the Kratke Range, Eastern Highlands Province, PNG; T. pachysomus is known from its holotype, from the Cloudy Mountains, Milne Bay Province; PNG, T. cratermontanus from its holotype, from Crater Mountain, Simbu Province, PNG, while T. ernstmayri was only known from its holotype in the Star Mountains of Western Province, PNG, until a second specimen was observed crawling across mine-workings at the Ok Tedi Mine, in the Star Mountains. Toxicocalamus grandis is also only known from its holotype, collected on the Setakwa River, western New Guinea, in 1912, (the only species represented by a type specimen west of the WNG/PNG border), and T. pumehanae is also only known from its holotype, from the Managalas Plateau, Oro Province, PNG,. On the islands of Milne Bay, T. holopelturus is known from 19 specimens from Rossel Island, also known as Yela; T. misimae is known from six specimens from Misima Island; and T. mintoni is only known from its holotype, from Sudest Island, also known as Vanantai or Tagula Island, all in the Louisiade Archipelago. Toxicocalamus nigrescens is only known from its holotype and paratype, from Fergusson Island, in the d'Entercasteaux Archipelago, while T. longissimus is known from 12 specimens from Woodlark Island. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:Elapidae Category:Venomous snakes Category:Snake genera Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger ","title":"Toxicocalamus"},{"id":"42026920","text":"Les Suprêmes (The Supreme Ones) is the junior-level synchronized skating team representing the figure skating club Club de Patinage Artistique de Saint- Léonard (CPA St-Léonard) in Montréal, Quebec, Canada.

His place of birth and exact date of death have yet to established. ==Life== Like other automobile pioneers Max Wenkel began his career as an engineer and inventor with the construction of bicycles. He built his first pennyfarthing bicycle while still an apprentice engineer, and was soon taking part in races with well-known cyclists such as Willy Tischbein, who later became Director General of the Continental-Caoutchouc and Guttapercha Company.ADAC Motorwelt, 1929, No. 7, p. 17 He accompanied the future founder of the Adler Bicycle and Automobile Company, Dr. Heinrich Kleyer, on a trip to study the manufacture of bicycles in England at the beginning of the 1880s. Later he was employed at the Duplex bicycle factory in Berlin.Automobil- Rundschau, 1904, no. 3, p. 431 Wenkel's water tricycle 1895 In 1895 he successfully experimented with a water velocipede on the rivers Leine and Ihme near Hanover.Dinglers polytechnisches Journal, 1896, no. 299, pp. 172–179 As early as 1899 he exhibited a small car at the First International Exhibition in Berlin.Automobil-Rundschau, 1904, no. 3, p. 431 Between 1901 and 1903 Wenkel travelled through East India, Java, Sumatra and Borneo, where he built the first Wenkelmobils in rather primitive conditions.Siegfried M. Pistorius, \\"Sensation um die Jahrhundertwende.

Archive letter S Wenkel won numerous prizes with it in races in its small-car class. In 1906 and 1907 he travelled the length of South America down to Patagonia in a Wenkelmobil. He was officially commissioned to open up the Cordillera region for motor traffic, and also built flat-bottomed speed boats suitable for Argentine rivers.ADAC Motorwelt, 1929, no. 7, p. 17 Wenkel acquired several patents, e.g. for the Wenkelmobil’s friction drive and a high-speed compression and vacuum pump. The Berlin Directory lists him as engineer and owner of a technical bureau and export firm during World War I. When well over sixty he won the prestigious Garbaty Trophy with his speedboat \\"Java II\\", in 1929.Die Yacht, 1930, issue 9, p. 22 Three years later he was still making his mark with the invention of a \\"motor in a trunk car\\", a newfangled though unsuccessful miniature automobile.Immo Sievers , \\"Der Frontantrieb aus Spandau setzte Maßstäbe\\" in: Berliner Zeitung, 27/09/1995 An article in a boys’ yearbook in 1943 suggests that Wenkel died in that year, but his precise date of death has yet to be confirmed.Jungen - eure Welt!, vol. 6, 1943, p. 438. This is an adapted version of the abovementioned article by Siegfried M. Pistorius of 1938 ==Wenkelmobil== Early Wenkelmobil built in Java Wenkelmobil front view Wenkel's first car, built around 1899, was based on a light tubular steel frame for an air-cooled De-Dion-Bouton engine, originally developed for tricycles. The rear axle was chain-driven. The next model, a four-seater with a break chassis and a stronger water-cooled Aster motor with battery ignition, he was already calling a \\"Wenkelmobil\\". With an improved 4-hp version with a Belgian Vivinus engine he travelled through the Far East from 1901 to 1903 and built Wenkelmobils adapted to the tropical climate in Java, where petrol was very cheap.\\"Automobiling in the Tropics\\" in The Horseless Age, 25 November 1903, pp. 557-8 The construction followed that of light American steam cars, with a standing engine in the rear and friction drive.Zeitschrift des Mitteleuropäischen Motorwagen-Vereins, no. XXI, 1904, pp. 431-432 After his return to Berlin Schneider & Co produced several models of the Wenkelmobil, which was at first a reasonably successful small car. The construction of the car was described in a contemporary automobile magazine with reference to the picture alongside:Zeitschrift des Mitteleuropäischen Motorwagen-Vereins, no. 20, 1906, pp. 499-500 (The confusing numbering of these two issues is authentic!) Chassis of a Wenkelmobil \\"The engine a sets the face plate b, which serves as the flywheel, into motion and the rotation is transferred to the discus wheel c. Through this the shaft dd with the sprocket turns. Thus the chain e drives the rear axle. The speed is adjusted by shifting the discus wheel c on the shaft dd by means of the hand lever fastened to the left of the upper end of the steering column and the articulated lever f. The bearings of the shaft dd with the discus wheel c can be shifted forwards and backwards carriage-like by the hand lever g to the right of the driver's seat. By means of this hand lever the discus wheel c is engaged with the face plate b and the engine, or idling, pressed backwards against the brake arm f to brake the car. So this lever serves both to brake and to engage the clutch. Independently of the aforementioned brake there are two band brakes r1 and r2 on both rear wheels. The beehive radiator n cools the cylinders by means of the belt-driven pump l. The chassis is made of iron-reinforced wood. The front axle is straight, the rear axle is full-length and has no differential.\\" Wenkelmobil with glass screen and folding roof The inventor Wenkel on his Wenkelmobil in 1906 Wenkelmobil at Memmingen Westertor in 1910 In 1906 a model with a 9/10 hp engine was produced, but in the long run the car was not able to compete because of its friction drive and lack of a differential. In 1907, while Wenkel was travelling through South America, production of the Wenkelmobil was stopped because of falling demand. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:Place of birth unknown Category:1943 deaths Category:German inventors Category:German automotive pioneers Category:Engineers from Berlin ","title":"Max Wenkel"},{"id":"42027053","text":"The men's sanda (as Sanshou) 70 kg at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar was held from 11 to 14 December at the Aspire Hall 3 in Aspire Zone.

Players could alter the appearance of their in-game avatar as well as the properties of their weapons at the cost of some premium in-game currency. Edge of Reality has since discontinued development of the game. On Jan 23, 2018, CE-Asia (in collaboration with P-40) published the game on PlayStation 4 in several Asian countries as a paid \\"Premium Edition\\". Other game servers were sunset on May 24, 2018, due to the inability to provide compliance with the onset of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. On September 26, 2020, Loadout Premium's servers were shut down due to inability to afford the server cost, leaving no servers of the game available. ==Gameplay== There were five types of game modes: Death Snatch, Blitz, Jackhammer, Annihilation, and Extraction, most of which were based around collecting Blutonium, a fictional element. ;Death Snatch: Upon killing an enemy player, the dead player will drop a vial of Blutonium which can be grabbed to add to team score. ;Extraction: Extraction is a game mode in which the first team to win is the one to collect the most Blutonium, an object in the game that rewards one team with points. A player who is designated as the Collector has to travel around, picking up Blutonium and depositing it in the provided baskets, gaining points. The Collectors are chosen randomly from the currently alive players. ;Blitz: The map is dotted with poles and one will be designated as a control point. Teams will compete for control of the point, as standing near it slowly raises a team-colored pair of boxers, as well as taking down the enemy's boxers. When the boxers reach the top of the flag, the point is captured and it is added to the team score. ;Jackhammer: Jackhammer is a gamemode similar to Capture the Flag, except the player can kill people with the flag. The goal is to take the enemy's hammer and return it to the player's base. When the enemy's hammer is in control, the player can smash people with it, killing them instantly. Each hammer has 5 smashes per capture. Capturing the hammer will add to the team score. ;Annihilation: Annihilation is a game mode that combines elements from other game modes. The goal is to get a team score of 10,000. Several things can add to the team score. Players drop Blutonium vials on death, similar to Death Snatch. The vials can be picked up to gain team score points. As well, there are two control points which can be captured to gain a temporary damage buff, and adding to the team score, similar to Blitz. There is also a Jackhammer, which can be captured and used to kill people. Adding to the team score will give the player a growing supply of personal Blutonium, which can be used to purchase upgrades for their character. There are three types of upgrades. The first is attack, which buff the amount of damage dealt, the second is Tank, which adds the amount of damage able to withstand, and Health, which increases the healing the player can give to others and adds to the effectiveness of health packs. Once a team has reached 10,000 points, the team must take the enemy's hammer back to their base, and charge it. Then, the team must take the hammer back to the enemy's base, and smash it inside the base, destroying it, finally winning the match. ;Domination: Domination is a game mode where the player captures points, and each team starts at 0 points. 20 points are awarded when a point is captured and 5 per second while the point is captured. Each team must capture the points once it is captured by the other team. If there is a red arrow under the point at the top of the screen, the other team is capping the point. ; Campaign: In the campaign, up to four players can play cooperatively through missions which are divided into about 5 or 6 \\"chapters\\", each mission with its own goal. Many of the missions have to do with killing aliens known as \\"Kroads\\" in the game. Each mission will reward the player with some kind of loot, such as loot crates, Blutonium, Spacebux, and other things. ==Reception== Loadout received mixed to positive critic reviews (72 on Metacritic ), 4 out of 5 stars (51,800 player reviews) on PlayStation 4, and \\"Very Positive\\" (35,986 player reviews) on Steam. The Escapist gave Loadout an 80 and wrote this bottom line in their review: \\"A surprisingly well crafted multiplayer shooter full of options, amusing cartoon violence, and rock solid action. That Loadout does all this, and provides a respectably balanced free-to-play ecosystem, is encouraging to see.\\" Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 and wrote this closing comments: \\"It didn’t take me long to realize that Loadout wasn’t an ordinary shooter. It’s an amalgamation of sorts, melding comedy, cartoon violence and competitive multiplayer seamlessly. Edge of Reality seems to be well aware of the genres oversaturation, and contribute very little to the nimiety of mediocrity. Shooters may be all the craze now, but Loadout doesn’t take the challenge of being different sitting down — it stands, with a severed head and a badass rifle. There are few online-only experiences that offer such dynamic gameplay without developing some sort of genre-identity crisis. Hell, the fast-paced matches, alarmingly meaty weapon customization system, and visual hilarity are but a few of the features that make Loadout worth its weight in dismembered limbs. So why wait?

Dyegh previously served as a member of committee on Appropriations, Drugs, Narcotics and Financial Crimes, Education, Gas Resources, Inter-Parliamentary Relations, Science and Technology in the 7th National Assembly. He ran for the second term as a favourite candidate, bearing the flag of the All Progressives Congress and retained his seat, following the announcement of 28 March National Assembly Polls in the 2015 General Elections in which he polled 67,463 votes to defeat his challenger, Bernard Nenger of the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) with 26,329 votes.He ran for a third term on the platform of the All Progressives Congress and won. Dyegh is currently serving his 3rd term at the National Assembly. And he is the current House committee chairman on Human Rights. ==Early life== Dyegh was born at Gboko. He received elementary schooling at LGEA Primary School Gboko, earning First School Leaving Certificate before proceeding to Mbawuar Secondary School Ihugh in Vandeikya Local Government Area, for Senior Secondary School Certificate. He then studied at the Benue State University for both undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. Dyegh obtained a Doctorate at the same institution, making him the first and the only House of Representatives Member to have represented a constituency with the highest educational qualification from Benue State, a record that is yet to be matched. ==Political career== Dyegh garnered political prominence when he ran successfully on the platform of the then main opposition party in Nigeria – the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) for the House of Representatives seat to represent Gboko/Tarka Federal Constituency. Despite running as an out of favour candidate, he polled overwhelming 85,917 votes to defeat rival, Barr. Tony Ijohor who ran under the umbrella of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but trailed Dyegh by 55,540 votes. Widely regarded as one of the best performing members of the \\"Green Chamber\\" in Benue State, Dyegh enjoys overwhelming support and wider admiration for his speedy rural electrification initiatives, donating more than ten transformers to various communities and sinking over thirty boreholes as well as building classroom blocks in many primary and post-primary institutions of learning in his constituency within only three years in office. Dyegh is known for awarding scholarships to students of higher colleges thereby, ending scholarship drought among the students of college age in his constituency; he donates large sums of money to the poor, a quality that marks him out as a philanthropist. The politician is also credited for his unique ability in executing constituency projects, making him one of the most admired politicians of his generation in his constituency ahead of many others. Dyegh has sponsored the Nigerian Electoral Offences Commission Bill, 2011. The bill seeks establishment of an Electoral Offenses Commission but received only its first reading on 7 February 2012. On 20 March 2017, Dyegh accused the Federal Government of Nigeria for failing to protect human lives ahead of cows and other livestock in the country, claiming that some powerful Nigerians were frustrating the passage of the bill prohibiting open grazing pending before the House. Dyegh said this following wanton killing of the Tiv farmers by the Fulani herdsmen in his own state of Benue, with the Nigerian government failing to end the clashes. He cited the case of a bill sponsored by Senator Barnabas Gemade at the Senate to have suffered the same fate. He advised the government to be decisive in curbing the clashes between the herdsmen and farmers. ==Controversy== In July 2016,the Commissioner of Public Complaints Commission in Benue State, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav called for the interrogation of Hon John Dyegh, the then Gboko Local Government chairman, Emmanuel Kwagba and Hon Terhemba Chabo of the Benue State House of Assembly over allegation of the destruction of some property belonging to a widow in Ikyumbur, Mbatiav, Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State. In a petition written by Adam Terkula Raphael, son of the widow, Eunice Adam, alleged that Hon John Dyegh and others aided the destruction of his mother's property which included houses, farm produce, a motorcycle and economic trees valued at ten million naira (N10,000,000). Raphael in his petition to the Public Complaints Commission stated that when Hon Dyegh was informed about the initial destruction of 160 lines of yams and cassava by Lagos, a political thug in Gboko and his gang, instead of coming to their aid, Dyegh mobilised the youths to cause further havoc. \\"He told the whole community that my mother is a very bad woman and they should go ahead and burn down her house\\", \\"He described our house as the only home of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in his own kingdom, Mbatiav and that while he is from the APC nothing of PDP should exist in his own council ward,\\" the petitioner also stressed that the lawmaker was \\"erroneously informed that my mother had named her dog after him.\\" . ==References *Nassnig.org *Whoiswhonigeria.net Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Nigeria) Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:People from Gboko Category:Nigerian businesspeople Category:Nigerian philanthropists ","title":"John Dyegh"},{"id":"42027126","text":"Libuttle Girl Blue () is a 2007 Czech drama film written and directed by Alice Nellis.

Her work has been recognized with various awards. Cauich Ramirez was born in Kopchén, a small community 22 km southwest of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in the southeastern state of Quintana Roo. She received her first basket as a gift when she was seven, but began making them when she was ten. At that time, the municipality brought an instructor to the community to teach fiber arts, and she began making fruit bowls and round baskets with carrying handles. Her father encouraged her interest by collecting materials for her and helping with their preparation. Today, she has a repertoire of over forty basic designs, which include baskets of various shapes and sizes, animal figures, fruit bowls, carrying bags, cradles, lamp bases, flower vases and more. She principally works with a plant called guaco, a fibrous, resistant climbing vine found in the higher altitudes in the Yucatan Peninsula, originally used by her community to create thatched roofs. There are eleven different species of guaco in Quintana Roo, with the most common called tendón de sapo in Spanish or chiicheních much in Maya. If the vine is tough, she boils it first to take the bark off and divide it into strips. She uses her hands to weave the vines but sometimes uses her feet for stability. She has passed on her ability to her eight children, her nieces and nephews and her husband, Jacinto Mex Puc. Her family depends on this activity economically, and her children participate in workshop activities among other activities. The activity has allowed her to travel and meet other artisans in various parts of Mexico, as well as win various recognitions. She has won first place for pieces made for various crafts competitions, such as first place in the semi rigid fibers category at the 2011 Concurso Nacional de Fibras Vegetales organized by FONART. In 1996, she was named a Grand Masters by the Fomento Cultural Banamex, and in 2011 was named a “distinguished woman of Quintana Roo” by Governor Félix González Canto. ==References== Category:Mexican women artists Category:Basket weavers Category:Artists from Quintana Roo Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Women basketweavers ","title":"Rosalinda Cauich Ramirez"},{"id":"42027166","text":"Ann Heinson is an American high-energy particle physicist known for her work on single top quark physics.

The series has an official abbreviated name of \\"ShiroKoi\\" using the first two kanji of the first two words of the whole title. The game is a visual novel about a girl named Kaori Sawai who was saved by hospital staff after an accident during her youth and decided to repay them by becoming a nurse at the age of 21. The story starts with Kaori starting her first day as a nurse at the hospital she would start working at and meet other people-some connected to her past. The first release of the game was in 2011 exclusively for the Sony PSP. In 2012, an expanded version of the original game was released titled Hakuisei Ren'ai Shōkōgun RE:Therapy for Microsoft Windows and PSP featuring an extended storyline for the original main characters,and new character route additions for previously minor characters Yasuko and Ami, as well as a remake-exclusive character, a middle- school girl aged Mayuki. On April 19, 2019, a new version of Hakuisei Ren'ai Shōkōgun RE:Therapy was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Switch in Japan with improved character sprites and event scenes. The Windows and PlayStation Vita versions were released in English and Chinese simultaneously as Nurse Love Syndrome, published by Degica. The Nintendo Switch version was released in English on December 26, 2019. A new game in the same series, , was released on PlayStation Vita on April 30, 2015, with a new cast of characters and art design. It was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows on December 25, 2015 and for Nintendo Switch on May 24, 2018. Hakuisei Aijō Izonshō was in 2016 released in English and Chinese for Windows, and the following year on PlayStation Vita under the title Nurse Love Addiction, localizing the \\"White Robe\\" part of the series title to \\"Nurse\\", likely due to non-Japanese nurse uniform colors no longer being exclusively of white coloring. ==References * Category:2011 video games Category:Medical video games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Visual novels Category:Windows games Category:Yuri (genre) video games Category:Nintendo Switch games ","title":"Nurse Love Syndrome"},{"id":"42027233","text":"Kuntz is a German surname.

It was finished in 1968 and premiered in 1969. == Composition and premiere == The composition is dedicated to Serge Koussevitzky and his wife, Natalia Koussevitzky and is meant to be a gift for the Koussevitzky Music Foundation in the Library of Congress. The first version, for string orchestra, was premiered in Berlin on April 23, 1969. Michael Gielen conducted the Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin on this occasion. The version for 12 soloists was premiered a few months later, on October 10, 1969, in Saarbrücken, with the Kammerorchester des Saarländischen Rundfunks under the baton of Antonio Janigro. == Analysis == The piece is in one movement that takes approximately eight minutes to perform. It is scored for an ensemble of 12 strings, split into two groups: Group I comprises four violins, one viola, and one cello; and Group II comprises three violins, one viola, one cello, and one double bass. Moreover, Group I is tuned a quarter tone higher (approximately A=453) than Group II, which is in standard tuning. In addition, conventional barring is used merely for synchronization and does not function as a metric indicator. Accordingly, no stresses are made when performing the piece, and the piece is meant to be performed fluently and without discernible rhythm. The composition aims to sound as a heterogeneous, amorphous texture in which the two groups try to retune each other. Ligeti's intention was not to create microtonal music, but to create \\"mistuned music\\" instead. The performers are seated near to each other, so that the audience can listen to the music as if it is coming from only one source. The composition is presented in two different versions: one for 12 soloists and one for a string orchestra. For the orchestra version, it is recommended that the instruments are distributed in a balanced manner. Only the orchestra version makes distinctions when performing tutti and solo parts. However, Ligeti himself preferred the version for soloists. == Notable recordings == Following are some of the most well-known recordings of this piece: { !align=\\"center\\"Orchestra !align=\\"center\\"Conductor !align=\\"center\\"Record company !align=\\"center\\"Year of recording !align=\\"center\\"Format - align=\\"center\\"Orchestre de Chambre de Toulouse align=\\"center\\"Louis Auriacombe align=\\"center\\"EMI align=\\"center\\"1970 align=\\"center\\"CD - align=\\"center\\"Ensemble InterContemporain align=\\"center\\"Pierre Boulez align=\\"center\\"Deutsche Grammophon align=\\"center\\"1982 align=\\"center\\"CDhttp://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4232442 } == References  External links == *A preview of the score Category:Compositions by György Ligeti Category:1968 compositions Category:Contemporary classical compositions Category:Music with dedications Category:Compositions for duodecet ","title":"Ramifications (Ligeti)"},{"id":"42027290","text":"Alan L. Zegas (born October 28, 1952) is an American criminal defense attorney. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, received a Bachelor of Science degree from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974, an MBA from The Harvard Business School in 1978, and a J.D. from Rutgers School of Law-Newark in 1981. He said that he became a lawyer to defend the “little, powerless person against the powerful forces of government.” He has law offices in Summit, New Jersey. The New Jersey Monthly magazine named Zegas as one of the \\"50 Most Interesting People in NJ\\". He was Editor-in-Chief of the Rutgers Law Review between 1980 and 1981, and clerked for judge H. Lee Sarokin of the U.S. District Court between 1981 and 1983. == Notable cases == In 1989, Zegas represented one of the football players at Glen Ridge High School involved in the sexual assault of a developmentally disabled female student, the only defendant that was acquitted of all substantive sexual assault charges. Zegas participated in the case of Kelly Michaels in the Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial. Although Michaels was initially prosecuted, the decision was overturned in 1993, after she had spent five years in prison. Zegas represented Michaels on her appeal before the New Jersey Supreme Court, which overturned her conviction.

He was slow to mature and made little impact in bumpers and hurdle races before being switched to chasing and winning the Swordlestown Cup Novice Chase in 2008. In the following season he won the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase but fell twice in five races. He reached his peak in the 2009/2010 season when he won the Fortria Chase and the Tied Cottage Chase before defeating a strong field to win the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. He won the Fortria Chase and the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase again in the next season and rebounded from a defeat in the Queen Mother Champion Chase to win the Punchestown Champion Chase. He won both the Fortria Chase and the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase for a third time in the autumn of 2011 but developed injury problems and failed to win in his remaining five races. He was retired in January 2013, having won thirteen of his thirty-three races. ==Background== Big Zeb is a bay horse with a large white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Fermoy, County Cork by Lyle Buttimer. He was sired by Oscar, a horse who finished second to Peintre Celebre in the Prix du Jockey Club before becoming a leading sire of National Hunt horses. His other major winners have included Lord Windermere (Cheltenham Gold Cup), Rock On Ruby (Champion Hurdle), Oscar Whisky (Aintree Hurdle), Peddlers Cross (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle), Black Jack Ketchum (Sefton Novices' Hurdle) and At Fishers Cross (Spa Novices' Hurdle). Big Zeb's dam, Our Siveen, was bought by Buttimer for IR£7,500 in 1989 and produced thirteen foals before her death in 2007: Buttimer described Big Zeb as the \\"worst looking of the lot\\". Our Siveen was a great-granddaughter of Rififi, a broodmare whose other descendants included the leading Japanese racehorse Narita Brian. As a three-year-old gelding, Big Zeb was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sales in November 2001 where he was sold for 2,400 guineas. He entered the ownership of Patrick Joseph \\"Paddy\\" Redmond a hotelier and property developer based in Gorey, County Wexford. The gelding was trained throughout his racing career at Gorey by Colm Murphy. ==Racing careerEarly career=== Big Zeb began his racing career competing in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\". He made his racecourse debut at Limerick Racecourse on 5 February 2006 when he started 9/4 favourite against thirteen opponents and finished second, two and a half lengths behind the winner Clopf. On his only other start of the season he was beaten two lengths by Captain Cee Bee in a bumper at Fairyhouse in April. Big Zeb began the next season in a bumper at Fairyhouse, for which he was made odds-on favourite but finished third behind Judge Deed and Rebel Chief. After a break of more than four months, the gelding returned in a novice hurdle race at Fairyhouse on 10 March. Ridden for the first time by Barry Geraghty, he took the lead approaching the second last hurdle and drew clear in \\"impressive\\" fashion to win by twelve lengths from fifteen opponents. In the following month he was moved up in class for the Flogas Ireland Novice Hurdle at the Punchestown Festival and started 4/1 joint-favourite with Sizing Europe in a field of twenty-four. Big Zeb tracked the leaders in the early stages before moving into second place at the penultimate hurdle but was unable to make further progress and was beaten three and a half lengths by Sizing Europe. ===2007/2008 National Hunt season=== On his first appearance of the 2007/2008 season Big Zeb finished second, beaten thirteen lengths by Catch Me in a hurdle race at Fairyhouse on 1 December. He then began to compete in novice steeplechases, making a brief debut over the larger obstacles when he fell at the first fence Leopardstown on 29 December. Three days later at Fairyhouse he reappeared for a beginners' chase and started 11/4 joint-favourite in a field of twelve runners. Ridden by Davy Russell took the lead at the second last fence and went clear of his rivals to win easily by twelve lengths. Big Zeb fell at the first fence again at Gowran Park in January and was then moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Dr P. J. Moriarty Novice Chase. He led at the final fence but was overtaken and beaten five lengths by the French-bred five- year-old J'y Vole. The gelding started favourite for the Grade I Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse, but after leading for most of the race, he was caught in the closing stages and finished second to Conna Castle. On his final start of the season, Big Zeb faced both J'y Vole and Conna Castle in the Grade I Swordlestown Cup Novice Chase over two miles at the Punchestown Festival. Ridden by Geraghty, and starting at 4/1, he raced in third place before overtaking J'y Vole approaching the final fence. He drew clear of the field in the closing stages and won by four lengths from Thyne Again. ===2008/2009 National Hunt season=== After an eight-month break, Big Zeb returned in the Grade I Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet chase at Leopardstown on 27 December in which he was matched against more experienced opponents, including the former Champion Chaser Newmill. He was restrained in the early stages by his amateur jockey Matt \\"Strawberry\\" O'Connor before moving up do dispute the lead three fences from the finish. He established a clear advantage in the straight and held off the challenge of Watson Lake to win by half a length. After the race, Murphy said; \\"He was a store horse last year but he's far more the finished article this season. Physically he's more mature after some niggly muscle problems, but the lack of a run was a worry\\". Big Zeb failed to complete the course in his next two starts, falling at the last second when traveling well at Punchestown in February and falling four fences from the finish in the Queen Mother Champion Chase on his first visit to the Cheltenham Festival in March. He reverted to smaller obstacles in April and won a hurdle race at Fairyhouse. He ended his season at Punchestown two weeks later when he returned to steeplechasing for the Grade I Kerrygold Champion Chase in which he was matched against the French-bred six-year-old Master Minded, the winner of the last two runnings of the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Big Zeb tracked Master Minded throughout the race, survived a bad mistake at the last fence and made a strong challenge in the closing stages, failing by a head to catch the favourite. ===2009/2010 National Hunt season=== Big Zeb began his fifth season in November at Navan Racecourse when he carried top weight of 166 pounds on heavy ground in the Grade II Fortria Chase and won by half a length after Geraghty eased him down in the closing stages. Murphy was satisfied by the performance but said that the gelding would be \\"a stone better on better ground\\". In December he was sent to England and started favourite for the Grade I Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown Park Racecourse but appeared to be struggling just after half way and finished fourth of the five runners behind Twist Magic, Forpadydeplasterer and Well Chief. The horse was subsequently found to be suffering from ringbone although Murphy also admitted that he regretted running him so soon after his win at Navan. On his final race before the 2010 Cheltenham Festival Big Zeb was matched against the Paddy Power Chase winner Golden Silver in the Grade II Tied Cottage at Punchestown on 31 January. He took the lead four fences from the finish, went clear approaching the last, and won easily by seven lengths. Geraghty described the race as little more than a \\"strong schooling session\\". On 17 March 2010, Big Zeb, ridden by Geraghty, started at odds of 10/1 for the Queen Mother Champion Chase against a field which included Master Minded (the 4/5 favourite), Twist Magic, Forpadydeplasterer, Well Chief and Golden Silver. He made a jumping error but recovered to track the leaders and moved into second place behind Forpadydeplasterer at the second last. He took the lead approaching the final fence and went clear on the run-in to win by six lengths from Forpadydeplasterer, with Kalahari King in third and Master Minded fourth. After the race Murphy said \\"He's had his bad days, and has made stupid mistakes, but everything has gone really well this year. Every day you live with the horse and for him do this is just magic\\" while Geraghty said \\"the horse had a good look around after the last and I thought he was going to pull up, but he found plenty when he needed to. I saw Master Minded coming but I had a lot left when I kicked for home\\". Commenting on the horses occasionally erratic jumping, Geraghty added \\"there's probably a fine line between being a great jumper and being a bit of an eejit\\". ===2010/2011 National Hunt season=== On his first appearance of the 2010/2011 National Hunt season, Big Zeb repeated his 2009 success by winning the Fortria Chase, beating Golden Silver by one and a quarter lengths. On 13 December Big Zeb was named Irish Horse of the Year at the Horse Racing Ireland awards, beating the Arkle Challenge Trophy winner Sizing Europe and the flat racers Cape Blanco, Rite of Passage and Pathfork. Two weeks later, he won the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase for the second time, going three lengths clear at the last and holding off the challenge of Golden Silver to win by one and three quarter lengths with Scotsirish third and Captain Cee Bee last of the four runners. As in the previous season, Big Zeb prepared for Cheltenham with a run in the Tied Cottage Chase. He took the lead three fence from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten half a length by Golden Silver, with Sizing Europe seven lengths back in third. According to the Daily Express, Geraghty's ride was criticised by some observers who felt that he had gone to the front too soon. On 16 March he attempted to repeat his 2010 success in the Queen Mother Champion Chase and started the 3/1 second favourite behind Master Minded. He tracked the leaders before moving up to challenge Sizing Europe at the final fence but was outpaced on the run-in and finished second, five lengths behind the winner and four in front of Captain Cee Bee in third. At Punchestown in April Big Zeb, Sizing Europe and Captain Cee Bee met again in the Kerrygold Champion Chase, a race which also attracted Golden Silver and J'y Vole. As at Cheltenham, Big Zeb tracked Sizing Europe before challenging the leader at the final fence, but on this occasion he took the lead and held off the renewed challenge of his rival to win by three quarters of a length despite Geraghty dropping his whip 100 yards from the finish. ===2011/2012 National Hunt season=== Robbie Power took over from Geraghty as Big Zeb's regular jockey for the 2011/2012 National Hunt season. In November, the gelding began the new season by winning the Fortria Chase for the third time, taking the lead three fences from the finish and beating Noble Prince by two lengths with Forpadydeplasterer a head away in third. In the following month he attempted to win a third Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase and started 8/11 favourite against Noble Prince, Golden Silver, Forpadydeplasterer and Scotsirish. Big Zeb was settled behind the leaders before making his challenge at the last fence and overtaking Noble Prince on the run-in to win by one and a quarter lengths. After the race, Murphy commented \\"even at ten, he still has loads of pace. He met the last two fences spot-on, when it was needed, and won well.\\" In the Tied Cottage Chase in February, Big Zeb proved no match for Sizing Europe, who won easily by fifteen lengths. At Cheltenham in March he contested his third Queen Mother Champion Chase and started 13/2 third favourite in a field of eight runners. He moved into third place at the fourth fence and maintained that position throughout, finishing third, beaten one and a quarter lengths and fifteen lengths by Finian's Rainbow and Sizing Europe. He ended his season by finishing third behind Sizing Europe and Realt Dubh in the Punchestown Champion Chase in April. ===2012/2013 National Hunt season=== In November 2012, Big Zeb attempted to win the Fortria Chase for the fourth time, but was beaten seven lengths into second place by the seven-year-old Flemenstar. In the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase a month later he was never in contention and finished fourth, twenty-six behind the winner Sizing Europe. In January 2013, Murphy announced that Big Zeb had failed to recover from joint problems and would be retired from racing, saying that \\"the decision was made for us. We gave him a bit of time, but he still hadn't responded to treatment so we are retiring him for his own sake. He has been so good to us so it's the right thing to do.\\" ==PedigreeReferences== Category:2001 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Cheltenham Festival winners Category:Thoroughbred family 13-a ","title":"Big Zeb"},{"id":"42027397","text":"Marsha J.

Russian Centers look like platforms providing the opportunity to organize artistic performances, academic discussions and informal gatherings of representatives of various cultural groups.http://voiceofrussia.com/2009/12/16/3050317/ Traditionally Russian Cultural Centers are equipped with print, audio and video materials from Russia organized into the following categories: Culture and Art; Science; Education; Russian Language; History; Society; and Contemporary Russia ==Consular centers== Consular center provides civil attitude of the Russian Federation and foreign countries, protection of rights and legitimate interests of the Russian Federation, its citizens and legal entities abroad. These centers are coordinated by the Consular Department of the Structural Unit of the Central apparatus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. Today consular activity is providing in 239 consular institutions. In the early 90s Russia created the institution of honorary consuls, which is also an effective mechanism of protection of Russian citizens. In current time there are about 105 of the honorary consuls of the Russian Federation. . Consular officers carry out notarial actions, registration of Vital records acts, protect the rights of Russian citizens abroad, shall take appropriate actions to guarantee safety of citizens in emergency situations, can organize centralized evacuation of people from the country. ==Private Foreign Services== The help provided by Russian diplomatic missions abroad is minimal and it is given only after the registration in the Consulate and the submission of the list of the documents. It comes down to the issue of different documents and to the fulfillment of notarial operations. Russian citizens can also get support in returning to the motherland, but only in the exceptional situation when they are deficient of the means for living . So in the majority of cases people have to solve themselves their troubles when some complicated domestic situations and problems arise (the use of the public transport, currency exchange, the purchase of medicine, ignorance of local laws and traditions, the loss of the luggage, etc.). Even small domestic problems that can be easily solved in the native country can become extreme for compatriots living in a foreign country and can result not only in financial and time losses, but moral harm as well. Till 2014 there was no unified information service that was aimed to provide regular 24-hour support to Russian citizens in any place of the globe. Only few companies and societies that exist in the Russian tourist market solve this matter. Among such companies are information \\"Service of continents\\",http://www.s-cont.ru/node/9744 \\"Wellcare\\" service,http://www.wlcr.ru/index3.html IP-Travel.https://ip-travel.com Such companies operate in the field of tourism collaborating with tourist agencies and tour operators. Problems that can occur during the trip abroad vary a lot and depend on the activity of multiple participants who create a tour product. Any step of the trip is influenced by different factors and companies have to deal not only with matters connected with transportation and accommodation of a tourist in a country abroad and organization of excursions. It’s inevitable that difficulties in communication with officials and commercial bodies or local citizens arise, and it’s connected with the ignorance of laws and traditions of the other country and a language barrier. The cases of injuries, illness and accidents are not rare and it’s not possible to predict them and it’s rather difficult for a person to cope with such a case all alone. The support of the service companies becomes invaluable. But it must be noted that the range of citizens going abroad is not limited to only tourists. Russians go abroad for various reasons, and regardless of the aim of the arrival abroad, a person will initially need help and support. That’s why special attention is paid to the service companies that provide comprehensive support of a Russian-speaking citizen in every step of stay in a new country. ==References== Category:Russian society ","title":"Russian Foreign Services"},{"id":"42027448","text":"Ogunode is a family name of Nigerian origin that may refer to: *Femi Ogunode (born 1991), Nigerian-Qatari sprinter *Tosin Ogunode (born 1994), Nigerian- Qatari sprinter and younger brother of Femi ","title":"Ogunode"},{"id":"42027461","text":"Julia Lee Niebergall (15 February 1886 - 19 October 1968) was a musician and ragtime era composer. ==Early life and education== Niebergall was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to a family of musicians.

In the era she grew up, it was the norm for women to become housewives whose chief roles were to perform domestic duties, but Bleeker did not want to conform to these standards. She wanted to pursue an education, and never married her life-long partner, Gerard Willemse, which was quite anomalous at the time. She would later emerge as one of the first women in the Netherlands to become a doctor in physics and mathematics. After earning her PhD, she founded a physics consultancy firm, which served as an influence for the formation of TNO, and extended her firm by establishing a small factory where scientific and optical instruments were produced. Bleeker's firm took a huge hit due to the effects of the Second World War. Sales plummeted, she had to fire some of her employees and pay the ones who remained out of her own pocket. Bleeker, along with her partner Willemse, had to go into hiding due to her actions in successfully eluding Jews from the German Officers when they invaded her factory. She re-emerged her firm after the end of the war. Because of her actions in the war, Bleeker was awarded the Royal Distinction by the Dutch army, and was later granted a recovery loan by the government to open up a new factory in Zeist. Her company manufactured the optical instruments required for the development of the phase contrast microscope, which was invented by Frits Zernike who received the Nobel prize in 1953 for this invention, and held his patents on the design. ==Early life and education== Lili Bleeker was born on the 17th of January 1897 as the youngest of 5 children to John Lambert Bleeker, a Lutheran preacher in that city, and Martha Gerhardina Döhne, a housewife. She grew up in Middelburg and showed great brilliance as a young child, so much so that she could skip her first primary school class. Bleeker attended Lange Sint high school in Pietersstraat, Middelburg, the Netherlands and although she was a top student, she was discouraged by her mother from furthering her studies. However, Bleeker refused because she had her sights set on her education even though girls at that time where destined to perform just domestic roles. In 1916, she enrolled at the University of Utrecht, a large research institution located in Utrecht, Netherlands to study physics and astronomy. Bleeker became a teacher at a secondary school for girls so that she could earn money to pay for her studies, but she herself regarded that job as unsuccessful because she felt that she was too young. So, as a result, she became a private tutor. In 1919, she became a laboratory assistant to various professors at the Utrecht Observatory Sonnenborgh and on January 1, 1926 was named as sole head assistant On November 5, 1928, she earned her PhD in physics cum laude from Utrecht University with the reputable Professor Leonard Ornstein, who was impressed by her work under his supervision that he wrote recommendation letters describing her as 'very intelligent and well educated, both theoretically and experimentally.' Bleeker's Ph.D. thesis was on measurements of emission and dispersion in the series spectra of alkali metals, and the printing office responsible for printing her thesis was owned by the father of her fellow student and life partner, Gerard Willemse. == Career == On June 5, 1930, eighteen months after receiving her degree, Bleeker started a successful physical consultancy which advised companies and industries on scientific instruments. Her consultancy firm served as a model for the foundation of TNO in 1932. Later on, Bleeker opened a factory for the construction of scientific and optical equipment. Until 1936, the company's focus was on manufacturing hardware for the laboratory and precision electric measuring instruments. However, in 1936, Bleeker decided to start an optical workshop, and in 1937 started production on optical instruments. Her production spearheaded the optical industry in the Netherlands, which was previously nonexistent. In 1938, Bleeker entered negotiations with the Dutch military to develop binoculars for them. In 1940, The Netherlands entered World War II. Bleeker stopped production of binoculars in her factory because she did not want to produce any products for the German army. She did not stop production entirely in her factory, however. Bleeker developed microscopes for Dutch universities and their students. Bleeker also hid Jewish citizens in her factory, and eventually in 1944, someone told the German authorities about her doing so. She was able to successfully mislead the German authorities and successfully let the Jewish people in hiding escape, but Bleeker and her husband had to go into hiding. Her factory was closed down during that time. After the war, she opened a new factory, which was the first in the world to make the phase- contrast microscope invented by Frits Zernike. ==Awards and honors== * There is a building at Utrecht University named after Bleeker. ==References== Category:Dutch physicists Category:1897 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Dutch women physicists Category:Dutch women scientists Category:Utrecht University alumni Category:People from Middelburg Category:20th-century physicists Category:20th-century women scientists ","title":"Lili Bleeker"},{"id":"42027468","text":"LTTR is a feminist genderqueer collective with a flexible project oriented practice.

The series was inspired by the 1950 John Ford film Wagon Master. It ran for eight seasons with the first episode airing in the United States on and the final episode on . Its first five seasons were broadcast on the NBC network and the remaining three on ABC. Originally an hour-long program filmed in black-and-white, Wagon Train expanded to 90-minute color episodes in its seventh season but returned to hour-long black-and-white for its eighth year. During its run 284 episodes were broadcast, of which 252 were an hour in length and 32 were 90 minutes. Wagon Train was an immensely popular program during its original run. In the autumn of 1959, two years after its inception, it ranked as one of seven Westerns in the Nielsen top ten in the United States. In the 1961–62 season it surpassed Gunsmoke in popularity and ranked as the most popular program on American television. Wagon Train revolved around the characters traveling to California by a wagon train caravan from St. Joseph, Missouri. In its first three seasons and part of the fourth, the regular cast consisted of Ward Bond as Major Seth Adams, the trailmaster, Robert Horton as Flint McCullough, the scout, Terry Wilson as Bill Hawks, the ramrod, and Frank McGrath as Charlie Wooster, the cook. During the fourth season Scott Miller was introduced as an assistant scout Duke Shannon. Ward Bond died of a heart attack on November 5, 1960. The last five episodes in which he appeared were broadcast posthumously, after which John McIntire was introduced as Bond's replacement, scoutmaster Christopher Hale. At the end of the fifth season Robert Horton left the series to pursue a career in musical theatre. He was replaced in the seventh season by Robert Fuller as the new scout, Cooper Smith. The final episode of the sixth season introduced Michael Burns as teenager Barnaby West, who became a recurring character in the seventh season.

The hamlet lies about southeast of Hilmarton village and northeast of the town of Calne. ==History== A settlement of 15 households was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and at this time most of the land was held by Malmesbury Abbey. In 1219 the manor (together with Bremhill and Foxham) was transferred to the Bishop of Salisbury, and by this time Highway was probably a chapelry of Bremhill, northwest of Calne. The manor passed through various hands, including (from 1628) Sir John Glanville of Broad Hinton, a member of parliament who served as Speaker and as King's Serjeant. In 1936 the estate was inherited by Raymond Anthony Addington, 6th Viscount Sidmouth, and continues today as the family seat. Highway was a large village, with a population of 148 recorded at the 1831 census. The village declined as Calne grew, with most inhabitants having left by the early 20th century. Today Highway is a hamlet consisting of the manor house, a farm, the former church and a small number of houses. The only listed building is Stratton Cottage, formerly two cottages and now a house, which dates from the 17th century. ==Church== Highway was a chapelry of St Martin's, Bremhill. St Peter's church was a 12th-century building but was too small for the 19th-century population, and was almost entirely rebuilt in 1866-67 to designs of William Butterfield at the expense of Archdeacon Harris, vicar of Bremhill. The new building had a simple rectangular plan with a south porch and was constructed in stone with a roof of stone slates; the western bell-turret was in timber and roofed in shingles. Highway was transferred to Hilmarton parish in 1952, the name of the benefice becoming 'Hilmarton and Highway'. The church was confirmed as redundant in 1971 and became a private dwelling, described by Pevsner in 1975 as \\"recently converted\\". ==Local government== The parish of Highway was a detached part of Potterne and Cannings hundred, surrounded by Kingsbridge hundred.

He received instruction in drawing from a Mr. Harle of Durham. In 1806 he went to London with £5 in his pocket. Robson began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1807, in 1810 landscapes in the Bond Street gallery of the Associated Painters, where he was a member, and in 1813 with the Society of Painters in Oil and Watercolours. At the anniversary meeting on 30 November 1819 he was elected president of the last society, for a year. Robson was an honorary member of the Sketching Society, but weakness of sight prevented him from drawing at their evening meetings. A meeting of the society to say farewell to Charles Robert Leslie on his departure for America was held at his house, 17 Golden Square, on Thursday, 22 August 1833. On the following Wednesday he embarked on the S.S. James Watt, to visit his friends in the north, and was at Stockton- on-Tees on the 31st, suffering from inflammation. He died at his home in London on 8 September, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary-le-Bow in his native city of Durham. ==Works== Robson published in 1808 a print of Durham, the profits of which enabled him to visit Scotland. In 1811 and 1812 he exhibited drawings of the Trossachs and Loch Katrine; and in 1814 published Scenery of the Grampians, with forty mountain landscapes, etched by Henry Morton after his drawings. From 1813 to 1820 he contributed, on the average, twenty drawings annually to the Oil and Watercolour Society's exhibition, mostly of the Perthshire highlands, but comprising also scenes from Durham, the Isle of Wight, and Wales. When in 1821 the Society of Painters in Oil and Watercolours, now the Royal Watercolour Society of Painters, excluded oil paintings, Robson contributed 26 drawings to the exhibition of that year. Between 1821 and 1833 he exhibited 484 works there. Robson's drawings, besides those of the Scottish highlands and of English cities, included views of the English lakes and Lake Killarney, Hastings, the Isle of Wight, and other places, mainly in Berkshire and Somerset. Of the ‘Picturesque Views of the Cities of England,’ published by John Britton in 1828, 32 are by Robson. That year he bought a drawing, by Joshua Cristall, from A Midsummer Night's Dream, cut out the groups, laid them down on separate sheets of paper, and got other artists, including George Barret the younger, to paint backgrounds to them. He exhibited two of these \\"compositions\\" as the joint work of Cristall and Barret; and offended Cristall. From 1829 to 1833 Robson worked with Robert Hills, the animal painter. His main talent was for the treatment of mountain scenery under broad effects of light and shade. ==Notes== ;Attribution Category:1788 births Category:1833 deaths Category:19th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:English landscape painters Category:English watercolourists Category:English landscape artists ","title":"George Fennell Robson"},{"id":"42027615","text":"Spastic paraplegia 14 (autosomal recessive) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SPG14 gene. == References  Further reading == * Category:Proteins ","title":"SPG14"},{"id":"42027635","text":"Spastic paraplegia 16 (complicated, X-linked recessive) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SPG16 gene. == References  Further reading == * * * ","title":"SPG16"},{"id":"42027680","text":"Larissa Rose Crummer (born 10 January 1996) is an Australian international football player who currently plays for Newcastle in the W-League and the Australia women's national football team, also known as the Matildas.

Workers brought in under the program are referred to as Temporary Foreign Workers (TFWs). Between 1993 and 2013, the total number of TFW more than doubled to 338,189 workers; between 2006 and 2014 alone, over 500,000 workers were brought into Canada under the program. When TFWP began in 1973, most of the individuals brought in were high-skill workers, such as medical specialists. In 2002, however, a \\"low-skilled workers\\" category was added, which now makes up most of the temporary foreign workforce. In 2006, the program was expanded, introducing fast-tracking for some locations. It was revised again in 2013, raising wages, charging employer fees, and removing the accelerated applications. == Employment == Apart from their temporary status, TFWs have the same employment rights as Canadian workers, and can phone a free 1-800 number for help. However, because of the way in which the Canadian residence of a temporary foreign worker is tied to an employer, some TFWs have said they can be treated worse than Canadian co-workers. It is against Canadian federal rules to bring in temporary foreign workers if Canadian workers are available. For an employer to hire a TFW, or for a TFW to work in a company they started in Canada, they may need to obtain a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). A positive LMIA or a confirmation letter grants permission to the employer who proves that there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job as no Canadian worker is available and that such hiring will not negatively impact the Canadian labour market. ==Controversies2013=== In April 2013, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began reporting on issues surrounding the hiring of temporary foreign workers. On 6 April, CBC News reported that Canadian IT workers at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) were losing their jobs to replacement foreign workers, who were brought from India by outsourcing firm iGATE. Existing RBC employees trained their replacements before they themselves were laid off, causing their appeal to the media. Additionally in 2013, CBC found that, in Saskatchewan, 65% of recent newly created jobs were held by temporary foreign workers,\\"Labour congress warns of foreign worker 'exploitation'.\\" CBC News. 11 April 2013.

The report claimed that 270 Canadian workers employed by a Toronto-based firm were to be replaced by foreign workers employed by an Italian firm. On 23 October, Global News reported that Farmers of North America, in Saskatoon, was helping farmers recruit TFWs in order to help them. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture reportedly estimated that Canada was in need of 30,000 seasonal and longer- term farm workers. Employment Canada acknowledged that there was a shortage of agricultural workers. Political reaction The move resulted in a strong negative reaction from the public, and garnered attention from the office of the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. Accordingly, Human Resources Minister Diane Finley issued a statement saying the situation is unacceptable if it is true. RBC responded to the controversy by issuing a statement denying the charges and offering clarification of the situation. While a reported 45 employees lost their jobs, the bank nevertheless had indicated that they intended to expand this practice in the coming year. In May, the TFWP was the focus of debate between the Conservative government and the NDP Official Opposition, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper was questioned at the House of Commons about the program. CBC reported that some employers were said to be abusing the TFWP by bringing in temporary foreign workers to areas where qualified local workers were collecting Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.\\"Temporary foreign workers hired in areas with EI claimants.\\" CBC News. 7 May 2013. Retrieved on 2013-07-26. During Question Period, Harper said that the government had addressed this issue before 2013, and that changes had been made to both the EI and TFW programs in order to address these issues. He stated that the NDP did not cooperate at the time in the introduction of the changes, and that NDP Members of Parliament requested more foreign workers in their own ridings.\\"Harper says foreign worker program is being fixed.\\" CBC News. 7 April 2013.

The capital was Port Edward (now known as \\"Weihai\\"). The leased territory covered pp.462-463 Hutchings, Graham Modern China: A Guide to a Century of Change Harvard University Press, 1 Sep 2003 and included the walled city of Port Edward, bay of Wei-hai-wei, Liu-kung Tao and a mainland area of of coastline running to a depth of inland. Together with Lüshunkou (Port Arthur) it controlled the entrance to the Gulf of Zhili and, thus, the seaward approaches to Beijing. p. 417-418. ==Background to the British lease== Waterfront, Seymour Street in Weihaiwei, circa 1905-1910 The port of Weihaiwei served as the base for the Chinese Beiyang Fleet (Northern Seas Fleet), founded in 1871 during the later years of the Qing dynasty in China. In 1895 Japanese land and sea forces captured the port in the Battle of Weihaiwei, the last major battle of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The Japanese withdrew in 1898. After Russia leased Port Arthur from China for 25 years in March 1898, the United Kingdom pressured the Chinese government into leasing Weihaiwei, with the terms of the treaty stating that it would remain in force for as long as the Russians were allowed to occupy Port Arthur. The British fleet took possession and raised its flag on 24 May 1898. The British used the port primarily as a summer anchorage for the Royal Navy's China Station and as a health resort. It also served as an occasional port of call for Royal Navy vessels in the Far East (very much secondary to using Hong Kong in southern China). Other than for military matters, local administration remained under Chinese control, and the port itself remained a free port until 1923. At the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, the commander of the Royal Navy's China Station was initially ordered to withdraw his ships from Weihaiwei to avoid Britain being drawn into the conflict. However, fearing that the Imperial Russian Navy might use Weihaiwei as a safe haven, the Japanese government successfully pressured the British to return their fleet. During the war, correspondents covering the conflict used the port as a telegraph- and radio-transmission station; it also served as a source of contraband shipping for blockade-runners bringing supplies into Port Arthur. After the Japanese victory over Russia in 1905, Japan took possession of Port Arthur. Britain extended its lease over Weihaiwei until 1930; the Japanese occupied Port Arthur from 1905 to 1945. ==British rule in Weihaiwei== Sir James Stewart Lockhart, Commissioner of Weihaiwei, 1902-1921 Commissioner staff and headmen of the territory in 1908 The War Office were responsible for the territory as it was envisaged that it would become a naval base similar to British Hong Kong. As such, the first Commissioners of Weihaiwei were appointed from the British Army and based themselves in Liu-kung Tao. At the beginning of the lease, the territory was administered by a Senior Naval Officer of the Royal Navy, Sir Edward Hobart Seymour. However a survey led by the Royal Engineers deemed that Weihaiwei was unsuitable for a major naval base or trading port. In 1899, administration was transferred to a military and civil commissioner, firstly Arthur Dorward (1899–1901), then John Dodson Daintree (1901–1902), appointed by the War Office in London. The territorial garrison consisted of 200 British troops and a specially constituted Weihaiwei Regiment, officially the 1st Chinese Regiment, with British officers. In 1901, it was decided that this base should not be fortified and administration was transferred from the War Office to the Colonial Office which allowed for civilians to be appointed as the Commissioner. In 1909, the Hong Kong governor Sir Frederick Lugard, proposed that Britain return Weihaiwei to Chinese rule in return for perpetual rule of the New Territories of Hong Kong which had also been leased in 1898. This proposal was never adopted. Weihaiwei was not developed in the way that Hong Kong and other British colonies in the region were. This was because Shantung Province, of which Weihaiwei was part, was inside Germany's (and after World War I, Japan's) sphere of influence. It was normal practice for British colonies to be administered under the provisions of the British Settlements Act 1887. However, Weihaiwei was actually administered under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890 which was the law which granted extraterritorial powers over British subjects in China and other countries in which Britain had extraterritorial rights. The reason for this was that as a leased territory, subject to rendition at any time, it was not considered appropriate to treat Weihaiwei as a full colony. In exchange for recognizing British Weihaiwei, Germany demanded and received assurance from Britain through Arthur Balfour that Britain would recognize a German sphere in Shantung and not build a railway from Weihaiwei into the interior of Shantung province.p. 9 Otte, T.

During British rule, residences, hospital, churches, tea houses, sports ground, post office, and a naval cemetery were constructed. ===Commissioners=== The Commissioner of Weihaiwei () was the head of government for the British leased territory of Weihaiwei between 1898 and 1930. Until 1902, the first Commissioners of Weihaiwei were members of the British Army before civilians were appointed to the role. A Civil Commissioner was appointed in February 1902 to administer the territory. The post was held by Sir James Stewart Lockhart until 1921, where he oversaw the renaming of the civil seat of the Commissioner from Matou to Port Edward and started to develop the territory as a holiday resort for British expats. As the position was not a full Governorship, it afforded the holders more authority as they did not have to consult any territorial legislative or executive councils when making decisions or passing ordinances. The Commissioner of Weihaiwei was also responsible for representing the territory overseas. After Lockhart, Arthur Powlett Blunt (1921–1923) and Walter Russell Brown (1923–1927) were appointed Commissioners in Weihaiwei. The last Commissioner was the outstanding sinologist Reginald Fleming Johnston (previously tutor to the last Chinese emperor) who served from 1927 to 1930. Commissioner's flag The Commissioners of Weihaiwei initially used a Union Jack with a Chinese imperial dragon from the flag of the Qing dynasty as their flag. When Lockhart arrived as the first civil commissioner, he wrote to the Colonial Office requesting that the dragon be replaced by Mandarin ducks as he felt it was inappropriate to use a Chinese national symbol on a British flag. King Edward VII approved the new design as well as the creation of a civil flag of Weihaiwei in 1903. List of Commissioners Below is a list of the military and civilian Commissioners of Weihaiwei. *1898–1901 Major-General Sir Arthur Robert Ford Dorward *1901–1902 Commander John Dodson Daintree, Royal Navy *1902–1921 Sir James Stewart Lockhart *1921–1923 Captain Arthur Powlett Blunt (acting) *1923–1927 Walter Russell Brown *1927–1930 Sir Reginald Johnston ==Postage and currency== One of the revenue stamps of Weihaiwei issued in 1921 No special postage stamps were ever issued for Weihaiwei. Just as in other treaty ports, Hong Kong stamps were used. From 1917, these were overprinted with the word \\"CHINA\\". Revenue stamps of Weihaiwei were issued from 1921. There were never any special coins or banknotes issued for circulation in Weihaiwei. The various currencies in circulation in China at the time were used; the Hong Kong dollar was also used. ==Army and police== The Weihaiwei Regiment was formed in 1898 with Lt. Colonel Hamilton Bower as its first commanding officer and served in the Boxer Rebellion. The regiment was ordered to be totally disbanded in 1906p. 56 Airlie, Shiona Scottish Mandarin: The Life and Times of Sir Reginald Johnston Hong Kong University Press, 1 October 2012 by Army Order No. 127 of 1906.http://www.abandonedbritish-chinesesoldiers.org.uk/the- forgotten-history/ Some of the soldiers were retained as a permanent police force with three British Colour Sergeants commissioned as police inspectors. In 1910 the police force comprised three European Inspectors and 55 Chinese Constables.p.83 Johnson Previously the force had comprised one Chinese sergeant and seven constables under a District Officer. During World War I the British recruited the Chinese Labor Corps in Weihaiwei to assist the war effort. During the seamen's strike of 1922 in Hong Kong, the colonial government sent two European police officers to Weihaiwei in September of that year to recruit the first of about 50 Weihaiwei men as Royal Hong Kong Police constables. After completing six months' training in Weihaiwei, the recruits were posted to Hong Kong to maintain law and order in March 1923. The Weihaiwei policemen were known as the D Contingent in the HKP, and their service numbers were pre-fixed with letter \\"D\\" to differentiate them from the European \\"A\\", Indian \\"B\\" and Cantonese \\"C\\". At the end of 1927, the Chinese police were replaced by Indians.http://www.legco.gov.hk/1926/h261228.pdf ==High Court== In 1903, the British established a High Court of Weihaiwei. The judges of the court were chosen from individuals serving as a judge or Crown Advocate of the British Supreme Court for China in Shanghai. The three judges of the court from 1903 to 1930 were: * Frederick Samuel Augustus Bourne (1903–1916), Assistant Judge of HBM Supreme Court for China * Hiram Parkes Wilkinson (1916–1925), Crown Advocate of HBM Supreme Court for China * Peter Grain (1925–1930), Assistant Judge, and from 1927, Judge of HBM Supreme Court for China The Commissioner could also exercise judicial powers if the judges of the court were not available. Appeals from the High Court for Weihaiwei could be made to the Hong Kong Supreme Court. It appears that no appeal was ever heard in Hong Kong.See Tan, Carol G.S. (2008) British Rule in China: Law and Justice in Weihaiwei 1898–1930. London: Wildy, Simmonds & Hill for a comprehensive history of British justice in the Weihaiwei leased territory. Initially, the Crown Advocate for China, Hiram Parkes Wilkinson served as the Crown Advocate for Weihaiwei. When Wilkinson was appointed judge in 1916, Allan Mossop took over as Crown Advocate for Weihaiwei. Mossop later became Crown Advocate for China in 1926. ==Return of Weihaiwei== Weihaiwei was returned to Chinese rule on 1 October 1930 under the egis of the final Commissioner of Weihaiwei Sir Reginald Johnston who previously had been a District Officer and a Magistrate in Weihaiwei. The last Commissioner of Weihaiwei flew the flag of the Republic of China alongside the Union Jack during the transitional day. Following the return of Weihaiwei to China, the Chinese replaced the British Commissioner role with their own version of the Commissioner as Weihaiwei became a Special Administrative Region of China; later, the was created. However, the Chinese government leased the island of Liu-kung Tao (Liugong Island) to the Royal Navy for ten years;pp. 32-33 Schwankert, Steven R.

She has also reduced the amount of injuries for inner- city children through her research and efforts to educate the public on prevention of accidents. ==Early life and education== Barlow was born in a rural town in Pennsylvania in 1938. Her mother returned to school and obtained a degree in Psychology in 1954 after her father's death in order to become a guidance counselor and assistant professor and support Barlow and her sister. From her mother, Barlow learned the importance of and found the inspiration to work hard in life. Barlow went on to study Psychology at Vassar College in New York and then attended the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City and earned her M.D. degree in 1967. She then received a training fellowship at Babies Hospital Columbia University Medical Center, where she was the first woman to ever train in pediatric surgery there. ==Career== While completing her residency in the Bronx, Barlow noticed the severe lack of quality pediatric care in the area. She was inspired to provide children living in lower socio-economic areas with the same care that middle- and upper-class children received. One thing she particularly noticed was the number of preventable accidents the children in the area suffered from. Upon researching, she found that the injury rate for the Bronx and surrounding area was twice the national average. She also found that the most severe accidents were caused by falls from windows. She was one of the key figures in a New York City ordinance that required landlords to install window guards and participated in the educational campaign \\"Children Can't Fly,\\" which warned parents about the risk of children falling from high-rise building windows. The campaign, which was created in the early 1970s, created a law that stated in apartments where small children live, there must be window guards. Also, the campaign employed nurses to go and check on children who were reported to have fallen. The nurses also are able to help the parents in dealing with the situation and provide advice to prevent it from happening again. Within the Bronx district, the reported number of falls has decreased by 50%. Injuries due to children falling out of windows in the Washington Heights neighborhood decreased by 96 percent by 1981. The conditions of community spaces, such as school playgrounds in the Harlem neighborhood and streets where young children frequently played after school, were also a concern of Barlow. In 1988 she began work on improving Harlem's playgrounds with the help of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation by working with an architect to design low-cost playground equipment. Also in 1988, she helped create the Injury Prevention Program at Harlem Hospital Center. This program helped to decrease the occurrence of injuries in children. The program was able to help lower the rate of injuries in children by improving education, building better playgrounds, and also providing supervised mentors to watch the children. She has continued her work on injury prevention in children for the past 15 years. Since 1991, Harlem has gotten 40 plus new playgrounds and numerous new after- school activities are offered through community organizations. Barlow also founded \\"Injury Free Coalition for Kids,\\" through which she has been able to ensure that similar programs are operating in cities across the nation, such as Los Angeles, Atlanta, Philadelphia. The \\"Injury Free Coalition for Kids\\" has implemented Injury Prevention Programs in 42 different trauma centers. This program helps promote safe ways for children when playing outside. The program also brings more medical professionals into an area where injury is prone in order to reduce the rates of injury. She continues her work through the National Association of Children's Hospitals. Barlow is now retired. Her last position was a professor in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York. == Honors and awards == Barlow has received multiple awards for her \\"Injury Free Coalition for Kids\\" Program. She was the recipient of the CDC Foundation Hero Award in 2011. She has also been recognized and given awards from many different organizations such as the American Hospital Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Safety Council, the American Trauma Society, and the American Public Health Association. == Publications == The following is a list of publications Barbara Barlow has contributed to during her medical career. * \\"A brief history of Forging New Frontiers, the annual conference of the Injury Free Coalition for Kids.\\" * \\"Epidemiology of bone fracture across the age span in blacks and whites.\\" * \\"A comparative analysis of serious injury and illness among homeless and housed low income residents of New York City.\\" * \\"Motor vehicle injury, mortality, and hospital charges by strength of graduated driver licensing laws in 36 States.\\" * \\"Race and ethnic differences in a multicenter study of home safety with vouchers redeemable for free safety devices.\\" * \\"Motor vehicle occupant injury and related hospital expenditures in children aged 3 years to 8 years covered versus uncovered by booster seat legislation.\\" * \\"Forging new frontiers.\\" * \\"National injury-related hospitalizations in children: public versus private expenditures across preventable injury mechanisms.\\" * \\"Twenty- year trends in fatal injuries to very young children: the persistence of racial disparities.\\" * \\"Improving access to comprehensive injury risk assessment and risk factor reduction in older adult populations.\\" * \\"A national program for injury prevention in children and adolescents: the injury free coalition for kids.\\" * \\"Preventing injury and injury-related disability in children and adolescents.\\" * \\"Community childhood injury surveillance: an emergency department-based model.\\" * \\"A benefit-cost analysis of the Harlem hospital injury prevention program.\\" * \\"Impact of a cancer screening program on breast cancer stage at diagnosis in a medically underserved urban community.\\" == References == Category:1938 births Category:Physicians from Pennsylvania Category:American pediatric surgeons Category:Living people Category:Women surgeons ","title":"Barbara Barlow"},{"id":"42027804","text":"The 2008–09 VMI Keydets basketball team represented the Virginia Military Institute during the 2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

She was an orphan by the age of seven and was first heard of as a dancer using the name \\"Amarilli Etrusca\\".Bandettini, Teresa (1763-1837), Margaret E. Kern, 2002, University of Chicago, retrieved 24 February 2014 After Bandettini married Lucchese Pietro Landucci, whom she had met in Imola in 1789, her career shifted from dancing to improvisation. Her specialty was to create and deliver verse on the spot from random suggestions supplied by an audience willing to pay to witness her emotional delivery and the creative process. Bandettini's talents led to her finding a patron in Count Ludovico Savioli. He paid for an early poem concerning the \\"Death of Adonis\\" to be not only printed but to be illustrated by Francesco Rosaspina. Bandettini was a composer of extemporaneous verse, and a poet. Not surprisingly with her dancing background, she was known as the literary ballerina (Figurante Poetesca). Although there were two publications of her improvised verses published in 1801 and 1807, Bandettini preferred to publish poetry that she had spent more time composing. ==Legacy== Within Bandettini's lifetime she was acknowledged as an important writer. The noted Italian poet Maria Maddalena Morelli, also known as Corilla Olimpica, dedicated some of the last of her poetry to Bandettini. There are a number of paintings of Bandettini including an oil by Angelica Kauffman. Kauffman was a member of the Italian literary Society known as the Arcadian Academy. Kauffman respected Bandettini skills, and created the portrait which she gave to her in 1794. In 2002 it was discovered that the young composer Niccolò Paganini had dedicated six long lost sonatas to her. She died in Lucca in 1837. ==Partial worksReferences== * Emilio De Tipaldo, Biografia degli italiani illustri, Tipografia di Alvisopoli, Venezia, 1837 * E. Castreca Brunetti, Aggiunta alla Bibl.

It was announced on February 12, 2014, and released on Verizon Wireless in the United States on February 20, 2014. It is currently exclusive to Verizon and the U.S. market; its international counterpart is the Nokia Lumia 930. On February 11, 2015, Verizon released the Windows Phone 8.1 operating system and Lumia Denim firmware update for the Icon. On June 23, 2016, Verizon released the Windows 10 Mobile operating system update for the Icon. ==Primary features== The primary features of the Lumia Icon are: * 5in 1920x1080 AMOLED 441 PPI touchscreen display * Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 Processor * 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM * 20 MP PureView camera with Carl Zeiss optics and pixel oversampling * Optical Image Stabilization * 2160p (4K UHD) video recording at 30fps * Quad microphones with noise reduction * Wireless AC Wi-Fi * 4G LTE support * Microsoft Cortana Voice Assistant with \\"Hey Cortana\\" voice activation (with Lumia Denim update) == Availability == The phone was released for sale exclusively through Verizon in the United States for $199.99 with a 2-year contract or $549.99 with no contract. The Lumia Icon has almost identical internal specifications to the larger Nokia Lumia 1520 with the primary difference being that it has a smaller screen of 5 inches compared with the Lumia 1520's 6 inches. The Nokia Lumia 930, released in April 2014, is nearly identical to the Icon in both appearance and specifications. However, the 930 uses GSM radios and comes with Windows Phone 8.1 and the Cyan firmware, and is the worldwide variant of the Icon. While the 930 has since been updated to Denim (which contains the Windows Phone 8.1 Update), Verizon previously faced criticism for not releasing the Cyan update for the Icon. Now that Verizon Wireless has updated the Icon directly to Denim, skipping Cyan, the OS and firmware distinctions have largely been eliminated. == Naming == While in development, the Nokia Lumia Icon was known by its model number. Early development screenshots and prototype accessories referred to the phone as the Lumia 929. This was in keeping with Nokia's previous branding practice of assigning a corresponding number to the place where the phone would sit in Nokia's lineup, with higher numbers indicating higher-end models and lower numbers indicating lower-end products. Upon release, the phone kept the model number 929, but was the first Lumia to utilize a name other than its model number for branding. == Reception == The Lumia Icon received fairly positive reviews, with some reviewers calling it the best Windows Phone released, praising the phone's camera quality, display, and overall speed but detracting its being locked to one carrier and having a camera with a slow transition time between taking photographs. Reviewers were split on the design of the phone, with some praising its metal build quality as solid and premium, and others criticizing it for being too utilitarian and conservative. Brad Molen of Engadget called the Lumia Icon \\"the solid high-end Windows Phone that we've wanted for a long time. It has an amazing display, great performance and solid imaging capability, but its exclusivity to Verizon will severely limit its appeal.\\" and Mark Hachman of PCWorld said \\"If you’re an app fiend, you’d still be better off buying an iPhone or Android phone, which dependably receive third-party apps. But the Icon and Lumia 1520 are clearly the best Windows Phones on the market. Deciding between them simply depends on which size you prefer.\\" Christina Bonnington from Wired said that the best Windows Phone ever still disappoints, and mentioned poor call quality as one of the detractors, but praised the solid build quality, inclusion of wireless charging, and powerful processor.The Best Windows Phone Ever Still Disappoints  Product Reviews  Wired.com == See also == *Microsoft Lumia *Nokia Lumia 1520 *Nokia Lumia 930 == References == Lumia Icon Category:Microsoft Lumia Category:Mobile phones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2014 Category:Discontinued smartphones Category:Windows Phone devices Category:PureView ","title":"Nokia Lumia Icon"},{"id":"42027951","text":"Business Leaders for Michigan is a private, non-profit organization based in Detroit, Michigan, United States.

It is now located between the carriageways of the main road 62 \\"Solidarności\\" Avenue (the former address was 14 Bielańska). ==History== The palace was built in the Baroque style around 1730, on the ruins of an earlier building for the Crown Treasurer, Jan Jerzy Przebendowski. Its designer was John Sigismund Deybel. After Jan Jerzy Przebendowski's death, the palace was inherited by his daughter Dorothy Henrietta, then by Piotr Jerzy Przebendowski. After the property was inherited by Ignacy Przebendowski, it was rented from 1760-1762 to palace diplomat and Member of the Spanish Court, Pedro Pablo de Bolea, who started the palace's famous masked balls. Ignatius Przebendowski sold the palace in 1766, to Constance Lubienska of Łubna, and in 1768 all rights were acquired by Constance's husband, the Royal Treasurer Roch Kossowski. From 1863 to 1912 it belonged to Jan Zawiszy, and after his death, to his wife Elizabeth and daughter Mary. In 1912, it was acquired by the Prince Janusz Radziwiłł, Ordynat of Olyka and owner of Nieborów Palace. It was destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising, and was taken from Janusz Radziwill in 1947, and rebuilt in 1949, together with a major throughroad. During the People's Republic of Poland it served as the Central Museum to Lenin, opening on April 21, 1955. Since 1990, the building has housed the office of the Museum of Independence (Muzeum Niepodległości w Warszawie). From 2000 to 2009, it also functioned as the Cinema Paradiso (Kino Paradiso) - named after the Italian movie of the same name - which was run by distributor Solopan for challenging and non- commercial films of high artistic interest.

It was published by Viacom New Media. Based on the Star Trek: Voyager license, the game followed Kathryn Janeway and the crew of the USS Voyager in their attempts to rescue members of their team from the Kazon. Voyager was the first game in a multi- title agreement between Viacom and Looking Glass, and Viacom took a minority equity investment in the company as part of the deal. However, Viacom decided to leave the video game industry in 1997, and Voyager was canceled in spring of that year. In response to Voyager's cancellation, team members Ken Levine, Jonathan Chey and Rob Fermier left Looking Glass to found Irrational Games. ==Overview== Voyager was an adventure game based on the Star Trek: Voyager license. The player guided Kathryn Janeway and other characters aboard the USS Voyager through three \\"episodes\\". The game began as the USS Voyager resupplied at an agricultural planet, only to have certain members of its crew kidnapped by the Kazon. As Janeway and the surviving team tracked the Kazon, they encountered such things as other alien races and \\"an abandoned planet occupied only by a single computer system\\". Unlike in other Star Trek video games of the time, the player manipulated the crew at a high and general level. The player selected the crew's course of action from a list of options during \\"decision point\\" scenes, after which the crew would carry out their orders automatically. Certain decisions continued the plot, while others led to dead ends or to a game over. Producer Alan Dickens said, \\"We want to make it a lot like you're watching the TV and yelling at the characters. You're giving them, as a team, guidance and direction on where they should go and how they should address the various problems that come before them.\\" Between decision points, the player used and combined items, solved puzzles and engaged in combat. The game's item system involved scanning objects with tricorders and storing them in a \\"virtual inventory\\". This was an attempt to avoid hammerspace and the protagonists \\"stealing everything they find\\", two issues that Dickens said were common in the adventure game genre. \\"Tech sim\\" puzzles in the style of The Incredible Machine—a video game series in which players create Rube Goldberg machines—were a main feature in Voyager: the player would receive collections of mechanical parts, which would have to be combined into complex mechanisms. Combat took place on the ground and in space, and like other scenes was controlled at a general level. The player could order the crew to provide suppressive fire, to maneuver or to beam out, for example, and would then watch the scene play out. ==Development and aftermath== Looking Glass Technologies scanned the heads of Star Trek: Voyagers cast to create more accurate 3D models for the game. Voyager began development in 1995, and it was announced in August of that year as the first game in a multi-title deal between Viacom New Media and Looking Glass Technologies. According to Next Generation, the announcement was \\"greeted with joy\\" by gamers and fans of Star Trek. Viacom was interested in Looking Glass's engine technology, and took a minority equity investment in the company. Voyager was conceptualized by Dickens and by Viacom producer Rachel Leventhal. It was initially planned for release in 1996, but a later report gave it an expected release date of early 1997. The team at Looking Glass visited and researched the set of Star Trek: Voyager in order to reproduce it accurately, and they created 3D laser scans of the cast's heads. Voice over from the cast was also recorded. The game's characters and pre-rendered backgrounds were created with 3D Studio and Alias, and the characters were animated with the skeletal animation system that had been developed for Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri. Designer Jonathan Chey worked on the game's physics and artificial intelligence code, which he later said were \\"really weird\\" features for an adventure game and evidence of unfocused development. During the game's showing at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June, a writer for Computer Games Strategy Plus called it \\"one of the most highly anticipated projects currently floating around the game world.\\" Voyager was canceled in the spring of 1997, after 18 months in production. According to Looking Glass's Paul Neurath, the cancellation was due to Viacom's wider decision to abandon the video game industry. He believed that the Viacom deal and Voyager were ultimately a \\"giant distraction\\" and a \\"boondoggle\\" that hurt the company. These events started a financial downward spiral at Looking Glass, which, compounded by a string of troubled and commercially unsuccessful projects such as Terra Nova and British Open Championship Golf, culminated in the company's closure in May 2000. Three members of the Voyager team—Chey, writer Ken Levine and designer Rob Fermier—became close friends during the game's development. The game's cancellation inspired them to start the spin-off developer Irrational Games in April 1997, which went on to develop System Shock 2 in collaboration with Looking Glass. Levine later recalled that, while writing Voyager's opening cutscene, he learned that technological limitations made it difficult for characters to express emotion; and this experience influenced his future writing for games such as BioShock Infinite. ==Notes== Category:Adventure games Category:Adventure games set in space Category:Cancelled Windows games Category:Looking Glass Studios games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games based on Star Trek: Voyager ","title":"Voyager (video game)"},{"id":"42028115","text":"Barbara Brandon-Croft (born November 27, 1958) is an American cartoonist, best known for creating the comic strip, Where I'm Coming From, and for being the first nationally syndicated African-American female cartoonist. ==Early life== Brandon-Croft was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Brumsic Brandon Jr..

There is an absence of backdrop drawings, with the focus solely on the characters who are represented by drawings of their upper torso. Speech bubbles are also omitted and the characters address the reader directly. Where I'm Coming From went into national syndication in 1991 with the Universal Press Syndicate making Brandon-Croft the first female black cartoonist to be nationally syndicated.

She was the youngest child of Edwin and Elizabeth Barnes (née McKay). Her father was a grocer and wine merchant who had premises on Great Britain Street and at 57 Camden Street. Barnes attended Rutland School for Girls in Dublin, going on to enrol in the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art in 1898 and 1899. She appears to have received an Art Teacher's Certificate in 1899. Immediately after leaving the School of Art Barnes worked as a governess in County Tipperary, teaching the two daughters of Anna Maria Cooper-Chadwick. ==Career== She spent most of her career working with the National Museum of Ireland's natural history and antique's division, helping the naturalist Robert Lloyd Praeger and botanist Matilda Knowles, as well as creating models for the museum's exhibits. Her association with the Natural Museum in Dublin appears to have begun in 1907, when she is recorded as donating models of the eggs of a platypus. By 1909 she appears to be working in the museum, setting up exhibition cases, constructing models of natural habitats, and wax models. Many of these examples, such as the rock pool and mammal displays that are still exhibited on the ground floor of the Natural History Museum, are believed to be her work. Her formal position within the Museum is unclear, with her at times being referred to as a staff member or the \\"Museum Artist\\". Barnes illustrated cephalopoda for Annie Massy, such as those collected by the 1910-1913 British Antarctic expedition. She undertook similar illustration work for the sponge expert, Jane Stephens, illustrating a number of her publications. She also illustrated the Foraminifera collected during the Clare Island Survey. Her work was highly regarded by Praeger, who even went as far as to name one of his plants after her (Sedum barnesianum). Barnes' works have been featured in numerous books and monographs, and still highly regarded today, especially her sedums (stonecrops) and sempervivums (house leeks). She worked with Robert Francis Scharff to reconstruct and illustrate specimens of the Giant Irish deer. Barnes also undertook some cartographic work with the Geological Survey of Ireland, and restoration of archaeological artefacts from the Royal Irish Academy. She also assisted Mary Eily de Putron when she was working at the museum. Barnes was a member of the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club from 1913. It is believed she collected specimens of lichen, with one specimen found in the herbarium of the Irish National Botanic Gardens (Ireland). ==Later life and death== Barnes retired from her work with the Museum at some point after March 1947, though continued to restore artefacts on behalf of the Museum into the 1950s. She lived with her mother and siblings until their deaths. None of her five siblings who reached adulthood married, meaning that Barnes had no close family when she died in 1956. Neither Barnes birth or death was officially registered, with her date of death remaining undocumented until 2015. She was admitted to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital on 13 February 1956, undergoing an operation to \\"extensive burns\\" on 27 February. She later died on 12 March, and was buried alongside her siblings Herbert and Edith on 14 March 1956. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1876 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Alumni of the National College of Art and Design Category:Botanical illustrators Category:Irish artists Category:Irish botanists Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Women botanists ","title":"Eileen Barnes"},{"id":"42028341","text":"Playmaker or playmakers may refer to: ==In sports== *Playmaker, a designation assigned to some association football midfielders and forwards *Playmaker (basketball), an alternate term for the point guard position in basketball or handball *PlayMaker Football, a 1989 video game for the Macintosh operating system *\\"The Playmaker\\", a self-assigned nickname of retired American football player Michael Irvin ==In arts and popular culture== *Playmaker (film), a 1994 film *Playmakers, a 2003 ESPN television show *Playmaker Media, an Australian television production company *PlayMakers Repertory Company, a theater company at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill *Playmakers Theatre, a building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill *The Playmaker, a 1987 novel *Playmaker Music, a record label *Playmaker, the alias of Yusaku Fujiki in the anime series Yu-Gi-Oh!

Gamble is currently part of the NERC-sponsored team that is looking to date key evolutionary events in Europe over the last 60,000 years by dating deposits of volcanic ash. The events that the team is seeking to date includes the arrival of modern humans, the Neanderthal extinction, and the post-Ice Age re-colonisation of northern Europe approximately 16,000 years ago by the direct ancestors of most modern Europeans. Gamble was a co-director on the British Academy Centenary project (2003-2010) Lucy to language: The archaeology of the social brain Gamble led a fieldwork programme in Greece, which recorded and published all the evidence from field surveys for Palaeolithic and Mesolithic settlement undertaken there in the last 50 years.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Description== The house, which was completed in 1854 (when its site was part of Blount County, Tennessee), is a two-story wooden frame farmhouse with nine rooms arranged in an ell-shaped layout. It is a vernacular design that exhibits Federal influences in its three-bay front facade and pedimented front entrance. The house has five fireplaces. ==History== The owner of the house, William H. Griffitts, was born in 1825 into one of the Quaker families that had arrived in Blount County around 1800 and settled in the Unitia and Friendsville areas. He and his wife, Lucy Ann Burton, were the parents of seven children. With other Quakers in the local area, the Griffitts family were active supporters of the Underground Railroad movement that aided fugitive African-American slaves attempting to reach freedom in the northern United States. Historians identify the Griffitts house and the nearby Friendsville and Unitia communities as \\"stations\\" on the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, they also sheltered white Southern men seeking to avoid military conscription by the Confederacy. During the Civil War, William Griffitts had conscientious objector status due to his Quaker religious faith. In lieu of military service, he worked in a salt mine in Kentucky. His wife and teenaged son managed the farm and household during his absence. After the war, the Griffitts family allowed former slaves to live on a portion of their property that is still known locally as Negro Hollow. The property remained in the Griffitts family until 1960, and Griffitts descendants lived in the house until 1943. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as the result of efforts by Larry Benson, who purchased it in 1978 and did extensive restoration and renovation work. Architect Eugene Burr drafted the National Register nomination materials. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1854 Category:Houses in Loudon County, Tennessee Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:Houses on the Underground Railroad Category:Vernacular architecture in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Loudon County, Tennessee ","title":"William H.

The squadron disbanded in May 2018 after the retirement of the Westland Lynx. ==History== No. 657 Squadron traces it lineage to the Royal Air Force No. 657 Squadron formed in January 1943 and disbanded in November 1955. No. 657 Squadron AAC was formed on 1 January 1973 as part of 1 Regiment AAC. The squadron served in Northern Ireland based at Shackleton Barracks. On 1 March 1978, No. 665 Squadron AAC was re-designated as 657 Squadron based at Kirkee Barracks in Colchester. In July 1990, the squadron relinquished its independent status by becoming part of 9 Regiment AAC and moved to Oakington in Cambridgeshire and then in February 1991 to Dishforth Airfield in North Yorkshire. In June 2000, the squadron once again became independent when it moved to RAF Odiham in Hampshire. In September 2000, two Westland Lynx helicopters took part in Operation Barras in Sierra Leone. In April 2001, the squadron became part of the newly formed Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing. ===Afghanistan incident=== On 26 April 2014, a Lynx crashed in Takhta Pul district of Kandahar Province, killing all five British personnel on board. They were Captain Thomas Clarke, Warrant Officer 2 Spencer Faulkner and Corporal James Walters of the Army Air Corps, Flight Lieutenant Rakesh Chauhan of the Royal Air Force and Lance Corporal Oliver Thomas of the Intelligence Corps. As at 28 April 2014, the cause was described as an \\"accident\\", despite Taliban claims that they had caused the crash. The purpose of the mission has speculated upon, but has been described as a \\"routine training mission\\". The site, variously described as \\"close to Kandahar base\\" and \\"30 miles from the Pakistani border\\", had been \\"secured\\" for recovery of the bodies and aircraft. A full report into the accident was published in July 2015, by the Ministry of Defence and the Military Aviation Authority. The Service Inquiry revealed \\"procedural drift\\", which allowed standards to dilute during sustained operations in theatre, to be a major factor. The SI Panel also commented that the crew may also have been distracted trying to establish visual contact with a second Lynx helicopter and that the radar altimeter was not being used effectively as the 'bugged' setting was too low to initiate a recovery in a descent. It was being routinely set lower than required by the standard operating procedures without challenge. The report also highlighted that the pilot had had less than six hours sleep the previous night and was possibly fatigued. == Disbandment == With the Lynx reaching the end of its operational life in January 2018, the squadron disbanded in May 2018. Plans to purchase modified AgustaWestland Wildcat helicopters to replace the Lynx in the special forces role were dropped due to budget constraints. The squadron's special forces role has therefore been taken over by a flight of special forces- trained personnel within the existing Wildcat fleet. ==See also== * List of Army Air Corps aircraft units ==References== Category:Army Air Corps aircraft squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1973 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 2018 ","title":"No. 657 Squadron AAC"},{"id":"42028656","text":"David Gere (born February 15, 1975) is an American film producer, actor, artist and business entrepreneur. == Biography == David Gere was born and raised in Cromwell, Connecticut, and attended Cromwell High School.

As a musician, Ersahin has performed and recorded with various musicians as well as his own projects/bands, Wax Poetic, Love Trio, Our Theory, I Led Three Lives, Wonderland and Istanbul Sessions. Most of those bands formed or sparked because of Nublu, the club he opened on Avenue C in Manhattan's Lower East Side in 2002. The club was then on the cusp of intensive gentrification.NY Times Local It became a hub for musicians and DJs.Village Voice Being a club in Manhattan, the music of Africa, the Caribbean and Brazil also became part of the Nublu mix, and the club became well known for its Wednesday night Forro in the Dark Brazilian sessions. Key to the scene was the creator of Conduction, Butch Morris, long a downtown fixture. Ersahin became part of different Morris projects in the late 90s. When Nublu began, they devised a new project that would apply Morris's Conduction methods to the Nublu sensibility. The result was a new direction for Morris; within the context of The Nublu Orchestra he began incorporating more beats and electronica into his sound. The ensemble became a big part of the club's identity. ==Background== Ersahin's family were not musicians, but Stockholm is a long-established jazz and music center and his elder brother and sisters brought home records that exposed him to the music of his generation, from rock to jazz to bossa nova and world music. When he was 14, Ersahin bought a reggae compilation album featuring the work of pioneering Jamaican DJ/toaster, U-Roy.XLR8R The thrill of the sound confirmed his direction as a musician. This early passion led to Ersahin eventually recording with U Roy, on the Love Trio in Dub album.Barnes and Noble, Love Trio in Dub Throughout his teens, Ersahin expanded his musical horizons, turning on to the more marginal sounds of punk, hiphop, reggae and dub.Nublu As Ersahin began to teach himself to play saxophone in his teens, he knew that in order to accomplish his dreams, he had to move to the United States.Time Out Istanbul == In the United States == Arriving in the United States in his late teens, he enrolled briefly at Berklee School of Music in Boston in 1986. But his urge to be actively involved in music outweighed the importance of a degree.Global Turks By the early 1990s, Ersahin was living in the East Village, then still a hub of underground creativity. During his first ten years in the city, Ersahin studied with sax masters Joe Lovano and John Purcell, and honed his jazz skills playing at various clubs with musicians like legendary trumpeter Eddie Henderson, Larry Grenadier, Wallace Rooney, Kevin Hays, Ben Allison, Jeff Ballard, Cindy Blackman and many more. Throughout the decade, Ersahin worked at the jazz club Sweet Basil, where he formed a band that played for Sunday brunch. Ersahin gained experience by leading both a trio and a quartet at Sweet Basil and began performing in international jazz festivals. In 2002, Ersahin opened the Club Nublu on Avenue C. Nublu is regarded as the last hold-out of the free-wheeling spirit that the Lower East Side was known for, pre-gentrification. More than simply a club, it has become known round the world as a workshop and breeding-ground for musicians interested in trans-cultural, uncharted and multi-disciplinary music. ==Bands and albums== While performing his Saturday brunch sets at Sweet Basil, performing modern jazz, Ersahin attracted the attention of a small independent label in San Francisco called Golden Horn and recorded two albums for them. His first record was called \\"Our Song,\\" (1997)All Music and featured Eddie Henderson, Doug Weiss, Jon Davis and Kenny Wollesen. (\\"Our Song\\" was originally released in Turkey as \\"She Said.\\")All Music, She Said Ersahin's second release, \\"Home,\\" (1998)MTV was a trio album featuring bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Kenny Wollesen. His sound was described by critics as \\"post-bop,\\" and he was praised for his original compositions.Golden Horn Records But the cosmopolitan, edgy ambiance of late 1990s New York was re- orienting Ersahin's creativity. The year 2000 marked a pivotal shift in his approach to music as he released two albums with a new approach. On \\"Virgo,\\" he worked with voice and words in a new way, by adding the political hip-hop poet, Saul Williams to the mix of drummer Brian Blade, pianist Jon Davis, bass player Larry Grenadier and Val Jeanty, a vocalist and electronic sample player.All Music, Virgo In late 1990, the first phase of what would become a long-running project, \\"Wax Poetic,\\" was also released on a deal with Atlantic Records. The band had developed playing at Lower East Side after-hours joints, notably the long-running Save the Robots on Avenue B.Prezi The first Wax Poetic album showcased Ersahin's new direction, featuring spoken word and trip hop techniques. Norah Jones was the band's lead singer for two years and her first released recorded song was \\"Angels,\\" on Wax Poetic's first self-titled record. Initially released on Atlantic Records in 2000, it was re-issued on Nublu Records in 2013.Amazon, Wax Poetic Other musicians on that record were Arto Tuncboyaciyan, Marlon Browden, Eddie Henderson, Kurt Rosenwinkel and Guyora Kats. Its sound is a snapshot of downtown NYC at that time, and the video features the band in iconic Lower East Side locations such as Tompkins Square Park.Daily Motion Released two years after the opening of the Nublu club, \\"Wax Poetic Nublu Sessions,\\" 2004, was equally a time capsule of the excitement and spontaneous energy of the club's live shows and legendary jams. This incarnation of Wax Poetic had a strong spread of voices, including Norah Jones, soul-jazz diva, N'Dea Davenport, Saul Williams, Marla Turner, and Turkish singer Nil Karaibrahimgil.Pop Matters Ersahin delved more specifically into the modal textures of Turkish music in his atmospheric album \\"Harikalar Diyari (Wonderland)\\" in 2002.All Music, Wonderland Wonderland also features the sound of Hüsnü Şenlendirici, a third generation Turkish clarinet virtuoso. This record was a particularly important release in Turkey, as it featured four then unknown up and coming artists who went on to become famous: Hüsnü Şenlendirici and vocalists Nil Karaibrahimgil, Bora Uzer and Dilara Sakpinar, who was 14 at the time of the recording. Its blend of traditional 'world music' with electronica and dance beats, was new in Turkey and made the record extremely successful and influential.Nublu To capture the sound of his creative Nublu community, Ersahin founded Nublu Records in 2005. Among their first releases were three releases under the name Wax Poetic; however, in that period, the band was not active and Ersahin adopted the name for his experiments with local musicians in different countries. The result was a conceptual trilogy: “Copenhagen” (2006), “Brasil” (2007) and “Istanbul”(2007.)AllMusic, CopenhagenAllMusic, BrasilAllMusic, Istanbul The next Wax Poetic release, \\"On A Ride,\\" (2012)All Music, On A Ride was an encounter between Ersahin and Swedish pop producer Klas Wikberg.Nublu In 2013, Wax Poetic released \\"Tonight,\\" an album of remixes by Nouvelle Vague and Rob Garza from Thievery Corporation;Amazon and Ersahin started yet another version of Wax Poetic, working with producer Gus Oberg, who produced the last two albums by the band, The Strokes.Discogs, Gus Oberg Many more projects emerged from Nublu Club's creative crucible. Ersahin released two albums as part of the Love Trio, together with Californian bassist Jesse Murphy (who went on to play with The Brazilian Girls,) and drummer Kenny Wollesen who plays with Tom Waits and John Zorn, among many others. The improvisational trio gave Ersahin the opportunity to explore his roots in reggae and dub, along with turntablism and the new electronica, which dub had inspired in a generation, mixed with dance music. They released two albums on Nublu Records, \\"Love Trio\\" (2003) featuring contributions from Ersahin's longtime partner, legendary trumpeter Eddie Henderson, vocalist Marla Turner, Kenny Wollesen, Brazilian Girls bass player Jesse Murphy and DJ Logic; and \\"Love Trio in Dub with U-Roy,\\" (2006.) The voices of The Brazilian Girls' Sabina Sciubba and Marla Turner are featured on this album as well. Also in 2006, Ersahin played in and produced the Nublu Orchestra album under the direction of Butch Morris, the presiding genius of Nublu.Amazon, Nublu Orchestra As Morris resided on nearby East 7th Street, Nublu became not just a welcoming but a convenient laboratory for the creator of the Conduction sound. From the club's opening until his death a decade later, Nublu was the creative home base from which Morris was able to spread Conduction globally.NY Times, Obit Adding to a busy 2006, Ersahin also launched another project, Our Theory. Ersahin described the Our Theory sound to All About Jazz magazine as \\"Nu-Jazz.\\" The group began when Ersahin met French trumpeter, Erik Truffaz on the road. Deciding to record a few sessions together, they formed Our Theory with Matt Penman, a young bass player from New Zealand; at the time Wax Poetic's guitarist and drummer, Thor Madsen and Jochen Rueckert, the latter also an accomplished electronica man. Their experimental, ambient jazz self-titled album on Nublu Records was improvised and recorded in the studio over a period of two days; then Ersahin and Madsen cut and pasted the tapes over the next two years.All About Jazz “Thinking About You,\\" a track Ersahin co-wrote with Norah Jones, came out on her 2007 album, \\"Not Too Late.\\" He also wrote the score for a BBC/Swedish TV documentary on Nobel Prize winner, Turkish Orhan Pamuk, in 2008.Womex In 2009, Ersahin composed the soundtrack for director Fatih Akin's section in the movie \\"New York, I Love You,\\" a compilation of eleven director's segments on the city. Also in 2009, Ersahin helped form I Led Three Lives, a trio in which he played saxophone and keyboards together with drummer Jochen Rueckert and bass player Juini Booth of Tony Williams and the Sun Ra Arkestra, all regulars at the Nublu club. The trio formed as a result of many late-night jam sessions at Nublu. Their track, \\"House of Ahmet,\\" from the album, \\"Peace Now,\\"(2008) was selected as Song of the Day by Washington University's WKEXP who described \\"the album's range of sounds – electronica, techno, jazz, funk, blues, hip hop, house, and even psychedelia – and its ability to slash through any preconceived genre restrictions and examine how far these established stylistic ranges can be pushed.\\"KEXPDiscogs, Peace Now Ersahin's next two releases both revisited musical terrain he had explored with Wax Poetic. For the first time, Ersahin chose to include himself in the group's name, calling his even more personal tribute to the city he loved, \\"Ilhan Ersahin's Istanbul Sessions.\\"Istanbul Sessions For a 2009 art event being held in that city, Ersahin formed Istanbul Sessions with local players bassist Alp Ersonmez, drummer Turgut Alp Bekoglu, and percussionist Izzet Kizil.Yabangee The one-off combo was so well received that they toured Europe and played in America and recorded an album the following year that reunited Ersahin with French trumpeter, Erik Truffaz. Istanbul Session' next release, \\"Night Rider,\\" (2011) blended a cosmopolitan electro feel with its improvised jazz. Le Monde said, \\"Hear this! Jazz has changed form.\\"Le Monde Jazzwise Magazine described Istanbul Sessions as \\"...a highly distinctive new sound that connects the dense modal funk of Miles Davis' Agartha group with the dervish whirl of Turkish and middle-eastern melodies and spikes it with a potent shot of dub electronics.\\"Nublu Writer Eli Dvorkin of Flavorwire saw Istanbul Sessions perform in Istanbul and described what he called a quintessential hometown gig: “A sold-out crowd at Babylon, one of Istanbul’s best live-music clubs. The rapturous response from the hometown crowd, which eventually spilled out onto the narrow streets and ancient cobblestones of the Beyoglu neighborhood, elevated the show to a plane somewhere above an ordinary Saturday night.”Flavorwire Such projects led to Ersahin being described as \\"the driving force behind the new Turkish jazz,\\" by world music site, Gladys Palmera. Istanbul Sessions performed in Turkey at the 2012 Jazz in Ramadan festivalTime Out Istanbul and at 2013's Babylon Soundgarden Festival.Babylon Soundgarden Next in his homages to his urban inspirations came \\"Ilhan Ersahin's Afternoons in Rio\\" (2011).Amazon, Afternoons In Rio This time round, he assembled a group of mostly local Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro musicians including Mamelo Sound System's Lurdez da Luz and Rodrigo Brandao, Thalma de Freitas, Junio Barreto, China, Kassin, Fernando Catatau and Nina Becker. The website Sounds and Colors described it as \\"a certain style of music that is becoming more and more prevalent in Sao Paulo (i.e. the noirish-take on samba perfected by CéU), as well as showing musical links between New York and Sao Paulo and allowing for a number of very talented Brazilian musicians to get their chance to shine outside of their country.\\"Sounds and Colours Ersahin's horn has become identified with a modal style of jazz, combining the influence of the cool Nordic sound to the minor-key strains of Istanbul and the quirky funk of the East Village, Manhattan.Lucid Culture Continuing his work as a songwriter with Brazilian links, in 2011 Ersahin co-wrote a track called \\"Six Minutos,\\" with Brazilian vocalist Otto for his album, \\"Certa Manha Acordei de Sonhos Intranquilos.\\"NY Times Arts In 2012 Ersahin also co-wrote the song \\" Like This,\\" with top Brazilian singer, Tulipa Ruiz. Although Ersahin has performed at many of the world's largest concert halls, his affinity for the boho soul of jazz is evident in the videos posted to YouTube of him jamming by the Bosphorus. ==Nublu Club== When Ilhan Ersahin opened the Nublu Club in 2002, it captured the budding synergy between hiphop turntablists, the avant-garde jazzers who were still in the Lower East Side, and DJ's and players from Europe, Jamaica, Africa and Brazil. Nublu's jam sessions captured the freewheeling rivalry of cutting sessions at clubs like the legendary Minton's Playhouse's in the bebop era of the 1940s. The club's hipness was underlined by the single blue light outside the door and lack of a name signboard, giving the club the feel of a secret speakeasy adventure. Bands and DJ's performed in the middle of the club, among the audience, giving it the ambiance of an underground event.NY Times Fashion Its authenticity made Nublu a safe zone for artists, has seen many stars drop in over the years like the late Lou Reed, Caetano Veloso, David Byrne, Gilberto Gil, Bebel Gilberto, Kevin Spacey, and many more.NY Times Local The club's commitment to integrating turntablism into live action prompted Moby to tell XLR8R magazine in 2008 that he \\"had more fun DJing records for 75 people at Nublu than going on tour and performing in front of 10,000 people a night.\\"XLR8R Butch Morris held a residency there from the club's opening until his death in 2013 and led the Nublu Orchestra. ==Nublu records== The intense creativity that revolved around the Nublu club prompted Ersahin to start a Nublu label in 2005 as a platform for his own groups and those of his fellow players who made the club their home from home. Artists on Nublu Records include Ersahin's bands, Love Trio, Our Theory, Istanbul Sessions, I Led Three Lives, Wonderland and Wax Poetic; electronic dance-pop acts Hess Is More, aka Danish musician Michael Hess, praised by WNYC.com for his cinematic sensibility,WNYC and Kudu, the edgy Brooklyn-based trio; Turkish DJ Baris K; Brazilian band 3 Na Massa, Brazilian singer Otto and Calibro 35 from Milan, Italy. ==Festivals== Ersahin has been actively involved in promoting festivals from his earliest days in New York. He directed Istanbul's Akbank Jazz FestivalTurkish Cultural Foundation and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival jam sessions for four years in a row, starting in 1996.

Williams, ‘Made in Germany’ (Brighton: The Harvester Press, 1973), p. xxxviii. Upon returning to England he joined the Fabian Society (in March 1891), being at this time a socialist. During the next two years he was a speaker for the Society in London and in April 1893 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the Society.Williams, p. xxxviii. However he dissented from the majority of the Committee in that he supported the proposal for the Society to unite with the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist League. He therefore resigned from the Committee in July 1894.Williams, p. xxxix. ==Career in journalism== He became a journalist and in 1895 was asked by William Heinemann to investigate the threat to British industry from German competition. Williams wrote a series of articles for the New Review which were published in 1896 as ‘Made in Germany’. In this work he advocated protectionism and spoke to the Fabian Society on ‘Socialism and Protection’ but failed to convert them. In 1897 he wrote The German Menace and its English Apologists and Marching Backwards in reply to the arguments of free trade politicians.Williams, p. xxxix. In 1898 he became a leader write for the Daily Mail. He attacked Lord Curzon, a friend of the wife of the owner of the Daily Mail, and so was forced to resign.

As of 2010, there are 43,228 Chinese Americans who live in Chicago, 1.6% of the city's population. This population includes native-born Chinese as well as immigrants from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, and also racially mixed Chinese. ==History== In 1869 the first transcontinental railway was completed. By that time the first Chinese arrived in Chicago.Chinatown Museum Foundation, p. 9. Early immigrants from China to Chicago came from the lower classes and lower middle classes. The earliest immigrants were Cantonese.Steffes, Tracy. \\"Chinese.\\" Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on March 3, 2014. In 1874 the Chinese managed one tea shop and 18 laundry businesses in central Chicago. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act passed by the U.S. Congress restricted Chinese immigration and restricted freedom of travel for existing Chinese, forcing those in Chicago to stay put. At that time some Chinese in Chicago were illegal immigrants. The Chinese Inspector of the Department of Labor deported illegal immigrants who were discovered. According to the 1900 U.S. Census, there were 1,462 Chinese in the city. Chuimei Ho and Soo Lon Moy of the Chinatown Museum Foundation wrote that \\"there must have been others who avoided government notice.\\" Some Chinese immigration began after the Chinese exclusion laws were repealed in 1943. During the 1950s the Chinese population grew from 3,000 to 6,000. Taiwanese and Hong Kong immigrants settled in Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, a new wave of immigrants from the mainland came in the 1950s. The Mandarin-speaking people settled throughout Chicago and the suburbs instead of clustering in the Chinatown area. The 1965 Immigration Act further increased Chinese settlement, with a new wave coming from Mainland China. By 1970 there were 12,000 Chinese in Chicago. After the Fall of Saigon in the 1970s, a wave of ethnic Chinese came from southeast Asia. A new Chinatown opened in Uptown during that decade, and many Southeast Asian refugees were attracted to this new Chinatown. According to the 1990 U.S. Census there were over 23,000 Chinese in the city of Chicago. In the 2000 U.S. Census there were almost 74,000 Chinese in the Chicago metropolitan area, with 34,000 of them in the City of Chicago. ==Demographics== As of 1990 there were about 60,000 ethnic Chinese in the Chicago metropolitan area; of them, about 10,000 Chinese lived in Chinatown's business district and the area south of 26th Street. As of 1995 almost 35,000 Chinese lived in Chicago, and 10,000 Chinese Americans lived in the area holding the Chinatown. The origins of ethnic Chinese Chicagoans include native-born Chinese as well as immigrants from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, and also racially mixed Chinese. Around 1995 many new immigrants were from agricultural and blue collar working classes and from better educated professional classes.Moy, p. 408. 90% of the residents of Chinatown were ethnic Chinese. ==Institutions== The Chinese American Museum of Chicago is in Chinatown. Chinese American Service League is in Chinatown, Chicago. ==Media== As of 1995 Chicago had four daily Chinese newspapers. Chinese-Americans who were bilingual in Chinese and English or who knew English but did not know Chinese had a tendency to read English-language American newspapers. In 1995 there were no English-language Chinese-American newspapers that focus on Chinese-American issues in the Chicago area.Moy, p. 407. In 1983 a Mandarin-language television program opened on Channel 26. In 1989 a Chinese radio station named Global Communication was established. ==Education== In 2003 there were 20 Chinese schools in the Chicago area. Around 2003 an increase in immigration and non-Chinese American parents sending adopted Chinese children to Chinese schools caused enrollment figures of Chinese schools in the northwestern suburbs of Chicago to increase.Ray, Tiffany. \\"Schools connect students to China.\\" Chicago Tribune. March 2, 2003. Retrieved on February 24, 2014. ==Religion== Compared to Chinese in China, there is a higher proportion of Christians among the Chinese in Chicago. Chinese Christians operate their own missions. The Chinese Christian Union Church, an interdenominational church, has its main facility on Wentworth Avenue in Chicago and satellite facilities in the suburbs and in Bridgeport. Chinese Catholics, many of whom originate from Hong Kong and had converted to Christianity, attend the St. Marie Incoronata, an Italian Catholic church on Alexander Street. The St. Therese School, founded by the Maryknoll Sisters, was established for the Chinese community. Christians in the United States attempted to convert Chinese from their native religions after the Chinese began arriving. The earliest recorded Chinese Baptist mission was one that opened on Clark Street, in the Chinese area, in 1878. In the early 20th century, of all cities, Chicago had the largest number of Chinese Sunday schools. In the South Side and West Side of Chicago, these smaller Chinese Sunday schools opened near laundry businesses operated by Chinese. By 1995 these Sunday Schools ceased to exist. Franciscan priests and nuns established the first Catholic missions for Chinese people. ==Notable residents== * John Chiang * Chloe Wang (Chloe Bennet) ==References== * Ho, Chuimei and Soo Lon Moy (editors) for the Chinatown Museum Foundation.

Wollan (left) and Clifford Shull working with a double-crystal neutron spectrometer at the ORNL X-10 graphite reactor in 1949. Ernest Omar Wollan (November 6, 1902 – March 11, 1984) was an American physicist who made major contributions in the fields of neutron scattering and health physics. ==Biography== Wollan was a native of Glenwood, Minnesota. After earning a bachelor's degree at Concordia College in 1923, he undertook graduate study at the University of Chicago, where he investigated X-ray scattering under Arthur Compton and received a Ph.D. in 1929. Over the next several years, he taught physics at North Dakota State College and Washington University, spent a year in Zurich as a National Research Council fellow conducting research on cosmic rays, and worked with the Chicago Tumor Institute on its medical use of a radium source. In January 1942, Wollan joined the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory at the invitation of Compton and Enrico Fermi. As a member of the Manhattan Project research team, he focused on measuring radiation exposure, for which he developed the film badge dosimeter. He was one of the 50 scientists present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the Chicago Pile experiment. He was also on the scene in Oak Ridge on November 4, 1943, when the first continuously operating reactor, the Clinton Pile, later known as the X-10 Graphite Reactor, first went critical. Hand-plotted rocking curves for Bragg scattering from single sodium chloride (salt) crystals at the X-10 reactor at Oak Ridge, obtained by Ernest O. Wollan and Lyle B. Borst in December 1944. With his background in X-ray diffraction, Wollan was one of the first to recognize the potential value of neutrons for investigating the structure of materials. In May 1944 he asked the director of Clinton Laboratories (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) for permission to use the neutron output of the X-10 reactor to study the diffraction of neutrons in single crystals. His request was granted, and a neutron crystal spectrometer that Wollan brought from Chicago was installed in the reactor that same month to make observations on a crystal of gypsum. Wollan and his group were transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to the Clinton Laboratories in August of that year. After some early setbacks, in December 1944 Wollan and chemist Lyle Benjamin Borst successfully used neutron diffraction to produce \\"rocking curves\\" for crystals of gypsum and sodium chloride (salt). Working at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) after World War II, he continued study into neutron scattering, using the neutrons emitted from the X-10 Graphite Reactor and a modified X-ray diffractometer. In collaboration with Clifford G. Shull, who joined him at ORNL in 1946, he developed neutron diffraction methodology used for determining atomic resolution structure of substances. In 1994, Shull was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on neutron diffraction. The unusual delay in the Nobel award, which came more than four decades after the work that it recognized, may have resulted from negative views of the work's relationship to nuclear power. Wollan was not eligible for the Nobel because he had died 10 years earlier. In his Nobel lecture Shull spoke of Wollan's contributions and expressed regret that his colleague had not lived long enough to share in the prize. Wollan remained a member of the ORNL research staff until retiring in 1967. For much of his 23-year service at ORNL, he was associate director of the Physics Division. He continued as a consultant to ORNL until 1977. In his final years, Wollan returned to Minnesota, the state of his birth, where he died in 1984. He is buried in the Oak Ridge Memorial Park. ==Honors and awards== * Wollan Island, in Crystal Sound, Antarctica, is named in honor of Wollan's work on the crystal structure of ice using neutrons. * Concordia College awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science in 1965. * John Price Wetherill Medal, 1967 ==References== Category:1902 births Category:1984 deaths Category:20th-century American physicists Category:American nuclear physicists Category:Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota) alumni Category:Manhattan Project people Category:North Dakota State University faculty Category:Oak Ridge National Laboratory people Category:People from Glenwood, Minnesota Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Washington University in St. Louis faculty Category:Washington University physicists Category:Neutron scattering Category:Neutron facilities Category:Neutron instrumentation ","title":"Ernest O.

Versoaln (or Versailler) is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the South Tyrol wine region of northeast Italy. In the commune of Tisens, in South Tyrol, one of the world's oldest vines is a Versoaln vine planted at Katzenzungen Castle that has been dated to be at least 350 years old by the viticulturists at the University of Göttingen.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 1133 Allen Lane 2012 ==History== According to one legend, the Versoaln vine was once planted at Versailles and brought to Italy by the owner of Katzenzungen Castle. According to legend, the Versoaln vine is named after the French royal Palace of Versailles that was home to King Louis XIV from where the vine was reportedly brought to Katzenzungen Castle by Grafen Schlandesberg. However, ampelographers doubt the validity of this origin theory due to lack of historical evidence as well as DNA evidence showing a connection between Versoaln and any known French wine grape variety. Ampelographers note that the root of Versoaln's name in the local dialect of South Tyrol means \\"to secure with a rope\\" and could be a reference to the viticultural practice of trellising where the canopy of the vine is secured by rope or wires to a trellis. Another theory is that the name is derived from verdolen, which means \\"green\\" in the local language, and describes the deep green color of the berries before veraison. ==Viticulture== A segment of the Katzenzungen Versoaln vine. Similar to the German/Italian grape variety Trollinger (Schiava Grossa), Versoaln has the tendency to produce large berries of thick-skinned grapes in similarly large, irregularly shaped bunches that can put a great strain on the vine if not properly managed by vine training and pruning. The vine tends to bud midway through the budding period of the growing season and is also considered a \\"mid-ripening\\" variety. Versoaln is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of sour rot and the fungal infections of downy and powdery mildew. ==Wine regions== While once widely planted throughout the South Tyrol region, Versoaln was on the verge of extinction until viticulturists with the Laimburg Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry and Free University of Bozen-Bolzano started propagating cuttings from the single, 350+ year old Versoaln vine planted at Katzenzungen Castle. As of 2012, there were approximately 100 new vine plantings of Versoaln in cultivation. ===Katzenzungen vine=== Katzenzungen Castle, home of the 350+ year old vine of Versoaln According to legend, the Versoaln vine planted at Katzenzungen Castle was originally a cutting taken from a Versoaln vine planted at the palace of Versailles in the Île-de-France region of north- central France. The vine was reportedly brought to northeast Italy by a former owner of Katzenzungen Castle, Grafen Schlandesberg. While ampelographer doubt the details of that origin story, today the Katzenzungen Versoaln vine is considered to be one of the oldest and largest vines in the world. Dated by Martin Worbes of the University of Göttingen in Germany to be at least 350 years old, the vine has been measured to cover a length of . Among the few grapevines in the world that are older than the Katzenzungen vine is the 400+ year old Žametovka vine growing in the Slovenian town of Maribor.G. Harding \\"A Wine Miscellany\\" pg 19, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 Anthony Gardner \\"Maribor, Slovenia: a cultural city guide\\" The Daily Telegraph March 1st, 2012 The vine is maintained by viticulturists from the Laimburg Research Centre and has been used to propagate new Versoaln vines to keep the variety from being lost to extinction. Wine is still being made from the Katzenzungen vine with fruit harvested from the old vine added to the fruit taking from the newer plantings of Versoaln. Between the Katzenzungen vine and the newer plantings, around 500 bottles of Versoaln wine a year is produced in specially numbered bottles. ==Wine styles== According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Versoaln tends to produce a dry wine with notable acidity levels and aromas green apples and apricot flavor notes. ==Synonyms== Over the years, Versoaln has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Versailler, Versoaler,Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Versailler Accessed: February 23rd, 2014 Weiss Versoalen and Weisser Versailler. ==References== Category:White wine grape varieties ","title":"Versoaln"},{"id":"42029040","text":"The women's changquan competition at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China was held on 16 November at the Nansha Gymnasium. ==Schedule== All times are China Standard Time (UTC+08:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Tuesday, 16 November 2010  10:00  bgcolor=ffffccChangquan } ==Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Score -  align=left9.75 -  align=left9.67 -  align=left9.66 -  align=left9.66 - 5 align=left9.55 - 6 align=left9.35 - 7 align=left9.29 - 8 align=left9.26 - 9 align=left7.83 - 10 align=left7.81 - 11 align=left7.72 - 12 align=left7.52 - 13 align=left7.29 - 14 align=left7.28 } ==References== *Results ==External links== *Official website Women's changquan ","title":"Wushu at the 2010 Asian Games – Women's changquan"},{"id":"42029064","text":"Melaleuca clarksonii, commonly known as Alice River bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia.

Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a distinct petiole long and 5 to 9 parallel veins. The flowers are white to greenish-cream coloured, in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain 9 to 15 groups of 3 flowers per group. The sepals are long and the petals are long and fall of as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 6 to 9 stamens. Flowers appear in May and the fruit which follow are woody capsules long in loose clusters along the stems. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca clarksonii was first formally described in 1997 by Bryan Barlow in Novon from a specimen located in the Mitchell-Alice Rivers National Park. The specific epithet (clarksonii) honours John Richard Clarkson, a north Queensland botanist, who assisted in the collected of the type specimens. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca clarksonii is found in the Cape York Peninsula bioregion, including in the Mitchell-Alice Rivers National Park in the west, the Jack Lakes in the south-east and the Wenlock River district.

He was one of the foremost American experts on the discomycetes. ==Biography== Elias Judah Durand was born in Canandaigua, New York. He received his bachelor's degree in botany and entomology from Cornell University in 1893 and his Doctor of Science in botany in 1895 under George Francis Atkinson at Cornell. Following graduation he taught botany and mycology at Cornell until 1910, first as a fellow and later as an instructor. In 1910, Durand was appointed professor of botany at the University of Missouri, where he remained until 1918. In 1918, Durand was named professor at the University of Minnesota, where from 1920-1921 he was the Chairman of the Department of Botany. He remained at the University of Minnesota until his death from cancer on 29 October 1922. Durand is buried in the Durand family plot in Woodlawn Cemetery in Canandaigua, New York. He married Anna Louise Perry on 6 September 1899 and had one child, Anna Louise Durand (d. 1981), on 6 June 1901. Anna Louise died shortly after giving birth to their daughter on 11 June 1901. He married Sue Gertrude Stone (d. 1957) on 24 July 1917. ==Mycological contributions== Durand contributed to a broad range of botanical sciences, ranging from bryology and pteridology to mycology. He was recognized and highly respected as an authority on discomycetes, and was one of the first Americans to study the group extensively. His personal collection, numbering 12,087 specimens of discomycetes, including 16 types, 27 paratypes, 2 syntypes, and 6,000 microscope slides, was deposited in the Plant Pathology Herbarium at Cornell University (CUP), helping establish that herbarium as a leading center for the study of discomycetes. Durand's collections included 650 types (mostly discomycetes) from other authors and herbaria, currently stored at Cornell University. Additional specimens Durand collected are stored in the herbaria of the Field Museum of Natural History, the University of Kentucky, the University of Minnesota, the New York Botanical Garden, and Pomona College. ==Taxa described and new combinations== E.J. Durand described a total of 25 new species, one new form, one new variety, and made 20 new combinations of species. , nine of his species and ten recombinations are still accepted (having not been assigned to another genus or reduced to synonymy under previously published names). Durand also described two genera, Gloeoglossum and Ionomidotis which were both later reduced to synonymy. *Gloeoglossum E.J. Durand 1908 = Geoglossum Persoon 1794 *Ionomidotis E.J.

Dudley was a student and assistant under Albert Nelson Prentiss, who was the first head of the Department of Botany at Cornell University. Dudley mentored G.F. Atkinson who later returned to Cornell when Dudley left in 1892. While Durand did not directly mentor any students who would later become professional mycologists, he was well-regarded as an instructor in undergraduate courses. ==Honors and memberships== While a student at Cornell, Durand was a member of Sigma Xi, Quill and Dagger, Congress, the Classical Association, and the Natural History Society (of which he was president in his senior year). Durand was a charter member of the American Mycological Society (which merged with the Botanical Society of America in 1903). He was also a member of the American Phytopathological Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. ==Eponymous taxa== *Durandia (Peck) Rehm (1913) – nom. illegit.

Moreno Reinoso makes large, ornate bird cages from the reeds and bamboo often in the forms of churches and houses, as well as boxes for paper, laundry baskets, book shelves and other light furniture. He grows his own raw materials, and his house is filled with reeds and bamboo of various types along with machetes, knives, blades, chisels and pieces of leather.

Then they are soaked for over twelve hours and left covered to maintain moisture. Standing at his worktable, he pulls the needed pieces. Thicker ones are used for support, sometimes with cross pieces for larger works. He usually leaves the finished product unpainted but sometimes adds brown blotches by lightly burning certain areas.

Despite the sport being described in official literature as canoe sprint, in line with Olympic practice, a canoe marathon, a 5000-metre non-Olympic event, was included for each gender. ==Qualification== Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) is restricted to one boat per event, a maximum of fifteen boats, and therefore a maximum of 26 qualified athletes. Azerbaijan, as host, is guaranteed entry of three athletes, in three boats; K1-1000 metres and C1-1000 metres for men, and the K1-500 metres for women. The bulk of qualification (all places other than host and 'universality' places) will be awarded by virtue of performance in the 2014 European Canoe Sprint Championships. Places will be awarded to NOCs rather than individual athletes. Each event has a quota of places available as set out below:Canoe sprint qualification summary {  align=\\"center\\" - ! Event !!

Where a boat qualifies in two events of the same boat size but over two distances (e.g. 200m and 1000m in K2), that boat will be allowed to compete in both events, but will only take up the quota place in the longer event; the unused quota place in the shorter event will then be redistributed. In both cases this will allow for more boats to compete in a particular event than there are quota places. ==Timetable== {  style=\\"margin:0.5em auto; font- size:90%;position:relative;\\" - style=\\"width:2.5em; background:#00cc33; text- align:center\\"OCOpening ceremony style=\\"width:2.5em; background:#ccccff; text-align:center\\"TTraining day style=\\"width:2.5em; background:#3399ff; text-align:center\\"●Event competitions style=\\"width:2.5em; background:#ffcc00; text-align:center\\"1Event finals style=\\"width:2.5em; background:#ee3333; text-align:center\\"CCClosing ceremony } {  style=\\"margin:0.9em auto; font-size:90%; line-height:1.25em; width:75%;\\" - ! colspan=2June !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"12th Fri !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"13th Sat !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"14th Sun !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"15th Mon !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"16th Tue !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"17th Wed !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"18th Thu !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"19th Fri !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"20th Sat !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"21st Sun !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"22nd Mon !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"23rd Tue !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"24th Wed !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"25th Thu !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"26th Fri !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"27th Sat !style=\\"width:2.5em\\"28th Sun !Events - align=\\"center\\"  colspan=2 align=\\"left\\"  link= Canoe sprint  00cc33;\\" align=centerOC   3399ff;\\"●  ffcc00;\\"5  ffcc00;\\"10             ee3333;\\" align=centerCC  15 } ==MedalistsMen=== { -  C-1 200m    -  C-1 1000m    -  C-2 1000m  Andrei Bahdanovich Aliaksandr Bahdanovich  Alexey Korovashkov Ilya Pervukhin  Peter Kretschmer Michael Mueller -  K-1 200m    * * * -  K-1 1000m    -  K-1 5000m    -  K-2 200m  Nebojša Grujić Marko Novaković  Ronald Rauhe Tom Liebscher  Sándor Tótka Péter Molnár -  K-2 1000m  Zoltán Kammerer Tamás Szalai  Max Rendschmidt Marcus Gross  Vitaliy Bialko Raman Piatrushenka -  K-4 1000m  Zoltán Kammerer Dávid Tóth Tamás Kulifai Dániel Pauman  Alexandr Sergeev Vasily Pogreban Anton Ryakhov Vladislav Blintcov  Pavel Miadzvedzeu Aleh Yurenia Vitaliy Bialko Raman Piatrushenka } ;Notes # Miklós Dudás of Hungary originally won the gold medal, but were later disqualified due to doping violations. ===Women=== { -  K-1 200m    -  K-1 500m    -  K-1 5000m    -  K-2 200m  Marharyta Makhneva Maryna Litvinchuk  Nikolina Moldovan Olivera Moldovan  Mariya Povkh Anastasiia Todorova -  K-2 500m  Milica Starović Dalma Ružičić-Benedek  Roxana Borha Elena Meroniac  Anna Kárász Ninetta Vad -  K-4 500m  Gabriella Szabó Anna Kárász Danuta Kozák Ninetta Vad  Franziska Weber Verena Hantl Conny Wassmuth Tina Dietze  Karolina Naja Ewelina Wojnarowska Edyta Dzieniszewska-Kierkla Beata Mikołajczyk } ==Medal tableReferences *Results book Category:Sports at the 2015 European Games 2015 European Games ","title":"Canoe sprint at the 2015 European Games"},{"id":"42029313","text":"Scaphyglottis atwoodii is a species of epiphytic orchid from Costa Rica.

Dennis first began sprinting at Fremont High School in Los Angeles where he opened eyes with a 9.5 100-yard dashhttp://masterssprinter.com/videos-ken-dennis-vs-harold- tolson-m-[0OhNkh10jbY].cfm before transferring to Centennial High School in Compton. At Centennial, he was joined by Charles Dumas, who had transferred from Jefferson High School. One year removed from winning the Olympic gold medal and being the first person to jump 7 feet, Dumas winning the high jump was a foregone conclusion. But it was Dennis' 13 points winning the 100, second in the 220 and 4x220 yard relay that led Centennial to the overall team title at the CIF California State Meet in 1955.http://www.prepcaltrack.com/ATHLETICS/TRACK/STATE_BK/statehis.htm Dennis was the top high school 100-yard dash man nationwide that year.http://www.prepcaltrack.com/ATHLETICS/TRACK/TFN/1955tfn.htm Dennis ran collegiately for the University of California.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat;=19850216&id;=h6xAAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=zzIHAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4884,5033014 Lodi News-Sentinel February 16, 1985 P11 On September 23, 1983, Dennis set the M45 World Record in the 100 metres at 10.92http://www.mastersathletics.net/fileadmin/html/Rankings/All_Time/100metresmen.htm in the heats before winning the World Masters Athletics Championships in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

He won the World Masters Championships in the 100m in 1987 a breath ahead of long time rival Reginald Austin of Australia, himself a former world record holder, who was running on home soil in Melbourne. Both were timed in 11.24.http://www.mastershistory.org/International-Results/1987-Results- Melbourne.pdf In 1989, on American soil in Eugene, Oregon Dennis handily beat Austin to take another world title.

Originally published in English, the Oslo Syndrome has been translated into Hebrew. ==Synopsis== According to Professor Ron Shleifer of Ariel University, Levin, a psychiatrist, compares the acceptance of the Oslo Accords by the Israeli public to Battered child syndrome, in which the victims \\"blame themselves and are convinced that if they would only behave better, their parents would cease to beat them, without knowing that they will continue to be beaten anyway because it is their parents who have a problem and not they.\\" Jerold Auerbach history professor from Wellesley College describe the book as \\"comprehensive historical description and compelling psychological interpretation of the “delusions of a people under siege\\"\\" Iddo Netanyahy described The Oslo Syndrome \\"attempts to show how a whole country can suffer from wishful thinking. A great majority [of Israelis] thought the accords we signed with [Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser] Arafat and his people would bring peace. All it brought was more bloodshed.\\" Excerpt from the book: \\"This phenomenon reveals great similarity, at the level of human psychology, to the response of children subjected to chronic abuse. Such children tend to blame themselves for their suffering.\\" Thus, he continues, \\"those segments of the Jewish community who live and work in environments hostile to Israel, commonly embrace the anti-Israel bias around them. And they often insist they are being virtuous by doing so.\\" This pathology is \\"no less delusional than that of abused children who blame themselves for the abuse they experience.\\" But, he concludes, the result is awful: \\"All too often such children doom themselves psychologically to lives of self-abnegation and misery. In the case of Jews indicting Israel for the hatred directed against it, the misery they cultivate goes far beyond themselves, and ultimately undermines Israel's very survival.\\" \\"The World's Oldest Sickness,\\" Janet Tassel, New York Sun, August 26, 2013 == References  * Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:Books about Israel Category:Israeli–Palestinian conflict books ","title":"The Oslo Syndrome"},{"id":"42029613","text":"The 1978 Society of West End Theatre Awards were held in 1978 in London celebrating excellence in West End theatre by the Society of West End Theatre.

It premiered September 12, 1959. == Synopsis == A Soviet scientific expedition is being prepared as the world's first mission to planet Mars. Their space ship Homeland has been built at a space station, where the expedition awaits the command to start. An American ship Typhoon experiencing mechanical problems arrives at the same space station, secretly having the same plans for the conquest of the Red Planet. Trying to stay ahead of the Soviets, they start without proper preparation, and soon are again in distress. The Homeland changes course to save the crew of Typhoon. They succeed, but find that their fuel reserves are now insufficient to get to Mars. So Homeland makes an emergency landing on the asteroid Icarus passing near Mars, on which they are stranded. After an attempt to send a fuel supply by unmanned rocket fails, another ship Meteor is sent with a cosmonaut on a possibly suicidal mission, to save the stranded cosmonauts. == Cast == * Ivan Pereverzev — scientist Eugene Kornev * Alexander Shvoryn — engineer Andrey Gordienko * Constantine Bartashevich — astronaut Robert Clark * Gurgen Tonunts — astronaut Erwin Verst * Valentin Chernyak — cosmonaut Gregory Somov * Viktor Dobrovolsky — space station chief Vasily Demchenko * Alexandra \\"Alla\\" Popova — Vera Korneva * Taisia Litvinenko — doctor Lena * Larisa Borisenko — student Olga * Leo Lobov — cameraman Sasha * Sergey Filimonov — writer Troyan * Maria Samoilov — Clark's mother * Mikhail Belousov — ( uncredited ) == Crew == * Screenwriters — Alexei Sazonov, Evgeniya Pomeschikov with the participation of — Mikhael Karyukov * Production director - Tatiana Kulchitskaya * Artistic director — Timofej Liauchuk * Staging directors — Alexander Dovzhenko, Mikhael Karyukov * Director of photography — Nikolai Kulchitskii * Art director — Yuri Shvets * Composer — Julij Meitus * Sound engineer — Georgij Parahnikov * Director — Valery Fokin * Mounting — L.

In addition to preparing a dubbing script in American English, Coppola removed all references to the US/Soviet conflict from the dialogue, blotted out all the Cyrillic writing on the various spacecraft and superimposed neutral designs, replaced shots showing models and paintings of Soviet spacecraft with scenes showing NASA ones, replaced the names of all the actors with made-up names which had their first letters identical to those of the players (and thus turning Taisiya Litvinenko into a man, Thomas Littleton), and inserted a scene with monsters on Mars's moon Phobos.

Throughout his criminal career following his escape, Guzmán was pursued all across Mexico and abroad, and went from being an average-level drug lord to arguably the world's most-wanted man. Mexico offered MXN$30 million (about US$2.3 million) for his capture, while the United States offered up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. In 1993, he was arrested and imprisoned for murder and drug trafficking, facing a 20-year sentence. Fearing his extradition to the U.S., Guzmán fled from prison by reportedly hiding in a laundry cart in 2001. He quickly reincorporated back in the Sinaloa Cartel while authorities continued their manhunt to re-arrest him. While on the run, Guzmán reportedly travelled with a large entourage of armed bodyguards equivalent to those of a head of state, using a vast surveillance network and bullet-proof cars, aircraft, and all-terrain vehicles to avoid capture. His elusiveness helped him craft a near-mythical persona and image in some parts of Mexico; with alleged eyewitnesses accounts abound that Guzmán would enter restaurants with his gunmen, order all cell phones and devices confiscated, proceed to calmly enjoy his meal, and subsequently paying the tab for every customer in the restaurant upon departing. His whereabouts were a subject of Mexican folklore, with reports and rumors circulating that he was in many parts of Mexico, especially in an area known as the \\"Golden Triangle\\", a drug- producing region in the Sierra Madre mountains where Guzmán grew up. By late 2013, authorities began to penetrate Guzmán's security inner circle by arresting several of his top lieutenants. Through informant tips, wiretap phone calls, and confessions from his close associates, Mexican security forces got closer to his whereabouts. After more than 13 years on the run, he was finally arrested by the Mexican Navy in a beach resort area in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, on 22 February 2014. Many Mexicans compared his capture with the fall of Colombia's drug lord Pablo Escobar, the capture of Saddam Hussein, and even the death of Osama bin Laden. On 11 July 2015, however, Guzmán escaped from prison again through a tunnel inside his prison cell, but was caught six months after his escape and extradited to the U.S. ==Vicente Fox administration: 2000–2006Arrest and prison escape: 1993–2001=== On 9 June 1993, Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán, the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, was arrested in Guatemala following a massive manhunt to arrest him and other drug traffickers involved in the murder of the Mexican cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo (who was mistakenly killed by the Tijuana Cartel during an attack aimed at Guzmán). Following his arrest, he was extradited to Mexico and imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (often referred to simply as \\"La Palma\\" or \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico. On 22 November 1995, he was transferred to the maximum security prison Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2 (also known as \\"Puente Grande\\") in Jalisco. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but while he lived in Puente Grande, Guzmán enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle; he had most of the people working in the prison under his payroll, ordered the meals he wanted from a menu, continued his illicit activities through cellphone, enjoyed sporadic visits from prostitutes, among other benefits. However, under fears of being extradited to the United States for pending charges on drug trafficking, Guzmán orchestrated his escape from Puente Grande. On 19 January 2001, his electronically secured cell was opened and Guzmán was reportedly escorted by a prison guard outside of Puente Grande while hidden in a laundry cart. The security cameras of the prison were disabled on his way out, and Guzmán became a free man. Guzmán was driven out of the prison by Francisco Javier Camberos Rivera (alias \\"El Chito\\"), one of the prison guards, and headed to Guadalajara. In the car, Guzmán sat in the passenger seat and urged Camberos Rivera that both of them were better off fleeing together, given that the manhunt to re-arrest him would also include his accomplice. When they were outside the city, Guzmán asked him to stop at a gasoline station because he said he was thirsty and wanted a bottle of water. Camberos Rivera got off the vehicle, went into the shop, and bought the water. When he came back to the car, Guzmán was gone. At 11:35 p.m. that day, the prison warden Leonardo Beltrán Santana was notified that Guzmán's cell was empty, and chaos within the prison ensued. The prison staff searched in every cell, room, and closet to no avail. When the news of Guzmán's escape reached the newspaper headlines, the Mexican government vowed to launch a national manhunt to bring him behind bars again and to punish those responsible for allowing him to escape. In the nearby communities close to the prison, the Mexican Army searched for Guzmán; they raided houses, ranches, and even government buildings, but they did not find traces of the drug lord. In Guadalajara, security forces raided a house of one of Guzmán's associates, confiscating weapons, drugs, phones, computers, and thousands of dollars in cash, but they did not find their target. Anonymous tips led authorities to Manzanillo, Colima, which led to raids in seventeen houses and four ranches. Guzmán, however, was nowhere to be found. Within days of the escape, it was clear to the Mexican government that Guzmán was no longer hiding in the surrounding areas. The manhunt was then extended nationwide, with hundreds of police officers and soldiers scattered across Mexico, from major cities to the tinniest rural communities. After meeting with other Sinaloa Cartel leaders a few months after his escape, Guzmán re-emerged and was eager to prove that his time in prison had not softened his personality and that his position and status among the cartel hierarchy was stronger than before. He spent most of 2001 transversing numerous hideouts all across Mexico, acclimating quickly to his new lifestyle as a high-profile drug lord on the run. ===Continued manhunts=== In March 2001, authorities discovered that Guzmán was hiding at a ranch known as Los Limones in Santa Fe, Nayarit. Soldiers raided the property but the drug lord had escaped beforehand, reportedly via helicopter. In August 2001, he was detected near La Marquesa in Mexico City. In November 2001, Guzmán was reported to have lived in Puebla with his wife Griselda López Pérez and in Cuernavaca. According to police reports, Guzmán and his wife were under the protection of Jesús Castro Pantoja, an ex-policeman in charge of the drug lord's security logistics; and Juan Mauro Palomares (alias \\"El Trece\\"), another Sinaloa Cartel member and associate of Guzmán. From Puebla he moved back to Mexico City before hiding at a mountainous community known as Tohayana in Sinaloa. It was there federal agents believed that Guzmán began to make business connections with South American drug traffickers. In the first week of September 2001, Mexican authorities reported that Guzmán was living between Toluca and the state of Nayarit. He managed to escape arrest after the extinct Federal Preventive Police (PFP) intercepted a vehicle carrying Arturo Guzmán Loera (alias \\"El Pollo\\"), one of Guzmán's brothers. In one of the other vehicles in the convoy was Guzmán, who managed to escape the scene. One of the henchmen arrested with Arturo was allowed to make a phone call while detained, allowing Guzmán to escape from a safe house he was hiding in Zinacantepec, State of Mexico, where he lived from June to September 2011. The Mexican authorities had several follow-ups on Guzmán's whereabouts since previous months; through phone taps, they concluded that the drug lord was residing in the Toluca Valley. That year, the Centro de Investigación y Seguridad Nacional (CISEN), Mexico's intelligence agency, conducted an investigation among several State of Mexico functionaries to determine if any of them were collaborating with Guzmán. In 2002, he was reported to have been at Campeche in southern Mexico; in Tamaulipas in the northeast; in the state of Sonora in the northwest; and in Mexico City, the country's capital. On 14 June 2002, federal agents believed that Guzmán and Mayo Zambada were hiding at Las Quintas neighborhood in Culiacán. When the authorities got to the area, they surrounded the houses with over 200 federal policemen, only to discover Zambada's ex-wife and daughter. About a month later on 2 July 2002, informants notified federal agents that the drug lord was hiding at the Condado de Sayavedra neighborhood in Atizapán, State of Mexico. Like in the other occurrences, Guzmán was not found. On 22 August 2003, rumors spread that Guzmán had been captured in Monterrey, Nuevo León; Mexico's Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha denied the allegations. That same day but in Manzanillo, Colima, other versions circulated that Guzmán had been captured, but they turned out to be false. In 2004, the Mexican Army discovered that Guzmán and Zambada hosted a large social event in Badiraguato, Sinaloa and were heading via truck to Tamazula, Durango. A terrestrial operation to capture the drug lord would have taken hours given the dirt tracks that led to the area where Guzmán was located. Instead, the Army sent in the Mexican Air Force to surprise him. As helicopters soared on top of the ranch, Guzmán and his men escaped by foot. Soldiers descended from the choppers and arrested the employees working at the ranch, but Guzmán was nowhere to be found. According to local journalists who consulted the police, the operative was carried out to merely scare away Guzmán, not to apprehend him. In November 2004, soldiers raided another of Guzmán's ranches north of La Tuna, Badiraguato, after they detected his voice through a satellite phone line they had been tapping for several months. When they got to the location, Guzmán had escaped—they were about ten minutes late from capturing him. At the scene the soldiers confiscated several belongings from the drug lord, including laptops with new photographs of Guzmán. The pictures proved that the drug lord had been at that ranch, and showed that he sported a new mustache and had gained more weight after escaping from prison. Outraged for failing to capture him, the soldiers lit Guzmán's vehicles on fire and destroyed the property. Mexican authorities blamed infiltrated informants for passing down information to Guzmán and helping him escape, but critics noted that the drug lord had successfully avoided arrest because there were no serious efforts to apprehend him and that the government was faking attempts to capture Guzmán. ===Public appearances=== One Saturday evening in May 2005, Guzmán reportedly appeared at a restaurant in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas escorted by several of his gunmen. After closing the doors of the restaurant, the drug lord warned the 40 customers that they were not allowed to leave the place or use electronic devices until he finished dinner. To make up for the inconvenience, however, Guzmán picked up the tab for all of the customers in the restaurant. In November 2005, Guzmán was supposedly seen in Culiacán, Sinaloa repeating the same exploit he had done months before; according to an eyewitness, the drug lord arrived at Las Palmas, an eatery in one of the city's busy streets, with 15 of his bodyguards—all of them sporting AK-47 assault rifles. A man told those present the following: Following this statement, Guzmán entered through the front door of the restaurant and walked through the tables, greeting the customers. \\"Hello, nice to meet you. How are you? I'm Joaquín Guzmán Loera. A pleasure. At your service,\\" he said, shaking their hands. The drug lord then retreated to one of the restaurant's private rooms, where he ate his favorite steak dish. After a few hours, Guzmán finished his dinner and left the scene through the back door. His gunmen departed minutes later. The customers soon discovered that their tabs had been paid by Guzmán. When asked about the incident, however, the restaurant owner denied the story and stated that the drug lord was never there. Such stories, whether true or false, created a mystique surrounding Guzmán. ===Final months: 2006=== During the last days of the administration of President Vicente Fox (2000-2006), General Rolando Eugenio Hidalgo Eddy was appointed at the 9th Military Zone with clear orders to capture Guzmán. Within a few months in office, the General managed to arrest one of Guzmán's top money launderers and raided several towns and airstrips thought to be owned by Guzmán. Although he received death threats from organized criminals, he went for Guzmán's family. In one operation led by him, soldiers raided one of the ranches owned by María Consuelo Loera Pérez, the drug lord's mother. Intelligence reports mentioned that Guzmán had visited his mother in La Tuna, Badiraguato. When the soldiers arrived, the drug lord had already escaped; after not finding any evidence of criminal activities, the soldiers allegedly trashed the property, according to some local eyewitness accounts. Guzmán purposely carried out a defamation campaign against the General to win public support. Locals, accused of supporting the drug lord, marched in Culiacán and wrote a petition to the President and the local human rights commission asking for the abuses to stop. Authorities dismissed the accusations as a tactic employed by Guzmán. Locals, on the other hand, denied the accusations. In August 2006, he commanded an operation that led to the capture of Guzmán's nephew Luis Alberto Cano Zepeda in Durango. Guzmán responded by disposing the corpse of a man outside of the General's headquarters. Guzmán's escape from prison in the Fox administration marked an embarrassing episode for the government, which carried out several efforts to re-arrest the drug lord. However, Guzmán managed to remain a fugitive throughout the whole political administration and into Calderón's presidency, which began in December 2006. ==Felipe Calderón administration: 2006–2012== In the administration of President Felipe Calderón (2006–December 2012), Guzmán's capture was a top priority for the Mexican government. However, he managed to remain a fugitive throughout this administration. Ten days after taking office on 11 December 2006, Calderón carried out a military campaign to dismantle the drug trafficking groups in the state of Michoacán, marking the start of the Mexican Drug War. In 2006, hidden security cameras spotted Guzmán riding an SUV in the rural areas of Durango. When the police and the Mexican Army arrived at the area, he had escaped. On 2 July 2007, Guzmán married former beauty pageant winner Emma Coronel Aispuro in La Angostura, Canelas, Durango. The authorities raided the area the following day, but the newly married couple had already left. One version states that they left to Colombia; other sources state that they went to a new home Guzmán owned in the mountains. In October 2007, media outlets reported that Guzmán had been captured in Sinaloa de Leyva, Sinaloa following a military raid. The information was later confirmed to be just a rumor. Manhunts on behalf of the General continued throughout his tenure in Sinaloa until 2008, when he departed from his post, without much success. In every occasion, Guzmán was elusive and avoided being detained. On 25 March 2008, a massive shootout in Guatemala's border with El Salvador reached the headlines in Mexico; local media outlets reported that among the eleven dead was Guzmán. Two of the bodies were calcined, and Guatemalan authorities issued DNA samples to determine whether the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin was one of them, given that the Guatemalan authorities confirmed that there was one Mexican citizen among the casualties. As Mexico anticipated the news, Guatemala's President Álvaro Colom clarified that Guzmán had not been killed. After meeting with investigators, he said, they concluded that the drug lord was possibly hiding in Honduras. On the evening of 17 May 2008, Guzmán reportedly ate at the Aroma restaurant in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. According to eyewitnesses, around fifty of his henchmen arrived at the restaurant and ordered the diners to hand over their electronic devices and remain seated while Guzmán had dinner with several unknown companions. After eating, Guzmán ordered his henchmen to return the confiscated devices, paid everyone's tab, and left the establishment. Days later in an apparent revenge attack, rival gangsters of the Juárez Cartel set the restaurant on fire. On 20 May 2008, Mexican authorities conducted several operations in Irapuato, San Miguel de Allende, and in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato after suspicions that Guzmán was residing in that state. In the first week of September 2008, Guzmán reportedly ate at the Barroca hotel-restaurant in Piedras Negras, Coahuila with an unidentified man known as \\"El Yerno\\". On 15 September 2008, Mexico's Independence Day, Guzmán reportedly visited Badiraguato, Sinaloa to take a look at his marijuana plantations and deliveries as a helicopter overlooked the area. The Secretariat of National Defense stated on 11 August 2009 that Guzmán may have lived inside a drug laboratory in Tamazula, Durango for some time, following a raid conducted by Mexican security forces. ===Mexico's most-wanted list: 2009=== In 2009, the Federal government of Mexico released a list of its 37 most-wanted drug lords, offering monetary rewards for anyone who could provide information that would lead to their arrests. Mexico offered up to MXN$30 million (about U.S.$2.1 million) for Guzmán's capture, while the United States government offered up to U.S.$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Mexican government also offered up to MXN$15 million (about U.S.$1 million) for information leading to the arrest of the high-ranking associates of the traffickers on the list, which included members of the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas, Juárez Cartel, La Familia Michoacana, Beltrán Leyva Cartel, Tijuana Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzmán, however, was placed at the top of the list. === Continued manhunts: 2009–2012=== On 26 January 2009, U.S. authorities discovered that Guzmán met at a conclave in Sonoyta, Sonora with several of his associates to discuss the cartel's drug trafficking operations. According to documents provided by the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Guzmán stated to those present that they had to defend the cartel's drug shipments at all costs, even if it required an armed standoff with Mexican or U.S. law enforcement. On April 17, 2009, in the state of Durango, Roman Catholic Archbishop Héctor González said in an interview that \\"everyone [knew]\\" that Guzmán lived in Guanaceví, Durango, \\"except the authorities, who just [did not] happen to see him for some reason.\\" Supporters of President Calderón reduced the Archbishop's comments as careless, while others lauded the remarks, stating that the government was either incapable or too corrupt to go after the drug lord. In an interview the following year, the clergyman stated that \\"[Guzmán was] omnipresent. ... He [was] everywhere.\\" He also said that there were rumors that the drug lord owned several properties in the rural community of San Andrés del Teul in Jiménez del Teul, Zacatecas. A few days after the Archbishop's remarks, two undercover military officers disguised as marijuana planters were killed by organized crime in Durango. Alongside their corpse was a written message that read: \\"You'll never get Chapo\\". In May 2009, Guzmán reportedly ate at a restaurant in the state of Durango, where he asked the diners to put away their cellphones and cameras, and told them that no one was allowed to leave until him and his entourage were gone. He told everyone present, however, to order anything they wanted from the menu. On 8 August 2009, the Mexican Army deployed their troops to Jesús María, Culiacán after their received a tip that Guzmán had plans to visit the tomb of his son Édgar Guzmán López, who had been killed a year earlier. The soldiers guarded the surrounding area for twenty-four hours. With Guzmán still absent, the Army deployed two choppers to oversee the area and several soldiers on foot to search the town. Guzmán, however, never showed up. On 24 February 2010, Honduran intelligence reports indicated that Guzmán was making sporadic visits to El Paraíso, Copán to take some time off from the day-to-day operations of his cartel and to rest from the pressure of law enforcement in Mexico. The reports were based on informants' testimonies that indicated that there was a man in the area who had attended a party with Mexican musical groups and who fit the description of the drug lord. The Honduran authorities, however, reiterated that they did not believe Guzmán's permanent residence was in Honduras. According to court documents, Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Feith said that in April 2014, a FBI informant met with Guzmán at a disclosed location in a montaneous region in Mexico. The informant met with him because he was introduced by Jesús Manuel Gutiérrez Guzmán (Guzmán's cousin), a former Sinaloa Cartel representative in the U.S. The meeting was not recorded and only involved Guzmán and the FBI informant. Following a supposed operation led by the Mexican Navy in the rural community of Alchichica in the municipality of Tepeyahualco, Puebla, rumors spread on social media that Guzmán had been arrested on 14 October 2010. The rumors of his arrest turned out to be false. Investigators believe that the drug lord lived in Argentina from August 2010 to March 2011 and was accompanied by an unidentified female and his stepdaughter. Following a lead conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that called for his arrest, Guzmán reportedly went to the Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires and flew to Paraguay, Colombia, and then to Europe using a false name. It was not clear if Guzmán travelled in the same plane with the woman and the girl. The authorities speculate that they did travel together. In Argentina, Guzmán reportedly conducted drug trafficking shipments and met with regional drug lords in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Córdoba to further extend the Sinaloa Cartel's presence in South America. The drug lord hid in poor Argentinian neighborhoods and laundered money there; such actions helped him gain the trust of some locals, investigators say. In April 2011, an anonymous top official working for the DEA said to the media that Guzmán was living in Durango and hiding in a mountainous area \\"like Osama bin Laden\\". The official said that the area where Guzmán lived was a \\"very difficult terrain\\", and that the drug lord knew all the locals who lived in the surrounding area. He then said that any outsiders or suspicious activities were easily detected by them. During Holy Week in 2011, Guatemalan authorities confirmed that Guzmán was reportedly seen in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, and admitted that he had frequented the country and Honduras. In August 2011, a newspaper in Veracruz reported that Guzmán had moved to the state and was seen by several locals at a famous restaurant in the port city of Veracruz, Veracruz. According to the story, his gunmen entered the restaurant and asked those present to hand over their electronic devices. Once they had done this, Guzmán entered the restaurant and apologized for the inconvenience. He then had dinner, paid the tab for all the diners present in the restaurant, left a large tip for the waiters, and left the premises. In September 2011, there were reports among authorities that Guzmán and one of his sons were in Bolivia. His son was reportedly taking aviation classes at El Trompillo Airport in Santa Cruz. Final months On 21 February 2012, the Mexican Federal Police—acting on intelligence information provided by U.S. law enforcement—raided a mansion in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur in an attempt to capture Guzmán. Intelligence reports indicated that Guzmán was staying at the premises temporarily, and that he had plans to meet with a sex worker who was hired by his intermediaries to offer her services. When he arrived at the house, however, the sex worker notified Guzmán that she was menstruating; he rescheduled an appointment for another day and left promptly. Four people were arrested (the sex worker, a gardener, a chef, and one of Guzmán's pilots) when the Mexican authorities raided the mansion a few days later. They believe that if Guzmán had not cancelled the appointment, he would have been arrested at the scene. The near-arrest of Guzmán reached international headlines, but suspicions and worries that there was someone tipping him off with information from law enforcement mounted. Following the raid, Guzmán hid in another resort area by blending in with other vacationers. Authorities searched for the drug lord in Los Cabos for three more days. Realizing that his Blackberry cellphone had been traced down by law enforcement, Guzmán handed it over to one of his subordinates. The Mexican security forces, unaware that Guzmán had realized his phone had been identified, continued to pursue the signal until they arrested the subordinate. By the time this had happened, Guzmán had already made his way to the desert, where a private jet flew him to his hideout in the Sierra Madre region. After the incident in Los Cabos, Guzmán reinstated a different network to communicate with his subordinates. If his men needed to communicate with him through text message, the message would first be sent to a trusted lieutenant at a public wireless network. Upon receiving the text, that person would type it into an iPad in order to send it via WiFi and avoid detection from law enforcement. The message would then be sent to a second intermediary who would write the message on his cellphone and send it to Guzmán through public WiFi. This made it difficult for authorities to penetrate his communication network, given that Guzmán's cellphone only connected with another device. If he replied, the message would be relayed through the same procedures. This method is sometimes known as the \\"mirror system\\", and it is difficult to penetrate because it uses public WiFi areas and different intermediaries to transcribe messages. However, the DEA managed to decipher the communication pattern and decided to focus on targeting the operators in Guzmán's ring in order to identify the mirrors and eventually reach him. A video of a man who appeared to be Guzmán surfaced on the Blog del Narco website on 10 April 2012. In the clip, Guzmán, wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and a cap, appears interrogating a man (apparently a kidnapped victim) about rival drug traffickers in the state of Sinaloa, particularly in the areas of Mazatlán, Los Mochis, and Los Limones. The video lasts for about two minutes and was received anonymously via e-mail by the Blog del Narco. It is unknown when and where the video was filmed, or why Guzmán himself was leading the interrogation. Given that Guzmán was characterized for his elusiveness and low-profile status, it is possible that the video was filmed without his permission. That same month, confidential reports from anonymous officials in Mexican and U.S. governments stating that the Pentagon had plans to send the U.S. Navy SEALs to capture or kill Guzmán in Mexico were leaked to the media. The plan was reportedly elaborated by the U.S. government and initially accepted by Calderón. However, the President faced objections from the top echelons of the Mexican Armed Forces, who refused to accept the measures of the plan. The plan consisted of the following: the SEALs would be divided into three groups; two groups would attack by land, and the other one would stay airborne. In about 10 to 15 minutes, the land team would raid the property where Guzmán was located and attempt to apprehend him. In case of resistance from Guzmán or his security circle, the SEALs would kill him and his men on the spot before taking the drug lord's body. The plan would be carried out only by U.S. authorities, excluding the Mexican Armed Forces and other officials altogether. The refusal of the Mexican Armed Forces in accepting the plan, however, halted its execution. Throughout Calderón's administration, critics accused his government of favoring the Sinaloa Cartel and protecting Guzmán while it went after its rivals, especially Los Zetas. Rumors and conspiracy theories that Guzmán enjoyed a level of protection or favoritism from the Calderón administration were rooted in the fact that data showed that Mexican authorities were capturing more drug cartel leaders from criminal organizations other than Guzmán's Sinaloa Cartel. It was also rooted in the fact that people perceived that the government was not carrying out real efforts to capture him. In the wake of the 2012 presidential elections and in the final months of the Calderón administration, suspicions that the government was planning a potential ploy of capturing Guzmán to boost Calderón's National Action Party (PAN) popularity were widely discussed in talk shows and opinion polls. The reasoning went that capturing Guzmán would make the PAN soar in popularity before elections. At the same time, the capture could have ignited more controversy, as it would imply that the government kept Guzmán at bay until they saw it convenient to arrest him. However, Guzmán was not arrested, and continued to exert his influence in the criminal underworld and extend the Sinaloa Cartel's reach to global proportions. ==Enrique Peña Nieto administration: 2012–2014== In December 2012, Enrique Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) became the President of Mexico. During his presidential campaign and into his term, Peña Nieto vowed to reduce the violence in Mexico by refocusing the strategy against organized crime and prioritizing to lower murders, kidnappings, and extortion, as opposed to simply relying on the so-called \\"kingpin strategy\\", which focuses on taking down the leaders of the drug trafficking groups. Rumors persisted, however, that the new government had plans to arrange a truce with organized crime to reduce the violence and give accommodations to top drug kingpins like Guzmán. Peña Nieto and the PRI government rejected the notion that they would negotiate with criminals in exchange for relative peace. In his term, the military-led offensive against Mexico's drug cartels continued while Guzmán remained a fugitive. On 21 February 2013, it was reported that Guzmán was killed in a gun fight with Guatemalan security forces near the border between Guatemala and Mexico, in the town of San Francisco, El Petén. Police stated two suspected criminals were killed in the fire exchange, and that one of the corpse that was found inside a truck resembled Guzmán's physical appearance. Later that same day, however, Guatemalan authorities were not sure if the shooting had even occurred. The authorities later dismissed the rumors after the body was not found. The Guatemalan government issued an apology for the misleading information. The blunder occurred because the Guatemalan authorities relied entirely on reports from villagers who said they had seen the incident. However, officials later recognized that there were contradictions in the eye-witness testimonies. Wikileaks reports indicated that Guzmán was hiding in Petén days prior to this mistake. On 12 May 2013, the DEA stated they believed Guzmán and his former business partner Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada were in the region of northern Baja California and southern California. In November 2013, Honduras Vice-Minister of Defense Roberto Funes stated in a press interview that Guzmán was possibly hiding in Honduras. The interview continued with Funes talking about drug trafficking in Honduras, but he did not say why he believed Guzmán was hiding there. The DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne refused to comment on Guzmán's whereabouts, but Woodrow Wilson Center expert Eric Olson said that it was possible that the drug lord was hiding in Honduras, given its institutional weakness and porous borders. However, there was no clear evidence that the drug lord had left Mexico. Between 15 November and 20 November 2013, Mexican media outlets reported that the DEA had discovered, through radio conversations between drug traffickers, that Guzmán was admitted to a private hospital in Jalisco after suffering a heart attack. The exact medical center that the drug lord reportedly attended is unknown (though they believe it was likely at the San Javier Hospitals in Zapopan or Guadalajara). Authorities believe that Guzmán used a fake identity when he checked in for a brief check up. Mexican officials investigated several clinics in Manzanillo, Colima and in the Guadalajara area, though their efforts to get a lead to Guzmán were unsuccessful. This report, though it did not provide any leads on his whereabouts, served to reinforce the rumors that Guzmán had health problems, given that other reports suggested that he had experienced some weight loss and was exercising regularly. Intelligence reports suggested that Guzmán suffered from diabetes and heart disease. Although his whereabouts were unknown, the authorities believed that he was likely hiding in the \\"Golden Triangle\\" (Spanish: Triángulo Dorado), an area that encompasses parts of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua in the Sierra Madre region. The region is a major producer of marijuana and opium poppy in Mexico, and its remoteness from the urban areas makes it an attractive territory for the production of synthetic drugs in clandestine labs and for its mountains that serve as possible hideouts. Guzmán reportedly commanded a sophisticated security circle of at least 300 informants and gunmen resembling the manpower equivalent to those of a head of state. His inner circle would help him move around through several isolated ranches in the mountainous area and avoid capture. He usually escaped from law enforcement using bullet-proof cars, aircraft, and all-terrain vehicles, and was known to employ sophisticated communications gadgetry and counterespionage practices. Since many of these locations in the Golden Triangle can only be reached through single-track dirt roads, local residents easily detect the arrival of law enforcement or any outsider. Their distrust towards non-residents and their aversion towards the government, alongside a combination of bribery and intimidation, helped keep the locals loyal to Guzmán and the Sinaloa Cartel in the area. According to law enforcement intelligence, attempting to have launched an attack to capture Guzmán via air would have issued similar results; his security circle would have notified the presence of an aircraft 10 minutes away from Guzmán's location, giving him ample time to escape the scene and avoid arrest. In addition, his gunmen reportedly carried surface-to- air missiles that may bring down aircraft in the area. ===Closing in on Guzmán: 2013–2014=== For more than 13 years, Guzmán hid across Mexico and in the Sierra Madre while other drug lords from other organized crime groups were arrested or killed. His elusiveness from law enforcement made him a near- legendary figure in Mexico's narco folklore. However, by 2013, law enforcement began to penetrate his inner circle by taking down some of his top lieutenants; in November 2013, the DEA arrested Zambada's son Serafín Zambada Ortiz at the border crossing in Nogales, Arizona as part of an extensive drug case. His arrest was important for law enforcement to penetrate the top echelons of Guzmán's cartel. A month later in Sonora state, Mexican security forces gunned down Gonzalo Inzunza Inzunza (alias \\"El Macho Prieto\\"), a top lieutenant of the Sinaloa Cartel and business partner of Zambada. Less than two weeks after that, the Netherlands police arrested José Rodrigo Aréchiga Gamboa (alias \\"El Chino Ántrax\\"), the leader of the Sinaloa's assassins squad Los Ántrax and a top logistics chief for Guzmán, as he arrived from Mexico City at the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. With his arrest, U.S. authorities began to understand how the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel moved and communicated. The DEA learned through wiretap phone calls, texts, and emails after the arrest that Guzmán had plans to travel to Culiacán for a family reunion with his Alfredo and Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, both who were close to Aréchiga Gamboa. The Mexican Navy, acting on intelligence from the DEA, assembled at a military base in Los Cabos and formed the so-called Operation Gargoyle (Spanish: Operación Gárgola), the code-name given for the operation that pursued Guzmán. In order to avoid attention, the Navy placed one of its ships off the Baja California coast in Los Cabos as a decoy. They wanted to distract those around by making them think that the presence of the Navy was due to a regular naval exercise. However, with the informant system that characterized Guzmán in the past, it was believed that the drug lord was aware of the Navy's presence in the area. Intelligence information collected by Mexican and U.S. authorities in 2014 stated that Guzmán was beginning to gradually change his lifestyle as an outlaw. They believed that Guzmán was venturing to Culiacán and other urban areas from the Sierra Madre mountains more often than usual because he was tired of the austere life in the countryside and wanted to enjoy his wealth more comfortably. Other authorities speculated that his wife Emma Coronel Aispuro, who was much younger than Guzmán, was not used to the countryside. Adding to the fact that the couple had twin daughters, his wife was adamant that Guzmán spend more time with them. Guzmán also wished to enjoy other benefits not readily available in the countryside, like gourmet foods (which explains why he was spotted at restaurants in the past). On 6 February 2014, Mexican authorities believed that Guzmán had lunch at Mar and Sea restaurant (formerly known as El Farallón) in Culiacán. However, intelligence reports later indicated that it was not him but his son Iván Archivaldo who was at the sea food restaurant. In the operation, the Mexican Navy surrounded the premises and entered the restaurant in search of their target. At the parking lot, the soldiers searched inside the diners' vehicles. Iván Archivaldo, however, managed to escape the scene by reportedly disguising as a waiter. Final days On 12 February 2014, the PGR arrested high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel chief Daniel Fernández Domínguez (alias \\"El Pelacas\\") in Puebla, Puebla. His arrest was a major break in Guzmán's inner circle; at the time of his arrest, Fernández had 20 cellphones with several contacts having the Sinaloa dialing code. Investigators concluded that several of the numbers on the cellphones were from other high-ranking members of Zambada's personnel. Two days following his arrest, Mexican authorities carried out several raids in Sinaloa's countryside and in Culiacán. On 13 February 2014, the PGR, Federal Police, and the Mexican Navy arrested Sinaloa Cartel chief Joel Enrique Sandoval Romero (alias \\"El 19\\") and four of his associates. Sandoval Romero, according to Mexican authorities, was the assassin and security chief of Zambada in Sinaloa. One of the detainees said that one of the numbers of the cellphones they had belonged to Guzmán. That number was then used by law enforcement to trace his presence in Culiacán. On 16 February 2014, U.S. authorities tracked down the cellphone of Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramírez (alias \\"El Cóndor\\"), Guzmán's chief of communications. With such information they were able to track down other facilitators and identify a stash house before giving the information to Mexican security forces. Intelligence information began to focus on Mario Hidalgo Argüello (alias \\"El Nariz\\"), a man who formed part of Guzmán's inner circle as his personal assistant. On the night of 16 February 2014, Guzmán arrived at a property owned by his ex-wife Griselda Pérez López in Culiacán and ordered Hidalgo Argüello to pick up his dinner at a local restaurant. After his shift, he returned to his home in Culiacán and was arrested by Mexican authorities at his doorstep. After an interrogation, he provided law enforcement with information of Guzmán's whereabouts in Culiacán and pinpointed several addresses. In the city, Guzmán rarely spent more than a day in a single property; he rotated each day to different ones to avoid arrest and did not tell those in his inner circle of his whereabouts until they were en route. On 17 February 2014, the property of Guzmán's ex-wife at the Colinas de San Miguel neighborhood was raided by Mexican security forces. Several belongings were destroyed, but Guzmán was not found. Before dawn that day, Guzmán turned on his cellphone to make a call asking for help to get out of Culiacán. Law enforcement tracked the signal to a property at the Libertad neighborhood and made their way to arrest him. When the Navy tried to break down the door, they discovered that the front door was steel-reinforced; in addition to that, the door was custom-made with water on its inside in order to prevent the door from breaking down by heat. The authorities hammered the door for roughly ten minutes until they gained access to the safe house. They initially made their way to the kitchen and into other windowless rooms. There were security cameras and monitors throughout the house, but there were no signs of anyone there. When they reached the bathroom, they discovered that the bathtub had been raised with hydraulic lifts and that there was a set of stairs that led to a hidden tunnel. Guzmán was inside the domicile with Hoo Ramírez and a female cook known as La Chapis when the Navy arrived, but the steel door gave them ample time to escape through the tunnel. The Navy quickly made their way through the tunnel too, knowing that Guzmán had only a slight start advantage on them. The tunnel then reached a small portal that connected with the entire sewage system of Culiacán. Authorities continued their expedition through the tunnel without hesitation; in the streets, troops flooded the area in case Guzmán managed to escape by foot. Airborne was a covert U.S. drone that supervised the area and was readily available to notify Mexican authorities if the drug lord escaped through a manhole. Meanwhile, Guzmán made his way through the sewage system and eventually the Navy was unable to keep track of the pursuit. They discovered a tactical vest in one path and continued in that direction. They eventually reached a stopping point at a storm drain near a river, more than a mile from their starting point. Guzmán, once again, had managed to escape. Following the failed operation, Mexican authorities arrested Mario López Osorio (alias \\"El Picudo\\"), a close associate of Guzmán. Like the other arrested lieutenants, López Osorio was cooperative with law enforcement upon questioning, and stated that Guzmán and Hoo Ramírez had been picked up at a storm drain outside of Culiacán by him. He then said that he drove them south of Culiacán, where they were picked up by other aides in a different vehicle. Mexican authorities then raided the house of Hoo Ramírez in Culiacán but no one was there. On 20 February 2014, Mexican authorities arrested Jesús Peña González (alias \\"El 20\\"), a top Sinaloa Cartel enforcer and leader of Zambada's security circle. That same day, Hoo Ramírez turned on his cellphone and sent a text message to other Sinaloa Cartel members. Authorities tracked the signal to Mazatlán, Sinaloa and made their way to the city. In light of other occurrences, the authorities believed that Guzmán had already made his way to the Sierra Madre region. But they decided to head to Mazatlán anyway to attempt to capture Hoo Ramírez and squeeze Guzmán's inner circle even more. ===Re-arrest: 2014=== On the evening of 21 February 2014, about forty soldiers of the Mexican Navy assembled in Mazatlán along with a small group of agents from the DEA, the U.S. Marshal Service, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The marshals managed to pinpoint the signal of Hoo Ramírez's cellphone to Hotel Miramar, a twenty-story condominium complex at a beach resort area. Since geolocation technology cannot pinpoint the exact location of a signal, the Mexican authorities cordoned the area early in the morning of 22 February 2014. They later discovered at the hotel's registration office that two rooms had been rented the previous day. A team of Mexican soldiers made their way to one of the rooms of the sixth floor of Hotel Miramar and inadvertently discovered two sleeping U.S. tourists. At the same time on the fourth floor, a group of six soldiers made their way to Apartment #401, where they discovered Guzmán's bodyguard Hoo Ramírez guarding the entrance with an AK-47 assault rifle. Outnumbered, he surrendered his weapon while the authorities made their way into the apartment. In one of the bedrooms, the soldiers discovered Guzmán's chef and a babysitter, along with the drug lord's two daughters Mali and María Joaquina. In the other bedroom was Guzmán and his wife. No shots were fired, and in less than three minutes following the raid, Guzmán was arrested. By the time of his arrest, Guzmán was regarded as the world's most-wanted criminal and as the top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug trafficking organization whose influence stretched across several continents. The news of the arrest was leaked to the press by anonymous U.S. law enforcement officials that same morning, and the story quickly was shared and reached international headlines. For many Mexicans, the arrest of Guzmán paralleled in importance to the killing of Pablo Escobar and even to the death of Osama bin Laden. Though the idea of Guzmán as a near- legendary criminal remained high, the arrest greatly reduced his status in Mexico's narco folklore more to a man than to a myth. ==Re-escape and arrest: 2015–2016== On the evening of 11 July 2015, Guzmán escaped from the Federal Social Readaption Center No. 1 by going through a 1.5 kilometer tunnel found at the shower area in his cell. ==See also== * Operation Black Swan ==SourcesFootnotes=References=Bibliography=== : : : Category:Mexican drug war Category:Operations against organized crime in Mexico Category:Sinaloa Cartel ","title":"Manhunt of Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán"},{"id":"42029686","text":"International Boat Industry (IBI) is a business magazine with a special focus on boat industry published by Boating Communications Ltd.

She was educated at Døtreskolen af 1791. As an adult, she was employed as a teacher at the same school. Convinced of the importance of education of females, and eager to put her ideas of reforms in to practice, she reportedly dominated the school and placed the actual principal in the background. At that time, however, the opportunities for females to educate themselves was very limited and the institutions of learning open to them was largely limited to the capital of Copenhagen. Most female teachers in Denmark in the early 19th-century were employed as governesses rather than at schools. == Career == In 1845, a new law was put in effect regarding the formal competence demanded from a professional teacher, and an educational authority was installed with the task to control this new regulation. At this time, most private teachers in Denmark were female, but they had not formal education as the schools open for girls were still few and no academic institutions were open for adult females. In 1846, she founded the women's seminary Den højere Dannelsesanstalt for Damer to educate professional adult female teachers to serve in the private schools in Copenhagen, and who could meet the demands put upon them by the new school education authority. This was the first academic educational institution for women in Denmark. One of her students were Natalie Zahle (1827-1913) founder of the N. Zahle's School and alongside herself one of the two most notable pioneers of women's education in Denmark, as well as women's rights activists and feminists Louise Westergaard (1826–1880). In 1859, a new law was put in effect which allowed female teachers a formal degree. However, there were no institutions in existence which could offer such a degree to women. In 1861, Annestine Beyer together with Nicolai Femmer and Gotfred Bohr, arranged for the opening of Beyers, Bohrs og Femmers Kursus (later Femmers Kvindeseminarium) so that it could meet the demands necessary to issue a degree to female teachers, ==ReferencesOther sources== * Category:1795 births Category:1884 deaths Category:Danish women's rights activists Category:Danish feminists Category:19th-century Danish educators Category:19th-century Danish women ","title":"Annestine Beyer"},{"id":"42029759","text":"Giuseppe Varotti (Bologna, 1715- Bologna, 1780) was an Italian painter, active depicting sacred and historical subjects in a late-Baroque or Rococo style.Gli artisti italiani e stranieri negli stati estensi catalogo storico ...

In medical contexts, the meaning of deafness is hearing loss that precludes a person from understanding spoken language, an audiological condition. In this context it is written with a lower case d. It later came to be used in a cultural context to refer to those who primarily communicate through sign language regardless of hearing ability, often capitalized as Deaf and referred to as \\"big D Deaf\\" in speech and sign. The two definitions overlap but are not identical, as hearing loss includes cases that are not severe enough to impact spoken language comprehension, while cultural Deafness includes hearing people who use sign language, such as children of deaf adults. In a medical context, deafness is defined as a degree of hearing loss such that a person is unable to understand speech, even in the presence of amplification. In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an audiometer (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, can be heard. In a cultural context, Deaf culture refers to a tight-knit cultural group of people whose primary language is signed, and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or persons who \\"identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community\\", an example being children of deaf adults with normal hearing ability. It includes the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication. Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability or disease. == See also == * Hearing loss * Models of deafness * Deaf culture == References == Category:Deafness Category:Hearing loss Category:Audiology ","title":"Deafness"},{"id":"42029775","text":"Kokapur is a census town in Barasat I CD Block of Barasat Sadar subdivision in North 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal.

He has been recognized as a “grand master” by the Fomento Cultural Banamex for his work . Ixtle is obtained from the thick hard leaves of the maguey plant, which the artisan uses the fiber to make hammocks, nets, plant hangers, huaraches, bags and belts. He also works with a much finer maguey fiber called “pita,” which is obtained from the heart of the plant. He learned the craft when he was a child and today, he works with his wife, Esperanza Cruz and his children, who participate in all phases of production in the family workshop. He cuts the maguey leaves at the thickest part, near the base of the plant. To obtain the fiber, he cooks the leaves in a pit oven. When ready, he removes them and beats them to a pulp, loosening the fibers by scraping them free. The fibers are then placed in soapy water with lime to clean them. The cleaned fibers are straightened and set out to dry, then they are twisted into string. To color them, the string is put in a mixture of soapy water and dye. Hammocks and nets are made in a similar fashion, by knotting on a rudimentary wooden frame. The knotting techniques are traditional to the region, with variations called jaspeado, el arroz, el arroz fino and crucetas. The method of finishing off hammocks and making the loops to hang them is unique to the artisan’s community. ==References== Category:Mexican artists Category:Living people Category:People from Oaxaca Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Fortunato Hernández Bazán"},{"id":"42029812","text":"The Double Dealer was a short-lived but influential New-Orleans-based literary journal of the 1920s. ==Founders== The Double Dealer was established in 1921 as a platform for contemporary Southern writers of a modernist bent. Its founders were cultural critic Julius Weis Friend (editor) and Basil Thompson, Albert Goldstein, and John McClure (associate editors). The magazine's title came from a William Congreve play of the same name that Thompson and Friend admired for its acute dissection of human nature.Bowen, Frances Jean. \\"The New Orleans Double Dealer, 1921-26.\\" Louisiana Historical Quarterly 39 (1956): 443-56. They saw their ideal reader as someone with a tolerant understanding of \\"the devious ways of the world\\". Loyola University New Orleans preserves the personal papers of Basil Thompson which contain correspondence, manuscripts, and other materials related to the Double Dealer. ==Modernism== With its subtitle A National Magazine for the South, The Double Dealer positioned itself to combat a popular stereotype of Southern literature as a provincial and second-rate \\"Sahara of the Bozart,\\" as H.L. Mencken termed it in a notorious 1917 essay. In a piece entitled \\"New Orleans, the Double Dealer, and the Modern Movement in America,\\" Sherwood Anderson laid out the editors' vision of a modernism that does not operate only at a national level but also embraces the cultural individuality of regions like the South.Kennedy, Richard S., ed. Literary New Orleans in the Modern World. LSU Press, 2006. In pursuit of its inclusive vision, The Double Dealer published African-American authors, and an unusually high proportion of its writers were women. ==Writers== The Double Dealer was published monthly from January 1921 to May 1926, during what has been called the first golden age of little magazines.Weddle, Jeff.

Born into a humble family, he has no car, no house, and no connections. Yet as the term went viral on the Internet, Chinese youth (regardless of sex) from all backgrounds began to embrace it. It is slowly transforming into a descriptor of the ordinary Chinese citizen who faces everyday struggles and hardships. == Usage == The term diaosi (屌丝) – literal meaning \\"dick hair\\" – first appeared in an online dispute between two sub-forums of the BBS Baidu Tieba in October 2010. The members of Thunder's Big Three forum were insulted by the term, \\"diao\\" (a swear word or an offensive expression for \\"penis\\"), so they threw diaosi (dick hair) back at the Li Yi forum, suggesting that Li Yi's membership were inferior. Rather than take offence, Li Yi's membership incorporated the term and identified with it. The slang term emerged as a comedic insult, similar to the Western equivalent of \\"living in your mother's basement\\" – shorthand for \\"You're brave enough in a web forum but who are you in real life?\\" The Japanese term, otaku, also has a lot of similarities with diaosi. The term became a buzzword, referring to a young man born in a humble family, with mediocre appearance and standing and working in a dead-end job. He has few prospects, is unable to purchase luxuries; he is an outcast from the social mainstream. Their time is mostly spent on the computer, especially online games. Programmers and media industry workers have the highest percentage of self-identified diaosi. He also dreams of having a \\"goddess\\" as a girlfriend, but when interacting with said \\"goddess\\" he feels inferior and behaves awkwardly, knowing the \\"goddess\\" belongs with a \\"gaofushuai\\"(高富帅), his polar opposite: tall, rich and handsome. Like many insults, an initially vulgar epithet became a self-ascribed identity, in a classic example of a group on the outskirts of society claiming a once derogatory term as their own. Diaosi has become an almost universal identity among Chinese netizens. A survey conducted by Internet giant Sohu found that 64, 81 and 70 percent of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, respectively, can identify themselves with the feeling of being a diaosi. Another report carried out by the Chinese gaming company Giant, in April 2013, says that some 529 million young people (approximately 40 percentage of the total population of China) across the country now embraces the term diaosi. Although diaosi is often translated as \\"loser\\" in English, this is becoming less and less apt, with the growth of diaosi's popularity. Loser remains an indisputably negative term, personal in its injury, while diaosi is a true meme: dynamic, complex, and current, cultural rather than personal. The ambiguous meaning of diaosi – both as an insult and tribal term – is similar to the American term, redneck, whose poverty and unrefined behavior can not only be a source of pride, but a culture in and of itself. == Social background == Today, it is common to hear Chinese people proclaim that it's nearly impossible for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain entry to the country's upper class. The rate of students of rural background in a renowned university continues to decline. At the same time, the implementation of compulsory education means that more and more youngsters go to college, creating a surplus of educated young men who find it hard to enter the labour market. So not only do physical labourers feel they are marginalised by the society, the young men with a higher education background also feel helpless. == See also == * hillbilly * otaku * redneck * yokel * herbivore men == References == Category:Chinese culture Category:Chinese Internet slang Category:Chinese popular culture Category:Internet memes Category:Stereotypes Category:Chinese youth culture ","title":"Diaosi"},{"id":"42029861","text":"Giacomo Feo (c. 1471 – 27 August 1495), was the second husband of Caterina Sforza, Countess of Forlì. He was born and died in Forlì. ==Biography== Ravaldino Coat of Arms of Giacomo Feo BAron of France Giacomo Feo is the brother of Tommaso Feo, the castellan who had remained faithful to Caterina Sforza after the assassination of her husband. Following the assassination in 1488 of Caterina Sforza's first husband, Count Girolamo Riario, lord of Imola and Forlì, she appointed Giacomo Feo, a handsome stable groom in her household, to be the castellan of the fortress Ravaldino in Forlì. Feo and Sforza became lovers and they married in secret so she could avoid the possibility of losing custody of her children and the regency. The chronicles and diplomatic dispatches of the period reported that Sforza was very enamored with Feo, and it was feared that she would give political precedence and power to him, passing over her eldest son and Riario's heir, Ottaviano. These fears led to two failed conspiracies to assassinate Feo and Sforza. The third conspiracy, organized by Giovanni Antonio Ghetti, finally succeeded in killing Feo on 27 August 1495 when he and Sforza and their entourage were returning to Forlì from a hunting trip. Sforza and her daughter, Bianca, led the group in a carriage, while Feo, along with Sforza's sons, Ottaviano and Cesare, followed on horseback. As they approached the Schiavonia gate into Forlì, Feo was cut off from the others by the conspirators, stabbed and beaten to death. Sforza escaped to the safety of Ravaldino. Giovanni Antonio Ghetti thought he would be regarded as a liberator of the city, but Caterina Sforza responded swiftly to avenge Feo's murder. Thirty-eight people were executed for the crime - including Ghetti and his wife and children - and many others imprisoned or exiled.Leone Cobelli, who witnessed the events, recorded these numbers in his book, Cronache Forlivesi. Giacomo Feo was laid to rest in the Church of San Girolamo in Forlì.

It is in length. The stream flows through Wolf Township, Muncy Township, and Muncy Creek Township. The stream's watershed has an area of 10.8 square miles. Slightly over two million pounds of sediment flow through the stream every year. A fort existed near Wolf Run for several hundred years until the late 1800s or early 1900s. At least three bridges cross the stream. ==Course== Wolf Run looking downstream Wolf Run begins near the western border of Wolf Township, between Roundtop and Long Hill. It flows southwards inside a valley and turns southeast after some distance and then turns south again. In the southern part of Wolf Township, the stream leaves the valley, flows under U.S. Route 220, and turns southwest, exiting Wolf Township and entering Muncy Township. It gradually turns west and passes near the community of Pennsdale before turning south. Near the border of the township, the stream crosses under Interstate 180 and enters Muncy Creek Township. The stream turns west and then south again to parallel the West Branch Susquehanna River. Near the borough of Muncy, it reaches its confluence with Muncy Creek, very near to Muncy Creek's confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River. Wolf Run joins Muncy Creek upstream of its mouth. ==Hydrology== Wolf Run experiences siltation and also experiences stream bank erosion. The annual load of sediment flowing through Wolf Run is . A load of of sediment per year comes from croplands, comes from stream banks, comes from forests, and comes from hay or pastures. per year comes from what is classified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as \\"low- intensity development\\" and per year comes from what is classified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as \\"transition\\". A sediment load of per year comes from the watershed's coal mines and none comes from the watershed's wetlands. ==Geology and geography== The lowest parts of the Wolf Run watershed are approximately above sea level. The highest parts of the watershed are approximately above sea level. The entire watershed is in the ridge and valley geographic region. Of the rock in the Wolf Run watershed, 50 percent is interbedded sedimentary rock, 30 percent is sandstone, 15 percent is shale, and 5 percent consists of carbonate rocks. ==Watershed== The Wolf Run watershed has an area of and a total of of streams. 63.1 percent of the watershed is forested land and 27.7 percent is agricultural land. 8.5 percent is considered \\"low-intensity development\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 0.5 percent is occupied by coal mines, and 0.1 percent is occupied by wetlands. ==History== A fortification made of earth known as the \\"Ancient Fortification\\" was built at least several hundred years ago on Wolf Run, less than north of Muncy Creek. John Franklin Meginness stated in the late 1800s that it was under 300 to 500 years old. The fortification was square and situated in an east-to-west alignment. It enclosed about an acre of land. It had been the subject of much discussion in the early 20th century. It had already been deserted for a long period of time and was in a state of decay when Conrad Weiser reached the area on March 21, 1737. The historian John Franklin Meginness has stated that it is possible that Étienne Brûlé, a Frenchman, visited an area near Wolf Run as early as 1615, but this is not certain. The Genesee Road, which was opened in the early 1800s and ran from Muncy to the Genesee River, passed by Wolf Run. A stone gristmill was once built on the stream by William Ellis. In the 1800s or early 1900s, a railroad was built near Wolf Run and it passed over the Ancient Fortification. During the construction of the railroad at this location, several artifacts, including a piece of Indian pottery, were found. Charcoal and other evidence of ancient fires were also found near Wolf Run during the construction of the railroad. In the late 1800s, the Cogan House school was located on Wolf Run. Wolf Run is named for the relatively large number of wolves that historically lived near the stream. In 2013, Lycoming County rehabilitated the U.S. Route 220 bridge over Wolf Run at a cost of $770,000. Two other bridges over the stream were repaired in the same year for a cost of slightly over $1 million each. ==Biology== Wolf Run has been designated a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Parts of the stream do not have a riparian buffer. In a book dated to 1909, Edward A. Straub wrote that there were large catfish and eels lived in Wolf Run. A white oak tree with a trunk circumference of over historically grew near Wolf Run, on the Adlum Farm.

Historically, it was the main seat of the Wiśniowiecki princely family which takes its name from this castle. ==History== In 1395 landlord Dmitry Koribut having been removed from power in Novgorod-Siversky attained instead great dominion of Volyn' lands, where under his leadership fortress construction began. This is how on the banks of Horin' River in the town of Vyshnivets', Old Vyshnivets' today, first castle came about. Upon Dmitry Koribut's death due to absence a successor of male gender, castle of Vyshnivets' all together with the estate passes through Olgerdovich- Nesvitsky sidelong lineage of three generations till Michał Zbaraski Wiśniowiecki gaining power (1517). Following immediate raid of Turk-Tatar forces in 1491 razed the fort post in the town of Stary Vishnivets and settlement that had been secured by it. In a result the same year landlord Michał Zbaraski, having taken a different name of Wiśniowiecki, broke the ground for another fort-post up the stream on the crest of round hill, and new fastness destined to be a bulwark and vindicator for new generations from Tatar-Turkish inroads for centuries to come. Latest architectural view as a defense fortification the stronghold took having been completely reconstructed in 1640s, when Jeremi Wiśniowiecki supervised the work. The features of defensive bastion system was taken upon at that time, although it hadn't done much saving the castle from Cossacks' capturing during uprising of 1648 and being sacked by Tatars a year later following signing of Treaty of Zboriv. Despite the use of the most advanced martial fortification technique, Vyishnivets surrendered to enemy inroads: formerly in 1655 to the swords of Tatar, then more recently twenty years later in 1675 during the Second Polish- Ottoman War to Turks turning into a ruin. In the course of the tumultuous 17th century, the town and the castle stood destroyed as the king of Poland, John III Sobieski, relieved the city from its taxation burden for twenty years. Michał Serwacy Wiśniowiecki (1680–1744), last descendant of Wiśniowiecki family by father's line, a wealthy Polish nobleman, broached revival of patrimonial estate. He raised not a castle, but a magnificent accomplished palace atop of extinguished cinders completing it in 1720. Nonetheless it did retain a role of combat structure. Garrison was dislocated there until 1760. Somewhat later on appeared indefeasible attributes of magnate wealth of a castle church and grand park. The death of last male member of Wiśniowiecki family caused palace and estate in the city of Vyshnivets ownership being transferred by female line to Mniszech family under their care and supervision of whom castle had revealed all of its beauty adding another facet to the palettes of European palace and park recreation art. For three generations Mniszechs owners (Jan Karol (1716–1759), Michał Jerzy (1748–1806), and Karol Filip (1794–1846)) rendered the estate true royal charm: painting collection of Wiśniowieccy, Potoccy, Sanguszkowie, Czartoryscy as well as Ostrogscy's, sculptures, retro furniture, Holland tile mantles, literature, weapon, cutlery and china. All-round upgrade in the same time had only given final accord to the appearance of Volyn' nicest palace residence. No sooner remaining owner of Mnisheks four years later having succeeded into patrimonial rights as he had to leave to France bringing along most valuable family relics which was two thousands books, family portraits, letters, heraldry researches. In the same time Vyshnivets palace for many years became a place of bargaining trade off where many previously thoughtfully and mindfully collected items were sold out, all that a laymen would be happy to pay cash for. For more than sixty years (1852–1913) castle changed nine owners, that despite their titles and social status used one of the most lavish European palaces as the mean to accrue their perpetually depleting banking accounts. Palace lost its glamour, and priceless collection was sacked. During the time before First World War an attempt made by yet another owner, Volyn' aristocrat and nobleman Demidov, Pavel Oleksandrovich (1869–1935), and Kyiv architect, Władysław Horodecki (1863–1930) was invited to join the cause. Unfortunately, war and revolution introduced its own adjustments: 25th Russian Army Corps utilized facilities followed by ministry of transitional government and Petlura lieutenants. In the mid-1920s, the main building of Vyshnivets Palace accommodated a museum collection, while the remaining space was utilized as a school of craftsmanship. Second World War became a venue and an argumentation for most recent forgoers shipping remains of the valuables to Moscow (1940–1941), and German Armed Forces used it as a police precinct and Gestapo (1941–1944) depriving architectural structure from those few showpieces still being there. Fire on the premises (1944) completed started ruination. Post-war restoration of 1950th practically all together renewed outer appearance of the palace with only few back draws needed to be mentioned as inside facility remodeling performed, outside park area hadn't been worked on, palace yard grew with self-disseminated weeds, and plundering by local residents had taken place. Only in 1963 Vyshnivets Palace recognized by authorities as monument of architectural art, although it still was being utilized for various business transactions and occupied as a club, a library, an apparel factory, and a school of craftsmanship. Having Ukrainian Independence established reflecting soundly on its fortune: in 1993 there was historical and cultural researches conducted, castle officially became a branch of State Historic Architectural Sanctuary in the city of Zbarazh (1999). Later on it was included into the registry of National Sanctuary of Ternopil' Castle (2005), program of restoration and intended usage (2005–2011) started, all none-associated business entities left the premises (2007).

Antipsychotics ( neuroleptics or tranquilizers) were investigated by the anesthesiologists De Castro and Mundeleer who coined the term neuroleptanalgesia, an anesthetic process that involves combining a major neuroleptic tranquilizer/antipsychotic with a potent opioid analgesic to produce a detached, pain-free state. This technique was widely used from the 1960s onwards, initially using a combination of phenoperidine and haloperidol, which was subsequently replaced in the early 1980s by a combination of fentanyl and droperidol. Efforts were also made to develop compounds which combined both types of activity in a single molecule. Neuroleptanalgesia results in amnesia among some patients, but not all. The technique has become less popular with the advent of more modern procedural sedation drug combinations, though it is still rarely used today as a combination of 2.5 mg droperidol and 50 μg (micrograms) of fentanyl in a ratio of 50:1. This combination is characterized by immobility, analgesia, and variable amnesia.Edmond I Eger II, Lawrence Saidman, Rod Westhorpe. The Wondrous Story of Anesthesia.

He graduated in 1992 from Texas A&M; University in College Station and thereafter obtained a certificate of ranch management from Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. He raises cattle and leases his land during spring and autumn to hunters. His Tonkaway Ranch is especially known for quail hunting and trapshooting. Kacal and his wife, Marci, have two children, a son, Carter, and a daughter, Kendall, who attend the private Allen Academy in Bryan, the city adjacent to College Station. Kacal is a trustee of Allen Academy. The Kacals are active in St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in College Station. Kacal is a former salesman for Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Company in College Station. He is a member of the Brazos Valley Farm Bureau. ==Political life== Kacal ran for the legislature in 2012, when the one-term Republican incumbent James E. White, an African American, declined to seek reelection in the revised District 12. Instead White won reelection in the mostly rural District 19. Kacal won the Republican runoff election on July 31, 2012, when he narrowly defeated Tucker Anderson (born 1977) of College Station, 4,230 (50.9 percent) to 4,084 (49.1 percent). In the general election, Kacal defeated Democrat Robert Stem, 28,762 (56.9 percent) to 21,793 (43.1 percent). Representative Kacal is a member of two House committees: Agriculture & Livestock and Environmental Regulation, both affiliated with his particular areas of expertise. In his first legislative session in 2013, Rep. Kacal focused the bills that he authored on his areas of personal knowledge which include Agriculture and Conservation. A few examples include: HB2311 which limited the authority of the Texas Animal Health Commission to create burdensome policies while also maintain their ability to respond to disease outbreak; HB 2312 which created a structure for a Texas Beef Check-off program, a program that would later be started by a referendum of cattle producers in the state; and HB 1182 which required state agencies to create their own goals for reduction in use of natural resources including water. On one of the most visible pieces of legislation, HB 2, Rep. Kacal voted along with the Republicans to increase abortion restrictions as well as measures that restricted doctors from performing abortion facilities. In 2016, the Texas law was struck down by the United States Supreme Court as unconstitutional.http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/27/politics/supreme-court- abortion-texas/ Due to his support of these issues, Kacal's re-election would later be endorsed by anti-abortion organizations, including Texas Alliance for Life, Life PAC, and the Texas Right to Life, which scored Rep. Kacal at 109 on their scorecard. Kacal supported a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73–58. Kacal supported legislation to provide marshals for school security. He did not vote regarding the immunization of minors without parental consent, a measure which the House nevertheless approved, 71–61. He co-sponsored the law to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. Kacal did not vote on the measure to prohibit texting while driving. He voted to require drug testing for those receiving unemployment compensation. He voted against an \\"equal pay for women\\" measure, which passed the House, 78–61. He voted to forbid the state from enforcing federal regulations of firearms and in support of another law allowing college and university officials to carry concealed weapons. He voted for the redistricting bills for the state House, the Texas Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. In the primary election on March 4, 2014, Kacal, in his bid for a second term, handily defeated a former opponent from the 2012 primary, Timothy Allen Delasandro (born 1968) of College Station, who had polled 12 percent of the ballots cast in the earlier contest. Kacal in 2014 received 7,492 votes (76.3 percent) to Delasandro's 2,328 (23.7 percent). Kacal won his fourth legislative term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 33,003 votes (67.6 percent), he defeated Democrat Marianne Arnold, who polled 15,828 votes (32.4 percent). ==References * Campaign website * State legislative page * Kyle Kacal at the Texas Tribune Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:People from Pearland, Texas Category:People from College Station, Texas Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Texas Christian University alumni Category:School board members in Texas Category:Ranchers from Texas Category:American Roman Catholics Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Catholics from Texas ","title":"Kyle Kacal"},{"id":"42029966","text":"The music video for recording artist Janet Jackson's single \\"Rhythm Nation\\" was directed by Dominic Sena. It was filmed as part of the long-form video Rhythm Nation 1814 Film at a power plant located in Pasadena, California. The video is notable for its \\"post-apocalyptic\\" warehouse setting, the unisex black military-style uniforms in which Jackson and her dancers were outfitted, and its choreography, considered to \\"set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and aughts.\\" The video's outfit has received various tributes, being displayed at Walt Disney World theme park, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's \\"Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power\\" exhibit, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. A wax figure of Jackson wearing the outfit was also included in Madame Tussaud's exhibits in Hollywood and New York City, as well as Tussaud's Rock Circus exhibit in London. The song and choreography is also a mainstay at talent shows worldwide, and has been performed at The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent, and America's Best Dance Crew, with an Australian music show also named after the song. Various actors and choreographers, including Wade Robson and Travis Payne, have cited Jackson and the \\"Rhythm Nation\\" routine as a primary influence to their careers. It won multiple accolades, including MTV's Video Vanguard Award for Jackson's impact on entertainment. Entertainment Weekly considered the video \\"legendary,\\" and Rolling Stone included it in a list of 10 Favorite Dancing Musicians, calling Jackson \\"a brilliant dancer\\" whom it said had \\"arguably had a greater long- term impact on the choreography of contemporary music videos\\" even than her own brother Michael Jackson had had. The publication also titled it \\"the gold standard for dystopian dance pop music videos,\\" featuring \\"some of the most memorable choreography in pop video history.\\" The Los Angeles Times considered Janet's choreography to be \\"even more enthralling\\" than those of her contemporaries. ==Music video== The black-and-white, military-inspired \\"Rhythm Nation\\" video was directed by Dominic Sena in August 1989. It was the finale in the Rhythm Nation 1814 Film, following videos for \\"Miss You Much\\" and \\"The Knowledge\\", respectively. Known for its high-octane choreography in an abandoned factory, the video won an award for Best Choreography and was nominated for Best Dance Video at the MTV Video Music Awards, where Jackson also received the MTV Video Vanguard Award. \\"Rhythm Nation\\" ranked at thirty- seven on VH1's \\"Greatest 100 Videos\\" and forty-four on MTV's \\"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\\". The video features a young Tyrin Turner. The success of \\"Rhythm Nation\\" allowed Sena to direct such subsequent films as Swordfish, Gone in 60 Seconds, and Season of the Witch. ==Development== The \\"Rhythm Nation\\" video was filmed simultaneously with \\"Miss You Much\\" and \\"The Knowledge,\\" which were later combined to form the long-form music video Rhythm Nation 1814 Film. The video was filmed over a period of twenty days at the Pasadena Power Plant in Pasadena, California, and served as the finale in the series. Speaking to MTV, Jackson said, \\"I knew who I wanted to direct ’Rhythm Nation,’ that was simple: Dominic Sena. After working with him on ’Let's Wait Awhile,’ I absolutely fell in love with him. [...] Dominic understood story, and he could put onscreen, from front to back, the whole picture you had in your head.\\" Deciphering the video's scenery, Jackson explained, \\"the foggy, smoky street and the dark, black-and-white tone, that was all intentional. When you've done a lot of videos, it can be difficult to keep it fresh and new. You have to try something you've never done, in fear of looking like something you've already created.\\" The video was shot in black-and-white to locate everybody's skin tone within shades of grey, portraying the Rhythm Nations slogan: \\"We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rif of color-lines.\\"The Face Magazine, 1990. Page 77 \\"There were so many races in that video, from Black to White and all the shades of gray in between. Black-and-white photography shows all those shades, and that's why we used it,\\" said Jackson.Ebony, February 1990. Page 50 \\"We're living in a very visual time right now,\\" Jackson explains. \\"That's why videos are so important. Before, they really weren't. They play such an important part in the music business. The next is the live show. But the first they ever see of you is the video.\\"British Vogue, 1990. Page 578 Describing Jackson on the set of the video, journalist David Ritz said \\"Janet Jackson's mood seems retiring, but underneath, like so much else about her, there's more than meets the eye. For hours she obliges the camera during a grueling photography session on a sun-soaked day at the Pasadena Power Plant, a central locale for her black-and-white-dance video, a mysterious and metaphorical work dramatizing the concerns of Rhythm Nation.\\" Jackson's clothes were considered to reflect \\"a quiet sadness,\\" being \\"cooperative to a fault, yet inwardly shy.\\"Essence Magazine, March 1990. Page 54 Jackson was often questioned for her black attire and uniforms, saying \\"A lady came up to me and asked, 'Why do you always wear so much black? Is it because it is slimming?'\\" \\"Wearing black shows that for once that you can represent something positive and not negative,\\" she emphasized, and offered harsh words for those who equate negativity with the color black, referring to the day the stock market crashed being known as \\"Black Monday\\". Jackson responds. Jackson recalled being hurt over the comments of an African-American critic who considered her black attire \\"drab,\\" saying \\"He's been brainwashed because he can't see what I'm trying to show - and that hurt me so bad. I would hope that everyone will understand that for once black represents something good.\\" \\"That's why I decided the color scheme for Rhythm Nation - the costumes, the cover art, the overall feeling - would be positively, uncompromisingly Black.\\" Several label executives reportedly told Jackson the album and video wouldn't have \\"crossover\\" appeal. With Jackson's persistence, the video became \\"the most far-reaching single project the company has ever attempted.\\" In a later interview, Jackson said \\"The concept basically was very industrial black and white, not wanting any color brought to it\\" - \\"no color lines is was it was, so everyone is all somewhat of the same kind of tone.\\" \\"Dominic Sena directed it, it was a twenty day shoot. A lot of work, long hours.\\"http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/213453/on-the-rhythm-nation-video.jhtml On 'The 'Rhythm Nation' Video' Sena commented \\"She's always out there trying to give people something different and fresh, and exciting to look at. If it's been done before she doesn't want anything to do with it, it's like 'let's start over'. Part of the reason she gravitated toward a new choreographer this time, a young guy who hadn't had that much experience, an amazing street dancer, and they developed a rapport and she said 'nobody's seen this guy's stuff before, I'll work with him. We'll develop these steps and give people something fresh to look at.\\"Making of \\"Rhythm Nation\\", Rhythm Nation 1814 Film release ==Choreography== The video's choreography has been considered one of the most recognizable and imitated routines in pop culture. Co-choreographer Anthony Thomas said, \\"she's not a trained dancer/ It comes from her soul. She's a natural. She's unbelievable.\\" Rolling Stone included the video in a list of \\"10 Favorite Dancing Musicians\\", calling Jackson \\"a brilliant dancer\\" who has \\"arguably had a greater long-term impact on the choreography of contemporary music videos\\" than Michael Jackson, setting a format for \\"hundreds\\" of subsequent videos. The publication said \\"Jackson leads what appears to be a hip paramilitary organization through some of the most memorable choreography in pop video history.\\" The publication also exclaimed Jackson's \\"dazzling dancing\\" and the \\"can-humans-really-do-that? choreography\\" in the video \\"is on a par with, and may even top, the best of brother Michael's hoof-happy videos\\", commending her \\"lightning speed\\". Billboard commented \\"Ms. Jackson and her crew put on their military jackets and did the finely choreographed routine that fans everywhere wore out countless VHS tapes rewinding to memorize.\\" Sweat, Tears, and Jazz Hands author Mike Weaver commended the video's impact on choreography, declaring \\"praised for its probing lyrics and video and production innovation, made her recognized and respected dancer and performer in the industry. Janet Jackson and her crew's innovative, one-of-a-kind, funk-and-groove choreography was unlike anything seen in the history of pop music. [...] By the early '90s, every show choir and every hiphop dancer wanted to cut and paste parts and pieces of the Rhythm Nation production into their set.\\" The book Gender and Qualitative Methods suggested the routine represents \\"self-control and military discipline\\" - \\"they move in unison and in the same rhythm, dancing like roots, with stiff square arm movements,\\" also exhibiting Asian martial arts. The Orlando Sentinel regarded Jackson to portray \\"Swiss-watch precision\\" in the routine. Slant Magazine said the clip \\"anointed Janet the ambassador of intricately choreographed,\\" being among \\"the most intricately and powerfully choreographed music videos of all time.\\" The Guardian said the routine was \\"made famous by its memorably routine- infested video,\\" described as \\"an aerobic goose step\\" by The New York Times. BET ranked the video as having the \\"Best Dance Moves in a Music Video\\" in 2013, commenting \\"the dance moves — from the finger count down to the standing split — were as crisp as the uniforms.\\" Geico also noted The Running Man dance gained fame through the video. Another critique stated \\"most of the video consists of Jackson with background dancers performing a synchronized dance routine. Judging by the serious facial expressions and vigorous body movements of Jackson and her dancers, the men and women in “Rhythm Nation” are confident, courageous, and display unmatched conviction.\\" Jackson and her dancers were analyzed to \\"march toward the camera in a dominating manner\\" while simultaneously \\"performing moves that most humans couldn’t accomplish without a personal trainer and lots of free time on their hands.\\" A brief scene potentially depicting sexuality in the video's choreography was also debated, though the video was ultimately praised for its depiction of social themes, explaining \\"Although there are no sexually explicit lyrics or messages in “Rhythm Nation” that would be obvious to audiences, there is a short scene two minutes and thirty eight seconds into the music video that is somewhat sexual. [...] Instead of using sexual elements to attract audiences, it portrays the strong bond between entertainers and social activists with a common goal.\\" ==Outfit== The outfit worn for the video and performances of the song is infamous in popular culture. Jackson's appearance includes \\"a fearless red-lipped pout and long black ponytail,\\" along with \\"a black baseball hat with a metal \\"1814\\" applique, a black military-style shirt jacket with silver buckles and faux leather straps and collar, black belted pants and chunky, strappy boots.\\" Another analysis observed Jackson and her dancers \\"dressed in black, cadet- style costumes that cover the entire body except the face.\\" A biography of Jackson stated she attempted her performances to \\"center around her and her dancers, who would act as \\"soldiers\\" in a kind of army of reformers. Her outfit was a dark, buttonedup uniform, and she moved in tight formation with her dancers.\\" The New York Times also said the clip \\"stars Ms. Jackson buttoned up tight in a tailored uniform, with an Army issue coat, epaulets and combat boots.\\" An additional anecdote from the publication noted \\"Ms. Jackson, done up in black military-inspired garb, was eager to rail against societal ills like racism and domestic abuse.\\" Jackson performing \\"Rhythm Nation\\" on the Number Ones, Up Close and Personal tour, 2011. Chris Ryan of MTV praised Jackson's look as trendsetting, saying \\"Janet took her place at the top of the trendsetting heap.\\" MTV's Rebecca Thomas also commented Jackson \\"made a signature of dangling-key earrings, boxy black hats and suits adorned in gold hardware\\". Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of MTV Style spoke about its influence, recalling that \\"everyone wanted to dress like her\\" and dance classes would \\"dedicate hours\\" to the video's choreography; \\"she had her own personal Rhythm Nation hardware and bondage straps; I can't figure out or remember if she predated the Boy London hardware caps, but both were around the same time, and she was influential enough that it's not unlikely her steez gave them the idea.\\" An additional critique regarded the video's wardrobe \\"intimidating\\" and \\"uniform fetish,\\" likened to \\"some type of dark-ops cadet corps.\\" Other aspects of Jackson's ensemble in the clip are also regarded as influential. Essence also praised Jackson as a trendsetter, commenting \\"she started her own movement with the hoop earrings with the solo key.\\" Retail outlet Karmaloop called Jackson's snapback hat \\"80s signature style\\", selling a hat based on Jackson's. MTV credited the hat worn in the video as one of the reasons for the snapback hat's revival in popularity. In 2011, Entertainment Weekly included the outfit at number nineteen on a list of 50 Stars Who Rocked Fashion, commenting Jackson adopted a \\"crisp military look for the ladies — with epaulets, cadet caps, fierce tailoring.\\" In 2013, Lucky Magazine ranked the video among \\"The 18 Most Stylishly Influential Music Videos of All Time\\". The same year, Cosmopolitan listed \\"Rhythm Nation\\" among the \\"10 Most Iconic Music Video Looks of the 80s\\". In 2013, Alexander Fury of The Independent called Jackson a \\"style icon\\", exclaiming \\"the artwork created with Eighties illustrator Tony Viramontes for Control stands the test of time, as does the video for 1989's \\"Rhythm Nation\\", adding he was \\"obsessed\\" with the video's \\"get-up of quasi-military uniform accessorised with a single key on a hoop earring.\\" Fury also said Jackson \\"deserves a place in the fashion hall of fame\\". ==Themes== The themes of unity among the dancers and various ethnicities, as well as gender equality, has received praise from critics. Slant Magazine observed \\"The solidarity of Janet Jackson's multi-racial Rhythm Nation dancers is evoked with hyper-synchronized movements while their individuality is expressed via their separate, distinct dances.\\" The New York Times praised Jackson as a feminist, proclaiming \\"although most female characters on MTV are still reclining, swept off their feet by the fantasies of self-serving musicians and video directors, more singers are getting up and standing on their own two feet. You only have to catch Janet Jackson's hit, Rhythm Nation to be convinced that a change has taken place,\\" calling it \\"a far cry from the lascivious bodies in various states of undress that flood the channel.\\" 34th Street Magazine applauded the video's implication of gender neutrality, saying \\"“Rhythm Nation” makes a far superior statement on the fluidity of gender. In this video, men and women dress and dance identically and no one’s really sexualized. Everyone just knows how to move. In other words, sometimes the best way to send a positive message is not to try so damn hard.\\" The clip's theme of activism and leadership was also commended, writing \\"instead of using sexual elements to attract audiences, it portrays the strong bond between entertainers and social activists with a common goal,\\" in an attempt to speaks \\"particularly to young people and encourages them to be the leaders of tomorrow. Jackson passes on the message of social activist Mahatma Gandhi who once said, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\\" A biography stated the video spreads \\"a message of love that was neither naive not superficial.\\" The video features dancers of \\"African-American, Caucasian, and Asian ancestry,\\" aiding Jackson in becoming known for \\"breaking existing racial stereotypes specifically toward African-American women,\\" depicting her as a \\"socially responsible citizen with dignity and grace.\\" The backing dancers in the video were thought to represent \\"social activists\\", shrouded by \\"empty surroundings\\" deciphered as \\"the indifferent attitudes in society.\\" Jackson and her dancers were considered \\"confident, courageous,\\" and displaying \\"unmatched conviction\\". The video was used as an example of \\"positive gender performance of black women in a music video\\" in the book Gender and Qualitative Methods, considered to produce \\"a new kind of desire and a new position for a female viewer (and listener).\\" The video's director was noted to construct Jackson as \\"a creative, intelligent professional, someone who aims at promoting the status of black people, especially women.\\" Dressed in identical uniforms, Jackson and the dancers \\"move in unison and in the same rhythm, dancing like roots, with stiff square arm movements. ... Jackson is also dressed in a uniform and is performing asexually and almost anonymously in front of, but as one of the members of the group.\\" The video was also one of the only popular music videos considered suitable to be broadcast to US troops in Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf due to religious restrictions on the portrayal of female sexuality. Commenting on the situation, VH1 executive Jackie Sharp said \\"It's the perfect women's video, because they're all buttoned up to the neck and nobody touches\\". ==Long-form music video== The full-length music video, known as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Film, consists of the videos for \\"Miss You Much\\", \\"The Knowledge\\", and \\"Rhythm Nation\\", filmed simultaneously over a period of twenty days. It received a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. The video premiered in full on September 16, 1989 on MTV to high ratings, and was aired several times the following week. Producer Jimmy Jam said \\"The concept for the half-hour, long-form video was already in the works when we recorded the album. Janet's choreographer was here, so we knew what the steps were going to be for the songs, how the story would be treated, and how the video was going to look. [...] We actually tried to make the album sound a little like the black-and-white images in the video, rather than adapting the video to the album. A lot of the music was treated almost as soundtrack.\\"Keyboard, May 1990. Pages 26-27 While filming \\"The Knowledge\\", Jackson collapsed from exhaustion after filming for over 25 consecutive hours, explaining \\"That's the one area where I must be careful. Sometimes I won't sleep, won't stop reviewing, won't stop searching for ways to improve the projects. The projects absorb me. When we were filming the long video, I actually collapsed.\\"Essence Magazine, March 1990. Page 116 Describing the situation, journalist David Ritz, who attended the video's filming, commented \\"Looking at \\"The Knowledge,\\" it appears that Janet's physical breakdown came at the emotional climax of the video. \\"Prejudice, no!\\" she cries, kicking and smashing windows with the anger of a soul possessed. \\"Ignorance, no! Bigotry, no! Illiteracy, no!\\" she bemoans, before falling onto the ledge of the roof, dangerously positioned on the edge, ominous clouds of change racing overhead.\\" ==Legacy== The \\"Rhythm Nation\\" video received favorable reviews from critics and journalists, focusing on its theme of unity and choreography. Comparing Lady Gaga to Jackson, Kyle Anderson of MTV News described it as \\"the clip that sent Jackson into the stratosphere as an envelope-pushing pop star.\\" Entertainment Weekly called the video \\"legendary,\\" and Rolling Stone included it in a list of \\"10 Favorite Dancing Musicians,\\" calling Jackson \\"a brilliant dancer\\" who has \\"arguably had a greater long-term impact on the choreography of contemporary music videos\\" than Michael Jackson. The publication added the video \\"set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and aughts.\\" It was also included in a list of the \\"Ten Best Apocalyptic Dance Music Videos\\" in 2011, heralded as \\"the gold standard for dystopian dance pop music videos\\" which features \\"some of the most memorable choreography in pop video history.\\" The Sun Sentinel called it \\"dark, futuristic,\\" and \\"unforgettable,\\" adding \\"No one can witness the militaristic precision of Rhythm Nation, which gives the impression that a really angry pep squad has taken over the dance floor, and not see how Janet's style has been sampled, borrowed and stolen over and over ... and over.\\" In 2013, Cosmopolitan listed it among the \\"10 Most Iconic Music Video Looks of the 80s\\", saying \\"How do you step out from behind the shadow of the world’s biggest pop star? You strap on some black, wear a key as an earring and dance like you’re going to war. Janet is a style General and all the rest better fall in line.\\" Slant Magazine ranked the video among the \\"100 Greatest Music Videos\\", calling the \\"stunning, monochromatic\\" video it \\"one of the most intricately and powerfully choreographed music videos of all time,\\" saying \\"the solidarity of Janet Jackson's multi-racial Rhythm Nation dancers is evoked with hyper-synchronized movements while their individuality is expressed via their separate, distinct dances.\\" The publication observed Jackson \\"saw dance as a movement in both senses of the word: an athletic extension of ones own socio-political force of will,\\" as well as a \\"obliterator of races, genders, creeds,\\" calling for a \\"Zen-like transcendence of self.\\" The publication also stated, \\"if the song's music video inadvertently recalled the spirit of Leni Riefenstahl, its vision of unity through mandatory multiculturalism reverses the Nazi demagogue's ideology.\\" Additional commentary said the clip \\"wasn’t the norm for most things in the 80s, let alone a pop music video.\\" Another review considered it \\"groundbreaking\\" and \\"famous for its dynamic choreography in an abandoned factory,\\" exclaiming \\"Fast-paced and bold, viewers become hooked to the catchy tunes and soulful sounds of the groundbreaking dance video.\\" Entertainment Weekly considered it \\"groundbreaking,\\" also \\"striking, timeless and instantly recognizable.\\" Elena Gooray of 34th Street Magazine praised the video's overall theme, concept, and wardrobe, exclaiming \\"Janet’s messages? Justice, togetherness, the power of dance. Those ideas are simple and almost by definition inoffensive. Her use of military themes? Only to inspire her wardrobe and some incredibly synchronized dance routines with bangin’ choreography.\\" Music journalist Richard Croft considered it \\"captivating, saying \\"Anyone with an interest in music videos, dancing, military jackets or nunchucks – you need to see the short film that accompanied ‘Rhythm Nation’. It is incredible, one of the top five music videos ever made.\\" Croft added, \\"I’ve never seen dancing like that in a video, and no matter how many times I see it, I can never look away. It’s captivating. ‘Rhythm Nation’ is the most empowering, come-on-get-up song in the world. They should play it before sporting matches like the national anthem. Yet the lyrics never say that thinking positively and coming together is all we need to do to achieve our goals – there was work to do in 1989, there’s work to do now. No struggle, no progress.\\" Rolling Stone described the full length piece as a \\"mini-musical\\" which \\"told the morality tale of two shoeshine boys who discover the Rhythm Nation.\\" The New York Times stated the plot \\"juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams.\\" Chris Willman of The LA Times considered it \\"ambitious\\" and \\"fun,\\" saying \\"The can- humans-really-do-that? choreography in the three dance numbers is on a par with, and may even top, the best of brother Michael's hoof-happy videos.\\" Willman added, \\"Miss You Much\\" is full of joy and giddy goofiness, and establishes shyly grinning Janet—a real team player in this big production number—as winsome and human after some of her earlier ice-goddess poses. \\"The Knowledge\\" and \\"Rhythm Nation\\" are angrier performances; the former is a bravura solo rooftop dance, with Jackson breaking windows and knocking over objects in rage at the dying of the light. What connects these numbers is an anti-drug story, unfortunately bolstered by the glitziness-among- the-L.A.-ruins imagery of \\"Blade Runner.\\" Director Dominic Sena's \\"slick penchant for neato futuristic grime\\" was also praised, adding \\"the big-bass songs and the dazzling dancing say what the hokey script can't.

Art has been used as a means to record history, shape culture, cultivate imagination, and harness individual and social transformation. It can not only be a means to generate awareness, but it can also be a catalyst to engage community members to take action around a social issue. Social justice art allows people to develop agency to interrupt and alter oppressive systemic patterns or individual behaviors. The processes by which people create and engage with art equips them with analytic tools to understand and challenge social injustices through social justice education (teaching for social justice), community building, and social activism/social movements. Examples of visual and performing social justice art includes: drawing, painting, sculpture, murals, graffiti, film, theater, music, dance, spoken word, etc. Filipino Community Mural ==Background== Art has played a role in social justice education, community building, and social activism/social movements. It provides a universal language that gives voice to individuals and communities and is accessible across social boundaries. These examples can overlap and are not strictly confined to one specific category. ==History== Two well-known art movements that have utilized art as a means to work towards social justice are the Black Arts Movement and Chicano art movement. Both movements began to enter into public consciousness during the 1960s. The Civil Rights Movement in combination with the Black Power Movement helped to propel the Black Arts Movement. One of the main goals of this movement was to support Black Nationalism and mobilize the community towards social action. This period produced an increase in Black poetry, literature, and music. A few key figures of the movement were; author Marcus Garvey, author and artist Charles S. Johnson, revolutionary artist Emory Douglas, and social dancer and choreographer Katrina Hazzard-Gordon. The efforts to incorporate post-Mexican Revolution notions with current Mexican American social, political, and cultural issues drove the Chicana/Chicano Arts Movement. Murals are a form of visual art that experienced a rise in popularity during this movement. Chicana/Chicano mural art became a means of working towards political goals, challenging stereotypes, as well as a way for community members to play an active role in creating community memoirs. Diego Rivera was one prominent figure who helped to establish Mexican muralism. Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals ===Social justice education=== An educational approach that focuses on fostering awareness of social injustices and how inequalities impact youth. Social justice education saw its roots in the ideas of Paulo Freire, author of Pedagogy of the Oppressed. In his work, Freire highlights the theoretical ideas of critical pedagogy, which is an approach that combines education and critical theory. This approach is relevant to social justice art education because it combines the critique of social injustices and the use of art as a mechanism to engage with social issues. Culturally relevant arts education  Culturally relevant arts education (CRAE) is an education model that emerged from Tubman Theater Project. The theater project is a culturally relevant drama program in which African American middle and high school students examine their internalized oppression and work to create positive racial identities. The program gives them the opportunity to learn from rehearsing and performing plays based on their lived experiences. This framework incorporates six different pedagogies. Three of these are art related; arts production, aesthetics, and arts integration as well as three non-art related; multicultural education, critical pedagogy, and contextual teaching and learning. CRAE engages both students and educators in a process in which they reflect on their social position in societal liberation and subjugation. ===In higher education=== Universities have employed social justice art education models within the art department. :University of San Francisco - Performing Arts & Social Justice Majorhttps://www.usfca.edu/arts- sciences/undergraduate-programs/performing-arts/performing-arts-and-social- justice-major :Santa Clara University - Arts for Social Justicehttp://scupresents.org/support-the-arts/special-projects.html :University of Michigan - The Prison Creative Arts Projecthttp://www.lsa.umich.edu/pcap/ ===Community building=== Sense of community is built through bridging geographic or interest-driven relationships. Building community helps individuals come together to challenge inner oppressive dynamics that have been imposed by institutions, structures and bodies. These inner oppressive dynamics have been termed “social ghosts” have been referenced in dance literature and function as a key theme within many community building art projects. Art for community building is a collective effort in which the art making process strengthens community ties. * AIDS Memorial Quilt Aids Quilt * Oral History * Mural Art **The City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program * Dance **Martha Graham Dance Company's 'Political Dance Project' **Karen Jamieson's Carnegie Dance Troupe * Theatre **In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theater **Theater of the Oppressed **The Pride Youth Theater Alliance **People's Theatre Project- Social Change through the Arts * Photovoice **Photovoice Projects **Detroit Youth Passages Photovoice Project *Heidelberg ProjectHeidelberg Project ===Social activism/social movements=== * Black Movement **Amiri Baraka **Black Arts Repertory Theatre * Feminist Movement **Rosie the Riveter *Chicana/Chicano Movement **La Raza **Dia De Los Muertos **Low Rider Art *LGBT Rights and Gay Liberation **AIDS Memorial Quilt **Allen Ginsberg ==References * Music and Social Justice article in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Category:Social justice Category:The arts and politics ","title":"Social justice art"},{"id":"42030030","text":"is a kind of Buddhist temple.

He also remained editor-in-chief of the Amrita Bazar Patrika during the 1940s.Appendix B It is commonly thought that he was killed in a police encounter on August 5, 1971 but till now he was missing in police and state records ==Early life and education== He was born in a land-owning family in Jessore in East Bengal, now in Bangladesh, on 13 March 1914. He studied at the Victoria Collegiate School in Narail, and later graduated from the Scottish Church College in Calcutta in 1936. He subsequently earned his MA In English Literature 1938 from the University of Calcutta.Tribute to Saroj Dutta ==Career== Dutta joined the Amrit Bazar Patrika in early 1940s, after completing his studies, however he was fired in 1949 for joining violent activities as a member of the Communist Party of India. In 1962, after the Sino-Indian War he was briefly arrested for having pro-China (Maoist) sympathies. In 1964 he joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPI(M), and was an editor of their paper, Swadhinata, along with Sushital Ray Chowdhary. He was among the many radicals who were disillusioned when the CPI(M) decided to join electoral politics in the run-up to the 1967 elections. Attracted to a more radical form of revolutionary Marxism, he along with Sushital Ray Chowdhury and some other Calcutta intellectuals, supported the Charu Majumdar-led Naxalbari uprising in May 1967. In April 1969, he was also one of the founder members of Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist), CPI (ML), an organisation which was outlawed a year later for conducting armed guerrilla warfare targeted at the landlords and the police. Saroj Datta, along with Charu Majumdar, became one of the most wanted men in Bengal. ==Death== Police Arrested Dutta from his friend Debiprasad Chattapadhyaya's home on the night of August 4–5, 1971. It is stated that he was killed by the Kolkata Police on the Aryan Club grounds in the Maidan (Kolkata) that very morning. It is also said that the movie star Uttam Kumar witnessed the shooting while on a morning walk, but talked about it much later when drunk; this is the storyline of the 1994 Bengali-language movie Sopan. Bengali writer Dibyandu Palit also portrayed the incident in his novel 'Sahajoddha'. In 1977, after the CPI(M) returned to power with a Left-front majority, many Naxalite sympathisers signed on a petition seeking an investigation of Saroj Dutta's death. The petition was given to the chief minister Jyoti Basu. However, no investigation has ever been held. His comrade, Charu Majumdar died in police custody a year later. == Film == A feature-length documentary film, S.D. : Saroj Dutta and His Times, directed by Kasturi Basu and Mitali Biswas in 2018, featured Saroj Dutta's journey as a poet, journalist, translator, ideologue and revolutionary. The film contains the only on-camera interviews of two eyewitnesses - Debiprasad Chattopadhyay and Manjusha Chattopadhyay - of Saroj Dutta's abduction and disappearance by the Kolkata Police. ==References== Category:Indian communists Category:Maoist theorists Category:1914 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Naxalite–Maoist insurgency Category:Indian newspaper editors Category:People from Jessore District Category:History of Kolkata Category:Extrajudicial killings Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in India Category:Scottish Church College alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni ","title":"Saroj Dutta"},{"id":"42030093","text":"The women's Taijiquan / Taijijian all-round competition at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China was held on 15 November at the Nansha Gymnasium. ==Schedule== All times are China Standard Time (UTC+08:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  rowspan=2Monday, 15 November 2010  10:00  Taijijian -  16:00  bgcolor=ffffccTaijiquan } ==Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Taijijian !width=80Taijiquan !width=80Total -  align=left9.679.6919.36 -  align=left9.679.6719.34 -  align=left9.659.6819.33 - 4 align=left9.649.6319.27 - 5 align=left9.569.6619.22 - 6 align=left9.679.4319.10 - 7 align=left9.579.4619.03 - 8 align=left9.279.6618.93 - 9 align=left9.509.2718.77 - 10 align=left9.279.4318.70 - 11 align=left8.288.5816.86 - 12 align=left7.907.5015.40 } ==References== *Results ==External links== *Official website Women's taijiquan ","title":"Wushu at the 2010 Asian Games – Women's taijiquan"},{"id":"42030117","text":"Attack Squadron 15 (VA-15), nicknamed the Valions, was an aviation unit of the United States Navy.

He attended schools in Chicago and the Riverdale Country School in New York. He graduated from Harvard University magna cum laude in 1930. ==Career== Upon graduation, Despres went to work for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a special foreign exchange analyst. He established a system for monitoring the volatile international flows of short-term capital during the Great Depression. He supported expansionary policy. He was among the advisors who early warned that Hjalmar Schacht's system of exchange controls would help Germany carry through economic recovery and military rearmament without suffering a balance of payments collapse. In 1937, Despres returned to Harvard as a consultant in the Graduate School Public Administration. In 1939, Despres served as Economic Advisor to the chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve System.

In August 1947, Despres again \\"testified emphatically\\" for Marzani's loyalty before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. During the McCarthy era, Despres was among a number of Federal employees alleged to be sources of information to the communist underground, including Lauchlin Currie, Harry Dexter White, V. Frank Coe, Robert C. Barnard, George A. Eddy, William Ludwig Ullman, Harold Glasser, Solomon Adler, and William Henry Taylor. Allegations were never substantiated. ==Personal and death== Despres married Joanna Hitt Eakin in 1939 and had three children: Lani, John, and Charles.

It is located north and east of Sandwich Center. Although the area has buildings that date to the middle of the 18th century, most of the district's more than 200 contributing properties are residences built between 1825 and 1860, when the glass company was at its height. These houses are predominantly Cape and Greek Revival in character, and are modest one- and two-family buildings that originally housed glass factory workers. The glassworks in Jarvesville reached their peak of production and employment around the time of the American Civil War. Business began to decline in the 1860s when cheaper fuel sources in the Midwest prompted the relocation of the businesses. Most attempts to continue glassmaking operations were unsuccessful, and the industrial properties were eventually demolished in the 20th century. The residential properties continued to be occupied, often by descendants of the glassworkers, but also by workers employed in other industrial facilities in the area. The only significant commercial properties in the district are located on Jarves Street, which is also where the separately-listed John and Mary Waterman Jarves House is located. This 1857 Italianate house was built by Deming Jarves' son, and designed by Charles Kirk Kirby. The only church in the district is the Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church at 6 Jarves Street; the Romanesque Revival building was constructed in 1901.

Built in 1887 and located off New Hampshire Route 11 west of Andover center, the Town lattice truss bridge is one of New Hampshire's few surviving 19th-century covered bridges, and is relatively little altered since its construction, having had its roof replaced and an abutment reconstructed. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==Description and history== The Bog Bridge spans Pleasant Brook, a tributary of the Blackwater River, just south of where New Hampshire Route 11 crosses the river. The bridge is long and wide, with a span over the brook of , and is clad in vertical planking. The asphalt shingle roof, a replacement made in 1982, is the only major modification to the bridge. The bridge rests on abutments of roughly coursed granite blocks; the eastern abutment is original, without mortar, while the western abutment was damaged in the 1938 New England hurricane and rebuilt with cement mortar. The trusses were at some time reinforced with iron bolts. The bridge is unusual among New Hampshire's covered bridges in that it lacks lateral bracing, which caused the bridge to be slightly tilted for many years. The Town through truss bridge was built in 1887 by local carpenter Prentice C. Atwood. The bridge originally carried Bog Road across Pleasant Brook, but was reduced to foot traffic when the current alignment of New Hampshire Route 11 bypassed it in 1957. Of at least seven documented 19th or early 20th-century covered bridges in the town, it is one of only two that survives (the other is the Keniston Bridge). ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Merrimack County, New Hampshire *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire ==References== Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Bridges completed in 1887 Category:Buildings and structures in Merrimack County, New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges in New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Merrimack County, New Hampshire Category:Andover, New Hampshire Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges in New Hampshire Category:Wooden bridges in New Hampshire Category:Parker truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Bog Bridge"},{"id":"42030482","text":"Symplocos candelabrum is a flowering plant in the sapphireberry family.

He trained probably until 1672 in Amersfoort under the still life and cityscape painter Matthias Withoos, who had previously lived and worked in Rome. He was active in Amersfoort until 1674, the year in which he left for Italy together with Caspar van Wittel, another pupil of Withoos. He is documented in Rome on 3 January 1675. Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Jacob van Staverden was given the bent name Ijver (diligence). He also became close to the ‘Bamboccianti’, a loose group of principally Dutch and Flemish genre painters residing in Rome who took the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside as the preferred subject of their paintings. A watermelon vendor and a young boy In March 1686 and January 1687 he is documented back in Amersfoort. He left again for Rome where he resided from 1689 until his death. In Rome he is recorded as living with Caspar Van Wittel in 1689 and in 1693-94. He entered the service of the Papal Guard in Rome in 1694. According to the early Dutch biographer Jan van Gool the reason for this was that he was not very successful as an artist in Rome. Van Gool also maliciously states that van Staverden was passing himself off as a nobleman in Rome while in fact his father was 'only a common craftsman'.Jacomo Staveren in: Jan van Gool, De nieuwe Schouburg der Nederlantsche Kunstschilders en Schilderessen, 1750–1751, p.466 Jacob van Staverden’s name appears in various documents dated 1706, 1710 and 1712 and 1716 relating to the sale of assets to raise money. His profession is not mentioned in these records. The last record on the artist is dated 1716. It is not known when or where the artist died, although it is assumed he died in Rome. ==Work== Only a small number of paintings of van Staverden are known and then only on the basis of attributions. They are mainly genre paintings in the style of the Bamboccianti.Biographical details on Hadrian Van Gool mentions that van Staverden painted flower and fruit still lifes, but no known examples by his hand in this genre are known today. ==References * Category:1656 births Category:1710s deaths Category:Dutch genre painters Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Members of the Bentvueghels Category:People from Amersfoort ","title":"Jacob van Staverden"},{"id":"42030508","text":"Preljubje () is a village northeast of Lake Prespa in the Resen Municipality of the Republic of Macedonia.

It was built in 1879 for the exclusive use of African-American students, and although the school closed in 1934, the building is the only one of its kind still standing in Brooklyn. It is modest in size, just 46 feet (14 m) wide by 75 feet (23 m) deep, and has an ornate facade in the Romanesque Revival style, principally of red brick with brownstone trim. ==History== The institutional history of the school goes back to the founding, prior to 1841, of the African Free School in the old Town of Williamsburgh, which was consolidated into the City of Brooklyn in 1855. The Brooklyn Board of Education renamed it \\"Colored School #3\\" and continued to run it while pursuing an overall policy of segregated education, even after the State of New York passed a law ostensibly desegregating the state's schools in 1873. By 1879 the school had become overcrowded, and parents petitioned the school board for a new building. Samuel Leonard (1821-1879), who was in charge of school construction in Brooklyn from 1859 to 1879, drew up plans in the Romanesque Revival style that was popular for school buildings at that time. The building, with four classrooms for 220 students, was completed in 1881 at 270 Union Avenue, at a cost of $8,963. Soon after the school's construction, the practice of school segregation in Brooklyn began to change. In 1882, Seth Low, the new mayor of Brooklyn and a reformer, appointed Phillip A. White as the first African-American member of Brooklyn's Board of Education. White, who became the chairman of a committee in charge of the city's \\"colored\\" schools, opposed forced segregation and disliked the term \\"colored school.\\" During White's tenure, African-American students were given the option to attend integrated schools, and Colored School #3 was renamed P.S. 69, making its name consistent with those of integrated schools though it continued to serve an exclusively African-American student body (the other two colored schools were similarly renamed). By 1890, most African-American students chose to enroll in the integrated schools, and the enrollments of the colored schools had begun to decline. In 1898 Brooklyn was consolidated into New York City and the school came under the jurisdiction of the city's Board of Education. In 1901, P.S. 69 ceased to exist as an independent entity due to the declining African-American population of the neighborhood. Its building was used as an annex to other local public schools and as a school named P.S. 191 before being relinquished by the Board of Education in 1934. It was then used by other city agencies before becoming vacant for a period of time. In 1982 the city sold the property, and in 1983 it was purchased by a sculptor, James O. Clark, for use as a private family residence and studio. Clark continues to occupy the building in 2014. It was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1997. ==References== Category:Williamsburg, Brooklyn Category:Public elementary schools in Brooklyn Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in New York City Category:School buildings completed in 1881 Category:African-American history in New York City Category:Defunct schools in New York (state) Category:Historically segregated African-American schools in New York (state) Category:1881 establishments in New York (state) Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Brooklyn ","title":"Colored School No. 3"},{"id":"42030592","text":"Taumarunui railway station in Taumarunui, New Zealand was the main railway station in Taumarunui.

The album debuted at #1 on the Swedish Album Chart on 26 October 2012, with lead single \\"Händerna mot himlen\\" also reaching its peak position of #2 that same date. Inferno was certified Platinum in Sweden for sales of over 40,000 copies. Inferno was nominated for a Swedish Grammis Award in the category Pop of the Year. At the 2014 Grammis Awards, video director Magnus Härdner was nominated for Music Video of the Year for his work on the video to the album's second single, \\"Sanningen\\". ==Background== In 2012, Marklund announced on septembermusic.se that she was recording her first Swedish studio album.News! New album in Swedish  September www.septembermusic.se. In an interview with dn.se, she officially confirmed that the next album would be released under her birth name, Petra Marklund, rather than releasing a fifth September album. She announced that this album would have no trace of her signature dance-pop style, and stated the album would be \\"dark and personal.\\" She also stated that the album would contain influences of pop and hip hop. Upon the announcement of the album, Marklund said \\"it doesn't mean I 'quit' September, it just means I'm gonna do more music. September is on my mind all the time and there will be more in the future!\\" Lead single \\"Händerna mot himlen\\" was released on September 14, 2012. It peaked at #2 and was certified 6x Platinum in Sweden. ==Track listingReviews== scandipop.co.uk stated that the singing is very good, but the production is the big 'wow' factor. They stated, \\"does Inferno sound like those September albums of old that we cherish? No, nothing like it. But does that matter? No, not in the slightest – it’s really very good. Very very good, in fact.\\" Hanna Fahl from DN also complimented the album saying \\"it's a cohesive album, superbly well written, and in some moments it can lift and fly\\" and complimented Marklund for being \\"strong and present\\". However, unlike Scandipop, she believes it is not really a fresh start, but \\"an extension and continuation of September's tearful and desperate \\"Cry for You\\".\\" ==Charts== Inferno debuted at #1 and remained in the Swedish top 50 for 38 weeks. {  - !

He later went on to act as crew chief in Funny Cars races. ==\\"Hawaiian\\" carsTop Fuel Dragsters=== Leong's \\"Hawaiian\\" Top Fuel dragsters swept the National Hot Rod Association's two National Events: the Winternationals at the Pomona Fairgrounds and the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis, two years consecutively, in 1965 and again in 1966. This feat by Leong's entries was accomplished with two different drivers: as Don \\"the Snake\\" Prudhomme in 1965, followed by Mike Snively in 1966. In 1967, Leong failed to three-peat at Pomona or Indianapolis, but did triumph that year at two popular independent drag races, the notoriously fierce March Meet in Bakersfield, and the Hot Rod Magazine Championships in Riverside, CA. ===Funny Cars=== In 1969, abandoned campaigning Top Fuel Dragster in favor of the burgeoning Funny Car class. The following year, with driver Larry Reyes, Leong campaigned a 1970 Dodge Charger AA/Funny Car that won its class at the 1970 NHRA Winternationals. In 1971, Leong's \\"Hawaiian\\" Funny Car repeated at Pomona, winning Funny Car Eliminator again, this time with Butch Maas driving. Throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Leong campaigned a variety of \\"Hawaiian\\" Funny Cars, both in NHRA competition, as well as \\"match racing\\" at smaller, independent tracks. In 1980, having hired Ron Colson to drive in what was Colson's final year as a professional race-car driver, Leong tuned his \\"King's Hawaiian Bread\\" Corvette Funny Car to victory at the NHRA Winston World Finals in Ontario, California. Besides being Colson's last race, the event was also notable as being the last drag race at Ontario Motor Speedway. In 1983, with MIke Dunn at the helm, Leong's \\"Hawaiian Punch\\" Funny Car won the Bakersfield March Meet. The car crashed and was destroyed later that year at the NHRA World Finals at Orange County International Raceway. After Leong and Dunn parted ways in 1984, Leong and his new driver, Rick Johnson, won the 1985 Bakersfield March Meet, followed later that year by a victory at NHRA's Le Grandnational-Molson in Quebec, Canada. In 1991, Leong once again won the US Nationals at Indianapolis, this time in Funny Car Eliminator, and with Jim White driving. Later, at the Chief Nationals in Dallas, Texas, his \\"Hawaiian Punch\\" Funny Car was the first in the class to break the 290-mph speed mark. ==Crew chief== After sitting out the 1992 season, Leong ran an abbreviated season in 1993 with driver Gordie Bonin in the Hawaiian Vacation Dodge Daytona funny car, following which Leong relinquished his role as car owner. In 1996, he began serving as a crew chief for the Red Line Oil Dodge Avenger Funny Car of Ray Higley. Despite the entry's limited finances, with Leong's input and expertise, Higley posted his career-best 1/4-mile elapsed time, posting a 5.00-second clocking at the 1996 US Nationals. In 1997, Don Prudhomme, then retired from driving and now a multi-car team owner, hired Leong to tune his \\"Copenhagen\\" Funny Car. With Ron Capps driving, Prudhomme's Leong-tuned entry won Funny Car Eliminator at that year's inaugural St. Louis race. They began the 1998 season by winning the Winternationals at Pomona, and winning the Big Bud Shootout at the U.S. Nationals.

The name bang bang chicken is derived from the manner in which the meat is tenderized using a stick or hammer.The Chinese Kitchen: A Book of Essential Ingredients with Over 200 Easy and ... - Deh-Ta Hsiung. p. 61. == Legend == According to a legend concerning the Ming and Qing dynasties, there was a dedicated chef in the remote areas of Ya'an who enjoyed experimenting with foods. After studying and practicing the art of soup-mixing for a long time, he successfully invented a formula to produce aromatic chicken meat and broth. However, chicken was a luxury and was only served on holidays. Bon bon chicken with sauce Someone came up with a strategy: cut the whole chicken into thin slices and sell it by slice. This strategy proved to be very effective, and \\"chicken slices\\" gained a good reputation. However, another problem occurred: a kitchen knife could not cut a whole chicken into slices evenly, and customers are often picky when making purchases. However, it was found that beating the chicken into pieces with a giant stick would solve this problem. At the same time, juice broth infuses into the chicken and adds flavor. When preparing the dish, one holds a stick and another holds a knife; the sound made by the stick and the knife striking each other has a rhythmic, almost musical quality, hence the name bang bang chicken. ==See also== * List of Chinese dishes ==ReferencesFurther reading== * 1001 Foods To Die For - Madison Books, Andrews McMeel Publishing, LLC. p. 396. * Simply Allergy-Free: Quick and Tasty Recipes for Every Night of the Week - Elizabeth Gordon * Art of Chinese Cooking - Rebekah Lin Jewell. p. 54. * Some Like it Hot: Spicy Favorites from the World's Hot Zones - Clifford A.

Currently independent, the duo was previously signed to a four-album deal with the record label Arts & Crafts.Wheeler, Brad (November 20, 2011). \\"The Darcys: A new and momentous beginning\\". The Globe and Mail. Retrieved April 17, 2014.Rayner, Ben (December 2, 2013). \\"Why are the Darcys playing the high school circuit?\\". Toronto Star. Retrieved April 17, 2014. The third of those, 2013's Warring, was nominated for a Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year, and was a longlist nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.\\"Polaris Music Prize announces 2014 long list\\" . Aux, June 19, 2014. ==Career2007-2011: Formation and early work=== The Darcys, who obtained their name from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, first began as the two-piece project of Jason Couse and Wes Marskell in Etobicoke, Ontario which gradually transitioned into a full band in Halifax, Nova Scotia with the additions of Dave Hurlow and Kirby Best. In December 2007, The Darcys’ debut album, Endless Water, was released. In the years following, the group returned to Toronto, and Michael le Riche was added to the lineup. Days before their 2010 CMW showcase, Best had left the band, forcing them to frantically re-create the work of five into parts for four. This brought about the solidification of the current four-piece lineup: Jason Couse, Wes Marskell, Michael le Riche, and Dave Hurlow. On losing Best and adding Couse on vocals, Marskell notes, \\"We became really close friends because of it, and it also made us willing and able to work through things that came up later down the line that became publicized and were difficult for us internally.\\" In the process of touring and recording their 2011 follow-up album amidst lineup changes, The Darcys continued to encounter hardships. This included stolen equipment, being held at knifepoint, and nearly losing their lives to a head-on collision on an icy road. ===2011: The Darcys (self-titled)=== Despite the release of Endless Water, the band will argue that their \\"true\\" first release came in 2011 with their self-titled Arts & Crafts debut, which marked the first of a three- record deal with the Toronto label responsible for prominent Canadian acts such as Broken Social Scene and Feist. The 10-track release received production from Murray Lightburn of The Dears and was mixed by Dave Schiffman (Rage Against The Machine, Weezer). The album was offered as a free download on the band's website, drawing many comparisons to Radiohead for its \\"lushly layered, lightly proggy arrangements.\\" A music video was released for the album's second track, \\"Don't Bleed Me\\". ===2012: AJA=== Only months after releasing their self-titled album, The Darcys released their interpretation of Steely Dan’s 1977 release Aja. As Marskell mentions, the choice to cover the entire album \\"existed solely to redirect conversation\\" surrounding the band's self-titled release. The release gained much criticism for recreating an album that \\"cannot be duplicated or reinterpreted\\", while also receiving praise for being ‘compelling’ and bringing out the ‘dark-hued’ nature of the lyrical content. On November 11, 2012, the band presented ‘An Interpretation Of Steely Dan's Aja’ live at Toronto's historic Lee's Palace. A mini documentary was made by Adrian Vieni of Wood & Wires Productions, discussing the decision to re-imagine the album with interviews and live footage. A music video was also released for the track ‘Josie’. ===2013: Warring=== In late 2013, The Darcys delivered the third installment of a three album series with Warring. The band discussed accomplishing the album in a statement explaining: \\"It's learning in motion. Competition and survival, letting go to persevere. It is anxiety about the future and the triumph of life in the moment. It's victory on will alone, the force that eradicates failure as an option.\\" The album is strongly influenced by the work of American novelist Cormac McCarthy, specifically his book Blood Meridian, which can be seen through the lyrical content. The 10-track album features artwork done by Toronto artist/graphic designer Sara Cwynar, as well as production from Tom McFall (Stars) and mixing from previous contributor, Dave Schiffman. Six music videos have been released to accompany the tracks ‘Pretty Girls’, ‘Itchy Blood’, ‘The River’, ‘Hunting’, ‘The Pacific Theatre’ and ‘Horses Fell’ from the album. Warring marked the band's first Juno nomination in 2014 for Alternative Album of the Year, and also earned a spot on the 2014 Polaris Music Prize longlist. ===2013-2014: Play In School Campaign and \\"Hymn For A Missing Girl\\"=== The Darcys embarked on their Play in School campaign in November 2013, to support the continuation of public school music programs and engage youths in embracing the importance of the arts as a part of their development. The band was turned on to the idea when the Toronto District School Board intended to cut its musical programs, in addition to receiving countless messages from young fans who were unable to attend their mainly 19+ shows. This campaign has enabled The Darcys to visit multiple high schools across Southern Ontario with the intention of encouraging students nationwide to \\"hold their school boards accountable to maintain and develop music programs.\\" In celebration of Record Store Day, The Darcys released \\"Hymn for a Missing Girl\\" in 2014 as an epilogue to Warring. The 22-minute instrumental, split into five movements, continues the trend of its predecessor with inspiration being drawn from Cormac McCarthy’s Cities of the Plain. The track was released online, though it was limited to 500 vinyl copies in North America. The band has also released the track \\"Ultra Violet\\", a bonus track from the recording sessions of the 2013 album. In addition to working on a follow-up to Warring and touring rigorously, Marskell has been contributing to The Huffington Post by occasionally writing articles for their Canada Music section, mainly recounting The Darcys’ tour experiences. ===2014-present: duo and Centerfold=== On December 17, 2014, The Darcys announced the band will be going forward as a duo consisting of founding members Jason Couse and Wes Marskell.\\"The Darcys Downsize to Duo, Shoot for Mainstream Success\\". Exclaim!, December 18, 2014. On August 10, 2016, The Darcys announced their new album, Centerfold, would be released on November 4, 2016.\\"The Darcys want to escape to sunny \\"San Diego, 1988\\" on new song\\".

It was released for digital download on February 14, 2014, as a free Valentine's Day gift for JoJo's fans for all their support over the years. It is JoJo's first official release since she was released from her contract with Blackground Records and signed to Atlantic Records. The four-track EP includes three covers of various classic songs including songs of Atlantic-affiliated artists Anita Baker and Phil Collins. ==Composition== The extended play contributed the overall elements of sounds between pop and R&B; however, the EP dips into other genres such gospel and soul music. The EP opens with a spoken intro which is a poem, written by author Aeni, while R&B; singer Marsha Ambrosius produces the tracks melody. JoJo speaks in a sultry voice \\"that sucks you right in\\", JoJo says. \\"Rest your head and close your eyes / Everything will be okay / For when you wake with the sweet sunrise / It will be a brand new day.\\" The track that contains a cover was this jazzy-R&B; song \\"Caught Up in the Rapture\\", which was recorded by American R&B; singer Anita Baker that was included from her second album Rapture (1986). The song was written by Gary Glenn and Dianne Quander, while Da Internz handled the song's production. Idolator said the song \\"dissolves into glitchy loops\\" before transitioning into the next track, a cover of Phil Collins' song \\"Take Me Home\\". Time magazine called JoJo's version \\"a clear standout\\" on the EP, continuing calling it \\"all militant stomp buried under ambient noise; her voice soars and crashes over the glitchy, stuttering beat. It's not the most obvious love song, but who cares – it's good.\\" The song lyrics refer to a patient in a mental institution, and it is based on the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The EP finishes with JoJo's \\"gospel-inflected\\" rendition of the \\"spiritual\\" 1991 song \\"Glory\\" inspired by opera singer Kathleen Battle. Produced by JoJo's long-time friend and vocal coach Stevie Mackey, \\"Glory\\" sees JoJo's \\"soothing vocals soar and really bring out the goosebumps teasing us of her outstanding talent and what is to come\\". ==Promotion== Following its surprise release, JoJo performed tracks from the EP for the first time live at the 2014 South by Southwest music festival on March 15. her second live performance of the tracks was on March 22, 2014, during VH1's Save the Music Foundation's \\"Family Day\\", and that same night at Perez Hilton's birthday party. ==Critical reception== Overall the extended play has received rave reviews from music critics. Sam Lansky from Time magazine said that the EP sees JoJo \\"interpreting classic songs with inventive production and, as ever, chill-inducing vocals\\". He noted that JoJo's time away from the limelight, due to her constant label drama, has given her \\"the raw talent to rule 2014\\". In writing for Idolator, Christina Lee said that the EP \\"is respectful of R&B; tradition and is tastefully modern at the same time\\". Joe Hopkins of UK online magazine Hit the Floor gave the mixtape a 9/10 rating, writing, \\"JoJo's voice has clearly developed from her 'Leave (Get Out)' days but still remains light and delicate.\\" In the review Hopkins said, \\"The shifts between falsetto and the runs are exquisite. However, not to forget the production from Da Internz which is completely ingenious.\\" Nylon magazine's Liza Darwin also went on to compare the EP to JoJo's early beginnings, stating \\"It's a far cry from 'Leave (Get Out),' but we're not mad about it... The bottom line? This girl is good, and we can't wait to hear what she's serving up next\\". KempireRadio called the EP a \\"reminder of what we have been missing from the music scene\\". ==Track listingCredits and personnel== Credits adapted from JoJo's Soundcloud page. *JoJo – lead vocals *Da Internz – producer *Brian Ziff – art direction, photography *Lisa Zogalis – hair stylist *Chrissy Zogalis – make up *Joey Thao – stylist *Lee England Jr. – violin *Stevie Mackey – vocal production, producer *Affordable Healthcare – music *Kevin Randolph – piano *Tony \\"Chicago\\" Russell – bass *Zach Nicholls – recording, mixing *Marsha Ambrosius – additional production *Mark Pelli – guitar ==References *The Mixtape on Audiomack Category:2014 debut EPs Category:Albums free for download by copyright owner Category:Albums produced by Da Internz Category:Atlantic Records EPs Category:JoJo (singer) albums ","title":"LoveJo"},{"id":"42031369","text":"Odozana patagiata is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

He and Andrew Huxley, complimenting the independent works of Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson, revealed that muscle contraction is due to shortening of the muscle fibres. He studied medicine throughout the Second World War, and obtained his MD degree as the war ended in 1945. After a brief practise in his hometown, he chose a research career. He became associated with Huxley, whom he joined at Cambridge University. Together they published a landmark paper in Nature in 1954, which became the foundation of muscle mechanics. ==Early life and education== Rolf Niedergerke was born and educated in Mülheim an der Ruhr. The turmoil of the Second World War almost interrupted his medical course when he was at Freiburg University. As a student of medicine he was exempted from conscription to serve in the German Army. However Germany was in no condition to maintain its education system as the Allies invaded from all corners by 1944. He could manage to continue at Charles University in Prague in Czechoslovakia (now in Czech Republic) and received his medical degree (MD) in 1945, just as the war ended. Before he returned to Germany he was arrested twice by the Russian Army, but managed to make a slip. He entered into medical service at the hospital and clinic in his hometown. He soon turned his interest to medical research. In 1947 he got an opportunity to join Prof Hermann Rein at the Physiological Institute, Göttingen, to study the electrical activity of nerve fibres. He was rather isolated in a department mainly working on the control of the circulation in mammals, so he was glad to be invited by Alexander von Muralt to work in the Theodor Kocher Institute in Bern. In Bern, Robert Stämpfli taught him to dissect single myelinated fibres. He made four important publications in German on frog nervous system (myelinated neurons) during his research training. ==Career== Rolf Niedergerke was encouraged to join A.F. Huxley in Cambridge University by Stämpfli, who had been a close associate of Huxley on nerve potential. Since 1951 Huxley was looking for a competent researcher for investigating the striation pattern of living skeletal muscle. Niedergerke moved to England in the autumn of 1952 as a George Henry Lewes Student with additional support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. He was a good choice because his personal interest had been on skeletal muscle and had a good collection on the subject since his time in Göttingen. He worked using Huxley's own interference microscope. Within a year he helped to improve the technique and a research paper on the mechanism of muscle contraction was ready. At that moment almost the same observation was made by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Authored in pairs their papers were simultaneously published in the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature. Their conclusion states that the observation: This was the discovery of \\"Sliding Filament Theory\\", the first scientific evidence and the basis of modern understanding of muscle contraction. Contrary to scientific view of the time they found that the muscle as a whole do not contract of expand, but it was individual group of the muscle fibres (called I or light bands), while other fibres (A or dark bands) are never changed. The very \\"hypothesis\\" was experimentally proved in 1966. Niedergerke moved from Cambridge to London in 1955, joining the Biophysics Department at University College London. Taking the suggestion of Bernard Katz, he continued his study on cardiac muscle (a specialised muscle of the heart), on which he discovered the role of calcium in muscle contraction (often dubbed the \\"calcium story\\") He retired from UCL in 1987. ==Death== Nidergerke suffered from poor health after his retirement. He gradually lost vision and hearing. His condition was exacerbated by pneumonia, and he died on 27 December 2011 at the Royal Free Hospital in London. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Mülheim Category:Charles University alumni Category:German physiologists Category:Academics of University College London ","title":"Rolf Niedergerke"},{"id":"42031621","text":"Heike Raab (born April 8, 1965) is a German politician (SPD), currently serving as Deputy Minister of the Interior, for Sports and Infrastructure of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. == Early life and education == * 1984: Abitur (high school diploma), Hilda Gymnasium Koblenz (high school) * 1984 – 1987: Degree course for physical therapy, Technical University of Aachen, Germany * 1988 – 1992: University studies (M.A. degree): Political Sciences, Public Law and Spanish == Career == * 1992 – 1993: Research Assistant for the German Federal Parliament (Deutscher Bundestag) * 1993 – 1994: State Chancellery, personal assistant of the Minister-President Rudolf Scharping * 1994 – 1998: Personal assistant of the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party in the Deutsche Bundestag, Rudolf Scharping * 1999 – 2001: Head of Division in the State Chancellery of Rhineland-Palatinate * since 18 May 2011: Undersecretary/ Deputy Minister of the Interior, for Sports and Infrastructure ==Political and Societal Positions== * 1989: Member of the Social Democratic Party * 2000: Chairwoman of the county chapter of the Social Democrats in Cochem-Zell County * 2001 – 2011: Member of Parliament, Rhineland-Palatinate * 2004: Chairwoman of the Social Democratic parliamentary group in the County Council of Cochem-Zell * 2006 – 2011: Secretary-General of the Social Democratic Party in Rhineland-PalatinatePress Release as Secretary-General In the negotiations to form a fourth cabinet under Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Raab was part of the working group on digital policy, led by Helge Braun, Dorothee Bär and Lars Klingbeil. ==Other activities== * ZDF, Member of the Program CommitteeMembers of the Program Committee ZDF. * Schüler Helfen Leben, Member of the Board of TrusteesBoard of Trustees Schüler Helfen Leben. * Südwestrundfunk (SWR), Member of the Broadcasting Council (2002-2011) Raab also serves as tutor for US-American Program Students in Germany. == External links == * Website of Heike Raab ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cochem Category:Members of the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians ","title":"Heike Raab"},{"id":"42031628","text":"Friedrich Bödeker Friedrich Bödeker (11 September 1867 in Währentrup – 9 April 1937 in Cologne) was a German botanist who specialized in cacti studies.

Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories. Laguna Art Museum. 1990, p. 11. She embarked on her education in fine arts at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1968. While studying there she met Billy Adler and John Margolies, who became her collaborators and professors and introduced her to the concept that one’s personal narrative could be strong material for art.Desmarais, Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, p. 12. She collaborated with them in a project called Telethon, a work in which they interviewed others about their personal experiences in relation to anthropological models, recorded it, and presented it in the University gallery as an installation made up of a living room with sofas, TV dinners and a television.Desmarais, Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, p. 12. But Segalove's first introduction to video was through her sculpture professor, Roland Brenner. Other early influences in using the medium of video included Wolfgang Stoerchle, then a graduate student at UCSB who later taught at CalArts, and the curator David Ross who had come from New York and was to launch the most comprehensive video exhibition in the coming years. Upon completion of her bachelor's degree in Fine Arts at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1972, Segalove purchased a Sony PortaPak from Naim June Paik’s girlfriend.Video Data Bank, , Ilene Segalove. She returned to Los Angeles and began taking classes with John Baldessari at CalArts. He encouraged Segalove to continue working with collage, with found or appropriated photographs and to reconstruct photographs from popular culture.Desmarais, Charles. \\"Proof: Los Angeles Art and the Photograph 1960-1980\\". Fellows of Contemporary Art, 1992, p. 31. At CalArts she met David Salle, Robert Longo, and Wolfgang Stoerchle, with whom she shared ideas and collaborated. Segalove made Today’s Program: Jackson Pollack, “Lavender Mist,” 1950, 1974, Gifts/I Love You/Bel Air Menthol, 1975,Works in which Segalove appropriated imagery from popular culture were included in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art., Ilene Segalove, “Horizon Lines/Bel-Air Menthol,” (1975). and If You Live Near Hollywood, You Can't Help But Look Like Some 8x10 Glossy, 1976.Desmarais, Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, p. 14. Each of these works entailed appropriating existing imagery and collaging it, using it as is, or restaging it in such a way that shows our internalization of the message that the media was selling us.For a discussion on Segalove’s relation to the media and its critique in art see John Miller’s Artforum article titled “Tomorrow Is the Question: John Miller on the Art of Ilene Segalove”, Artforum, Vol. 50, No. 2, October 2011, pp. 262-67. Eleanor Heartney also speaks to the use of media in a review on Segalove's work. Art in American Review on Ilene Segalove by Eleanor Heartney In addition to working with Baldessari and found imagery, Segalove was also exposed to the ideas germinating in the Feminist Art Program at CalArts which encouraged her to continue to train her camera on her personal experiences.Grenier, Catherine. , \\"Catalog L.A.: Birth of an Art Capital 1955-1985\\". Chronicle Books, 2007, p. 236.Kirby, Peter. Interview with Ilene Segalove. October 8, 2012. In Mother’s Treasures, 1974, she sequences a series of photographs of her mother sitting on the patio showing different works of art that Segalove had made throughout her childhood. These works included captions that told the story of her life in art through her mother’s eyes, her success and failures, and admonishments for not dating them and sometimes not even putting her name on them. The irony in this account foretells what was soon to be unleashed in the mother/daughter relationship that Segalove interrogated throughout her early career as an artist. ===Video Art and the Vox Populi=== Segalove completed the graduate program in Communication Arts at Loyola Marymount University, earning her master’s degree in 1975. At Loyola she honed the techniques of writing, directing and producing primarily for commercial output, but also continued making video art.Desmarais, Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, p. 14. She met Hildegarde Duane and they began to use each other as subjects or actors in their works. The two women shared a similar aesthetic and sentiment about artists using the media of video and photography to tell the stories of what it was like to be a woman. During this time The Mom Tapes, 1974-1978, in which Segalove trained her camera on her mother and their relationship, began to take shape.Metropolitan Museum of Art, MetMedia, Video , “The Mom Tapes\\" (excerpt) by Ilene Segalove, LA Times Article on Ilene Segalove by Jan Zubin, June 9, 1990 She was utilizing the interviewing strategies that she had learned while making Telethon and employing the new techniques acquired in the commercial television program at Loyola.

This stemmed from her childhood desire to become a cartoonist and has said that it informed her narrative style and interest in commenting on popular culture. According to her gallerist Tom Jancar, other influences on her video work include the satirical voices found in Mad Magazine and the work of William Hogarth and Honore Daumier.Conversation with Tom Jancar regarding Ilene Segalove at his gallery on January 30, 2014. By the late 1970s Segalove was employing irony with ease in works such as US Treasury Nose, 1979 and TV is OK, 1979, but soon the irony begins to cut deeper in works like The Riot Tapes: A Personal History, 1984,Video Data Bank, , Ilene Segalove, “The Riot Tapes,” (1984). and Female Fragments, 1987. In these works she addresses the personal directly by discussing her early experiences with sex, drugs, politics, and relationships, even so personal as to identify why her then boyfriend committed suicide, and then having to get mammograms because she has reached that age.Desmarais, Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, p. 18. But these works are soon tempered by a lighter version of a childhood crush in a text piece titled Kenny, 1987. In 1986 she made two works, Appliances and Bodyparts, which were pure audio narratives without any visual elements. Her occasional use of brief interviews emulating the vox populi, forged her segue into radio where she was a commentator on National Public Radio for several years.Desmarais, Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, p. 20. Despite this shift into audio works, Segalove continued creating visual art that became increasingly complex with clusters of images layered one on top of the other and sometimes interspersed with text. These included Home Entertainment Center, 1987, Amnesia, 1990, and Turn to Appendix, 1990. ===Retrospective and Beyond=== In 1990 the Laguna Art Museum organized a retrospective of Segalove’s work titled Ilene Segalove: Why I Got Into TV and Other Stories, encompassing much of the work that she had made since the 1970s. The exhibition included original collages, photographs, photomontages, installations, video and audio works and a catalogue with essays by Charles Desmarais and Lowell Darling. A few years later, Segalove began to make large-scale works she called \\"wall works\\" and also embarked on making a text based mural on the outside wall of a gallery.LA Times Article on Ilene Segalove by Nancy Kapitanoff, June 20, 1993 Shortly, she turned towards manipulating imagery and text in Photoshop, then a new medium for fine artists. From the mid 1990s into the new millennium Segalove took a hiatus from making art and focused on writing books. In 1996 she co-authored a best- selling book titled List Your Self, an earnest and ironic nod to the conceptual practice of making lists ad infinitum. She returned to art in 2008 when she was included in the Getty Center’s California Video exhibition and in 2009 with her solo exhibition at the Jancar Gallery in Los Angeles.Jancar Gallery, , “Ilene Segalove,” solo exhibition, Los Angeles, CA, April 4 – 25, 2009. It was here that art collector Dean Valentine became acquainted with her work and began to understand how her gallerist Tom Jancar , Conversation with Tom Jancar at his gallery in January 2014. could claim that she was the “missing link” between the artists of Baldessari’s generation and that of The Pictures Generation. Within a year, Valentine curated a show of her work at Andre Rosen Gallery in New York touting her as standing “halfway between Martha Rosler and Cindy Sherman.”, Valentine, Dean. “The Dissatisfactions of Ilene Segalove,” Press Release. October 14, 2010. Segalove’s Secret Museum of Mankind, 2011, takes its cue from an early work titled Close But No Cigar, 1976, in which she pairs images of herself with those from history, showed biting humor countered by a sobering acceptance of one's own place in the world. Segalove’s work exists as a testament and document to her desire to not disappear, to make a claim on her existence and relevance in the world today. Whatever Happened to My Future?, 2013, is a video in which Segalove converses with a younger version of herself. Throughout the video she enlightens her younger self about the changes that have taken place historically in culture over the years. The viewer is a witness to the disappointments and amazements experienced by the younger Segalove and left feeling that the irony and playfulness of her youthful self is no longer sufficient for the artist who has reached a place of succinct maturity.Ollman, Leah. “Ilene Segalove, past and present and Jancar,” Los Angeles Times, May 22, 2013, p.

It was originally serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, but was later featured in three additional magazines published by Ichijinsha: Waai! Mahalo, Comic Rex and Febri. Collectively, Himegoto was serialized across the four magazines from November 2011 to June 2015 and was collected into six tankōbon volumes. The story focuses on Hime Arikawa, a high school boy whose sizable debt is paid off by the girls of his school's student council. In exchange, he agrees to join the student council and spend the rest of his high school life dressed as a girl. A 13-episode anime adaptation, directed by Yūji Yanase and produced by Asahi Production, aired in Japan between July and September 2014. Critics pointed out a general focus on humiliation and shame, and panned it for its characters and reliance on a single joke throughout the series. ==Plot== Himegoto follows Hime Arikawa, a second-year student at . Forced to assume a large amount of debt from his now- absent parents, Hime is saved by the three girls of his school's student council after he is chased down by debt collectors. In return for paying off his debt, Hime agrees to their conditions of becoming the student council's \\"dog\\" and spending his high school life dressed as a girl. ==Characters== ; : :The protagonist of the series, Hime is an extremely feminine-looking second- year high school student who gets troubled by debt collectors because his parents have racked up a large amount of debt in his name for constantly traveling overseas. When the student council pays off his creditors, he is obligated to join them as a servant, and must also cross-dress for the rest of his time in high school. While at first he only cross-dresses because he has no other choice, he starts to slowly shows signs of enjoying it, much to the delight of his brother and the student council. ; : :18-kin is the student body vice-president. She often forces Hime into unreasonable situations. Her father is the board chairman of the school. Despite how much she enjoys making fun of Hime, she never allows actual harm to come to him. She has feelings for Hime and likes kissing. Her real name is . ; : :Unko is the student council president at Shimoshina. She is an intelligent and athletic girl. Although her name is actually , this reminds her of the horror character Sadako, so she prefers to use Unko because she is afraid of ghosts. ; : :Albertina II, who also goes by , is the student council secretary. She is a popular manga artist, and uses Hime as the basis for the title character in her manga . She is sensitive about her small chest and gets upset whenever the issue of size comes up. Her real name is . ; : :Kaguya is Hime's younger brother who cross- dresses by choice because he enjoys the attention he receives from it. He dislikes that 18-kin and the student council pays so much attention to Hime. He is the lead character in the spin-off series Himegoto+. Kaguya joins the public morals committee at his school. He has a number of admirers at school he refers to as his \\"servants\\". ; : :No. 1 is Kaguya's classmate; her moniker refers to her status as Kaguya's foremost and closest admirer. While she normally dresses as a boy (for Kaguya's sake), when she dresses as a girl, she has a large bust size and is regarded as incredibly pretty. She has known Kaguya for five years and is very close with him. She joined the public morals committee with Kaguya. Her full name is . ; : :Nicknamed , Mitsunaga is a third-year student at Shimoshina High School and is the chairman of the public morals committee. As the head of the Oda family, he is forced to cross-dress until he reaches adulthood due to a family rule. Similar to Kaguya, Mitsunaga dislikes 18-kin due to her lax morals and disregard for his authority. ; : :Hiro is Mitsunaga's classmate and assistant in the public morals committee. His family has served the Oda family for generations as their servants. Due to feeling sorry for Mitsunaga being forced to cross-dress, Hiro willingly dresses as a girl and normally dresses in a maid outfit. Although neither he nor Mitsunaga acknowledge their relationship as anything other than a master and servant throughout the series, they do love each other. ; : :Tadokoro is Hime's classmate and they have been friends since junior high school. He is somewhat of a playboy, but never gets far. ==Development== Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on an earlier four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main characters that make up the student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided it would be easier to manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it. When drawing the manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that were easy to read, something she felt she was unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross- dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have. Although Tsukudani kept a notebook with story ideas, she admitted that on many occasions the theme of a chapter was born out of her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story. ==MediaManga=== Himegoto is written and illustrated by Norio Tsukudani. It began serialization in volume seven of Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine on November 25, 2011 as a four-panel comic strip manga, and continued until February 25, 2014 when Waai! suspended publication. A spin-off series titled Himegoto+ was serialized in Waai!s sister magazine Waai! Mahalo between April 25, 2012 and December 25, 2013. Another version of Himegoto was serialized between the December 2013 issue of Ichijinsha's Comic Rex magazine sold on October 27, 2013 and the August 2015 issue sold on June 27, 2015. Tsukudani serialized another version of Himegoto in Ichijinsha's Febri magazine between volume 23 sold on June 20, 2014 and volume 29 sold on June 17, 2015. Ichijinsha published six tankōbon volumes between February 19, 2013 and July 27, 2015. A special edition of volume four was bundled with a drama CD. Ichijinsha published an anthology titled on September 3, 2014. ===Anime=== A 13-episode anime television series adaptation, directed by Yūji Yanase and produced by Asahi Production, aired in Japan between July 7 and September 29, 2014 on BS11. Each episode is about five minutes long. The screenplay is written by Kazuho Hyodō, and Masaaki Sakurai based the character design used in the anime on Norio Tsukudani's original designs. The opening theme is and the ending theme is ; both are sung by I My Me Mine, a group composed of Yūki Kuwahara, Yuka Matenrō, Saki Ono and Hisako Tōjō. The single containing the theme songs was released on March 5, 2014. The series was released on Blu-ray in Japan on November 26, 2014. An Internet radio show hosted by the members of I My Me Mine to promote the anime called broadcast 24 episodes between April 16 and September 24, 2014. The show was streamed online every Wednesday and was produced by the Japanese Internet radio station Onsen.

By the end of the series, Beveridge noted that its approach focused on humiliation and shame, and went on to say that it \\"works one gag and does its best to run it into the ground as much as possible.\\" Tim Jones at THEM Anime Reviews heavily panned the series, calling the treatment of the student council girls towards Hime as \\"sinister and tasteless\\". Jones pointed out his frustration with every episode, going on to heavily pan the characters and use of a \\"terrible one-joke premise\\". ==Notes and references== ;Notes # The tankōbon volumes combine the chapters serialized in Waai!, Waai!

Motorola asked to meet with him in his lab and at a meeting in Copenhagen. Lai and Singh have published research on the effects of artemisinin on cancer. Lai with Singh and HW Chan, have also published research that frequencies emitted by RFID chips are capable of retarding the growth of several types of cancer cells. ==Controversy== Lai and Singh claim that Motorola attempted to discredit their low-level microwave radiation findings in order to suppress them.

Its roots can be traced to hot and dry climactic conditions in Peninsular Malaysia in early 2014, but other factors, including water infrastructure problems and political deadlock in negotiations between the government and private water concessionaires also played central roles. It was the worst water crisis in the state since the 1998 Klang Valley water crisis. ==CausesMeteorological background=== Peninsular Malaysia experienced unusually hot and dry weather in early 2014, with a lack of rainfall in key catchment areas from which the water supply was sourced. Early speculations linked the dry weather to the El Niño effect, but no El Niño emerged in 2014. ===Treatment plant shutdown=== Offline treatment plants have been an ongoing problem in Selangor. In February 2014 two plants in the state were shut down due to ammonia contamination. ===Politics=== 84% of the Selangor people believe that politics were the main factor responsible for the escalation of water shortages to crisis-level. Disagreements between Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor (SYABAS) and the state government slowed progress toward a stable water supply. The deadlines for agreement on a water distribution restructuring deal between the government and water concessionaires were postponed several times, while water supply to many households continued to be intermittent. ==EffectsNegeri Sembilan=== In Negeri Sembilan, the seven reservoir dams in the state suffered a substantial drop in water level. More than 8,000 homes were affected particularly in the areas of Sendayan, Rasah, Mambau and Seremban. On 19 February 2014, Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), Mohamad Hassan declared a state of crisis following the water shortage – the worst the state has seen in decades. The announcement had to be made after taps ran dry in several thousand households, due to the unusually long dry spell which has resulted in several water catchment areas drying up. Natural-disaster relief personnel were dispatched to supply potable water to 8,000 households. ===Selangor=== Immediate As river sources dried up, water levels fell to critical levels in seven of the state's dams, including as low as 31% of capacity at the Sungai Selangor Dam, which supplies more than 60% of the state's water. These critically low reserve levels prompted water rationing affecting upwards of 6.7 million residents and lasting from March to May. As a result of reduced access to water for commercial use, at least 30 companies in the state, especially in the food and drinks processing, rubber, chemical, electrical and tourism industries, suffered losses greater than MYR1 million. Long-Term In the wake of sustained problems with water infrastructure and supply in Selangor, negotiations are underway to return the four private water concessionaires operating in Selangor to state control. Construction has been approved of the MYR993.89 million Langat 2 water treatment plant which was proposed to increase the state's output of treated water, alleviate pressure on other treatment plants, and provide an additional safety net in times of crisis. ==See also== *1998 Klang Valley water crisis *Water supply and sanitation in Malaysia *Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor ==References *Water level index at all dams in Selangor by Selangor Water Works Board (LUAS) *The Selangor water crisis: a timeline Category:Health disasters in Malaysia Category:2014 health disasters Category:2014 in the environment Category:2014 in Malaysia Category:Water in Malaysia Category:Environmental issues with water ","title":"2014 Negeri Sembilan and Selangor water crisis"},{"id":"42031684","text":"The Nokia X family was a range of budget smartphones that was produced and marketed by Microsoft Mobile, originally introduced in February 2014 by Nokia. The smartphones run on the Nokia X platform, a Linux-based operating system which was a fork of Android. Nokia X is also known generally as the Nokia Normandy. It is regarded as Nokia's first Android device during the company's Microsoft partnership and was in the process of selling its mobile phone business to Microsoft, which eventually happened two months later. The Nokia X devices heavily resemble the Asha phones, and also contain some Lumia features. They have a single \\"back\\" button like the Asha 50x and 230. A \\"home\\" button was added to the X2 series when they were released in June 2014. They are primarily targeted towards emerging markets, and never made its way to Western Europe or North America. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop called it the Nokia X family during an announcement, possibly to distinguish it from the unrelated Xseries that ran from 2009 to 2011. In July 2014, Microsoft Mobile announced the end of the X range after just five months (as well as Asha and Series 40) in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Windows Phone products. ==Background== Despite choosing the Windows Phone operating system for its Lumia series of smartphones, Nokia had experimented with the Android platform in the past. Images of a Nokia N9 running Android 2.3 were leaked in 2011. They were believed to be genuine, as Steven Elop mentioned Nokia had considered using Android at one time. ===2013 events=== On 13 September 2013, the New York Times writer Nick Wingfield revealed that Nokia had been testing the Google Android operating system on its Lumia hardware. Another project, known as \\"Asha on Linux\\", used a forked version of Android without Google services. The Asha series previously ran the Java-based Series 40 and Asha platforms. These were not as functional as a similarly priced low-end Android handset, a price range that Windows was not able to provide Windows Phones in. Meltemi (operating system), a Linux-based operating system designed to replace Series 40, had been scrapped by the company. The Chinese technology site CTechnology revealed that despite the announced merge of Nokia with Microsoft, development of the Asha on Linux project was continuing until November 2013 and 10,000 prototype units had been manufactured by Foxconn, containing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 8225Q chip. A report by Tom Warren from The Verge on 11 December 2013 showed an Asha-like device, codenamed \\"Normandy\\". He said that \\"despite the finalisation of the acquisition, development of the device is continuing.\\" As of late January 2014 the deal stands as not finalized because of scrutiny from Chinese regulators.) AllThingsD suggested that Microsoft may not stop development of the device. A 14 December 2013 report by CTechnology claimed that the device development had been halted, along with an Android-based Snapdragon 400 tablet. The two projects were to have been created by Nokia's CTO division, which Microsoft did not acquire, with Peter Skillman, the head of UX Design, at the helm of the UI design. The report said that wearable devices were the new focus of the CTO division. A further leak by @evleaks showed a press image with several colour options for the phone. According to NokiaPowerUser, the device was dual-SIM with a display, the model number was RM-980, and it had a 640×360 resolution. In a second report, they suggested the device may be a member of the Asha range, as the development team was headed by Egil Kvaleberg (from Smarterphone), and the UI led by Peter Skillman (who worked on the Asha Platform's Swipe UI). A tweet by @evleaks on 31 December 2013 stated that \\"The reports of Normandy's death have been greatly exaggerated\\". ===2014 events=== A leak on the ITHome technology website showed a blurred image of the phone, and the app drawer of its UI in operation, confirming it to be a dual-SIM device. However, no Nokia logos were found on the device. @evleaks later posted screenshots of the UI, showing the lock screen and Skype in action. The device later showed up on the AnTuTu benchmark software as Nokia A110, with KitKat 4.4.1, a 5MP camera and an 854 x 480 display. Two new photos of the Engineering prototype were leaked in January 2014. One shows a different app launcher than previous photos, suggesting a placeholder. On 13 January 2014, a press photo showing the tile- like UI of the home screen was leaked, and was accompanied by a screenshot of the Asha platform's Fastlane-style notification centre the next day. According to Eldar Murtazin, Microsoft was not keen on the idea, saying there were \\"too many politics\\" around the project. He claimed it would have to be released in February, before the acquisition of Nokia was completed, if at all. Another source suggested Microsoft would use the device as a trojan horse to increase Windows Phone adoption. The phone (with the model code RM-980) was certified by the Indonesian authorities on 21 January 2014, suggesting a close launch date. On 23 January 2014, Nokia sent out invitations to its press event at Mobile World Congress on 24 February 2014, where the device would be unveiled, if it wasn't cancelled. @evleaks later tweeted that the name of the phone is Nokia X. A few days later, the specifications were leaked by @evleaks. The device had a dual core Snapdragon processor, 512 MB of RAM, 4 GB internal storage memory, a 1500 MAh battery, Nokia Store and third-party app stores, confirming its placement into the low-end market segment. On 30 January 2014, the French website nowhereelse.fr released more photos of the device, showing its form factor and rear view for the first time. According to GoAndroid, an anonymous Senior Nokia Executive Officer in India revealed that the device would debut in India in March 2014 under the Asha line. NokiaPowerUser later revealed that the phone gained certification in Thailand and Malaysia. The Wall Street Journal's sources confirmed that Nokia was going to reveal the device at the MWC in Barcelona at the end of February 2014. Reports from Artesyn Technologies and tech.qq said Nokia X is the first of several Android devices from Nokia, including high-end models. These additional devices, one named Nokia XX, would be released during May or June 2014, and were claimed to be out of beta and would possibly receive FCC certification. Nokia's social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook had their colour changed to green, which was suggested by WPCentral to be a veiled reference to the Android operating system. @evleaks confirmed that the phone was to be called Nokia X. Rumours of devices being sent to developers in India were published at GSMArena. As the release date grew nearer, teaser videos on Nokia's YouTube and Vine accounts under the hashtag #GreenDuck were released, as well as teaser images, such as a treasure map with an X marking the spot on the Sina Weibo microblog in China. More images of the interface also surfaced, showing the finalised product for the first time. On 18 February 2014, the Hungarian technology website tech2.hu claimed the device was under mass production at Nokia's Komárom plant in Hungary. At a pre-MWC event on 23 February 2014, Microsoft VP for the Windows Phone platform Joe Belfiore was asked about how the company would feel in the event that Nokia released an Android phone. His response was as follows: ==UnveilingFirst generation=== The phone was unveiled by the Nokia CEO at Mobile World Congress on 24 February 2014. Two variants, the Nokia X and the Nokia X+ were released, with the Nokia X+ having 768 MB RAM as opposed to the 512 MB RAM reported by leaks, as well as a microSD card included in the box. The phone also contained the Lumia-inspired UI design, in addition to the Nokia suite of mobile applications as previously leaked. Nokia XL, released at the end of Q2 A third phone, the Nokia XL, was released, with a larger screen, front-facing camera, rear flash and greater battery life. The XL featured 768 MB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Play chipset with a dual-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A5 CPU. ===Nokia X2=== On 24 June 2014, Microsoft launched the Nokia X2, which featured 1 GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 chipset with a dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 CPU. It was launched with an official price of €99 (US$135; £80). It also had single and dual-SIM options. ===Nokia XL 4G=== The Nokia XL 4G was released in China in July 2014. It featured a 1.2 GHz quad-core CPU over the 1.0 GHz dual-core CPU in the original Nokia XL, LTE support of LTE bands, 1 GB of RAM over the original 768 MB and a lower weight. ==Aftermath== In an interview with Forbes, former HMD Global CEO Arto Nummela stated that analysis showed that the Nokia X series became surprisingly popular with users of high end Samsung and Apple smartphone devices, despite the fact that it was a mid to low end device family. In May 2018, HMD global launched a new Android phone Nokia X6, but it is not officially classified as new member of Nokia Xseries or X family. ==Model comparison== The source of information is from the developer.nokia.com and the website of Microsoft mobile China. {  ! !!

To make a living in his small, rural town, Dal-ho's heavy metal rock band is forced to play trot (country music similar to enka, also known as bbong jjak) in tacky nightclubs. One day, Jang Joon, executive of a shabby record company, sees potential in the seemingly clueless vocalist and promises to make him a star—Dal-ho realizes too late that he's been duped into signing a contract with a label that specializes in trot music. Jang believes that Dal-ho's talent as a trot singer is in reflecting the melodramatic sentimentality of middle-aged Koreans (the genre's target demographic), but Dal-ho persistently believes that trot music, along with the gaudy costumes and hairstyles and exaggerated stage movements associated with it, is outdated and trite. So on his televised singing debut as a trot singer, Dal-ho wears a mask out of shame. However, the strange strategy works; his voice rocks the nation and his album sales climb the music charts. His mysterious masked face had only increased the public's curiosity about the new star, doubling his popularity. As Jang continues to train him, Dal-ho gradually begins to see the beauty of trot, thanks to the help of his colleagues, especially Cha Seo-yeon, an attractive trot singer with a strong passion for music but little talent. Dal-ho realizes that what's important is not which genre he chooses but whether he sings with all his heart. But he also undergoes an identity crisis, wondering if he would remain a star without the mask. ==Cast== * Cha Tae-hyun as Bong Dal-ho/Bong Pil * Im Chae-moo as Jang Joon * Lee So-yeon as Cha Seo-yeon * Lee Byung-joon as Na Tae-song * Park Seon-woo as Hae-chul * Jung Suk-yong as Jo Seung-ho * Park Young-seo as Hae- chul * Jung Seong-woo as good looking guy * Ah Yong-joo as Seo Deuk-nam * Kim Hyeong-ja as Dal-ho's mother * Kim Ki-hyeon as Chairman Choi * Lee Seung-heon as Lee Dae-chil * Jeong Gi-seop as detective * Im Se-mi as Chairman Choi's daughter * Yoo Jung-hyun as music award MC * Kim Ji-young as bar girl 2 * Lee Ha-eun as bar girl 4 * Seol Ji-yoon as Madam * Da Eun as university student * Kim Ik-tae * Lee Kyung-kyu as vocal trainer (ending scene) ==References* * Category:2007 films Category:South Korean films Category:2000s musical comedy films Category:South Korean musical comedy films Category:2007 comedy films ","title":"Highway Star (film)"},{"id":"42031836","text":"Mercurio (en:Mercury) is the second studio album by Italian rapper Emis Killa. ==Track listing== # Wow – 3:06 # Scordarmi chi ero – 3:52 # MB45 – 3:04 # Lettera dall'inferno – 3:44 # A cena dai tuoi (feat.

The first system developed in the Northern Hemisphere and eventually developed into Typhoon Olga, before it impacted the Marshall Islands. The second disturbance developed within the South Pacific Ocean and started to move westwards, before it started to show signs of developing into a tropical cyclone during October 19. Over the next couple of days, the system started to move south-westwards and was named Bebe by the New Zealand Meteorological Service, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the modern-day Australian scale. During October 21, the system passed near or over the Elice Island of Funafuti, where hurricane-force winds were recorded. During October 22, Bebe weakened slightly, as it passed about to the west of the Tuvaluan reef island Niulakita. By this time the system's circulation extended out about and had started to move south-eastwards. Bebe was subsequently located about to the northeast of Rotuma, by a Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft that was on a search-and-rescue mission to Tuvalu. The system subsequently passed near to or over Rotuma and peaked with 10-minute sustained winds estimated at 155 km/h (100 mph) and 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 205 km/h (125 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 tropical cyclone on both the Australian Scale and Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. After affecting Rotuma with hurricane-force winds during that day, the system moved southwards towards the main islands of Fiji, and appeared on the Cossor Radar screen at the Nadi Meteorological Office during October 23. The centre of the hurricane moved on to the north coast of Viti Levu. During October 25, Bebe transitioned into an extra-tropical cyclone, before its remnants were last noted on October 28. ==Effects == Bebe adversely affected both Tuvalu and the Fijian islands, where it left 25 people dead (six in Tuvaluhttps://www.redcross.org.nz/about- us/centenary/pacific/hurricane-bebe/ and nineteen in Fijihttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.3715K/abstracthttps://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/21944/DealingWithDisaster1984%5Bpdfa%5D.PDF) and thousands homeless. Overall damages were estimated at over $20 million (1972 USD). ===Tuvalu=== Funafuti International Airport in November 1972, showing damage from Cyclone Bebe. Modern-day Tuvalu (at the time a British colony known as the Ellice Islands) was the first island nation to be affected by Bebe, between October 19 and 22. The system started to affect Tuvalu during October 19, with intermittent heavy rain reported in the island nation, before the weather deteriorated further during the next day, with reported strong winds increasing to gale force, flooding and a rough sea. During October 20, as the seas were rough, the ship Moana Raoi (which had just arrived in Funafuti's lagoon, carrying supplies from Suva, Fiji) was anchored peacefully. During the next day, as the Funafuti International Airport airstrip was flooded, the fortnightly Air Pacific aircraft that was carrying supplies from Nadi, Fiji, turned back while it was located about from the airstrip. After a hurricane warning was received at the New Zealand Meteorological Service weather station, its chief tried to warn as many people as possible, including the Master of the Moana Raoi, the fishery officer of the Van Camp fishing fleet, and the agent of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands development authority. Little to no significant damage was recorded on the majority of the islands; however, the low-lying island of Funafuti was significantly affected after the system passed over the coral atoll during October 21. Hurricane-force winds were observed on the island for several hours, while a storm surge swept over the island, killing three people, destroying houses, and leaving coral debris. ===Fiji=== Bebe affected the whole of the newly independent island nation of Fiji between October 22–25, where it became the worst tropical cyclone since 1952 to affect the islands. Ahead of the system threatening the Fijian Islands, the Nadi weather office issued hurricane warnings for most of the island nation including Rotuma. As a result, hurricane shutters were put up on various buildings, schools were closed, local air service and cruise ships were cancelled while other smaller ships took shelter. The Nadi and Nausori international airports were also closed. On October 22, the Fijian Parliament was adjourned in order to prepare for the hurricane. During October 23, the system passed over the Fijian Dependency of Rotuma, with hurricane-force wind speeds of around had been recorded on the island. As a result, widespread damage was reported on the island, with various houses and other buildings either destroyed or extensively damaged. The island also lost the majority of its crops, with coconut palms, copra and citrus trees damaged or destroyed. As a result, it was estimated that between 60%-90% of the population would be dependent on relief supplies for the next three to six months. ==See also== *Cyclone Tomas *List of off-season South Pacific tropical cyclones *Tuvalu Meteorological Service ==References Category:1972–73 South Pacific cyclone season Category:Category 3 South Pacific cyclones Bebe Category:Tropical cyclones in Fiji Category:Tropical cyclones in Tuvalu Category:1972 in Fiji ","title":"Cyclone Bebe"},{"id":"42032036","text":"The History of Wargaming Project aims to archive and publish wargaming books, rules and documents about wargaming.

He is a supporting character in the eighth series of the program, first appearing in the second episode, \\"Into the Dalek\\". He appears alongside Peter Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor and his storylines stem primarily from being the colleague, and later boyfriend, of companion Clara Oswald, portrayed by Jenna Coleman. He appears in every episode of Series 8 except for the series premiere \\"Deep Breath\\" and the third episode \\"Robot of Sherwood\\". ==Appearances== Danny Pink is first introduced in Series 8 Episode 2, \\"Into the Dalek\\". He is a new Maths teacher at Coal Hill Secondary School in London, and is reasonably new to the profession having spent a number of years in the past serving with the British Army. A dark past is hinted at when he avoids answering a question from one of his students on whether he has ever killed someone who wasn't a soldier, with a tear rolling down his cheek. He is instantly attracted to his new colleague, Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), an English teacher at the school, and attempts to ask her out on a date, which is at first disastrous, but she eventually asks him herself. Their first date is seen in the fourth episode of the series, \\"Listen\\". Clara is offended when Danny presumes that she will not understand his career in the Army, knowing that she is anti-war, and she storms out. At the same time, the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) is attempting to explore the possibility that everyone has a constant companion, like a shadow, that is always with them, relating back to the recurring dream of the monster under the bed. Wanting to explore Clara's past experience of the dream, the TARDIS taps into her mind to return to her childhood but, as she is distracted by Danny, it takes them back to a children's home in Gloucester where they meet Danny as a child, whose real name is actually Rupert. Clara inadvertently inspires him to be a soldier. She then returns to the present and goes back to the date immediately after she stormed out. She attempts to reconcile things with Danny, but he becomes suspicious when she reveals she knows his real name. This time, he storms out. Clara is then stunned when the Doctor takes her to meet Orson Pink, a time traveller from 100 years in the future who has become stranded at the end of the universe. Orson bears a striking resemblance to Danny (both are played by Samuel Anderson). Clara realises that Orson is Danny's descendant, and she contemplates the idea that he is also hers after he remarks that he is descended from a time traveller. Realising that her future lies with Danny, she visits him and they reconcile by sharing their first kiss. In the season's sixth episode, \\"The Caretaker\\", a Skovox Blitzer is drawn to the school by the Doctor, who is posing as Coal Hill's caretaker. He clashes with Danny, mocking his past in the Army and refusing to accept that he is a Maths teacher, believing he is more suited to the role of a P.E. teacher (to the point of nicknaming him \\"P.E.\\"). Clara struggles to balance her life with the Doctor and her relationship with Danny, especially as neither one knows about the other. However, when Danny becomes suspicious of the Doctor's activities, he discovers the truth about Clara's time-travelling activities. Although he initially struggles to come to terms with the idea, he gives Clara his blessing to continue travelling, but warns her that there may come a time when the Doctor pushes her too far, remembering similar individuals from his time in the army. Danny makes brief appearances in subsequent episodes in the series, and he supports Clara when she decides to stop travelling with the Doctor after he puts her in a vulnerable position in \\"Kill the Moon\\". However, Clara is unable to resist the temptation of time travelling and resumes her trips with the Doctor without telling Danny. Her deception is exposed in \\"In the Forest of the Night\\", when Clara, Danny and a group of special needs students become stranded in an overgrown central London and are forced to call on the Doctor for help. While inside the TARDIS, Danny discovers a pile of recent student papers Clara has been marking, proving she is in regular contact with the Doctor. He is unhappy with her dishonesty, and this creates a strain on their relationship. Clara decides to declare her unending love for Danny in \\"Dark Water\\", but her phone call to him is cut short when Danny is hit by a car. She is devastated when he dies of his injuries, but Danny's consciousness is brought to the Nethersphere, an artificial afterlife created by Missy (Michelle Gomez), a female version of the long-standing Doctor Who villain the Master. Danny's past is explored when he is confronted with a young boy he killed while serving in Afghanistan. Upset over this and Clara's reaction to his death, Danny is encouraged to delete his emotions, but does not do so before seeing Missy force the consciousnesses trapped in the afterlife back to their bodies, which have been \\"upgraded\\" to become Cybermen. Danny rescues Clara from other Cybermen and asks her to turn on his emotional inhibitor to stop the pain he is under, both emotionally and physically, now he is a Cyberman. Clara convinces the Doctor to help her with this when Danny suggests he can access the hive mind of the Cybermen and discover Missy's plans for the Earth. He does so, but, due to his strong love for Clara, continues to act against Missy. With the Doctor's aid, he uses a bracelet that previously belonged to Missy to take control of the other Cybermen and, under his command, they all fly into the sky and self-destruct. Still possessing Missy's bracelet, which has the power to make one trip out of the Nethersphere back into the real world, Clara begs him to come back, but he instead sends back the boy he killed, making Clara promise to return him to his family. Danny next appears in the 2014 Christmas special, \\"Last Christmas\\". Having been put in a dream state, Clara is reunited with Danny for an idyllic Christmas Day. The Doctor enters the dream to convince Clara to wake up before the creature that induced the dream kills her, but she refuses, unwilling to let go of Danny. \\"Danny\\" then reveals that he is aware of his 'reality' as a dream. He tells Clara that, while she can still miss him, she must move on and encourages her to live her life without him. Finally accepting his death, Clara agrees to wake up from the dream. Danny is occasionally mentioned in the ninth series. In \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\", Missy asks Clara about her dead lover, referring to Danny. When Clara realises she is about to die in \\"Face the Raven\\", she states that if Danny Pink could face his own death, then so can she. ==Casting and development== On 24 February 2014, Samuel Anderson was announced that he has been cast alongside Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Capaldi's first series as Danny Pink, a teacher at Coal Hill School alongside companion Clara Oswald. Coal Hill School was the workplace of original companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. Following 2013's 50th anniversary celebrations, head writer Steven Moffat decided that he would bring in another teacher to work alongside Clara in exploring the school's roots. Anderson said that he was \\"excited\\" about joining the show, and could not wait to see how his character would be involved with the Doctor and Clara. Despite it not being confirmed until shortly before Series 8's airing, it was commonly speculated that Anderson would be playing Clara's love interest. Coleman and Anderson had previously closely worked together on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale, where they played Jasmine Thomas and Ross Kirk respectively. Anderson confirmed that Danny would be Clara's love interest in August 2014, but made it clear that Danny would not be a companion but rather the stay-at- home boyfriend providing Clara with the stability she needs after time travel. He also described Danny as \\"lovable and huggable\\". Danny's first appearance aired on 30 August 2014 in the second episode of the series, \\"Into the Dalek\\". Moffat described Danny as a \\"competitor\\" of the Doctor, saying that he had a better chance of winning Clara than previous companion boyfriends such as Mickey Smith and Rory Williams, who appeared weak compared to their Doctors. The series finale two-partner \\"Dark Water\\"/\\"Death in Heaven\\" saw Danny's character killed off, not once, but twice. His past was also explored from The Nethersphere, an artificial afterlife where Danny was confronted with a child he killed while serving in the Afghanistan war. As part of the Mistress' plans, Danny was reincarnated as a Cyberman along with the other dead on Earth, but saved the day by taking control of the other Cybermen and leading them into the sky to explode and burn away clouds of Cyber spores meant to convert the living as well. Moffat was quoted as saying that the event \\"cemented\\" Danny's place in Doctor Who history. ==Reception== Despite some initial outcry against another romantic interest for a companion, the character of Danny Pink and Anderson's portrayal of him were mostly positive following his first appearance. Malcolm Stewart of CultBox praised Danny for being starkly different from the characters of Rory Williams and Mickey Smith, who he claimed were \\"defined in relation to their girlfriends and... kept on a leash by their better sassier halves\\", and commented that, unlike them, Danny did not feel \\"emasculated\\" and was a more \\"straightforward, unassuming proposition\\". The initial reception to his death in \\"Dark Water\\" was also positive, with the episode receiving five stars from the Telegraph. Michael Hogan of the paper said that Danny Pink was \\"finally coming into his own\\", and called Danny's flashbacks to the war as \\"joltingly emotional, lump in throat moments\\". However, his permanent death and continuation of story in the following story \\"Death in Heaven\\" received mixed reviews, with Doctor Who TV commenting that how Danny kept a grip of his emotions following the turning of his inhibitor not being a sufficient explanation and criticising that Danny's backstory was not given sufficient screen time for emotional impact. Following his death, some fans campaigned to \\"keep Danny dead\\" following Steven Moffat's apparent trend to resurrect fallen companions including Clara, and Rory Williams. In 2015, Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph criticised the general portrayal of male companion figures in Doctor Who. He described Danny, alongside 2005-2006 character Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and 2010-2012 character Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) as all \\"basically soppy, sappy, slightly annoying plus-ones to far superior females\\". ==References *Danny Pink at the BBC One Doctor Who website Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Fictional soldiers Category:Male characters in television Category:Recurring characters in Doctor Who Category:Fictional Black British people ","title":"Danny Pink"},{"id":"42032066","text":"G Krishnaiyyah was an Indian Administrative Service Officer who was killed in Bihar by the mob led by a few politicians.

A study for high accuracy measurement of residual stress by deep hole drilling technique Journal of Physics: Conference Series 379, 2012 DHD is a semi-destructive mechanical strain relaxation (MSR) technique, which seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of a drilled reference hole. The process is unique in its ability to measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over , without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered deep in comparison to other hole drilling techniques such as centre hole drilling.VEQTER Ltd - Centre Hole Drilling . Retrieved on 25 February 2014 == Technique overview == DHD involves drilling a hole through the thickness of the component, measuring the diameter of the hole, trepanning (cutting a circular slot around the hole) a core of material from around the hole and finally re-measuring the diameter of the hole.A.H. Mahmoudi et al. A New Procedure to Measure Near Yield Residual Stresses Using the Deep Hole Drilling Technique Experimental Mechanics, 2009 For engineering metals, the trepanning process is typically performed using electrical discharge machining (EDM) to minimise the introduction of further stresses during the cutting. The differences between the measured diameters before and after stress release enables the original residual stresses to be calculated using elasticity theory. An animated YouTube video explaining the DHD technique can be viewed here: YouTube: Deep Hole Drilling Technique. === DHD procedure === The stages of Deep Hole Drilling (DHD) measurement process. Firstly, reference bushes are attached to the front and back surfaces of the component at the measurement location, to minimise \\"bell-mouthing\\" and assist with aligning the data sets during analysis. A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a gun-drill is typically used due to the smooth and straight hole profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an air probe. This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the air probe is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated transducer to convert the pressure change into a voltage.R.H.Leggatt et al. Development and Experimental Validation of the Deep Hole Method for Residual Stress Measurement The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design 1996 31: 177 A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using electro-discharge machining (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior to the trepanning. === Incremental DHD technique (iDHD) === If high magnitude residual stresses (>60% yield stress) are present in the component then the DHD technique can be modified to account for plastic behaviour during the stress relief process. The risk of plastic deformation during stress relaxation is a problem in hole drilling techniques due to the approximately x3 stress concentrating factor of holes, effectively \\"amplifying\\" the stress relaxation and increasing the chance of yielding.S.P.Timoshenko Mechanics of Materials - Third S.I Edition.Chapman & Hall 1991, 120-123, . Therefore, for iDHD, the procedure is changed to be performed incrementally, with the core being cut (trepanned) in several steps of increasing depth and the diameter measurements being performed in between each step. The analysis then incorporates this sequence of incremental distortions for calculating the high magnitude residual stresses. == Interpretation of the results == The DHD method seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of the reference hole.Practical Residual Stress Measurement Methods. Wiley 2013, 65-87, . The relationship between the original residual stresses acting on the reference hole and the measured changes in the hole diameter creates the basis of the analysis. The DHD technique uses an elastic analysis to convert the measured distortions of the reference hole into a residual stress profile.R.H.Leggatt et al. Development and Experimental Validation of the Deep Hole Method for Residual Stress Measurement. Wiley 2013, 65-87, . The accuracy of the results is dependent on sources of error in the measurement, but is also dependent on the elastic modulus of the material. A lower elastic modulus will result in larger distortions for a given stress release, meaning a higher measurement resolution and thus a greater achievable accuracy. The DHD technique has a nominal accuracy of ±10MPa for Aluminium, ±30MPa for Steel and ±15MPa for Titanium.VEQTER Ltd - Deep Hole Drilling . Retrieved on 13 March 2014 == Appraisal of the DHD technique == Advantages and disadvantages of DHD, relative to other residual stress measurement techniques, are listed below. === Advantages === * Residual stresses can be measured at depths up to . * Semi-destructive – enabling repeated residual stress measurements at many different stages in component life. * The equipment required is portable enough for measurements to be performed on-site as well as in a laboratory. * A through-thickness bi-axial residual stress distribution is measured (e.g. σxx, σyy and τxy), including stress gradients. σzz can be measured but with extra difficulty and reduced accuracy. * High magnitude residual stresses can be measured with iDHD, i.e. plasticity can be accounted for. * Applicable to both simple and complex component shapes. * Applicable to a wide range of materials, both metallic and non-metallic. * Indifferent to grain structure of component material. * Counter rotational Drilling is best for accuracy * The process is fast, relative to the quantity of information produced. * Extracted cylinder of material provides stress-free sample for further material tests and validations === Disadvantages === * Semi-invasive – the resultant hole might need to be re-filled or a mock-up be provided. * Not applicable through components of less than thickness. == Validation == A comparison of various residual stress measurement techniques on a bent beam component.

By the deaths of two elder brothers, Charles and Edward, Gore became heir to the estate. After receiving some instruction from Thomas Tully at Tetbury grammar school he matriculated as gentleman-commoner of Magdalen College, Oxford, on 22 May 1650, and graduated B.A. From university he went to Lincoln's Inn. After the death of his mother, 3 January 1655, Gore retired to his patrimony at Alderton, and devoted himself to the study of heraldry and antiquities. He was sworn a gentleman of the privy chamber in ordinary, 13 November 1667. In 1681 he was elected high sheriff of Wiltshire. Gore was a friend of John Aubrey, but they eventually fell out. He died at Alderton, on 31 March 1684, and was buried in the church; his monument is against the north wall of the chancel. His library of books and manuscripts on heraldry passed eventually to George Montagu. ==Works== Gore published: *Nomenclator Geographicus Latino-Anglicus et Anglico-Latinus, alphabeticè digestus; complectens plerorumque omnium M.

Another edition, enlarged, as Catalogus in certa capita, seu classes, alphabetico ordine concinatus, was issued, Oxford 1674. He also published A Table shewing how to blazon a Coat ten several ways (1655), taken verbatim from Sir John Ferne's Blazon of Gentrie (1586). Some acts of his under-officers as sheriff led Gore to publish a declaration entitled Loyalty displayed, and Falshood unmask'd, … in a Letter to a Friend, London, 1681. Some of his manuscripts went to the British Museum; one, Spicilegia Heraldica, was sold in James Bindley's sale in December 1818. ==Family== By his marriage at Bristol, on 18 September 1656, to Mary, daughter of Michael Meredith, of Southwoode, Gloucestershire, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Langton, alderman of Bristol, Gore had children: * Thomas, born 17 December 1665 and married to Frances, fifth and youngest daughter of John Eyre of Little Cheldfield, Wiltshire; * Edward, who died 22 September 1676; and * Mary, born in February 1663, who became the wife of Thomas Polden of Imber.

He only made a solitary appearance during that campaign, but the following year he established himself as the Steamers' first-choice hooker. Despite a disappointing season for his side in 2013, Harris' individual performances were impressive. Initially, he was not named in any of New Zealand's five Super Rugby franchises squads for the 2014 Super Rugby season. But, the defending champion , who had selected Hika Elliot, Mahonri Schwalger and Rhys Marshall as their hookers were struck with a selection crisis as Elliot and Schwalger went down with injuries prior to the start of the season. This opened the door for Harris to join the Hamilton based outfit on a short-term contract. He made his super rugby debut in week 1 of the season as the Chiefs defeated the in Christchurch. ==International careerEarly career=== Harris was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 side which finished as runners-up in the 2012 IRB Junior World Championship in South Africa. Harris was first-choice hooker during the competition, with his back up being future Chiefs teammate Rhys Marshall, who he later backed up. Harris made his international debut for New Zealand in round 5 of the 2014 Rugby Championship, replacing the great Keven Mealamu with nine minutes to go. This came after Harris and prop Joe Moody were added to the squad as injury cover. Harris made his first international start in his second test for the All Blacks, scoring the opening try against the United States in the first two minutes. Harris was unfortunately injured ten minutes later, being replaced by Mealamu. The All Blacks went on to demolish the States 74-6. ===2015-2016=== After missing all of international rugby in 2015 due to injury, Harris was re-selected for the All Blacks in the 32-man squad to face Wales in 2016. Harris replaced Dane Coles off the bench in the first and second tests of the series, scoring the winning try of the first test long after the whistle was blown, allowing the All Blacks to win 39-21. Harris only managed 13 minutes of game-time across the series however, due to the dominance of Coles, who was later nominated for World Rugby Player of the Year in 2016. Harris was named to start in the first test of the Bledisloe Cup against Australia that year, but was replaced by Codie Taylor due to snapping his ACL prior to the test. Harris missed the rest of 2016 due to injury. ===2017-2019=== Harris was selected for the 2017 series against the British and Irish Lions, replacing Codie Taylor in the warm-up 78-0 demolition of Samoa the week before the first test. Harris performed incredibly well throwing the lineout ball, with the All Blacks winning all nine of Harris' throws. This saw Harris chosen to replace Taylor off the bench in all three tests against the Lions. Harris only played 23 minutes of game time across the series unfortunately, with Taylor being one of the standout performers of the series. Harris stayed injury-free for the rest of 2017 and played another five times in the year. Harris started against the Barbarians on the end-of-year tour. Despite a great performance for most of the fixture, Harris silenced critics by scoring a great try. Harris was replaced by debutant Asafo Aumua with 12 minutes left. Harris started again on tour against a French XV before making way for Aumua with 14 minutes to go. Harris made two more appearances for the All Blacks on the end-of-year tour, replacing Taylor- the clear first-choice hooker, off the bench in wins against Scotland and Wales. Harris replaced Taylor off the bench in the first two tests of the 2018 French series, but missed the third test due to the birth of his first child. Liam Coltman earned a re-call to international rugby in Harris' absence. He played a total of nine tests off the bench in 2018, but with Dane Coles returning from injury, Harris was once again relegated to the third-choice hooker, for the All Blacks, after the end of the 2018 Rugby Championship. Breaking his leg during the 2019 Mitre 10 Cup meant that Harris was not considered for selection towards the 2019 Rugby World Cup. ==References== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Rugby union players from Tauranga Category:People educated at Tauranga Boys' College Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:Bay of Plenty rugby union players Category:Chiefs (rugby union) players Category:Rugby union hookers ","title":"Nathan Harris (rugby union)"},{"id":"42032265","text":"Ormetica taeniata is a moth of the family Erebidae.

The story of Sekachu begins with Renri Ōmi's younger sister Kokoro being discharged from the hospital. When he and his friends are cleaning out the Erdõs dormitory, they find various clues which guide them to a mysterious object. The gameplay in Sekachu follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters by the player character. The game was a commercial success at the time of its release, however, sales declined later on that year. ==Gameplay== Average dialogue and narrative in Sekachu depicting the player character Renri Ōmi talking to (from left to right): Ataru Nishō, Minori Tsukidate, Kokoro Ōmi, Haruka Akane, and Aira Shiratori. Sekachu is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Renri Ōmi. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Renri is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. There are four main plot lines (and a bonus route) that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. There are scenes depicting Renri and a given heroine having sex. ==PlotSetting=== Most of Sekachu's story takes place during spring break in the fictional , which is famous for its math and science courses. This prestigious academy also has a total of eighty eight dormitories. A few students, who attend Kaginomori, are residents of the dormitory. The game, set in the countryside, combines harem and fantasy elements together. ===Story and characters=== , the main heroine of Sekachu, is being discharged from the hospital. She is a sweet girl who is loved by everyone, and despite her weak constitution, has a bright and lively personality. Kokoro is to join her older brother , the player character, at Kaginomori Academy, and board the Erdõs dormitory. Renri is serious, but caring, and his nagging has earned him the nickname \\"okā-san\\". He and his friends decide to clean out Erdõs, for Kokoro, and while cleaning out the attic, they discover mysterious keys and incantation-like words, which are clues guiding them to a secret room housing a gigantic object. This is referred to as the \\"Celestial Globe\\" by the main characters. Another heroine includes , a beautiful and intelligent girl, appearing to be very ladylike. However, she is fun-loving outside of school. Renri makes other friends during his stay in Kaginomori, such as , an extremely quiet girl who only seems to talk to him. Much of the time, Aira does not change her facial expression. Renri's senpai, , is a genius with dreadful sleeping habits, and tends to speak slowly. She has a pair of dog ears, and a tail. ==Development== The production and planning of Sekachu began right after Hanairo Heptagram, another work by Lump of Sugar. The game was originally going to be called , but in mid-development, Celery and Tetsujin wanted to change the title, and searched in bookstores for inspiration. Later on, Tetsujin proposed the idea of Sekai to Sekai no Mannaka de, for a title. Celery directed the game, and wrote the scenario; Tetsujin and Tamaki Ichikawa also contributed to the writing. The character designer was Fumitake Moekibara, who has drawn many character designs in previous Lump of Sugar games, such as Nursery Rhyme, Itsuka, Todoku, Ano Sora ni, and Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity. The game's music was composed entirely by Shigenobu Ōkawa. ===Release history=== The game's official website opened on August 21, 2013. This site would update information pertaining to the self-described , Sekachu. Before any copies of the game were released, there were two free trial downloads. The first of these was made available on November 8, 2013, and the second on December 30, 2013. Both of these versions included adult content. The game was postponed for a month, before being released as a limited edition DVD-ROM for Windows PCs on January 31, 2014. A full version of the game was put up for download on the official website - this time, not for free - on October 2, 2015. ==Related mediaBooks and publications=== If pre-ordered, then the limited edition of Sekachu packaging would include a reservation-only booklet, titled Sekachu Confidential Official Book. A 127-page visual fan book was released by Kadokawa Shoten on June 27, 2014. Before the game's release, Sekachu received a fair amount of publicity in bishōjo magazines such as Tech Gian, Dengeki Hime, BugBug, Push!!, and Pasocom Paradise. ===Music and audio CDs=== Sekachu has three theme songs: , the first opening theme, and \\"Recollections\\", the ending theme, were sung by Kicco. Aira's voice actress, Haruru Aikaze, performed \\"Sing a Song\\", the only insert song in the game. A maxi single came bundled with the limited edition's release, containing the three songs and their instrumental versions. The background music of Sekachu was released in an original soundtrack on January 31, 2014, along with the limited edition's release. ==Reception== Sekachu ranked first in terms of national sales of PC games in Japan, in February 2014. Also, Sekachu was No. 1 in the January 2014 sales ranking on Getchu.com, a major redistributor of visual novel and domestic anime products. The sales of Sekachu quickly decreased, only ranking at No. 24 the following month on the website. As for the whole year, the game was ranked at No. 18. Sekachu is part of Bushiroad's Chaos TCG trading card game series, and has been released as a booster pack. ==References *Official website * Category:Eroge Category:Visual novels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Bishōjo games Category:Romance video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:2014 video games ","title":"Sekai to Sekai no Mannaka de"},{"id":"42032327","text":"Map of the Peloponnese with its principal locations during the late Middle Ages Saint George of Polyphengos (Sancto Georgio de Polifengno in a 1377 document) or simply Polyphengos (; Polifant in the French Chronicle of the Morea) was a fortress and settlement of the Frankish Principality of Achaea in the Peloponnese. The settlement of Saint George was situated on the plain some 3 km from ancient Nemea, and occupied the space of the modern town of Nemea, while the fortress was situated on the top of Mount Polyphengos and controlled one of the passes leading from the plateau of Arcadia to the lowlands of the Argolic Gulf. In September 1320, the Greeks under Andronikos Asen captured the fortress of Saint George in Skorta and defeated a relief force. They immediately followed up this success by advancing against the fortresses of Karytaina, Akova and Polyphengos and obtaining their surrender by bribing their commanders. This success gave the Greeks a strategic advantage as all these fortresses controlled passages through the mountains from the interior plateau to the still Frankish-held coastal plains. Polyphengos, however, may have been recaptured by the Franks some time after, as it appears in a list of fiefs of the Principality of Achaea in 1377. ==ReferencesSources== * Category:Medieval Corinthia Category:Castles and fortifications of the Principality of Achaea ","title":"Polyphengos"},{"id":"42032330","text":"Muyu Urqu (Quechua muyu circle, urqu mountain,Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) \\"circle mountain\\", Hispanicized spellings Muyuorco, Muyuorcco, Muyu Orcco, Muyu Orco, also Muyu Orqo, Muyuorqo, Muyu Urqo) is an archaeological site and a prominent hill in Peru.drc-cusco.gob.pe/ \\"Distrito de Santiago - Sitio Arqueológico de Muyuorqo\\", retrieved on February 24, 2014 (in Spanish) It is situated in the Cusco Region, Cusco Province, Santiago District,escale.minedu.gob.pe - UGEL map of the Cusco Province (Cusco Region) east of the mountain Araway Qhata, at the right bank of Watanay River.

It was released on February 21, 2014, by SPV. A vinyl version of Beyond was released on March 14, 2014. Beyond marked the return of founding member, bassist Ilker Ersin, and the addition of Ramy Ali on drums. ==Critical reception== Beyond received generally very positive reviews upon release, although the majority of these reviews were by genre-related or genre-specific reviewers. Examples of these included: In a 9/10 review for The Metal Observer and commenting on a return to form for Freedom Call, Jonathan Smith wrote: At its inception, this album makes little secret of which creative well it’s drawing from. The first eight songs are all but a perfect mixture of the speed happy character of Eternity meshed with the anthem-driven, catchy fanfare of Crystal Empire. In particular, “Union Of The Strong, “Knights Of Taragon” and “Heart Of A Warrior” all but kick the listener into a fit of déjà vu that recalls how this band’s much lauded third album began. Familiar melodies are reworked a bit and the lead guitar work of Lars Rettkowitz is a bit more mellow and methodical than Sascha Gershow’s technical work, but the speed and majestic consonance of each moment begs for a fist to the sky. In an unscored but favorable review for Metal Injection, Shayne Mathis wrote: ...Freedom Call have consistently released album after album of fun, hyper-melodic power metal that's only gotten better with time, and Beyond may be the band's best album yet. These Germans may not be the most creative or adventurous power metal band out there, but they're definitely one of the most enjoyable. Unless you're a total sourpuss, it's impossible to listen to this album without feeling the urge to smile (or battle a dragon while soaring on the wings of an eagle). He continued: Despite the mammoth running time and rote formula the songs lapse into occasionally, Beyond is still an entertaining record for fans of triumphant metal. This is an album best experienced blasting through car speakers with the windows rolled down on the way to meet your friends for beers and good times. In a 7.5/10 review for Hardrockhaven.net, Justin Gaines wrote: Freedom Call – a.k.a. the happiest power metal band in the universe – are back with a new studio offering... ...titled Beyond. The long-running German band took a risk with their last album – 2012’s Land of the Crimson Dawn – where they mixed in quirky, Edguy-style rock songs with their usual shiny, happy, power metal. It wasn’t terribly well received, so the band is back on (very) familiar territory with Beyond. If you have at least one older Freedom Call album, you probably know what to expect from Beyond. The band basically takes the Helloween formula and makes it even faster and more melodic. Between Chris Bay’s melodic guitar work and his high-pitched vocals, it’s hard to sit still when a Freedom Call album is playing. Beyond takes the band back to the familiar lyrical territory of warriors, enchanted lands and unity in metal. Yes, it’s cheesy and yes, it’s a little weird to hear battle hymns sung in such a high octave, but it’s so damned hard to resist when these guys get going. ==Track listingPersonnel== *Chris Bay – vocals, guitar *Lars Rettkowitz – rhythm guitar *Ilker Ersin – bass guitar *Ramy Ali – drums ==Charts== * Czech Republic #38 (Album charts) * Germany #33 (Media Market/Saturn Charts) * Germany #41 (Album charts) * Sweden #15 (Hard rock charts) * Sweden #99 (Album charts) * Switzerland #74 ==References External links == * Official website of Freedom Call * INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS BAY FROM FREEDOM CALL ABOUT NEW ALBUM \\" BEYOND \\" 2014 BY ROCKNLIVE PROD * FREEDOM CALL - \\"Union Of The Strong\\" (OFFICIAL VIDEO) (Beyond) Category:2014 albums Category:Freedom Call albums Category:SPV/Steamhammer albums ","title":"Beyond (Freedom Call album)"},{"id":"42032386","text":"Bholagoria is a village located in Panrui, Birbhum district, West Bengal, India.

This earlier foundation gave rise to the abbey sometimes being called Kilcolman, meaning Church of Colman.James Carmody, 'The Abbey of Killagha, Parish of Kilcoleman, County Kerry', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fifth Series, Vol. 36, No. 3, 285 The abbey was established by Geoffrey de Marisco, Justicier of Ireland, an Anglo-Norman nobleman who had received large grants of land in Munster from John, King of England. The abbey, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was occupied by Canons Regular of the Order of St Augustine until its suppression in 1576 during the Reformation in Ireland. It was a very wealthy institution, owning large amounts of land across Munster, and the Prior of Killagha was a member of the Irish House of Lords. It paid the third highest rate of tax in the Diocese of Ardfert in 1302.James Carmody, 'The Abbey of Killagha, Parish of Kilcoleman, County Kerry', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fifth Series, Vol. 36, No. 3, 287 The large east window was added in the 15th century. Killagha was a notable destination for pilgrims, and it became well known for its beautiful setting, hence the name 'Bello Loco'. Its distance from Dublin meant that it was dissolved later than most abbeys in Ireland. However, its proximity to the fortress at Castlemaine during the Desmond Rebellions brought it to the attention of The Crown, which gave orders for the establishment to be closed. Following the abbey's seizure by the Crown, the buildings and land were leased to Thomas Clinton, one of Queen Elizabeth I's officers in County Kerry. On 12 December 1588, the Crown transferred the abbey and its estate to Captain Thomas Spring of Castlemaine, a Protestant nobleman who had served with distinction during the Desmond Rebellions and was a grandson of Thomas Spring of Lavenham.James Carmody, 'The Abbey of Killagha, Parish of Kilcoleman, County Kerry', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fifth Series, Vol. 36, No. 3, 290Michael C.

The grant included a special clause to rebuild the domestic buildings of the abbey in a castle-like manner, so that the building could serve as a defensive structure. Captain Thomas Spring's son, Walter Spring, was High Sheriff of Kerry in 1609.Michael C. O'Laughlin, Families of Co. Kerry, Ireland (Irish Roots Cafe, 1994), 137. His grandson, Walter Spring, was raised as a Roman Catholic and fought in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. As a result, the abbey was attacked by a Cromwellian army during the Irish Confederate Wars. The fortified domestic buildings were demolished by cannon fire, while the church was partially damaged. Following the suppression of the rebellion, almost all of Walter Spring's lands were seized by Oliver Cromwell and he was subsequently dubbed 'The Unfortunate'.

In pursuing support for these children, she has established two schools, a college, a respite home and a website with over 50,000 international followers. Kennedy was appointed an OBE (Royal Reward for Inspirational Mother) Award by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2012 for her services. Kennedy is the special education correspondent of the psychology website Psychreg. ==Early life== Born in Middlesbrough to Maria and Antonino Sammarone, she studied at Sacred Heart School Middlesbrough. Before leaving for Italy, she had set up a dance school, which was owned and run by her for a number of years. She married Sean Kennedy, a qualified legal solicitor, in 1998. They had two sons, Patrick and Angelo; when the boys reached school age, Kennedy then discovered that they were affected with autism spectrum disorders. It was difficult for Anna and Sean to find a suitable education for their eight-year-old, affected by Asperger Syndrome and five-year-old with autism; they started a support group in their home, which grew rapidly and was joined by 275 families. They remortgaged their house in order to raise funds to open a school with special educational needs for their children. ==Hillingdon Manor School== Anna and her husband prepared a feasibility report to convert a local school, which was apparently due to be demolished, into a school for special needs children. Volunteers were also coming out to help them, including carpenters, electricians and painters. Anna also approached the probation service for volunteers to come and help. Hillingdon Manor School for autistic children opened in 1999, with only 19 pupils. Initially, this school had places for 14 children, later increased to 63 places by 2002. The funding for places by the local authority was based upon the condition that parents of autistic children select this school as a suitable place for their special children's needs. This school is now building a brighter future with safe and structured education for 150 special children. The school was subject to an emergency Ofsted report in January 2017, the report for which was published in March. The inspection found that the school did not meet all of the independent school standards that were examined during the inspection. Deficiencies found included out-of-date \\"safeguarding policy documents\\", an insufficiently robust approach to \\"safer recruitment\\", including \\"prohibition orders\\" and vetting, lacked a \\"written risk assessment policy\\", and its \\"health and safety policy\\" was sparse, and in need of updating, referring to the \\"new government\\" of 2010, among other faults. The report also stated, \\"The school is a safe and secure learning environment and pupils behave well. There are high ratios of staff to pupils and leaders have ensured that staff members are deployed effectively.\\" ==Online presence== She has more than 50,000 online followers through her website including the parents of autistic children, professionals, media and those who are concerned with Autism. She is constantly creating awareness about Autism and making efforts to raise funds in order to continue their work. ==Training== Anna also provides training for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and Child line with regards to the disability bullying issue and create awareness about autism all over the UK. ==Not Stupid== In 2009, Anna wrote a book named, Not Stupid which was about the struggle she had to set up the school for her kids. Based on the story of a mother who fights to rescue the lives of her children from autism this bestselling biography is available on Amazon. ==DVD== A fitness DVD, 'Step in The Right Direction' was a groundbreaking project which features a dance DVD, offering a clear picture of Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). It has been launched in Birmingham at the British Institute of Learning Disabilities Conference. ==Daisy Chain== Anna accepted a role as Patron in a bid to boost the profile of a charity called the Daisy Chain Charity which helps support families with autistic children. She has visited Calf Fallow farm, the home of Daisy Chain, to meet staff and see for herself the work being done there. \\"This is really very good, I am very impressed,\\" she said afterwards. The space available here is fantastic and just what is needed as we move forward and develop the services Daisy Chain provides. I am really excited about coming on board at this stage of development.\\" ==Autism Got Talent== It was the first talent show organised by Anna on 12 May 2012. In this show, children and adults with autism performed on the stage at London's Mermaid Theatre. A performance from James Hobley, an autistic dancer, was also included in this show who had appeared on Britain’s Got Talent. ==Other activities== During Autism Awareness Month, April 2013, ABA and Anna launched their 'Give Us a Break' campaign. This campaign aimed to raise awareness about the bullying of autistic children in school and colleges, particularly during break times, highlighted the need for autistic children to feel safe by providing them opportunities to indulge in positive activities and to encourage schools and colleges to share the ways they can improve their social skills and keep them safe too. She highlighted the activities that can keep children from bullying during lunch times. She also emphasised that there should be a strong communication between the parents and school which comes up with a 24-hour curriculum for the children in order to get a better idea about their behaviour all day and to prevent them getting mixed messages by parents and teachers. In 2001, Anna also set up a community college for adults. The former Prime Minister's wife, Samantha Cameron, was invited to the official opening of a specialist school set up by Anna Kennedy in Kent, South East London. ==Awards== Kennedy was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honors by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, for her services and campaigning work for autistic children. She won an award named, 'Woman of the Year' in 2009 which runs with the collaboration of The Observer and Smooth Radio. Kennedy received the Institute of Directors Chairman's special award for her contributions to the community. She is the \\"Achieving Mum of the Year\\" of Tesco Mum of the Year Awards 2013 for her campaigning work for autistic children. She is an ambassador for the Outcomes First Group. ==Media== Anna's story has been published in various magazines and newspapers, and appeared as 'pick of the day' an hour long Video Diary Documentary on BBC. Anna's story and the work she has been involved with was also discussed in depth in an episode of The Autism Podcast. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Autism activists Category:Living people Category:Special education in the United Kingdom Category:National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people Category:British women activists Category:People from Middlesbrough ","title":"Anna Kennedy"},{"id":"42032523","text":"Luke Demetre (born 22 March 1990) is a Canadian bobsledder from Nova Scotia.

A reduction in the tax burden of about €80 was announced for those earning less than €1,500 per month. In September the government brought the Jobs Act before Parliament, which provided for, among other things, the abolition of Article 18 of the Workers' Statute, which protected workers from unjustified dismissal. The proposal was heavily criticised by the largest Italian trade union, the General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) and its leaders Susanna Camusso and Maurizio Landini. Moreover, the left-wing of the Democratic Party, by then led by the former National Secretary Pier Luigi Bersani, criticised the government for the reform, threatening to vote against it. On 29 September, the National Committee of the Democratic Party voted to support the Jobs Act, despite the disagreements within the party, with 130 votes in favour, 20 against and 11 abstaining. On 9 October the Italian Senate voted to approve the Jobs Act, and the landmark reform passed with 165 votes in favour to 111 against, marking the first step for the most ambitious economic legislation of the eight-month-old government.

On 25 November, the Chamber of Deputies approved the Jobs Act with 316 votes, but the Five Star, Lega Nord and almost forty members of the Democratic Party abstained from the vote to protest against the reform.

He managed 1 try in 4 games in his first season of provincial rugby and was subsequently promoted to the full squad for 2014. His second season saw him feature in all 10 of Harbour's championship matches and score 3 tries as the men from Auckland's North Shore finished in 5th place on the log, just missing out on the promotion play offs.
