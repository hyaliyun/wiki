Rare was launched as a startup in 2013 by a team of journalists, marketers and business executives at Atlanta-based Cox Media Group. Rare's slogan is, “America's News Feed\\", describing itself as a \\"news, political, and lifestyle social content hub\\". The publication's first editor in chief was Brett M. Decker, formerly an editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal and editorial page editor of The Washington Times. Will Alford, one of the site's original founders and a former newsroom director at The Atlanta Journal- Constitution, became acting editor after Decker left. Betsi Fores, formerly of The Daily Caller, became Rare's managing editor, and Jack Hunter, former aide to U.S. Senator Rand Paul, became the politics editor after resigning from his Senate job. ==History== Rare launched at a Newseum gala on April 15, 2013, and acquired 25 million page views within its first year. The website was aimed at a younger, center-right audience, and early contributors brought in by Decker's team included Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Grover Norquist. Rare has been described as libertarian-conservative and has been compared to the websites Independent Journal Review, BuzzFeed, and The Huffington Post. Their original tagline, \\"Red is the Center\\" referred to an editorial position where conservative thinking was at the heart of American success. In 2014, their tagline became “America's News Feed”, reflecting more mainstream, high- traffic, popular content targeting a younger, socially engaged audience. In March 2018, editors for the site said Cox had decided to cease publication. Following a mass layoff of over 50 staffers, the site and its affiliated web properties were purchased by Texas-based Wide Open Media Group. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official website *Rare Brings Its Patriotic, Country Music-Loving Audience To Bat For Advertisers Category:American news websites Category:Libertarianism Category:Conservative media in the United States Category:American political websites ","title":"Rare (website)"},{"id":"46902853","text":"Cruffin at Mr. Holmes BakehouseAssorted box of cruffins by Lune CroissanterieA cruffin is a hybrid of a croissant and a muffin.

The episode premiered in the United States on NBC on April 28, 2014. ==Plot== After a politician in Prague is framed for a murder, Red suspects it's the work of The Kingmaker (guest star Linus Roache) – a strategist behind the rise of some of the world's most powerful politicians. Red is seen meeting with an ally about the Prague matter, and the man tells him that the recent news of a siege on Red's interests is causing several key people to start distancing themselves. Elizabeth views the photos that Tom had led her to, which show Red at the hospital where her adoptive father Sam had died. She confronts Red about it, but he steers her toward the more urgent matter of The Kingmaker being in the U.S. Elizabeth and the team are able to uncover a plot by The Kingmaker to run the car of a New York Congressman off a bridge, attempting to make him look like a hero by saving his family. This puts him in the best position to win a special election for a Senate seat, which The Kingmaker vacates by killing the Senator. Alarms go off in the home where the murder is committed, with Ressler and Liz entering the home. The Kingmaker attacks Elizabeth and applies a choke hold, before being fatally shot by Ressler. Red meets with Fitch, telling him his businesses are under attack and suggesting it's a mutual problem, and proposes that they cooperate against their common enemy. Fitch meets with members of his global alliance, then tells Red they have chosen not to ally themselves with him, despite Red's threats to expose them. Elizabeth phones Red to inform him about The Kingmaker. Red says he wants 10 minutes with the man to find out who ordered the Prague incident, but Liz has to tell him that The Kingmaker is dead. Elizabeth then visits Red about her adoptive father, with Red finally admitting he killed Sam.

His approach is a mixture of sculpture, installation, theatrical design, architecture, and landscape design. Media include metal, glass, concrete, fiberglass, gravel, LEDs, lasers, neon, solar panels, radar detectors, photo-voltaic cells, infra-red cameras, motors, searchlights, and occasionally elements such as fire, water, and smoke.

He was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Whitehouse was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Nuneaton and at Bristol University and had completed his studies before turning his full-time attention to cricket, though he had played second eleven cricket for Warwickshire from 1969. His first-class cricket debut in May 1971 was a minor cricket sensation: opening the batting against the admittedly weak bowling of Oxford University, he scored 173 out of a Warwickshire total of 324, with 38 not out in the second innings. At the time it was the fourth highest score ever by an English player making his debut. Warwickshire's strong batting line-up was rejigged to accommodate him, initially as a middle-order batsman, later as the opening partner to England Test batsman John Jameson, though it was with Billy Ibadulla that he put on 223 for the first wicket against Nottinghamshire, making 122, his second century, in August 1971. He finished the season with 1295 runs at an average of 38.08. He was also named Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year for the 1971 season. Following this impressive start, Whitehouse's first-class cricket career stalled. In both 1972 and 1973, he failed to pass 1,000 runs for the season and he also failed to add to his tally of centuries; in the second of these seasons, however, he was awarded his county cap. He took the whole of the 1974 season off from cricket to prepare for his professional accountancy examinations. Warwickshire made Whitehouse wait before recalling him to the first team in June 1975, but when they did he produced much better form, with two centuries in three matches. He fell just short of 1,000 runs in that season, but his average rose to 33.44 and he had developed into a fine slip fielder, taking 24 catches in just 16 first-class games. The next two years were Whitehouse's best in first- class cricket. In 1976, he scored 1363 runs with an average of 35.86 and two centuries; in 1977 he raised that to 1543 runs at 42.86 and six centuries. He did not exceed his debut score of 173 in these seasons, though he had reached an unbeaten 169 in the 1976 match against Yorkshire and shared in a fourth- wicket partnership of 266 with Rohan Kanhai which remains a record for games between these sides, when the innings was ended under the rule of the time which restricted first innings to 100 overs. He was also successful in 1976 in limited overs cricket and scored his only List A match century in the Gillette Cup match against Glamorgan, an innings of 109. At the end of the 1977 season, the Warwickshire captain, David Brown, retired from full-time cricket and Whitehouse was picked to replace him. It was a difficult time for Warwickshire as several established players had retired and others, including the England Test player Dennis Amiss, were involved in the World Series Cricket breakaway group, and feelings within Warwickshire particularly ran high about their continued involvement in domestic cricket. Whitehouse won praise for steering the cricket team through these difficulties, but his own form suffered and in neither 1978 nor 1979, the years of his captaincy, did he maintain his batting form: he failed to score 1000 runs in both seasons, and his average was barely above 20. He resigned from the captaincy after the 1979 season and returned to his best form in the 10 matches he played in 1980; these included the County Championship match against Glamorgan in which he finally beat his debut score of 1971 by making a second innings 197 to save the match. At the end of the 1980 season he retired from first-class and List A cricket. After retiring from playing, Whitehouse had a successful business career, and later returned to Warwickshire as honorary treasurer; but he resigned in 2000, saying he was disillusioned with cricket. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricket captains Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers ","title":"John Whitehouse (cricketer)"},{"id":"46902999","text":"\\"Berlin\\" is the twenty-first episode of the first season of the American crime drama The Blacklist. The episode premiered in the United States on NBC on May 5, 2014. ==Plot== Elizabeth tells Ressler, and then the FBI, her story about Tom. In the midst of a virus outbreak inside a bank, Elizabeth refuses to work with Red and sends Cooper her resignation, informing him that Red killed her father. Red tries to explain to her that the outbreak is connected to Tom, and ask if her anger towards him (Red) is above putting lives at risk. Elizabeth agrees to work the case, but declares it her last. Red is certain that the Cullen virus is part of a plan to kill him, as well as being capable of creating a widespread epidemic. Red and Elizabeth meet with Dr. Sanders (John Glover), an expert on the virus, who is also a mental patient. The conversation gets loony when Dr. Sanders speaks of Space Agent UD-4126 and omens of the Cullen virus leading to the apocalypse. Elizabeth storms out, accusing Red of using the visit as a diversion to change her mind about quitting. Meanwhile, Cooper is given an ultimatum by his superiors: if Elizabeth walks, Red no longer has immunity and the task force is no more. Elizabeth learns that Dr. Sanders had created an antidote for the virus and the team suspects that he was working with another doctor from outside the mental institution. Elizabeth pays Dr. Sanders another visit and noticing the nurse's ID badge number, it turns out that UD-4126 leads to one Dr. Nikolaus Vogel (Brennan Brown). Once he's arrested, he refuses to talk to Elizabeth, except with the warning of Berlin's coming. Elizabeth had laced his drinking water with the virus, and uses the antidote to blackmail him into talking. Using Tom's code book—which Red had given to her earlier as an “olive branch”—Elizabeth discovers connections among several members of Red's Blacklist, deciphering that he knew someone was targeting his interests, but not specifically who it is. He's been using his relationship with the FBI task force to systematically eliminate his enemies and draw Berlin out of hiding. Dr. Vogel gives up the names of 5 people involved in a prison plane transport, all airport employees infected with Cullen. Elizabeth begins to have a change of heart about leaving, but Cooper tells her it's too late. She finds Red and warns him about the FBI's pursuit and his immunity. She begs him to run, but he refuses, wanting to know about her sudden change of heart. Elizabeth goes on to tell Red how much she wants to kill him for ruining her life, but that she also needs answers from him. He tells her that he needs things from her also, and that nothing is worse than losing her. It becomes apparent to both that they are stuck with each other. As Red surrenders himself, the prison transport plane flies overhead and crashes. The war has begun. ==ReceptionRatings=== \\"Berlin\\" premiered on NBC on May 5, 2014 in the 10–11 p.m. time slot. The episode garnered a 2.7/8 Nielsen rating with 10.47 million viewers, making it the highest rated show in its time slot and the fourth most watched television show of the week. ===Reviews=== Jason Evans of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the episode, stating: \\"Wow… just wow! I love the way the show has now connected many of the random Blacklisters to a larger story. Red and Liz each had some great scenes this episode! Liz turning the tables on Vogel was one of her best moments all season. I can’t wait to see what happens next week!\\" Cory Barker of TV.com gave a mixed review of the episode. He stated: \\"Like many of the 2014 episodes of The Blacklist, \\"Berlin\\" was far from bad, but lacked some of the spark that drove the episodes from last fall. This one delivered a couple of key reveals and certainly set stories and characters up for what could be a crazy, deadly finale. Yet, this second half of the season has been so content to just push the goalposts to the next week that there's no guarantee that the crazy and deadly will ever come.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2014 American television episodes Category:The Blacklist (season 1) episodes ","title":"Berlin (The Blacklist)"},{"id":"46903016","text":"In decision theory, competitive regret is the relative regret compared to an oracle with limited or unlimited power in the process of distribution estimation. ==Competitive regret to the oracle with full power== Consider estimating a discrete probability distribution p on a discrete set \\\\mathcal{X} based on data X, the regret of an estimator q is defined as : \\\\max_{p\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}} r_n (q,p). where \\\\mathcal{P} is the set of all possible probability distribution, and : r_n(q,p) = \\\\mathbb{E} (D(p  q(X))). where D(p  q) is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between p and q. ==Competitive regret to the oracle with limited powerOracle with partial information=== The oracle is restricted to have access to partial information of the true distribution p by knowing the location of p in the parameter space up to a partition. Given a partition \\\\mathbb{P} of the parameter space, and suppose the oracle knows the subset P where the true p \\\\in P. The oracle will have regret as : r_n(P) = \\\\min_q \\\\max_{p\\\\in P} r_n (q,p). The competitive regret to the oracle will be :r_n^\\\\mathbb{P}(q, \\\\mathcal{P}) = \\\\max_{P \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}} (r_n(q,P) - r_n(P)). ===Oracle with partial information=== The oracle knows exactly p, but can only choose the estimator among natural estimators. A natural estimator assigns equal probability to the symbols which appear the same number of time in the sample. The regret of the oracle is :r_n^{nat} (p)= \\\\min_{q\\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q}_{nat}} r_n(q,p), and the competitive regret is :\\\\max_{p \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}} (r_n(q,p) - r_n^{nat} (p)). ==Example== For the estimator q proposed in Acharya et al.(2013), : r_n^{\\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\sigma} (q, \\\\Delta_k) \\\\leq r^{nat}_n(q, \\\\Delta_k) \\\\leq \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{O}} (\\\\min (\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}, \\\\frac{k}{n})).

Most of the buildings in the street date from the years after the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The Carlsberg Foundation is headquartered at No. 5. ==History== Gedde's district map of Copenhagen The street was originally called Benickestræde. In 1543, it is referred to as Per Broliggers Stræde. The name refers to Per Jensen \\"Brolægger\\" who from 1486-1510 owned the lot where No. 14 stands today. He was the first master cobble layer in Copenhagen. His son, Jens Brolægger, was mayor of Copenhagen from 1520. The Taylors' Guild was for a while based where No. 4 and 6 stand today. Their building was also used as a venue for German comedies. From the 1650s, the street was also home to breweries. Knabrostræde connected the south side of the street to the coast at Gammel Strand. Endeløsstræde (\\"Endless Alley\\"), a short cul-de-sac, extended northwards a little further to the east. When the street was rebuilt following the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, Knabrostræde was extended northwards to Vimmelskaftet and Endeløsstræde was later connected to its east side. In 1795, the street was destroyed by the second great fire that hit Copenhagen. Endeløsstræde disappeared when the houses were rebuilt. ==Notable buildings and residents== All the buildings in the street date from the years immediately after the fire of 1795 and all of them are listed on the Danish registry of Protected buildings and Places. The gate at Brolæggerstræde 11 Carlsberg-founder J.C. Jacobsen's first brewery, known as Bryggergården, is located at No. 5. The complex also comprises Knabrostræde 11 and 13 as well as several interconnected rear wings. It was built 1796-99 for another brewer, Nicolai Rindom. J. C. Jacobsen's father, Christian Jacobsen, purchased the brewery in 1826. A plaque above the gate commemorates J. C. Jacobsen and his son Carl Jacobsen. The inscription reads: \\"Brygger, dr.phil. Carl Chr. H. Jacobsen fødtes her den 2den marts 1842. Brygger, kaptajn J. C. Jacobsen foretog her året 1838 de første forsøg med fremstilling af undergæret øl\\". The building was refurbished by the architect Viggo Steen Møller in the early 1950s and now houses the Ny Carlsberg Foundation. Brolæggerstræde 2 The brick building at No. 11 on the opposite side of the street was built for another brewer, Andreas Tronier. A brass plaque to the left of the gate commemorates the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions which had its first home in the building from 1898 until 1950. Gyldenfeldts Gård (Brolæggerstræde 9/Knabrostræde 16) was built for Adjutant General Gyldenfeldt in 1795-98. The other buildings in the street are No.1 (1797, C. F. Hollander), No. 2 (1808), No. 3 (1797, Lauritz Thrane), No. 4 (1808, A. C. Wilcken), No. 6 (1798), No. 8 (1797, C. C.

The episode premiered in the United States on NBC on May 12, 2014. ==Plot== It is revealed that some passengers on the plane were killed in the crash, some are in the hospital, and a few are at large. The members of the task force start being targeted. Agent Malik is killed, and Cooper is strangled and placed into a coma. A guard (Peter Stormare) that was severely injured in the crash is questioned in the hospital, and tells a story of a man in prison whose enemy sent him parts of his dead daughter, one by one, until he managed to escape. Fitch meets with Red, saying that his organization has finally agreed to join forces with Red against Berlin, and he arranges to give Red an opportunity to escape from FBI custody. Red meets with Elizabeth and they continue to try to hunt down Berlin. Red encounters a man (Andrew Howard) believed to be Berlin and tortures him for information. Tom ambushes Elizabeth in her car and drags her into the room with a gun pointed to her head, imploring Red to give himself up. Red kills \\"Berlin\\" and inches closer to Tom. Tom shoots Red in the shoulder, prompting Liz to break free. Elizabeth and Tom scuffle and he is shot by her. With his dying breath, Tom whispers something to Elizabeth. Red says that he realized the man he had just tortured and killed is not Berlin, who is instead revealed to be the injured guard the FBI questioned in the hospital. As Cooper recovers under Ressler's watch, Elizabeth and Ressler discover that Berlin escaped his room and is at large. When agents investigate the room where the bodies of Tom and the fake Berlin should be, Tom's body is gone. Liz meets with Red and says that Tom told her that her father is alive. Red assures Elizabeth that her father definitely died in a fire. Berlin walks the streets carrying a pocket watch with the picture of a little girl, with Red concurrently carrying the same picture that he recovered from the Stewmaker. The season ends with Red removing his shirt to treat his bullet wound, revealing burn scars on his back. ==ReceptionRatings=== \\"Berlin Conclusion\\" premiered on NBC on May 12, 2014 in the 10–11 p.m. time slot. The episode garnered a 2.6/7 Nielsen rating with 10.44 million viewers, making it the second most-watched show in its time slot behind ABC's Castle, which collected 10.59 million viewers. The season finale of the show was also the eighth most watched television show of the week. ===Reviews=== Jason Evans of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the episode, stating: \\"Wow… just jaw dropping. We were promised lots of blood by John Bokenkamp and he delivered, though he managed to keep most of the main characters alive. [...] But, all in all it was a wonderful episode and a great ending to the season. So much fun!\\" Jim McMahon of IGN gave the episode a 7.5/10, stating: \\"The Blacklist wraps up its first season with a hit-and-miss finale as James Spader steals the show once again.\\" He further commented: \\"The first season finale was an almost perfect representation of the show on the whole: uneven, frustrating, and punctuated by thoroughly entertaining scenes with James Spader that made it all worth it.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2014 American television episodes Category:The Blacklist (season 1) episodes ","title":"Berlin Conclusion"},{"id":"46903123","text":"Linda Ruth Barlow is an American author of contemporary romance, historical romance, general fiction, thrillers, and romantic suspense.

Released on 3 June 2015, the work consists of a website hosting an eight-minute video, introductory text and an open comments section. The video shows Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a dorm room at Columbia University in New York City. It was directed by artist Ted Lawson in early 2015, while Sulkowicz was in the final year of a visual- arts degree at Columbia.Cait Munro, \\"Emma Sulkowicz Breaks New Ground With Troubling Video Performance\\", Artnet, 4 June 2015.

(The text notes that the sex was consensual and only appears to be rape.)Erica Schwiegershausen, \\"Emma Sulkowicz Made a Film Addressing Rape\\", New York Magazine, 5 June 2015. The online response in the comments to the video is a central part of the work, described as an example of participatory art. Sulkowicz wanted to know \\"what the public does with [the video], which begins with the way they deal with it from the moment it's disseminated.\\"Cait Munro, \\"Emma Sulkowicz Speaks Out About Her New Video Performance\\", ArtNet, 4 June 2015. Shortly after it appeared, the video was taken offline by a denial-of- service attack.Lauren Gambino, \\"Emma Sulkowicz's This Is Not A Rape site taken down by cyberattack\\", The Guardian, 9 June 2015. By 9 June 2015, there were 2,700 comments on the site, most of them negative or ridiculing.Hannah Rubin, \\"This Is Not About Emma Sulkowicz's Rape — It Is About You\\", The Forward, 9 June 2015.Sarah Seltzer, \\"Vile Comments Are the Most Important Part of Emma Sulkowicz's Graphic New Video\\", Flavorwire, 9 June 2015. Sulkowicz said she strongly believed in the video's importance, but that making it had been a \\"traumatizing\\" experience. ==Background== Emma Sulkowicz, 2014 Emma Sulkowicz, a non-binary artist who uses both she/her and they/them pronouns, obtained a degree in visual arts from Columbia University in 2015.For age, \\"Carry That Weight\\", Emma Sulkowicz interviewed by Roberta Smith, Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Brooklyn Museum, 14 December 2014, c. 48:50 mins.Vanessa Grigoriadis, \\"Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault\\", New York Magazine, 21 September 2014. Sulkowicz's senior thesis and first notable artwork was Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight) (2014–2015), which consisted of Sulkowicz carrying a mattress wherever she went on campus during her final year, in protest against campus sexual assault and the university's handling of a complaint she filed against a student she said anally raped her.Roberta Smith, \\"In a Mattress, a Lever for Art and Political Protest\\", The New York Times, 21 September 2014. The university cleared the student of responsibility; the district attorney's office declined to pursue criminal charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion. Max Kutner, \\"The Anti-Mattress Protest\\", Newsweek, 28 April 2015. ==WorkOverview=== Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol consists of a website that hosts a video, an introductory text and an open comments section. Its existence was made public by a Facebook post from the video's director, Ted Lawson. Sulkowicz says she had the idea for the piece in December 2014, and that performance artist Marina Abramović put her in touch with Lawson to direct it. Lawson told ArtNet that he thought the piece was \\"super risky\\" and courageous. Sulkowicz stressed that it was a separate piece from Mattress Performance. Sulkowicz wrote the script and introductory text, chose the position of the cameras, the lighting and the appearance of it having been filmed by security cameras. The scene was filmed in one continuous take three times during the Columbia spring break in March 2015. According to Lawson, Sulkowicz had \\"insisted on it being completely real. ... That's what makes it a performance art piece.\\" Sulkowicz told the Guardian that making the video had been traumatizing, and had left her in a \\"very scared, emotional state for days.\\" Sulkowicz said elsewhere that vulnerability is part of what makes performance art good. ===Text=== The introductory text said that the video was not an enactment of Sulkowicz's rape allegation. Rather, \\"Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol ... [is] about your decisions, starting now.\\" Sulkowicz gives only provisional consent to view the video: > Do not watch this video if your motives would upset me, my desires are > unclear to you, or my nuances are indecipherable. You might be wondering why > I've made myself this vulnerable. Look—I want to change the world, and that > begins with you, seeing yourself. If you watch this video without my > consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and > participating in my rape, for, in that case, you were the one who couldn't > resist the urge to make Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol about what you wanted to make > it about: rape. Please, don't participate in my rape. Watch kindly.Lauren > Gambino, \\"Columbia graduate who carried mattress releases video depicting > 'rape'\\", The Guargian, 5 June 2015. She then asks a series of questions: \\"Are you searching for ways to either hurt or help me? ... Do you think I'm the perfect victim or the world's worst victim? ... Do you hate me? If so, how does it feel to hate me?\\" ===Video=== The scene is shown on a split screen from four angles, with a timestamp in each corner, beginning 02:10 and ending 02:18. Lawson said the security-camera perspective \\"removes the wall between the viewer and the action.\\"Teo Armus, \\"Sulkowicz films herself in a violent sex scene for newest art project\\", Columbia Spectator, 5 June 2015. The video begins with Sulkowicz and the actor, whose face is blurred, entering the room, undressing each other, then kissing and engaging in oral and vaginal sex, the latter with a condom. Three minutes into the video, the actor hits Sulkowicz several times, then removes the condom, pushes his hands and her legs against her neck or throat, and penetrates her anally. She screams, tells him to stop, and puts her hand over her face. After a short time, the actor stops abruptly and leaves the room with his clothes in his hands. Sulkowicz is left curled on the bed in the fetal position, with her back to the camera. After wrapping herself in a towel, she briefly leaves the room, returns and makes the bed, then appears to fall asleep. Lawson told the Columbia Spectator that Sulkowicz and the actor had captured the shift from the consensual to non-consensual: \\"I think the video expresses the possibility that you don't forfeit that [consensuality] ever.\\" ===Public comments=== Lawson said Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol explores the relationship between art and social media, \\"this giant, polluted ocean.\\" A key part of the work was the online reaction, particularly in the website's comments section. The 2,700 comments within the first five days were mostly critical or ridiculing. They included sexual, sexist and racist insults and threats. There were remarks about Sulkowicz's physical appearance, ethnicity, mental health, and that the scene did not depict rape.Suzannah Weiss, \\"Emma Sulkowicz's 'Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol' Site Was Temporarily Disabled By Cyberattacks, But Her Opponents Are Missing The Point\\", Bustle, 9 June 2015.\\"Hackers Disable Emma Sulkowicz Website to Censor New Artwork\\", ArtNet, 9 June 2015.Melissa Chan, \\"Columbia University anti-rape activist Emma Sulkowicz releases sex video as newest art piece\\", New York Daily News, 6 June 2015. Someone posted the video on a porn site. Comments on other sites were both positive and negative. The video was the victim of a denial-of-service attack by hackers on 4 June, according to DigitalOcean, which hosts the site, and on 5 June there were technical problems caused by the numbers attempting to access it. ==Analysis== Newsweek called the video a \\"harrowing document,\\" while Priscilla Frank in The Huffington Post described it as \\"simple yet stinging, providing imagery that lingers like a nightmare, never quite comprehensible but impossible to forget.\\"Paul Mejia, \\"Columbia University Mattress Protester Releases Video Addressing Rape\\", Newsweek, 6 June 2015. In the German edition of The Huffington Post, Benjamin Prüfer was less positive, calling it an \\"art video that can only be described as pornography.\\"Benjamin Prüfer, \\"Kunst oder krank? Angebliches Vergewaltigungsopfer dreht verstörendes Sex-Video\\". The Huffington Post, 11 June 2015. Hannah Rubin, writing in The Forward, called it \\"sophisticated and brilliant,\\" and despaired of the lack of empathy on display in the website's comments section. According to Julie Zeilinger, the video was \\"unsettling\\" for Sulkowicz's supporters, and several questioned the approach.Julie Zeilinger, \\"Emma Sulkowicz Isn't the Only Artist Taking on Sexual Assault. Here Are 5 Others\\", 'Identities.Mic, 8 June 2015. On Slate's DoubleX Gabfest podcast, Hanna Rosin argued that the split-screen forces the viewer to embrace the subjective, in terms of choosing whether and how to watch, and how to interpret, which is the opposite of activism because it is too nuanced. The broadcast noted that Sandra Leong, Sulkowicz's mother, had written on Facebook in support of the work.Hanna Rosin, Noreen Malone and June Thomas, \\"DoubleX Gabfest: The Triple X Edition\\", Slate, 11 June 2015, from c. 09:00 mins; c 18:00 for Sandra Leong. Suzannah Weiss wrote in Bustle that Sulkowicz's provisional consent to watch the video is a metaphor for sexual consent. The video is there to watch, but the viewer has a decision to make. No one has consent to watch with hostility or if they are unsure of the artist's desires. No one has consent to post it to a porn site. If the artist's terms are disregarded, the viewing is non-consensual. Rebecca Brink argued in The Frisky that, as well as illustrating the nature of sexual consent, Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol challenges the position that art, once made public, is removed from the artist's control and is for the viewer alone to interpret.Rebecca Brink, \\"Emma Sulkowicz's “Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol”: An Explainer\\", The Frisky, 5 June 2015. ==See also== *Authorial intent *Death of the author ==References== Category:2015 works Category:Civil rights protests in the United States Category:Columbia University Category:Performances Category:Feminist art Category:Performance art in New York City Category:Political art Category:Works about rape ","title":"Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol"},{"id":"46903195","text":"The 1966–67 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the 1966–67 men's college basketball season. ==Schedule== 2014-15 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball record book .

He was born in Thessaloniki in 1945, pursued undergraduate studies in Theology and Mathematics in AUTh, and post-graduate studies in Biblical Criticism and Biblical Theology at British (King's College London) and German (Heidelberg) universities. ==Studies and career== Petros Vassiliadis started his academic career by serving as an assistant to the late professor Savvas Agouridis (1974-1977) at the Theological School of the University of Athens, where he submitted his doctoral dissertation entitled On the Hypothesis of the Q-Document. A Critical Consideration of Current Literary and Theological Problems of the Q-Document (1977). He then moved to his home town, Thessaloniki, where he was elected lecturer in 1982, assistant professor in 1983, associate professor in 1985, and full professor in 1989, at the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There he taught for almost 35 years New Testament and Interfaith dialogue, being also assigned for some time the courses of Missiology, Liturgics and Ecumenical Dialogue. He also taught as a visiting professor at various institutions, universities and colleges of USA (St. Vladimir's, St. Athanasius, Smith College, Lynchburg), of Europe (Bossey, Bologna Bari, Ravenna, Copenhagen, Lund, Oslo, Joensuu, Reykiavik), and Asia (South Korea). He was for many years the departmental coordinator of the Erasmus/Socrates program of inter- university cooperation of the European Union. From 1986 he is co-editor of the Greek biblical series “Hermeneia of the New Testament” (ΕΚΔ) and “Bibliotheca Biblica” (ΒΒ), editor of the ecumenical series “Ecclesia-Koinonia-Oecumene” (ΕΚΟ), and of the CEMES series, editor-in-chief for East and South Europe of the “International Studies in Formative Christianity and Judaism” of the University of South Florida, and editor of the Great Orthodox Christian Encyclopedia (Μεγάλη Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Εγκυκλοπαίδεια, MOXE) in its early stages. He also served as an Orthodox commissioner of CWME of the WCC (1998-2006), and chief organizer of the 14th World Mission Conference, officially hosted on his recommendation by the Church of Greece in Athens (2005), for the first time in an Orthodox setting. He was coordinator of the Biblical Studies in the 12th World Mission Conference in San Antonio, Texas of USA (1989), and the 8th General Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe (1998). In addition, he served in various Synodical Committees of the Church of Greece (of Liturgical Renewal, and of Inter-Orthodox and Inter-Christian Relations), consultant of the United Bible Societies for the improvement of the relations with the Orthodox Churches and the presentation of the Orthodox understanding of the Bible to the global family of the Bible Societies, institutional coordinator of the Forum Mediterraneum, dealing with issues pertinent to faith, history of religions, and cultural anthropological research on the three monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean sea, and member of the editorial committee of the Orthodox biblical journal Δελτίο Βιβλικών Μελετών (Bulletin of Biblical Studies) of the “Artos Zoes” foundation, and of the Regnum Edinburgh 2010 Mission Series of the Oxford Center of Mission Studies. He is Honorary President of the WOCATI, a founding member, secretary, and vice-president of the Society for Ecumenical Studies and Inter-Orthodox Relations (SESIOR), founding member, first secretary, and now president of the CEMES, member of the Q International Project of the Society of Biblical Literature, as well as of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas (SNTS), and among the coordinators of the regular conferences of Eastern and Western N.T. Scholars. He was one of the main contributors of the Inter-Christian Symposia of the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the Pontifical University Antonianum of Rome, and a close friend of the ecumenical monastic community of Bose in Italy. He was awarded with the highest honour of the municipality of Neapoli, Thessaloniki, for his contribution to the religious and cultural development of his home town, and also from the municipality of Edessa for his overall scientific contribution. Together with his colleagues, professors S. Agouridis, G. Galitis, J. Karavidopoulos, B. Stoyannos and J. Galanis, he translated the New Testament into Modern Greek (1977-1989). He published, edited in Greek and English nearly 20 books, and 300 articles in scientific journals, conference proceedings, and collective volumes, as well as in the conventional and electronic press. He supervised more than 17 master and 10 doctoral dissertations (promoting, in addition to the traditional, the sociological, feminist and other contemporary exegetical methods of biblical analysis), but also of missiological, ecumenical and liturgical character. He also participated in radio and television discussions, and gave numerous interviews on a variety of themes. He participated in more than 100 international conferences. ==His contribution to the Biblical studies== In the field of biblical literature his scholarly speciality was mainly the Sayings of the Historical Jesus, the Q-Document,Cf. his doctoral dissertation, Η περί της Πηγής των Λογίων θεωρία, Αθήνα 1977; LOGOI IESOU. Studies in Q, Atlanta 1999; Τα Λόγια του Ιησού. Το αρχαιότερο ευαγγέλιο, Athens 2005. the Pauline theology,Cf. Σταυρός και Σωτηρία, Thessaloniki 1983; Χάρις- Κοινωνία-Διακονία. Ο κοινωνικός χαρακτήρας του παύλειου προγράμματος της λογείας, Thessaloniki 1985; Παύλος: Τομές στη θεολογία του Α΄, Thessaloniki 2005. and the theology of Liturgy and Eucharist.Βιβλικές Ερμηνευτικές Μελέτες, Thessaloniki 1987; Επίκαιρα Αγιογραφικά Θέματα. Αγία Γραφή και Ευχαριστία, Thessaloniki 2000. Ηis contribution to the Synoptic (Q) scholarship was mainly his widely accepted and used procedural principles for the reconstruction of the Q-DocumentCf. \\"The Nature and Extent of the Q-Document\\", Novum Testamentum 20 (1978) 49-73. and the consequences of the Q Hypothesis, not so much as a solution to the Synoptic Problem, but as a change of the conventional picture of Christian origins. With regard to the Pauline collection project, on the basis of a thorough examination of 2 Corinthians 8-9, he is among those specialized scholars who support the social character of this ancient radical institution of Christianity, the main purpose of which was the ideal of “equal distribution and permanent sharing of the material wealth.” As to the Pauline (and general New Testament) Theology his recommendation is a combination of historical and thematic approach of this discipline, with a parallel recognition and use of such semi- and extra-canonical texts and traditions, as Q and the Gospel of Thomas among others, suggesting what he calls a “Eucharistic Paradigm”. ==His theological contribution== Although his primary scholarly profession is biblical, he has deliberately chosen to engage with the wider theological scholarship. With the decline of the word of God, the Gospel and the overall biblical foundation of the Orthodox theology, mainly as a result of the predominance of the institutional expression of the Church at the expense of her charismatic character, he attempted in many of his works a creative encounter between the later development of the ecclesiastical tradition and the modern theological problematic with the foundational biblical tradition. Realizing the fragmentation of contemporary theological scholarship, and wishing to overcome it, he extended his scholarly and practical engagement to other areas, such as ecumenical movement and theology, missiology, liturgical theology, and world theological education. Among his characteristic theological propositions is the priority of the eschatological experience of the early Christian community over against its literary products (texts, Bible etc.), although from the time of St. Paul there has been a shift of the center of gravity from the (Eucharistic) experience to the (Christian) message, from eschatology to Christology (and further and consequently to soteriology), from the event (the Kingdom of God), to the bearer and center of this event (Christ, and more precisely his sacrifice on the cross). This basic theological positions of his, i.e. the priority of the horizontal (ecclesiological and eschatological) perspective, both in the N.T. and in the early Church, as well as in later Christian literature, with the vertical soteriological (Pauline?) teaching placed always within the framework of the horizontal eschatological as complementary, has determined his extra-biblical theological activity and research. Basing his theological endeavour on the foundational, yet marginalized, incarnational Christian doctrine, and maintaining the overcoming the traditional patristic “exclusivity” of modern Orthodox theology, and in addition promoting the necessity of the biblical foundation of the Eucharistic ecclesiology, he adamantly promotes – following the legacy of his Doctor Vater, the late Savvas Agouridis – the Prophetic theology, above and beyond the contemporary classical “theologies”, which dominated his country since the decade of the ‘60s, i.e. the Eucharistic and the therapeutic.Cf. “‘Εις μέτρον ηλικίας του πληρώματος του Χριστού’ (Εφ 4:17). To βιβλικό υπόβαθρο της χριστιανικής πνευματικότητας,” and “Πτυχές σύγχρονης μαρτυρίας του ευαγγελίου: Το νέο αναδυόμενο βιβλικό ‘παράδειγμα’,” Θεολογία 58:2 (2014) 63-78. In quite a number of his works he opined that the relegation of the biblical word has inevitably resulted in limiting contemporary theology in dilemmas of the type: therapeutic or Eucharistic theology, gerontes/starets or bishop, theosis or sacraments etc. Following the general line of Metropolitan of Pergamon, John (Zizioulas’) Eucharistic ecclesiology for the necessity of the “primacy” on a theological and not just historical basis, he also brought into the fore for reconsideration the views expressed by the pioneer in the field Nicholas Afanasiev,«Συνοδικότητα και πρωτείο στην Καινή Διαθήκη. Η παύλεια ‘περιεκτική’ ευχαριστιακή θεολογία αίτιο και προϋπόθεση της συνοδικότητας», Θεολογία 80 (2009) vol. 2, 43-66) underlining Pneumatological (in addition to the Christological) and the Missiological (beyond the Eucharistic) dimension of the Church, thus coming closer to the theological views supported by the Archbishop Anastasios (Yannoulatos) of Tirana, Durrës and All Albania. ==His missiological contribution== Based on this position and relying on the biblical data he suggested a reconsideration of the Orthodox position on intercommunio and of the exclusivistic character of the Eucharist,Cf. «Η Ευχαριστία ως στοιχείο περιεκτικότητας και ενότητας στην εκκλησιολογία της Καινής Διαθήκης», ΔΒΜ 24 (2006) 77-105; “The Missionary Implications of St. Paul’s Eucharistic Inclusiveness,” The Relevance of Rev. Ion Bria’s Work for Contemporary Society and the Life of the Church, Sibiu 2010, 123-128; and “St. Paul: Apostle of Freedom in Christ,” In the Footsteps of Saint Paul. An Academic Symposium, HC Orthodox Press Boston 2011, 153-167) as well as of the Orthodox position on Christian anthropology.Cf. «Ο ιερός Αυγουστίνος ως ερμηνευτής του αποστόλου Παύλου και το πρόβλημα της ανθρώπινης σεξουαλικότητας», Θεολογία 81 (2010) vol. 3, 129-158. From the mid-80s he promotes a new “paradigm” of Christian witness (mission) in the post-modern era,Cf. his studies Η Ορθοδοξία στο Σταυροδρόμι, Thessaloniki 1992; Μετανεωτερικότητα και Εκκλησία. Η πρόκληση της Ορθοδοξίας, Athens 2002; Ενότητα και Μαρτυρία: Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Μαρτυρία και Διαθρησκειακός Διάλογος-Εγχειρίδιο Ιεραποστολής, Thessaloniki 2007; and he edited Orthodox Perspectives on Mission, Regnum, Oxford 2013, and Ορθόδοξη προσέγγιση για μια θεολογία των θρησκειών, CEMES, Thessaloniki 2014. being at the same time systematically engaged with the Orthodox understanding of the ecumenical theology,Cf. “Η Ορθόδοξη Εκκλησία και η αναζήτηση της ορατής ενότητος”, Ορθοδοξία και η των πάντων ενότης, [ed. by the H.M. of Koutloumousi], Mount Athos 1997, 139-152; and “L’ eschatologie dans la vie de l’ Églige: Une perspective chrétien orthodoxe et son impact sur la vie de la société,” Irénikon 73 (2000) 316-334. underlining the Christian witness as the real Liturgy after the liturgy and insisting on the necessity of the inter- Christian and inter-faith dialogue,Cf. Petros Vassiliadis (ed.), Orthodox Perspectives on Mission, Regnum, Oxford 2013. and especially the biblical and liturgical renewal.Cf. Eucharist and Witness. Orthodox Perspectives on the Unity and Mission of the Church, Geneva/Boston 1998; Lex Orandi: Λειτουργική Θεολογία και Λειτουργική Αναγέννηση, Athens 2005; and “Ο λόγος του Θεού στη σύγχρονη Ορθόδοξη θεολογία και η βιβλική αναγέννηση στην ελληνική πραγματικότητα”, ΔΒΜ 9/Β (2011) 9-26. During the last decade (since 2006, as a member of the WCC program on Poverty-Wealth-Ecology [PWE]) he is specialized and practically engaged in the alternative (to the neo-liberal economic globalization) Christian proposal.Cf. his scholarly contributions in the special editions on the world economy of the Greek Orthodox scientific journals ΔΒΜ [2011)] and Θεολογία [2013], with the title “Αγία Γραφή και Παγκόσμια Οικονομία” and “Θεολογία και Οικονομία”, respectively. His engagement with the interfaith dialogue, and his position for an encounter between Christianity and modernity (and post-modernity) made him aware of the need of a legally established and internationally binding Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, along with the Human Rights. He suggested that the interfaith dialogue and cooperation are necessary in the areas, where the “modern paradigm” failed to succeed, i.e. in the spiritual and material welfare of the people, the degradation in social and moral values, in the inability of our world order to enforce a lasting just peace on earth, and especially in its unwillingness to preserve the natural environment, and its surrender to the rules of the dominant world economic system.Cf. “The Responsibility of World Religions for Ecology, the World Economic System, and the International Law,” and “Spirituality and Politics: The Importance of Religion for the Re-integration of Europe.” ==Contribution to theological education== In 2002, after more than a decade in WOCATI, having also served as member of the executive committee, he was elected WOCATI's president (2002–2008), and for his contribution he was awarded for life the title of its honorary president. His scholarly contribution on the world ecumenical theological education is specified in combining the new challenges with the traditional Christian presuppositions.Cf. \\"The Importance of the Ecumenical Vision for Theological Education and Ecumenical Formation. Response,\\" J. Pobee (ed.), Towards Viable Theological Education.

Theological Perspectives-Regional Surveys-Ecumenical Trends, Oxford 2010, 603–610. On the basis of his international experience and the nearly 40 years academic service in Greece he is one of the contributors to the revision of the religious course in the public secondary education (Lyceum) of his country, and a fervent supporter of the constitutional changes in Greek public higher education, and a member of the Association of Professors of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.Official website at syndesmosauth.gr . ==List of books and publications== His most important books are: * Η περί της Πηγής των Λογίων θεωρία, 1977. * Σταυρός και Σωτηρία, 1983. * Χάρις-Κοινωνία-Διακονία, 1985. * Eucharist and Witness, 1998. * LOGOI IESOU: Studies in Q, 1999. * Μετανεωτερικότητα και Εκκλησία: Η Πρόκληση της Ορθοδοξίας, 2002. * Τα Λόγια του Ιησού: Το αρχαιότερο Ευαγγέλιο, 2005. * Lex orandi: Λειτουργική θεολογία και λειτουργική αναγέννηση, 2005. * Παύλος: Τομές στη θεολογία του Α΄, 2004. * Ενότητα και μαρτυρία: Ορθόδοξη χριστιανική μαρτυρία και διαθρησκειακός διάλογος.

The system functions by detecting and identifying fast moving P-waves that arrive before the slower and damaging S-waves generated from the hypocenter of an earthquake. Once ShakeAlarm has identified a candidate P-wave it will determine in less than 500 milliseconds if the following S-wave will be strong enough to be dangerous. Once the determination has been reached that an inbound S-wave might exceed acceptable levels the system can trigger the structured shutdown of critical processes - gas, electricity and water services - and can also be used for opening of fire bay doors, SMS warnings to the general population and a variety of other services to be activated before the S-wave's (shaking) impact. ShakeAlarm represents a streamlined site specific application of technology and ideas that Japan has been working with for some time on a nationwide deployment level in the form of a network.Meguro, K 2008, ‘Strategy for Taking Full Advantage of Earthquake Early Warning System for Earthquake Disaster Reduction’, 14th WCEE, Beijing, China, Oct 12-17 ==Applications== ShakeAlarm is deployed throughout British Columbia, Washington State and Oregon State - further locations on the West Coast of North America are being investigated for deployment of the ShakeAlarm system.

(http://www.shakealarm.com/earthquake_warning/early_warning_system.php) formerly of the BC Ministry of Transportation. ==History== The earliest uses of this technology by the development company were focused on listening for propagating micro fractures in the rock hundreds of meters under the surface. This was done to monitor the effects of oil and gas sector activities like fracking. The next major development from microseismic technology was the ability to look at interactions on the surface from a buried sensor, this led to a system called Rockfall which is designed to replace fall fences on sections of railway prone to falling rock and debris. ShakeAlarm was a natural evolution when it was discovered that the technology being used was capable of detecting P-wave vibrations in the ground. ==References== * http://www.shakealarm.com/earthquake_warning/early_warning_system.php * http://www.shakealarm.com/earthquake_warning/Detecting_Fronts_of_Elastic_Wave.php * https://techcrunch.com/early-warning-labs-partners-with-usgs-to-create-an- app-that-warns-of-earthquakes-30-seconds-ahead/ * http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/real-estate-daily/2015/05/earthquake- on-the-way-the-radiator-building-in.html * http://corefirst-seismic-upgrade- system.com/shakealarm-earthquake-early-warning-system/ * http://www.oregonbusiness.com/the-latest/15195-oregon-businesses-face- destruction-from-future-earthquake ==External links== * Official website * Company website * Facebook - Category:Earthquake and seismic risk mitigation ","title":"Shakealarm"},{"id":"46903243","text":"Heihachirō Fukuda (福田平八郎, Fukuda Heihachirō) (February 28, 1892 – March 22, 1974) was a Japanese Nihonga painter and designer.

It was released in Japan on June 13, 1992. It has been described as a slasher film. ==Plot== Akiko Narushima has just begun a new job consulting on art purchases for a large corporation. Her first day coincides with the first day of a hulking new security guard named Fujimaru, who is secretly a disgraced former sumo wrestler currently being re- investigated for the murder of his cheating lover and friend (and having narrowly avoided jail with an insanity plea during his first trial). At first, Akiko's days are complicated only by her uncertainty about her new job and by her lecherous manager, Kurume. But when Fujimaru finds an earring lost by Akiko, he begins wearing the earring and becomes obsessed with her, eventually leading him to shut down the electricity and phones in the office and embark on a murderous rampage. Trapped in the building with a killer, Akiko and her co-workers try to stay alive and get help from the outside world. Eventually, Fujimaru traps Akiko in the office of the eccentric Mr. Hyodo. He incapacitates Hyodo and confronts Akiko, who asks him to explain his actions. He makes a series of cryptic statements, giving Hyodo time to revive and strike him in the neck with the broken blade of a paper cutter. Grievously injured, Fujimaru tears Akiko's earring from his own ear and asks that she remember him before stumbling off. After Akiko and Hyodo are safely out of the building, police discover that he has hanged himself in the building's basement, where Akiko had earlier found an improvised shrine with her face on it. ==Cast== *Makiko Kuno as Akiko Narushima *Yutaka Matsushige as Fujimaru *Hatsunori Hasegawa as Hyodo *Ren Osugi as Kurume *Tarô Suwa as Yoshioka ==Reception== The film has been described as an early example of director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's distinct directorial style. Writing for the Japanese-cinema website Midnight Eye, reviewer Nicholas Rucka commented that \\"notwithstanding the low-budget nature of the film, it brims with atmosphere.\\" Rouven Linnarz of the website Asian Movie Pulse, wrote \\"Of course, in comparison to later works this film has many flaws, missed opportunities, especially since its last half is too much embedded within the conventions of slasher. However, the film holds more than just a promise, and within Kurosawa’s body of work it is a small, but significant piece of work.\\". J. Doyle Wallis of DVD Talk was less positive, calling the film \\"a b-grade slasher picture that probably wouldn't have any attention whatsoever if it hand't been made by a filmmaker who went on to establish some cult success. ...a fair to sub-standard film made by a talented director in their emerging, less polished days.\\" It was chosen as the 10th best film at the 2nd Japan Film Professional Awards in 1993. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1992 horror films Category:1992 films Category:Films directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese horror films Category:Japanese slasher films ","title":"The Guard from Underground"},{"id":"46903264","text":"Creative Market is an online marketplace for community-generated design assets.

The co-founders recognized that COLOURlovers was in need of a marketplace to help its community members exchange the digital goods they were creating, and hence created Creative Market. In May, 2011, the company raised $1,000,000 from 500 Startups and other investors. In June, 2012, it raised an additional $1,300,000 from a consortium of investors, including 500 Startups, CrunchFund, SV Angel, Longworth Venture Partners, Ludilow Ventures, and Alexis Ohanian. In early 2013, the team hired Zack Onisko to lead its growth efforts, who previously served as BranchOut's Director of Growth. In April 2014, the team launched a Photoshop extension that allowed designers to preview and purchase Creative Market's digital assets directly within Photoshop itself. This made it easier for designers to find and integrate third-party digital assets within the workflow of their existing graphic design environments. In February 2014, Creative Market was acquired by Autodesk. The amount of the acquisition was not publicly announced. The entirety of the Creative Market team stayed with the company through the acquisition. In May 2020, it was acquired by online design community Dribbble. == Overview == Creative Market's community members buy and sell creative assets for use in design and marketing projects. Assets include vector graphics, website templates, stock photography, document templates, fonts, and miscellaneous creative goods. As of mid-2015, over 250,000 products were available for purchase on Creative Market. Creative Market's content is submitted by its users through \\"shops.\\" On behalf of its shop owners, Creative Market handles the distribution, payment processing, support, and assisted marketing for its products. Sellers retain 60% of the sale price on their goods, are not bound to exclusivity agreements with Creative Market, and set their own prices on goods they sell through the platform. The platform also provides sales statistics and a customer-seller messaging system. As a form of content marketing, the company regularly runs promotions on bundles containing discounted creative goods. ==Pay it Forward== In December 2014, Creative Market launched its Pay it Forward bundle in partnership with various companies in the web design space, including Dribbble, Scribd, Skillshare, and others. The bundle offered $4,500 USD worth of digital assets under a pay what you want pricing model. All proceeds went to Watsi, a not-for-profit platform that enables individual donors to directly fund the medical care procedures for individuals in developing countries. Over 18,000 bundles were purchased, totaling $150,000 USD in funds raised, which amounted to over 250 financed healthcare procedures for patients. ==Industry competitors== *iStock *Shutterstock ==References External links == * Official Creative Market website Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Stock photography Category:Crowdsourcing Category:American companies established in 2012 Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:Y Combinator companies ","title":"Creative Market"},{"id":"46903274","text":"Vasil Katsadze (; born Potsdam, 16 July 1976) is a Georgian rugby union and rugby league player.

Vermont. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Provincetown International Film Festival on 18 June 2015. It is written and directed by Jeff Kaufman, and produced by Kaufman and Marcia Ross. Funding for the film's post-production and editing work was partially raised through a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. == Background == The film depicts the decades-long battle for marriage equality, beginning in Vermont in the 1990s. In 1997, Bonauto, a lawyer at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), joined forces with two local attorneys, Murray and Robinson, to file a lawsuit against the State of Vermont on behalf of three same-sex couples, Stan Baker and Peter Harrigan, Lois Farnham and Holly Puterbaugh, and Nina Beck and Stacy Jolles. The suit, Baker v. Vermont, ignited state- and nationwide controversy, but eventually resulted in a 1999 State Supreme Court victory and the passage of Civil Unions in 2000, which gave gay and lesbian couples the rights of marriage but not the name. Still, the bill was a national first, and paved the way for gay marriage initiatives in other states, as well as the passage of full same-sex marriage rights in Vermont in 2009. Kaufman was a radio host in Vermont during the initial legal battle, and witnessing the events unfold inspired the creation of the documentary. The film was shot in Vermont between July 2013 and February 2014. == Cast == *Jeffrey Amestoy *Stan Baker *Nina Beck *Rev.

The Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 and certain steps taken thereafter saw the addition of peripheral areas in the eastern and southern parts of the city to the corporation area. In 1888, there were 75 commissioners, 50 of whom were elected, 15 appointed by the government and 10 nominated from bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Trades Associations and the Port Commissioners. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore, Manicktola and Garden Reach, as well as the New Dock Extension area, were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out. Post-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata. With the addition of Joka to Kolkata, the number of wards rose to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 103 is bordered on the north by a straight line drawn in continuation of Santoshpur Avenue on the west up to the Eastern Railway, Santoshpur Avenue, Kalikumar Mazumder Road and New Santoshpur Main Road; on the east by Panchnnagram Canal; on the south by the crossing of the Eastern Railway and Panchanangram Canal; and on the west by the Eastern Railway and Kalikumar Mazumder Road.

In or around 1146 it joined the Arrouaisian Order, and in consequence adopted the Rule of St Augustine and became an abbey, under the first abbot, Lambertus. The men's and women's communities which had previously coexisted here were separated: the women were moved to premises in Odegem (now Steenbrugge) where their community developed into St. Trudo's Abbey (still extant and housed since 1954 in Male Castle), while the men remained on the existing site near the centre of Bruges. After centuries of decline the abbey was dissolved in the French Revolution. ==Dispersal== In 1803, after being sold off as state property, the abbey was entirely demolished by its French purchaser Rousseau, except for a single doorway onto the Eekhoutstraat, which still stands. Isolated plots which connected to their property in the Garenmarkt came into the hands of the Du Jardin family. After the failure of their family business, the Bank Du Jardin, in 1874 a large part of their property here came into the possession of the Sisters of the Sint-Andreasinstituut, who had a school built on it. The site of the former abbey is now occupied by the Groeningemuseum. ==References== ;Bibliography * Bossuyt, S, 2003: De eremiet Everelmus en de stichting van de Eeckhoutabdij te Brugge (ca. 1052-1150).

Hinostroza was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 6th round (169th overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== Hinostroza played for the Chicago Mission AAA Youth Hockey Club (where his future NHL teammates Ryan Hartman and Nick Schmaltz also played for). While playing for the Mission's U16 midget team, he played in 34 games where he scored 13 goals, had 21 assists and 38 penalty minutes. He attended USA Hockey's Central District U16 camp and was selected by the Waterloo Black Hawks in the first round (4th overall) in the 2010 USHL Futures Draft. Hinostroza would later commit to playing college hockey at the University of Notre Dame. Hinostroza attended the University of Notre Dame where he skated two seasons with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In his freshman season, he was named to the 2013–14 Hockey East All-Rookie Team, and the following year, he was named to the 2014–15 Hockey East First All-Star Team. On March 21, 2015, Hinostroza signalled the end of his collegiate career after his junior season in signing a three-year entry-level contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. He was assigned to the Blackhawks AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs to begin his professional rookie 2015–16 season. On October 16, 2015, he was recalled by the Blackhawks and on October 17, 2015, Hinostroza made his NHL debut, playing against the Columbus Blue Jackets. He recorded two penalty minutes and two shots on goal as Chicago won 4–1. Hinostroza scored his first career NHL goal against Jacob Markström of the Vancouver Canucks on November 19, 2016. He also recorded two assists in the same game which helped the Blackhawks rally from a 3–0 deficit and win in overtime. On June 15, 2018, Hinostroza agreed to a two-year contract with the Blackhawks, despite the possibility of becoming a free agent on July 1. On July 12, 2018, Hinostroza was traded to the Arizona Coyotes along with Marián Hossa, Jordan Oesterle and a 2019 third-round pick, in exchange for Marcus Krüger, Jordan Maletta, Andrew Campbell, prospect MacKenzie Entwistle, and a 2019 fifth-round draft pick. This trade cleared up $8.5 million cap space for the Blackhawks. On October 8, 2020, as an impending restricted free agent, Hinostroza was not tendered a qualifying offer by the Coyotes, releasing him to free agency. On October 9, at the opening of the free agent Market, Hinostroza was signed to a one-year, $1 million contract with Florida Panthers. ==Personal life== Hinostroza is the son of Rick and Laura Hinostroza and he grew up in Illinois with his older sister Carli. He attended high school at Bartlett High School where he played football and lacrosse. While playing junior hockey with the Waterloo Blackhawks, he attended Waterloo West High School in Waterloo, Iowa where he graduated in 2012. He is of Ecuadorian descent through his paternal grandparents. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

(1996–99), Tracey Ullman decided to take a step back from television, citing exhaustion from years of having to wear heavy prosthetic makeup for her many television characters. In 1999, she signed on for Woody Allen's film Small Time Crooks, as well as the film Panic. Despite making a conscious decision to move away from television, she announced her intent to someday return. She hoped to create a new comedy series, one in which she would play a few characters with minimal makeup. In the meantime, Ullman busied herself with her online fashion-focused boutique and blog, Purple Skirt, which she had launched in 1999. In 2001, she decided to spin-off the web site into a fashion talk show and reality show for the Oxygen television network, co-founded by American talk show host, Oprah Winfrey in 2001.

MacGroarty became O'Sullivan's business partner for eight years and in 1919 he transferred to the bar where he practiced from the old Inns of Court building in Adelaide Street. ==Political career== At the 1929 election, MacGroarty, the Country and Progressive National Party candidate, defeated Labor's Myles Ferricks to win the seat of South Brisbane. He was immediately appointed attorney general and in his maiden speech he attracted controversy when, after being interjected, he stated that the Queensland Court of Industrial Arbitration would be \\"ringbarked\\" as soon as possible. In April 1930, a Royal Commission was held into the purchase of the Mungana mines and Chillagoe smelters by the Queensland Government in what became known as the Mungana affair. The former owners included Peter Goddard and Fred Reid as well as then Queensland Premier, Ted Theodore and future Premier, Bill McCormack. Macgroarty opened the crown submissions and, after the commissioner, former Justice James Campbell, found the transactions to be fraudulent, MacGroarty, for the crown, sued the four men for £30,000 damages before Chief Justice Sir James Blair of the Supreme Court of Queensland.

In his time as attorney general MacGroarty introduced the Companies Act of 1931, and the controversial Judicial Proceedings (Regulations of Reports) Act of 1931. The latter was regarded as an attempt to protect public morals, but was seen by the Labor Party as a personal vendetta against Brisbane Truth newspaper. By the time of the 1932 election, MacGroarty had fallen out with important Catholic elements and lost his seat to Labor's Vince Gair. Macgroarty left politics bitterly disillusioned and resumed his law practice until his retirement. ==Personal life== On 21 December 1929, MacGroarty married Doreen Mary Joseph (died 1985)Family history research -- Queensland Government births, deaths, marriages, and divorces.

It inhabited the large central granitic Seychelles islands, but was hunted in vast numbers by European sailors. By around 1840 it was presumed to be extinct, along with the Seychelles giant tortoise, a subspecies which shared the same islands. It was recently rediscovered. Currently, less than a hundred individuals exist. Several had been reestablished in the wild on forested islands such as Silhouette, but were evicted in 2011 by the Seychelles Islands Development Company (IDC). ==Etymology== The subspecific name, arnoldi, is in honor of British herpetologist Edwin Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Arnold.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Dipsochelys arnoldi, p. 11). ==Description== The three Aldabra- Seychelles giant tortoise subspecies can be distinguished based on carapace shape, but many captive animals may have distorted carapaces, so they may be difficult to identify. Arnold's giant tortoise is flattened, smooth, and with a relatively high opening to the shell; it is usually black. This subspecies usually has a depression on the suture between the first and second costal scutes, this may be a shallow depression or a distinctive pit. The plastron is less variable than the carapace and usually provides a good indication of the subspecies. ==Life history== Giant tortoises are among the longest-lived animals on the planet. Some individual Aldabra giant tortoises are thought to be over 200 years of age, but this is difficult to verify because they tend to outlive their human observers. Adwaita was reputedly one of four brought by British seamen from the Seychelles Islands as gifts to Robert Clive of the British East India Company in the 18th century, and came to the Calcutta Zoo in 1875. At his death in March 2006 at the Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) Zoo in India, Adwaita is reputed to have reached the longest ever measured life span of 255 years (birth year 1750). Today, Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, is thought to be the oldest living giant tortoise at the age of 184 years and Esmeralda second at the age of 170 years, since the death of Harriet, a Galapagos giant tortoise, at 176. Esmeralda is an Aldabra giant tortoise. ==Morphotype== This is a controversial subspecies possibly distinct from the Aldabra giant tortoise. The subspecies is a morphologically distinctive morphotype, but is considered synonymous with that species by many researchers. This identification is based primarily on morphological characters. Published molecular identifications are unclear with several different indications provided by different data sources. Captive-reared juveniles suggest that there may be a genetic basis for the morphotype and more detailed genetic work is needed to elucidate these relationships. The subspecies is the only living saddle-backed tortoise in the Seychelles islands. It was apparently extirpated from the wild but recently purportedly rediscovered in captivity. The current population of this morphotype is 24 adults, including 18 adult males in nonbreeding captive groups on Mahé Island. Successful captive breeding has produced numerous juveniles. ==Extinction and rediscovery== The Aldabra subspecies has generally been assumed to have been the only one to survive over-exploitation. Occasionally, most recently in 1995, it has been suggested that some Seychelles granitic island tortoises survive in captivity. The report of oddly-shaped captive tortoises prompted the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles to examine the identity of the living tortoises. Examination of museum specimens of the 'extinct' Seychelles subspecies by Dr. Justin Gerlach and Laura Canning confirmed that some living tortoises do show characteristics of the supposedly extinct subspecies. Some recently published scientific papers on the genetics of the Seychelles and Indian Ocean tortoises provide conflicting results. Some studies suggest only one species was ever present in the islands, whilst others suggest three distinct, but closely related, species. These different views derive from studies of different genes. A synthesis of all available genetic data indicates Arnold's giant tortoise is genetically the most distinctive Aldabrachelys tortoise. This fits with the ecology and morphology of the subspecies, as a highly distinctive tortoise adapted to feeding on low vegetation rather than the grazing habits of the Seychelles giant tortoise and Aldabra giant tortoise. Due to its unusual 'saddle-backed' shape, this is the only Seychelles tortoise species that regularly basks in the sun. The other subspecies do so occasionally, but Arnold's giant tortoises rapidly lose heat from the skin of their exposed necks and need to heat up in the sun in the mornings. ===Conservation=== With DNA testing, tortoises of the \\"extinct\\" subspecies were identified and were acquired by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles for conservation. They were brought to Silhouette Island and the captive-breeding program was initiated in 1997. For several years, the female tortoises produced infertile eggs, but in December 2002, eggs laid by a small tortoise started to hatch. By 2006, the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles had produced as many babies of the Arnold's tortoises as they could cope with, which was 128. Five out of the original six adult tortoises were returned to the wild at Grande Barbe on Silhouette Island, intending to form the first wild population of this subspecies since the early 19th century but ended up being only temporary. These tortoises were visited regularly and their health and impacts on the ecosystem were monitored until NPTS was evicted from Silhouette Island. A survey in 2010 found that these tortoises were having a significant effect on the vegetation, restoring the areas where they feed into natural palm woodland. Woodland areas in 2006 were dominated by, and in 2010, regrowth of endemic palms were seen in the foreground. The decision of the Islands Development Company to evict NPTS from Silhouette Island by March 2011 and the refusal to have wild tortoises on the island forced them to find new homes for the tortoises. The privately managed islands of North and Fregate islands agreed to provide a new home for the Arnold's giant tortoises. If they had been able to release them on Silhouette island, they would have established a separate wild population, now they will be mixed with the Aldabra tortoises that are already on North and Fregate islands. NPTS have produced a new generation of many young tortoises which will live for at least 100 years. In that time, an opportunity may occur to establish pure populations of these tortoises; these animals live longer than short-term management and development perspectives. On February 4, 2011, the first of the Arnold's giant tortoises were moved to North island. North island subsequently decided they did not want any more tortoises on the island and refused to take the remaining 92 tortoises. Fregate Island agreed to take them and the last of the tortoises were finally moved on June 14. ==References== Category:Aldabrachelys ","title":"Aldabrachelys gigantea arnoldi"},{"id":"46903603","text":"The Seychelles giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea hololissa), also known as the Seychelles domed giant tortoise, is a tortoise subspecies in the genus Aldabrachelys.

The species is a morphologically distinctive morphotype, but is considered by many researchers to be either synonymous with or only subspecifically distinct from that taxon. This identification is based primarily on morphological characters. Published molecular identifications are unclear with several different indications provided by different data sources. It is a domed grazing subspecies, differing from the Aldabra tortoise in its broader shape and reduced ossification of the skeleton; it differs also from the other controversial giant tortoise in the Seychelles, the saddle-backed morphotype (Arnold's giant tortoise). It was apparently extirpated from the wild but is now known only from 37 adults, including 28 captive, and 8 on Cousine Island, 6 of which were released in 2011 along with 40 captive-bred juveniles. Captive-reared juveniles show that there is a presumed genetic basis to the morphotype and further genetic work is needed to elucidate this. ==Extinction and rediscovery== Originally, several different subspecies of giant tortoise inhabited the Seychelles. Large and slow, the tortoises were reportedly friendly, with little fear of man. Sailors and settlers slaughtered thousands and swiftly drove most populations to extinction. Though generally assumed that the Aldabra giant tortoise was the only one to have survived over- exploitation in the Seychelles, it is occasionally, most recently in 1995, suggested that some Seychelles granitic island tortoises survived in captivity. The report of oddly shaped captive tortoises prompted the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles to examine the identity of the living tortoises.

He equalised in the final at the Worthersee Stadion on 1 June, but FC Red Bull Salzburg won 2–1. Joelinton played all ten of Rapid's 2016–17 UEFA Europa League matches, scoring in a 3–2 win over Genk on 15 September and a 1–1 draw with Athletic Bilbao at the Allianz Stadion on 8 December. On the domestic front in the Austrian Football Bundesliga, he recorded 8 goals in 33 games – including one to cap a 4–1 victory at city rivals FK Austria Wien on 7 August – but the Viennese club finished 5th of 10 teams and missed out on European football. On 22 July 2017, the first game of the new season, Joelinton was sent off after 23 minutes in a 2–2 home draw with SV Mattersburg, for kicking back after being fouled by Michael Novak. Return On his return to Hoffenheim, Joelinton was given a first start in a DFB-Pokal first round match at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, and scored a hat- trick in a 6–1 victory. He netted his first Bundesliga goal on 22 September to open a 1–1 home draw with Borussia Dortmund, and as a substitute on 23 October he scored an added-time equaliser for a 3–3 draw against Lyon in a Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. ===Newcastle United=== On 23 July 2019, Joelinton joined Newcastle United on a six-year deal for a reported club record fee of £40 million. He made his debut on 11 August, starting in their 1–0 home loss to Arsenal; he and teammate Miguel Almirón were criticised by the club's all-time record scorer Alan Shearer for their performances. Joelinton scored his first Premier League goal on 25 August in a 1–0 victory away at Tottenham Hotspur. It took him until 14 January 2020 to score his second goal for the club, netting the final goal in a 4–1 FA Cup Third Round replay victory over Rochdale. Joelinton went on to score his first brace for the club in a 7-0 thrashing of Morecambe in the EFL cup on 23 September 2020. ==International career== Joelinton was capped four times by the Brazil under-17 national team in 2012, scoring two goals. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" +Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club!!rowspan=2Season!!colspan=3League!!colspan=2Cup!!colspan=2Other!!colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=3Sport Recife2014rowspan=2Série A 72101092 - 2015 5151203305 - !colspan=2Total !12!!3!!6!!1!!21!!3!!39!!7 - rowspan=3Hoffenheim2015–16rowspan=2Bundesliga 10000010 - 2018–19 28723513311 - !colspan=2Total !29!!7!!2!!3!!5!!1!!34!!11 - rowspan=3SK Rapid Wien (loan)2016–17rowspan=2Austrian Bundesliga 338531024813 - 2017–18 2774100318 - !colspan=2Total !60!!15!!9!!4!!10!!2!!79!!21 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Newcastle United 2019–20 Premier League 3826200444 - 2020–21 Premier League 50220072 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !43!!2!!6!!2!!1!!2!!51!!6 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career totals !144!!27!!23!!10!!37!!8!!203!!45 } ==Honours== Sport Recife *Campeonato Pernambucano: 2014 *Copa do Nordeste: 2014 ==References External links == *Joelinton career stats – Topforward *footballzz.co.uk Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pernambuco Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Sport Club do Recife players Category:TSG 1899 Hoffenheim players Category:SK Rapid Wien players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série A players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:Premier League players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Austria Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Expatriate footballers in England ","title":"Joelinton"},{"id":"46903659","text":"Favorite Hawaiian Songs, Volume One is a compilation album of phonograph records by Bing Crosby released in 1946 featuring songs that were sung in a Hawaiian-type genre. This was the fourth Hawaiian-themed album release for Crosby. ==Release history== This is not to be confused with the two earlier albums of the same name. An album was released in 1940 called Favorite Hawaiian Songs. By 1946, Crosby had recorded four more Hawaiian songs and Dick McIntire's Harmony Hawaiians recorded two more. Decca hadn't used \\"Paradise Isle\\" and \\"Aloha Kuu Ipo Aloha\\", on Decca 3797, in an album yet – so, the first album, consisting of twelve songs – along with those eight more unused songs, (twenty songs on ten 78 rpm records) – was split into two five-disc (10 song) 78 rpm albums of the same name: Volume Two and this album. ==Reception== The reviewer for Billboard commented, inter alia: :This is an over-ambitious attempt to coin extra-added out of Bing Crosby's early recordings. In this instance the label is packaging Der Bingle's Hawaiian diskings, putting 10 sides in a set. And there's enough here for two such sets, using the same cover design of smiling Bing against a geographical picture of the islands with a descriptive booklet accompanying each set. For the first set, they are all slow and dreamy spinners, with instrumental and vocal support from Dick McIntire, Lani McIntire and the Paradise Island trio. Top faves in the first volume include \\"Song of the Islands\\" and \\"Sweet Leilani\\" … Both McIntire strumming ensembles are included in the second album, also of 10 sides, with two sides cut with Harry Owens's full band. Second set includes several selections at a livelier beat, with \\"Trade Winds\\" the top song favorite…For Der Bingle and hula fans, there's enough in these two packages to last a lifetime.\\" ==Track listing== These previously issued songs were featured on a 5-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-460. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\\" -bgcolor=#D3D3D4  Side / Title  Writer(s)  Recording date  Performed with  Time - bgcolor=#F2F0E6  colspan=5Disc 1 (25009): -  A. \\"Song of the Islands\\"  Charles E.

It was centered on Maebashi Castle in what is now part of the city of Maebashi, Gunma. ==History== Maebashi was the location of an important fortification in the Sengoku period on a strategic junction of the Tone River with the main highway from Edo to Echigo Province and the Sea of Japan with the Nakasendō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. The area was hotly contested between the Uesugi clan and the Takeda and Odawara Hōjō clans. After Tokugawa Ieyasu took control over the Kantō region in 1590, he assigned the area to his trusted general, Hiraiwa Chikayoshi, with revenues of 33,000 koku. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Hiraiwa were transferred to Kōfu Castle and were replaced by a branch of the Sakai clan, formerly daimyō of Kawagoe Domain. The Sakai ruled over nine generations from 1601 to 1749, during which time the domain was gradually enlarged to 150,000 koku. The 2nd daimyō, Sakai Tadayo and 4th daimyō, Sakai Tadakiyo served as tairō within the shogunal administration. After the Sakai were transferred to Himeji Domain, they were replaced the a branch of the Matsudaira clan from Echizen Province, and Matsudaira Tomonori ruled from 1749 to 1767. However, erosion from the Tone River and repeated flooding continued to plague the castle, and in 1767 Matsudaira Tomonori decided to relocate his seat from Maebashi to Kawagoe Castle, demoting Maebashi Domain to a detached territory of Kawagoe Domain. Towards the Bakumatsu period, the growing prosperity and economic importance of Maebashi due to the silk trade led to the local townspeople petitioning their lord for his return to Maebashi Castle. The Tokugawa shogunate also looked to Maebashi as a possible refuge should Edo be attacked by the western powers, and supported the move. A new Maebashi castle was completed in 1866, and the Matsudaira clan relocated back to Maebashi in 1867. During the Boshin War, Maebashi Domain was quick to side with the imperial cause. However, the domain’s detached exclave in Futtsu sided with the Tokugawa and one of the rōjū of the parent domain in Maebashi was forced to commit seppuku in atonement. After the end of the conflict, with the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Maebashi Domain became “Maebashi Prefecture”, which later became part of Gunma Prefecture. ==Holdings at the end of the Edo period== As with most domains in the han system, Maebashi Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields,Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B.

The station was branded from the stations callsign 4ZB. ZB stations were assigned to the four main regions in New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. While content was local some network shows were heard such as Aunt Daisy up until 1963. In 1978 the station moved to 1044AM after New Zealand changed from 10 kHz spacing on the AM band to 9 kHz spacing. From the 1970s programming was extended into Central Otago on 640AM (callsign 4YW) and Queenstown (callsign 4YQ) on 1120AM, these stations moved to 639AM and 1134AM, respectively, in 1978. The Queenstown and Central Otago stations ran a mixture of National Radio and 4ZB programming. Both Queenstown and Central Otago frequencies were later used to solely broadcast RNZ National, however they were both switched off in April 2019. ===Switch to FM=== In September 1990 4ZB switched to FM, broadcasting on 89.4FM and became known as ZBFM. 4ZB continued to use the AM frequency and launched a parallel station called 4ZB The Talk of Dunedin. Both stations ran the same breakfast show but following the breakfast show programming on the AM frequency had a talkback focus including community news and easy listening music. ===Rebranding as Classic Hits 89FM=== In 1993 Radio New Zealand rebranded many of their heritage stations as Classic Hits. For 4ZB the station became known as Classic Hits 89FM. In the early nineties Radio New Zealand began rolling Newstalk ZB out across the country. In 1993 the 1044AM frequency used for 4ZB The Talk of Dunedin became Newstalk ZB with some local news and talkback retained. The station branding under the Classic Hits brand changed slightly from Classic Hits 89FM to Classic Hits 89.4 in 2001. ===Change of ownership and reduction in local programming=== In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the Classic Hits branded stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1998 Classic Hits 89FM was reduced to just 4 hours of local programming between 6 and 10 am 7 days a week. Outside this time nationwide shows based from Auckland took over, and the network announcers simply called the station Classic Hits. The breakfast show was shortened to a 3-hour show in 2012 on all Classic Hits stations and local weekend programming removed. ===Rebranding as The Hits=== On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. Dunedin however retained its local breakfast show presented by Callum Procter and Patrina Roche. and continues to run network programming after 9 am. ==References== Dunedin Category:Mass media in Dunedin Category:Defunct radio stations in New Zealand ","title":"4ZB"},{"id":"46903757","text":"Return of the Frontiersman is a 1950 American Western film directed by Richard L. Bare and written by Edna Anhalt. The film stars Gordon MacRae, Julie London, Rory Calhoun, Jack Holt, Fred Clark and Edwin Rand. The film was released by Warner Bros. on June 24, 1950. ==Plot== After the territory of Laramie, Wyoming has had law and order restored by men known as the Frontiersman, sheriff Sam Barrett has a peaceful town. At least until a fight breaks out between his grown son, Logan, and a man named Kearney who has been wounded by one of Logan's bullets. Newspaper editor Larrabee explains to the sheriff what happened. Larrabee was accused of cheating at cards by Kearney, who drew a gun on him. But because the editor was unarmed, Logan stepped in and shot the gun from Kearney's hand. Sam believes the fair thing is to give Logan and Kearney each 10 days in jail. Kearney is livid, though, accusing the sheriff of favorable bias toward his son. Later that day at Kearney's ranch, Ryan, a ranch hand, sees Logan standing over Kearney's dead body. A posse is formed. Logan runs into a doctor's daughter, Janie Martin, and explains his situation. A bank is robbed and the banker shot by a man fitting Logan's description, riding off on a pinto, which is what Logan rides. Larrabee helps him get away. Janie spots a man in similar garb on a pinto and realizes Logan's been telling the truth about being innocent. Sam goes to help his son and discovers Larrabee is behind the killing and robbery. Janie is held hostage, but Logan and his father, fighting side by side, save the day. == Cast == *Gordon MacRae as Logan Barrett *Julie London as Janie Martin *Rory Calhoun as Larrabee *Jack Holt as Sheriff Sam Barrett *Fred Clark as Ryan *Edwin Rand as Kearney *Raymond Bond as Dr. J.

Today this station is owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment and is host station of The Hits network. ==HistoryEarly Years=== The ZM name derives from the original 1ZM radio station founded by W.W. (Bill) Rodgers in the late 1920s in Manurewa, then a farming village south of Auckland, The letter Z meant a privately owned (later commercial) station, and the M stood for Manurewa. The original station broadcast on 1250AM. The station was later acquired by the NZ Government owned Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Board) and moved 26 km north to Auckland City, where it shared space in the 1941 Art Deco Broadcasting House studios of 1ZB. In April 1944 1ZM was handed over to the US AFRS military broadcasting service to provide entertainment for US troops on R & R leave in Auckland, as part of the AES Mosquito Network. The American programming, drawn from all three US radio networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) and played without commercial advertisements, proved popular not only with US troops but also with Aucklanders who appreciated the lively style of presentation and the latest American hits. After the war 1ZM was returned to the government broadcasting department, New Zealand Broadcasting Service (NZBS) and its successor, but still state-owned, New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC). As part of a reshuffle of frequencies and callsigns 1ZM was renamed, first 1ZD and then 1YD, in line with the Wellington metro station 2YD which had opened in 1937. 1ZM /1YD was turned into a low-power non- commercial metro music station, broadcasting retro hits and oldies from 5 pm to 10 pm weeknights, and from 10 am to 10 pm weekends. Later, to help meet demand for advertising in the single State owned commercial station 1ZB, 1YD was authorised to carry low-level commercials read live at the microphone, and by the 1960s transmitter time in Auckland was leased in the mornings to a private commercial operator Radio i, which later secured its own AM channel. ===Rise of ZM=== The start of 'pirate' broadcasting in 1966 from Radio Hauraki, based on a barge in the Hauraki Gulf, and the consequent opening up of NZ radio to private investors led to a sharp rise in competition. In 1973 the NZBC looked to sharpen up the rather fusty image of its metro stations by rebranding the three YD stations in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch back to ZM and promoting them under the brand ZM Maxi Music. In 1978, channel spacing in the AM band in New Zealand was adjusted from 10 kHz to 9 kHz. As a result, 1ZM moved to 1251AM. ===Introduction of overnight programming=== In 1981, Radio New Zealand stations were finally granted the right to broadcast 24 hours per day; previously only the domain of private operators. Overnight networked programming was introduced with the ZM All-Nighter show. Programming was produced from the 1ZM studios in Auckland and networked to 2ZM Wellington and 3ZM Christchurch. 2ZK in Hawkes Bay and 4ZG in Gore also took the ZM All- Nighter. The show was offered as an 'alternative music choice to the top 40-based formats offered by the private stations and was originally hosted by Barry Jenkin from Auckland. With his departure in 1983, the alternative format remained, but the music played was more top-40-based with the large percentage of NZ music. The ZM All Nighter continued until 1989 even after 1ZM Auckland changed format in 1987. ===Commercial Free Era=== In 1982, 1ZM lost its bid for an FM license and with the Broadcasting Tribunal allowing two new private radio stations into the Auckland market, 1ZM was required to re format and adopt a 'Limited Sponsorship' model in place of its full commercial licence. This was an attempt to assist the new operators in establishing a revenue base. For 1ZM this meant that although the station could still run paid-for advertisements, those messages could not have music underneath, mention price or be longer than 25 words. Within 2–3 years, both 1ZM's financial and audience market share dropped significantly as advertisers and young listeners were attracted by the higher quality sound of the FM stations, despite the absence of long commercial breaks on 1ZM. 1ZM at the time promoted itself as \\"Total Music ZM\\" to emphasise the commercial-free format. The station's management was still determined to secure an FM warrant and even employed a sales team to sell '30-second shares' in its first day of broadcast in stereo. ===Exit from ZM brand and introduction of Classic Hits brand=== By 1987, 1ZM was still running as a limited commercial station. With its final attempt unsuccessful under the old Broadcasting Warrant scheme, a decision was made to attempt a further re-format and a 'Classic Hits' format was first introduced. This format had been successful for a number of years in the USA. The small, tightly rotated playlist of 'Hit Radio' tunes was abandoned and the station instead targeted 25- to 44-year-olds with a playlist containing over 3,500 songs, playing everything from Dean Martin to ACDC. The 1987 version of Classic Hits was unlike anything else available at that time. The re formatting was essentially an attempt to recover audience, but was still costing Radio NZ over $1 million per annum to operate as it was the only \\"commercial station\\" legally required to run no commercials. The change to the Classic Hits format saw 1ZM drop the ZM name and become Classic Hits Twelve Fifty One. The change in name marked the birth of the Classic Hits brand that would eventually be rolled out to other radio stations across New Zealand. The ZM stations in Wellington and Christchurch were not affected by the requirement to run limited commercials and went on to switch to FM stations during the mid 1980s. ===Switch to FM=== The Lange government's liberalisation of the broadcasting warrant system (which was ultimately abolished in 1989/1990) saw the station finally win the right in December 1989 to broadcast in stereo on 97.4 MHz in Auckland and broadcast commercials. The 1251 kHz frequency licence was transferred to Christian broadcaster Radio Rhema. The move to FM saw the station change branding to Classic Hits 97FM. The original line up was: 06:00am Peter Mac and Mary-Jane Tomasi, 09:00am John Hawkesby, 12:00pm Bob Gentil & 3:00pm Darren Mills. ===Nationwide roll-out of Classic Hits brand=== In 1992 Classic Hits 97FM in Auckland changed its logo to a green diamond with the words Classic Hits on a banner above and the 97FM frequency inside the diamond. A year later Radio New Zealand decided to rebrand many of their local stations to use the same logo as Classic Hits 97FM with the station's local frequency in the middle. The on-air imaging was standardized across all stations now branded as Classic Hits but initially all stations remained live and local. ===Privatisation=== In 1996 the New Zealand Government sold the Radio New Zealand commercial group of stations, the sale included all stations branded as Classics Hits and the ZM stations. From 1998 most Classic Hits stations were reduced to a local breakfast show between 6am and 10am and outside these times took network programming from the Classic Hits Auckland studio. The announcers on Classic Hits 97FM Auckland started producing two voices break outside of breakfast programming, a localized voice break for Auckland listers and a second voice break targeted at a nationwide audience. ===Return of ZM to Auckland=== The ZM brand returned to Auckland on 91.0FM as 91ZM Auckland in 1997 on a frequency previously used by local Auckland station 91FM. This station was a completely separate station to the original 1ZM station and is now the host of the ZM network. ===Station Today=== On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. In Auckland the then breakfast announcers Justin Rae and Stacey Morris were moved to the Drive show now presented as a nationwide show for all markets. Estelle Clifford was moved from the night show slot to the 9am to 12pm timeslot presenting her show to regions that take network programming during this time. The former network drive host Dave Fitzgerald, who presented his show from Christchurch, was moved to the 12pm - 3pm show now producing a localized show for Christchurch and Auckland listeners in additional to a network show. Other weekday network days originate from the Auckland studios and usually contain a localized voice break for Auckland and a networked voice break for other regions. In February 2017 The Hits Auckland started a new local breakfast show for Auckland, the show is presented by Sarah Gandy, Sam Wallace and Toni Street. With Polly and Grant leaving The Hits in March 2017 this Auckland breakfast show became the new network breakfast show on The Hits. ==References== Auckland Category:American Forces Network Category:Mass media in Auckland ","title":"1ZM (New Zealand)"},{"id":"46903827","text":"River City FM was a radio station in Whanganui, New Zealand.

This was the fifth Hawaiian-themed album release for Crosby. ==Release history== This is not to be confused with the two earlier albums of the same name. An album was released in 1940 called Favorite Hawaiian Songs. By 1946, Crosby had recorded four more Hawaiian songs and Dick McIntire's Harmony Hawaiians recorded two more. Decca hadn't used \\"Paradise Isle\\" and \\"Aloha Kuu Ipo Aloha\\", on Decca 3797, in an album yet - so, the first album, consisting of twelve songs - along with those eight more unused songs (twenty songs on ten 78 rpm records), was split into two 5-disc (10 song) 78 rpm albums of the same name - Volume One and this album. ==Reception== The reviewer for Billboard commented, inter alia: :This is an over-ambitious attempt to coin extra-added out of Bing Crosby’s early recordings. In this instance the label is packaging Der Bingle’s Hawaiian diskings, putting 10 sides in a set. And there’s enough here for two such sets, using the same cover design of smiling Bing against a geographical picture of the islands with a descriptive booklet accompanying each set. For the first set, they are all slow and dreamy spinners, with instrumental and vocal support from Dick McIntire, Lani McIntire and the Paradise Island trio. Top faves in the first volume include \\"Song of the Islands\\" and \\"Sweet Leilani\\" … Both McIntire strumming ensembles are included in the second album, also of 10 sides, with two sides cut with Harry Owens’s full band. Second set includes several selections at a livelier beat, with \\"Trade Winds\\" the top song favorite … For Der Bingle and hula fans, there’s enough in these two packages to last a lifetime. ==Track listing== These previously issued songs were featured on a 5-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-461. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\\" -bgcolor=#D3D3D4  Side / Title  Writer(s)  Recording date  Performed with  Time - bgcolor=#F2F0E6  colspan=5Disc 1 (25021): -  A. \\"When You Dream About Hawaii\\"  Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, Sid Silvers  September 11, 1937  Lani McIntire and His Hawaiians  3:02 -  B. \\"Sail Along, Silv'ry Moon\\"  Harry Tobias, Percy Wenrich  September 11, 1937  Lani McIntire and His Hawaiians  2:44 - bgcolor=#F2F0E6  colspan=5Disc 2 (25022): -  A. \\"Sweet Hawaiian Chimes\\"  Lani McIntire, George B.

Fatima Aleem of nation gave it a rating of 7 out of 10 and praised the film's content and marked that \\"Movie had a good lesson for parents to let their children choose the career line they want to opt rather than compelling them to fulfill their dreams and live a life they never wished for\\".Editor of Dunya News praised The Direction but criticised its predictable storyline and mainly praised Shehreyar Munawar's acting but pointed out more negatives than positives. Haider Janjua praised the film especially its actors and wrote that \\"All in all, Ho Mann Jahan is a really great and entertaining movie.

The station was branded as call sign 2ZA. In 1978 the station moved to 927AM after New Zealand changed from 10 kHz spacing on the AM band to 9 kHz spacing. ===Switch to FM=== In 1991 2ZA began broadcasting on 97.8FM in addition to the 927AM frequency. On air the station became known as AM-FM 2ZA. In September 1992 AM- FM 2ZA was divided into two separate stations. The FM frequency was relaunched as a music station as The New 98FM and later shortened to 98FM, the AM frequency was used to run talkback, news and sports shows as The Manawatu's 2ZA. ===Rebranding as Greatest Hits 98FM=== In 1993 Radio New Zealand began rebranding most of their local heritage stations as Classic Hits. At the time of rebranding there was already a local independent station in the Manawatu market branded as Classic Hits 828 and 98.6FM as a result Radio New Zealand chose to rename 98FM as Greatest Hits 98FM instead of Classic Hits, the station used the same logo as the other Classic Hits stations and on air imaging was similar to all other Classic Hits stations. At the same time the 927AM frequency used to broadcast The Manawatu's 2ZA was used to launch network station Newstalk ZB into the Manawatu with some local content initially retained. In 1994 rival station Classic Hits 828 and 98.6FM was rebranded as Magic 828 & 98.6FM and as result Radio New Zealand were able to rename Greatest Hits 98FM to Classic Hits 97.8FM. ===Change of ownership and reduction in local programming=== In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the Classic Hits branded stations.

Before becoming eligible, the players must participate in a pre-draft combine, and the list of players that will attend the draft is officially decided. Teams are allowed to trade picks during the draft as well. In 2012, the Summerside Storm received a first and third-round pick from the Halifax Rainmen in exchange for Troy Gottselig. This was the first recorded incident of such a kind. It is also typical for teams to make trades following the event. The most notable occurrence was Halifax's acquisition of Brandon Robinson, the reigning scoring champion and a future All-Star, from the Oshawa Power in 2012 for a future draft pick. The first pick is, on most occasions, awarded to the team that finished with the worst record in the previous season.

In March 2014, the G7 declared that a meaningful discussion was currently not possible with Russia in the context of the G8. Since then, meetings have continued within the G7 process. == Host selection == Eight Japanese cities bid to host the 42nd G7 summit in 2016. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced on 5 June 2015 that Shima in Mie Prefecture was selected against other bids from Hiroshima, Kobe, Nagoya, Sendai, Niigata, Karuizawa and Hamamatsu. When the central government's deadline closed in August 2014 for prefectural governors to apply to host the summit, Mie Prefecture was not in the running. A member of the Prime Minister's Office actually contacted the governor of Mie Prefecture in December 2014, encouraging him to submit a bid. Mie Prefecture was subsequently declared a candidate on 21 January 2015. Ise Grand Shrine had an advantage in terms of security, as it has regularly hosted visits by both the Imperial family and Japanese political leaders. Another plus was its location in close proximity to Chūbu Centrair International Airport in the Aichi Prefecture, offering easy access to visitors. However, Prime Minister Abe had long had a fascination with Ise Shrine. Abe visits the shrine every year after New Year's holiday, and has even been known to postpone meetings so that he could attend a ceremony held at the shrine. == Leaders at the summit == The family photo of the G7 leaders, 26 May 2016 Meeting session The attendees will include the leaders of the seven G7 member states as well as representatives of the European Union.

The G7 also issued a warning in the wake of the upcoming referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union that \\"a UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend towards greater global trade and investment, and the jobs they create and is a further serious risk to growth\\". Commitment to an EU–Japan Free Trade Agreement – which would mean the elimination of the vast majority of trade tariffs, and boost imports and exports in key areas such as agriculture, car manufacturing and clothing, and which the British government alleges \\"will be worth the equivalent of £200 for every household\\" – was solidified, with a possible signing in autumn. David Cameron also claimed that the deal, alongside the highly unpopular Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), would boost the world economy by £340bn. Despite this, in the wake of the Panama Papers, an editorial by Oxfam Canada titled \\"G7 sides with tax dodgers\\" criticised the G7's commitment to free trade; the editorial said: > G7 leaders have sided with the tax dodgers and not the public. Despite all > the talk of action, the G7 have missed this opportunity to end the > destructive era of tax havens, and the world's poorest people – especially > women and girls, will pay the price.\\" === Foreign policy === The G7 leaders aim to discuss current foreign policy issues like counter-terrorism, conflicts in the Middle East, the Ukrainian crisis, North Korea's nuclear program and the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. === Climate change and energy === The G7 leaders will discuss \\"how to lead the overall efforts of the international community in addressing climate change\\" following the signing of the Paris Agreement in April. The leaders will also discuss their leading role in energy policy and ensuring energy security. === Development === As the first G7 summit following the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015, the G7 leaders will discuss advancing and promoting the Goals. === Quality infrastructure investment === The G7 leaders will discuss the importance of quality infrastructure investment contributing to sustainable development. === Health === The G7 leaders will discuss strengthening the response to widespread epidemics \\"by taking into account the lessons learned from previous outbreaks\\" like the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. They will also discuss the promotion of universal health care. === Women === The G7 leaders will discuss the promotion of women's empowerment in education, science and technology and in a wider range of areas. == Gallery of participating leaders == File:Justin Trudeau and Benigno Aquino III November 2015 cropped.jpg Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister File:Francois Hollande 2015.jpeg France François Hollande, President File:Angela Merkel - Juli 2010 - 3zu4 cropped.jpg Germany Angela Merkel, Chancellor File:Matteo Renzi crop 2015.jpeg Italy Matteo Renzi, Prime Minister File:Shinzō Abe Official.jpg Japan Shinzō Abe, Prime Minister File:David Cameron official.jpg United Kingdom David Cameron, Prime Minister File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg United States Barack Obama, President File:2014 - Donald Tusk (16).jpg European Union Donald Tusk, Council President File:Ioannes Claudius Juncker die 7 Martis 2014.jpg European Union Jean-Claude Juncker, Commission President === Invited guests === File:Sheikh Hasina - 2009 cropped.jpg  Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister Idriss Déby at the White House in 2014.jpg  Chad Idriss Déby, President File:Joko Widodo 2014 official portrait.jpg  Indonesia Joko Widodo,President Jokowi to visit Japan President Thongloun Sisoulith with Obamas cropped.jpg  Laos Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime Minister File:Peter O'Neill May 2015.jpg  Papua New Guinea Peter O'Neill, Prime Minister File:Maithripala- Russia (portrait).jpg  Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena, President File:Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc.jpg Vietnam Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, Prime Minister == See also == *G8 *Ise-Shima *Ise-Shima National Park *G7 Kitakyushu Energy Ministerial Meeting == References  External links == * Official site Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:2016 conferences Category:2016 in international relations Category:2016 in Japan Category:Diplomatic conferences in Japan 2016 Category:May 2016 events in Japan Category:Shima, Mie ","title":"42nd G7 summit"},{"id":"46904108","text":"The contents of a chocolate cake baking mix A cake baking mix being mixed together A baking mix is a pre-mixed formulation of ingredients used for the cooking of baked goods. Baking mixes may be commercially manufactured or homemade. Baking mixes that cater to particular dietary needs, such as gluten- free baking mixes or kosher baking mixes, can be bought in many places. == Types == Baking mixes are produced for the preparation of specific foods such as breads, quick breads, pancakes, waffles, cakes, muffins, cookies, brownies pizza dough, biscuits and various desserts, among other foods. Some all- purpose baking mixes, including commercial and homemade varieties, can be used to prepare several types of baked goods, such as biscuits, pizza dough, muffins, cookies and pancakes, among others. Some bread baking mixes are formulated for use in a bread machine. Ingredients in baking mixes may include flour, bread flour, baking powder, baking soda, yeast, sugar and salt, as well as others depending upon the food type. Gluten-free baking mixes may be prepared using rice flour in place of wheat flour. Dry baking mixes typically require the addition of water or milk, and may also require additional ingredients such as eggs, butter and cooking oil. ==Size== Some baking mixes are sold in bulk volumes, and the baker measures out the amount needed. In other cases, the mix is sold pre-measured in a commonly desired size, such as enough baking mix to make a particular size of cake. Around 2012, most large American manufacturers of cake mixes reduced the size of their standard cake mixes by about 15% by weight, as a result of rising prices for ingredients. This resulted in complaints from some customers about the mix making smaller cakes or fewer cupcakes. Betty Crocker and Pillsbury mixes shrank from 18.25 ounces to 15.25 ounces. However, not all manufacturers followed this trend of reducing the amount to maintain the price; the King Arthur Flour Company, which makes premium-quality cake mixes, continued to produce 22-ounce cake mixes. ==Brands and companiesUnited States=== Brands Arrowhead Mills is a brand of organic baking mixes, cereals, grains and nut butters. The company was founded in 1960 by nutritionist Frank Ford in Hereford, the seat of Deaf Smith County in the southern Texas Panhandle west of Amarillo, Texas. Many Arrowhead Mills products are certified at least 70 percent organic by the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) or Pro-Cert Organic Systems. Atkins Nutritionals produces an all-purpose baking mix, along with several other foods. Dr. Atkins founded Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. in 1989 to promote the low-carbohydrate products of his increasingly popular Atkins diet. This diet was developed after Atkins read a research paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association published by Gordon Azar and Walter Lyons Bloom. Atkins used information from the study to resolve his own overweight condition. General Mills owns the brand Betty Crocker, under which a variety of foods are purveyed, including baking mixes. Marjorie Husted was the creator of Betty Crocker. She was a home economist and businesswoman under whose supervision the image of Betty Crocker became an icon for General Mills. In 1921, Washburn Crosby merged with five or more other milling companies to form General Mills. There are a number of Betty Crocker-branded products, such as plastic food containers and measuring cups, and a line of small appliances like popcorn poppers and sandwich makers with the Betty Crocker brand name. It also owns the Pillsbury Company, which makes its own baking mixes. Bisquick is a baking mix brand that was founded by Carl Smith in 1931. At the time, Smith was employed a sales executive for the General Mills, Inc. Sperry Division. Bisquick may be used to bake several foods, such as biscuits, pancakes, coffee cake and other baked goods. According to General Mills, Bisquick was invented in 1930 after one of their top sales executives met an innovative train dining car chef on a business trip. After the sales executive complimented the chef on his deliciously fresh biscuits, the dining car chef shared that he used a pre-mixed biscuit batter he created consisting of lard, flour, baking powder and salt. The chef then stored his pre-mixed biscuit batter on ice in his kitchen ahead of time, enabling him to bake fresh biscuits quickly on the train every day. As soon as the sales executive returned from that business trip, he stole the chef's idea and created Bisquick. Bob's Red Mill is an American company that produces over 400 products, including baking mixes.

The employee-owned company has been named one of the Best Places to Work in Vermont every year since the inception of the award in 2006. Pinnacle Foods is an American packaged foods company that owns the Duncan Hines brand, which includes cake mixes.

In 1952, Hines introduced Duncan Hines bread through the Durkee's Bakery Company of Homer, New York. Principals Michael C. Antil Sr., Albert Durkee, and Lena Durkee were the bakery proprietors. This was Duncan Hines' first foray into baked goods. In 1957, Nebraska Consolidated Mills, who at the time owned the cake mix license, sold the cake mix business to the U.S. consumer products company Procter & Gamble. The company expanded the business to the national market and added a series of related products. Streit's is a kosher food company based in New York City that produces 11 cake mixes.

Passionei was of frail constitution which led to a number of rejections from the order but he was allowed to enter and was later ordained - he served in the missions for a period of time before his death. Pope Pius IX confirmed his beatification in 1867. ==Life== Marco Passionei was born on 13 September 1560 as the seventh of eleven children to the nobles Domenico Passionei and Maddalena Cibo. His parents died sometime in his childhood. He graduated with a doctorate in both civil and canon law in Padua in 1582 and decided to enter the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin after responding to his religious calling. He first served in Rome to the court of Cardinal Gian Girolamo Albani but realized he did not want to remain there as it did not serve his religious aspirations. Passionei was soon able to admit himself - after several rejections - to the order in Fano at the convent of Santa Caterina despite his fragile health and was placed under the direction of Father Bonaventura; he received the habit on 1 May 1584 and later professed in May 1585. He was forced to leave a few months later and moved to recuperate from stomach ailments in a convent in Fossombrone. Passionei underwent his theological formation under Father Girolamo da Castelferretti. Passionei was later ordained to the priesthood in 1590 and assumed the religious name of \\"Benedetto da Urbino\\". He was then sent as part of a team of missionaries in 1600 with Lawrence of Brindisi to Bohemia after Pope Clement VIII ordered that missionaries be sent there to evangelize; he was stationed there until 1603. He often was troubled with leg pains and often fasted in addition to flagellating himself for half an hour and wearing a hairnet; he slept little and often on a wooden plank. He died on 30 April 1625 after a period of ill health. He went for an operation on a hernia in Lent but his health declined and this led to his death not long after. ==Beatification== The sainthood process commenced in Urbino under Pope Innocent XII on 17 September 1796 - it granted him the title of Servant of God. His life of heroic virtue was recognized on 24 February 1798 and allowed for Pope Pius VI to confer upon him the title of Venerable. Pope Pius IX beatified him on 10 February 1867 after the recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hagiography Circle Category:1560 births Category:1625 deaths Category:16th-century venerated Christians Category:16th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:16th-century Italian people Category:17th-century venerated Christians Category:17th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:17th-century Italian people Category:Capuchins Category:Franciscan missionaries Category:Franciscan beatified people Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:People from Urbino Category:Italian Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Venerated Catholics Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in the Czech Republic ","title":"Marco Passionei"},{"id":"46904137","text":"Robbie Victor Russo (born February 15, 1993) is an American ice hockey defenceman who is currently an unrestricted free agent.

Cartoonist Al Capp was an admirer of Dr. King; his studio produced Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story at no charge, which was co-written by Hassler and Benton Resnik, and drawn by an uncredited artist. (Benton Resnick had been an editor and writer for the Al Capp-owned comics companies Toby Press and Graphic Information Services.) The artist has since been confirmed to be Sy Barry by artist James Romberger. It was published in December 1957 in full-color with a cover price of 10 cents. 250,000 copies were printed. Instead of the typical distribution network for comics in those days, which were newsstands, pharmacies, and candy stores, The Montgomery Story was distributed by the Fellowship of ReconciliationKarlin, Susan. \\"THE RETURN OF A COMIC THAT HELPED INSPIRE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT,\\" Fast Company (Nov. 13, 2013).\\"Al Capp's Martin Luther King Comic,\\" Comicon.com's The Pulse (March 7, 2010). among civil rights groups, churches, and schools. It was also promoted in pro-Civil Rights publications such as National Guardian and Peace News. FoR staff members, particularly Jim Lawson (an African American divinity student at Vanderbilt University)Lewis, John, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell. March: Book One (Top Shelf Productions, 2013), p. 76. and Glenn Smiley, traveled through the South, giving workshops on nonviolence. They would distribute the comic to younger attendees as something to take with them and study. At some point not long after its original publication, FoR produced a Spanish version of the comic for distribution throughout Latin America. Instead of using the same art as the English edition, the Spanish version is a complete copy of the original, drawn by a different artist. 125,000 copies were printed, but only a handful of copies of the Spanish version still exist. === Revival === In 2004 comic book artist, writer and historian Tom Christopher researched the King comic and posted an article about it (which included art samples of both the English and Spanish versions) on his website. Christopher had previously documented the publication of All-Negro Comics (1947) and the Golden Legacy and Fast Willie Jackson series (1976),Christopher, Tom, \\"Bertram A Fitzgerald and the Golden Legacy Series of Black History Comics\\" (originally published in edited form in Comics Buyer's Guide), TomChristopher.com. and those articles included information on other comics such as Negro Heroes and Negro Romance. Christopher described Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story not in terms of being a rare or obscure comic but as an historic document, placing it in the political context of the times and explaining non-violence as a workable tool for social change.Christopher, Tom. \\"Martin Luther King Jr and the Montgomery Story,\\" TomChristopher.com (2004). Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story became a major attraction on his website, and the next Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide listed the book for the first time. By 2006, there were only a handful of copies of Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story left in existence. That year, cartoonist/archivist Ethan Persoff scanned an original copy of the comic and posted it on his blog for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.Persoff, Ethan. \\"The 1956 International Bilingual Dr Martin Luther King Jr Comic Book Message,\\" Ethan Persoff's blog (early January 2006). In 2008, Persoff reported that the Cairo director of the American Islamic Congress (AIC) had translated the scanned comic into Arabic and Persian. The AIC's HAMSA (Hands Across the Mideast Support Alliance) initiative printed 2,500 copies of the translated comic, distributing them throughout Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Yemen.Persoff, Ethan. \\"HOW EP.TC IS UNINTENTIONALLY CONTRIBUTING TO WORLD PEACE,\\" Ethan Persoff's blog (March 27, 2008). Until 2012, no history of Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story had been written, and most versions of how the comic was created listed Al Capp as the actual creator. As part of his graduate degree at Georgetown University, Andrew Aydin wrote the first long-form history of The Montgomery Story as his graduate thesis. With the help of Carlow University Professor Dr. Sylvia Rhor and comic book icon Eddie Campbell, Aydin established most of what is known about the comic's creation and use. In August 2013, Aydin published a shortened version of his thesis as the feature article in Creative Loafing's award-winning \\"Future of Nonviolence\\" issue, which was guest-edited by Congressman John Lewis and Aydin. In 2013, Top Shelf Productions published an authorized re-issue of the comic, with all proceeds going to the Fellowship of Reconciliation. == Plot == The comic opens with a one-page synopsis of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and education up until 1957. The narrative then shifts to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1954. An African American man named Jones tells of life in Montgomery under Jim Crow laws. He describes the events of the Montgomery bus boycott and the important role played by Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. In the story, King advocates nonviolence, even when his own home is bombed during the boycott. The last section of the comic discusses the \\"Montgomery Method\\" of nonviolence, its roots in the activism of Mahatma Gandhi, and provides practical advice on how to pursue nonviolent activism. == Legacy == Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story influenced other civil rights activists, including the Greensboro Four. Thanks to the 2008 American Islamic Congress HAMSA initiative, thousands of copies of the Arabic and Persian version of the comic were distributed to democracy advocates throughout the Middle East. When the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 broke out, U.S. Representative John Lewis credited the mass-distribution of the 50-year- old comic as a contributing element in the Egyptian protests.Persoff, Ethan. \\"OUR WEBSITE'S WORK USED IN WIDE-SPREAD EGYPTIAN PEACE CAMPAIGN\\" Ethan Persoff blog (February 3–15, 2011). A hard copy of the Spanish edition of the comic is housed in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, part of the Smithsonian Institution. === March === Georgia Congressman John Lewis read Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story as a teenager. The comic book demonstrated in clear fashion to Lewis the power of the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence. Later, as he attended weekly meetings with students from Fisk University, Tennessee State University, Vanderbilt University, and American Baptist College to discuss nonviolent protest, The Montgomery Story served as one of their guides.Hughes, Joseph (September 16, 2013). \\"Congressman John Lewis And Andrew Aydin Talk Inspiring The ‘Children Of The Movement’ With ‘March’ (Interview)\\" . Comics Alliance. Lewis went on to become an important activist during the Civil Rights Movement. While working on his 2008 reelection campaign, Lewis told his telecommunications and technology policy aide, Andrew Aydin, about The Montgomery Story and its influence. Aydin tracked down a copy of the comic (which had long since fallen out of print), and thought that Lewis' own story would make strong material for comic book treatment: Aydin repeatedly suggested that Lewis himself write a comic book, and eventually Lewis decided to commit to the project, on the condition that Aydin write it with him.Herbowy, Greg (Fall 2014). \\"Q+A: Congressman John Lewis, Andrew Aydin & Nate Powell\\".

The game was released on August 27, 2015 ==Game mechanics== An example of a factory with multiple production lines. In Big Pharma the player takes the role as the manager of a pharmaceutical company, producing prescription drugs from raw materials. Raw materials have intrinsic positive (e.g., \\"Reduces coughs\\") and negative (e.g., \\"Induces drowsiness\\") effects that present themselves when the material is within a set concentration range, with possible concentrations ranging on a 0-to-20 scale. Most of the positive benefits can be enhanced to more desirable effects, or negative side effects can be outright removed, by bringing the material to a specific concentration range and applying an indicated process, some further requiring the addition of a catalyst material which itself carries positive and negative effects. Materials can also be mixed to combine positive and negative benefits to create more potent drugs. The goal in the mixing and preparation of materials is to achieve drugs that have their positive effects as close to their maximum potency concentration while either eliminating side effects or bringing the material's concentration as far away from the side effects' maximum potency levels. The player produces the drugs using an assembly line approach with various equipment that can modify the concentration of the material, combine materials, rearrange the effects of a material to determine how effects combine when mixed, analyze materials to determine maximum potency levels, and finally prepare the material in pill form for delivery. This is done on an isometric view of building plant floorplan, with various ports along the edges that can be used to bring in materials or ship out completed drugs. Materials are transported via conveyor belts between the processing units. Added building space can be purchased with in-game funds. The player can click on processes or materials to evaluate their current state, thus giving them the ability to debug the production line. Once the player has produced a complete pill from specific materials for the first time and delivered it to an output port, they are given the opportunity to name the product. This product is then sold on the game's virtual market. The produce is rated on a letter-grade based on the effectiveness and lack of side-effects as well as current market demand. The production lines operate in real-time - in that while the player can pause the game to arrange equipment within a production line, the game while running tracks the movement of each unit of material through the production line and only considered each unit as a product when it reaches the end of the production line. In the larger game, the player must build up these drug production lines to maintain a profit and allow them to build additional lines. Scenarios in the game include competing companies that will also be releasing prescription drugs that will impact the profitability of the player's products. For example, if other companies have released a cold remedy drug, the market may be too saturated for a better cold remedy to succeed. The player can review what market demand there is for specific remedies to tailor productions toward those goals. In addition, the player can manage a research tree that enables more effective process equipment and other benefits to be built, and send out explorers to research on new possible ingredients to build from. The game includes a number of preset scenarios (such as reached a financial milestone after a number of years of operation) at various difficulty levels as well as the ability to create a custom open-ended game. An expansion, \\"Marketing And Malpractice\\", was released on 26 April 2016. This expansion will add Executives as part of the company which can be used to market the drugs produced by the player's production lines, as well as to try to manipulate and corner the market. ==Reception== Big Pharma received. has a score of 72% on Metacritic,http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/big-pharma and scored an 8/10 from IGN Spain. ==See also== *Plague Inc. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Official Big Pharma Wiki Category:2015 video games Category:Business simulation games Category:Linux games Category:Medical video games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Unity (game engine) games ","title":"Big Pharma (video game)"},{"id":"46904192","text":"Lee Keshav (born December 27, 1992) is an Indian racing driver, entrepreneur and UX Designer from New Delhi. == Racing career == From a very young age Keshav showed interest in automobiles, technology and speed. He soon discovered Formula 1 on TV and was inspired to pursue motor racing. ===Motorcycles=== Keshav got his first taste of racing from motorcycles. He was very passionate about MotoGP and visited Thailand at the age of 16 to train on Superbikes. He was soon invited by the prestigious Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup to Spain for a selection event. Due to his inexperience in comparison to other professional racing kids he was not able to make it to the academy. But the whole experience left a positive mark on Keshav and after receiving some inspiring guidance from the team at Red Bull he became even more determined to enter motorsport. ===Switch to Cars=== After a break of two years in 2012 Keshav decided to give racing another shot and this time he made a switch to car racing. He received his first training on car racing from renowned ex Indian F3 champion Akbar Ebrahim. The training helped him quickly get used to 4 wheels and played an important part in getting him through the tough selection event for the VW Polo R Cup Championship. ===JK Tyre Racing Championship (2013-2014)=== Keshav made his national level debut in the highly competitive JK Tyre Volkswagen Motorsport Polo R Cup championship. He finished 6th overall out of 20 drivers and 2nd in the Junior category. Earning multiple podiums and many times taking the fight to the more experienced drivers. He also won the 'Fastest and Fittest Young Driver of 2013'. In 2014 Keshav returned for a second year in the VW Polo R Cup Championship. This time with experience behind him Keshav was soon considered a strong contender for the championship title. He scored multiple wins and podiums and was one of the fastest drivers throughout the year. Due to an unlucky crash in the final round of the championship Keshav was taken out by another driver and failed to finish the race. This lost him valuable points and eventually the championship. In an interview with Times Now Keshav showed his disappointment on losing the championship but vowed to return stronger in the future. At the final round of the championship Keshav also competed in the Formula BMW (known as JKFB02) as a guest driver. His best result was only a 7th position as he struggled to get used to the new car and tires while also racing the Polo R Cup car on the same weekend. ===MRF National Racing Championship (2014)=== After only one year of national level racing Keshav made a bold move to enter the MRF Formula Ford 1600 championship. The fastest formula car in India. Keshav quickly got up to speed and made a surprise 2nd-place finish in only the second round of the championship. He carried the momentum and started competing with the top experienced drivers and earned more podiums in the following rounds. At the final round of the championship Keshav also scored his first win at the Buddh International Circuit in front of his home crowd. He eventually finished a brilliant 3rd overall in the championship. ===MRF Challenge (2014-2015)=== Just two weeks after his win in the national championship Keshav managed a last minute entry in the highly acclaimed MRF Challenge winter championship. This marked Keshav's international racing debut and made him one of the fastest progressing drivers from India and the only active international formula racing driver from New Delhi. He competed against the likes of Freddie Hunt and Mathias Lauda amongst other top racing drivers from around the world. ===Plans for 2015 and beyond=== Keshav plans to start testing Formula 3 in Europe from September 2015 onwards. He will also return for a second season in the MRF Challenge. A potential GP3 test at Abu Dhabi is also on the roadmap. In an interview with Hindustan Times in June 2015 Keshav confirmed he's trying to finalize a deal to race either Formula 3 Europe or the GP3 championship in 2016. In May 2015 with the support of BMW India, Keshav visited the BMW Training Academy in Maisach Germany. The details of this partnership are still unknown. == Entrepreneurship == Apart from motor racing Keshav has also been passionate about the technology industry. At the young age of 16 Keshav founded his own App design firm and started working with international clients. In 2011 he joined BSB (Bharti Softbank) as a Senior UX Designer. Working under the wings of CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal he received the opportunity to head design for Hike Messenger and Airtel's Wynk Music. After 3.5 years working at Hike Messenger Keshav left the company in early 2015 to focus on his racing and his next venture (a fashion startup). Keshav believes the exposure and learning at Hike Messenger helped him gain valuable experience and knowledge as a professional and the company will always remain close to his heart. He is currently working on a new startup based around the fashion industry. == Personal life == Keshav is based out of New Delhi, India. He travels constantly for his work and racing to various cities within India and abroad. Keshav maintains a low profile with the media although he's known to be a big socialite. He has a younger sister who is an upcoming 10 meter air rifle shooter and is preparing to enter the next Olympics. ==References* Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Indian racing drivers Category:JK Tyre National Level Racing Championship drivers Category:MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship drivers ","title":"Lee Keshav"},{"id":"46904204","text":"Astrid Sverresdotter Dypvik (born October 19, 1977) is a Norwegian journalist and historian, and was the head of Norsk Målungdom, the youth branch of the Language Organisation of Norway, from 2000 to 2002.

The Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 and certain steps taken thereafter saw the addition of peripheral areas in the eastern and southern parts of the city to the corporation area. In 1888, there were 75 commissioners, 50 of whom were elected, 15 appointed by the government and 10 nominated from bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Trades Associations and the Port Commissioners. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore, Manicktola and Garden Reach, as well as the New Dock Extension area, were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out. Post-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata. With the addition of Joka to Kolkata, the number of wards rose to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 104 is bordered on the north by Viveknagar Road, southern bank of southern Jheel, northern bank of northern Jheel, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Link Canal and Kalikapur Road; on the east by Panchannagram Canal and Kalikumar Mazumder Road; on the south by a straight line drawn in continuation of Santoshpur Avenue on the west, up to the Eastern Railway, Santoshpur Avenue, Kalikumar Mazumder Road and New Santoshpur Main Road; and on the west by the Eastern Railway and Jheel Road.

This belief has been the focus of movements in both North and South Korea, where adherents have sought to deter the use of loanwords, regardless of whether they have been formally adopted into the Korean language. Of primary interest has been the replacement of Japanese-influenced loanwords (especially from the period of Japanese forced occupation when the teaching and speaking of Korean was prohibited), although the specific policies differ between the North and South.Differences in linguistic purism in the North and the South == North Korea == North Korea is known for eliminating most loanwords, which comprise most of the language differences between North and South. Unlike South Korea, where hanja has been intermittently used in texts, North Korea abolished the usage of Chinese characters in 1949. Many loanwords with hanja, especially academic words that were introduced during the Japanese occupation, were refined into native Korean. Some examples include: * (kwanjŏl)(, joint/articular surface) → (madi) * (myŏlgyun) (, sterilization) → (kyunkkanggŭrijugigi) * (hohŭp) (, breathing) → (sumswigi) * (yongryang) (, amount) → (tŭri) * (kwangwŏn) (, light source) → (pissaem) * (yŏmsaekch'e) (, chromosome) → (muldŭlch'e) == South Korea == In South Korea, the National Institute of the Korean Language maintains an exhaustive dictionary of refined (purified) language.List of refined words A refined version is created and decided on by online voting.Online voting of loanword refinement === Japanese colonialism === Notably, loanwords from Japanese that were introduced to Korea during the Japanese forced occupation are considered to have a political subtext of colonization and are often subject to refinement. Some words that were transliterations of Japanese words were refined in 1948: * (sirotto) (, amateur/novice) → (maengmuni), (nalmuji) * (bunppai) (, distribution) → (nunumaegi) Some critics of the movement argue that, instead of forcefully finding an equivalent translation for every loanword, the movement must promote the usage of widespread loanwords.Urigeul Barosseugi (1992) , 9788935600571Obituary: Lee O-Deok, Children's writer and champion of spoken writing 26 Aug 2003 Dong-A Ilbo] A recent example is the Korean spicy chicken dish dak-dori-tang (), where the etymology of the middle word dori () is not definitively known, although suggested as a Japanese-Korean hybrid. In South Korea, the National Institute of the Korean Language claims that the word came from Japanese tori (; \\"bird\\"), and suggests that the word should be refined into dak-bokkeum-tang (). However, the status of dori as a loanword has been subject to debate. This is because the institute has not presented the grounds for the argument besides the phonetic similarity of dori to the Japanese word tori. The word dori-tang appears in Haedong jukji, a 1925 collection of poems by the Joseon literatus Choe Yeongnyeon. In the book, Chinese characters do () ri () tang () were used to transliterate the Korean dish name. A food columnist argued that, had the word been Japanese, the character jo (; pronounced tori in Japanese) would have been used instead of the hanja transliteration of the Korean pronunciation. Alternative theories on the origin of dori include the assertions that it came from dyori (), the archaic form of Sino-Korean word jori (; \\"to cook\\"), and that it came from the native Korean verb dorida (; \\"to cut out\\"). None of the theories mentioned before has been widely accepted as the established etymology. ==References== Category:History of the Korean language Category:Linguistic purism ","title":"Linguistic purism in Korean"},{"id":"46904314","text":"was a Japanese playwright and dramatist whose plays focused on the mental, physical, and religious hardships of post-World War II Japan. Tanaka's writing differed greatly from that of other Japanese playwrights at the time because he wrote of essential human conflicts through the eyes of a Christian, which was atypical of the majority of his countrymen. His word structure and dramatic style creates an intense and lyrical force which has been satisfying for many theater enthusiasts, both to his own audiences and to foreign audiences as well.Rimer, J. Thomas. Four Plays by Tanaka Chikao. Monumenta Nipponica. 3rd ed. Vol. 31. N.p.: Sophia U, 1976. 275-98. Print. Tanaka is perhaps the first modern Japanese playwright about whom this can be said. He is notable for his play Head of Mary (1959) and his expanded dramatic structures that convey metaphysical, spiritual, and existential themes in the form of masterful, rhythmic dialogue. == Life and work  Life and influences === Tanaka was born in 1905 in the culturally diverse city of Nagasaki, Japan where his father practiced medicine. His father was a scholar and could fluently read Chinese kambun. He would constantly make young Tanaka read Chinese literature as a primary school student. This became the first major influence in the way Tanaka composed his later plays, because, as he described it, \\"Reading in that fashion produces in you a sense of rhythm: consciousness and resilience. That sense of rhythm has remained behind in me, and I feel it has had some effect on the way I compose my own plays\\".Rimer, J. Thomas. Four Plays by Tanaka Chikao. Monumenta Nipponica. 3rd ed. Vol. 31. N.p.: Sophia U, 1976. 275-98. Print. At the time, Nagasaki was considered a city that had one of the longest cosmopolitan traditions in Japan.Rimer, J. Thomas. Four Plays by Tanaka Chikao. Monumenta Nipponica. 3rd ed. Vol. 31. N.p.: Sophia U, 1976. 275-98. Print. Hundreds of families in Nagasaki were able to freely conduct public rituals of Christianity. The presence of these people in Nagasaki gave a peculiar flavor, in speech and in attitude, to the psychology of the region. These Western influences and ideologies interested Tanaka and other intellectually minded students of the time. He became so interested in Western ideas that in 1923 he became a student at Tokyo University and studied French literature. As a student, he joined many small troupes in attempts to try his hand in acting. Finally, in 1927 after not much success, he joined Shingeki Kenkyusho (‘New Theater Research Institute’) in hopes of better understanding Westernized theater. The theater was led by Kunio Kishida who is regarded as one of the most prominent Japanese dramatists and writers of the early 20th century. Kishida was fluent in French and had an excellent grasp on European dramaturgy. Rimer, J. Thomas. Four Plays by Tanaka Chikao. Monumenta Nipponica. 3rd ed. Vol. 31. N.p.: Sophia U, 1976. 275-98. Print. Impressed and influenced by his instructor, Tanaka began reading French literary works, most of which were full of fanciful and poetic dialogue. After the demise of the Shingeki Kenkyusho Institute in 1929, Tanaka composed a short play titled Ofukuro ('ma' or 'mom') which became a great success. Seemingly overnight, Tanaka was thrown into the spotlight as a promising dramatist. However, this promise was short-lived, as he struggled to produce any meaningful works after the success of Ofukuro. It wasn't until after the bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 8, 1945, that Tanaka produced the outpouring of work that he is most known for today. The complete desolation of Nagasaki was the most influential moment in the molding of the dramatist that Tanaka became. He felt strongly about the ironic relationship of the destruction by the West of the city that came the closest to penetrating the very essence of Western culture due to the adoption of Christianity by so many of its citizens.Konaka, Yōtarō, and Winifred Olsen. \\"Japanese Atomic-Bomb Literature.\\" JSTOR. University of Oklahoma, n.d. Web. 28 Apr. 2015. He felt that the detonation of the atomic bomb had been the ruination of everything his father's generation had stood for and built. In a sense, with the fall of Nagasaki and its spiritual and religious traditions, Tanaka seemed to have rediscovered his own cultural and spiritual background, which he successfully and dramatically conveyed to the audience of his plays.Rimer, J. Thomas. \\"After Apocalypse: Four Japanese Plays of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\" The Journal of Asian Studies. 5th ed. Vol. 45. N.p.: Association for Asian Studies, 1986. 1077-079. JSTOR. Web. 25 Apr. 2015. === Head of Mary === First performed in 1959, Head of Mary: A Nagasaki Fantasia (Maria no Kubi: Nagasaki Gensokyoku), written by Tanaka Chikao, is a Roman Catholic drama about survivors of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.Goodmen, David G. Head of Mary. : The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama'. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Apr. 2015. The play is a rhythmic allegory of the effort by Christians in Nagasaki to reconstitute their faith after the destruction of the Urakami Cathedral on August 9, 1945. It is also a comprehensive metaphor for the difficulties of rebuilding faith after the terrors of the early 20th century. The play tells the story of a group of survivors who plot to steal a statue of Mary so that they may rightfully restore their faith. The group is led by Shika, a woman who works as a nurse by day and a prostitute by night. However, she faces opposition as some believe that time would be better spent through political activism in an effort to ban atomic bombs. Shika does not sway; she stands her ground and says that absolute justice is what she craves, and only God can provide that.Goodmen, David G. \\"Head of Mary.\\" : The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Apr. 2015. In the last scene of the play, Shika and her co-conspirators struggle to move the head of Mary, the last remaining piece of the icon. They fail, but the head suddenly speaks to them: “I'll let you suckle at my breast. I'll let you drink to your hearts’ content. My milk is so sweet, oh so sweet! First drink, then I'll listen to your prayers. So come, come!\\" It is the nurturing voice of softness, but the head does not budge. In the end, Shika and her group are unsuccessful in moving the head, but the efforts to reconstruct their faith, although incomplete, are rewarded. === Other major works === Kyoiku ('Education') is a short one-act play composed in 1953 for the Haiyuza ('Actor's Theater'). The play is French in tone and reflects the lasting influences Tanaka picked up from his final years with Kishida. The characters have French names, and the play is filled with references to French culture. It is famous for its intense poetic dialogue that far exceeds the everyday dialogue produced by naturalistic characters. Education is also known for the successive layers of exhilaration and ambiguity that drive the drama forward.Rimer, J. Thomas, Mitsuya Mōri, and M. Cody Poulton. \\"Education.\\" The Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Drama. N.p.: Columbia UP, 2014. 275-312. Print. Chidori ('Plover') is the name of the young girl in this play composed by Tanaka in 1960. It was almost as successful as Head of Mary, with Christian elements present but less apparent than in Head of Mary. The structure of Chidori is less realistic and more festive and mystical than many of Tanaka's other works. However, the dialogue is much more realistic than his traditional poetic configuration. Instead of the intense poetic sequences seen in much of his usual work, sequences of dreams and the fluctuation between the present and memory give this play the dramatic pattern that Tanaka is known for.Rimer, J. Thomas. Four Plays by Tanaka Chikao. Monumenta Nipponica. 3rd ed. Vol. 31. N.p.: Sophia U, 1976. 275-98. Print. Arai Hakuseki (1968) is a Japanese historical play focused on the confrontation between Japanese and Christian thought. It portrays famous statesman and scholar Arai Hakuseki (1657-1725) and the various political engagements he encountered. This play focuses on the metaphysical world, rather than the realistic, to give the audience a clearer sense of ideas rather than emotion. Since this play is historical, it serves his purpose perfectly.Rimer, J. Thomas. Four Plays by Tanaka Chikao. Monumenta Nipponica. 3rd ed. Vol. 31. N.p.: Sophia U, 1976. 275-98.

Managed by the non-profit Terrace Mill Foundation, the mill contains a gallery, theatre, and gift shop, while the grounds host outdoor events. The mill and four associated structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Terrace Mill Historic District for having local significance in commerce, engineering, industry, and transportation. ==History== The first flour mill on the site was built in 1870 and operated into the mid-1890s, when it was moved to nearby Brooten, Minnesota, to be closer to a new rail line. Jonas M. Danelz bought the property in 1901 and constructed the current mill two years later. In 1920 it was purchased by Peter Takken, who installed a diesel engine in the mill and built a house for himself in 1930. Takken ceased grist milling operations in 1949 and the new owner converted the mill into a woodworking shop specializing in church furniture, operating until 1967. Terrace Mill stood vacant for several years. Preservation efforts began in the mid-1970s, and the Terrace Mill Foundation formed in 1979. ==Terrace Mill Historic District== The Terrace Mill Historic District consists of the 1903 mill, 1903 Stone Arch Bridge, 1915 Steel Beam Highway Bridge, Mill Dam possibly dating to 1882, and 1930 Miller's House. The historic district is significant for exemplifying the small, rural milling operations once common in Minnesota, particularly for retaining all the elements of a water-powered milling complex. Further significance derives from the fact that the complex is on the site of Pope County's first flour mill, built in 1870, and the existing mill was a major contributor to the local economy up until the 1960s. The mill itself bears significance because its construction and turbine engineering exemplify the era's small watermills, and it is one of only about two dozen surviving examples in Minnesota outside of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. All five contributing properties of the Terrace Mill Historic District are also contributing properties to the larger Terrace Historic District. The Terrace Mill Foundation has moved other historical buildings onto the mill grounds which are not considered contributing properties to the National Register district. These include a log cabin that was one of Terrace's first houses, reconstructed in the early 1980s, and a 1950s \\"heritage cottage\\" with Scandinavian construction and furnishings. ==GallerySee also== * List of watermills in the United States * National Register of Historic Places listings in Pope County, Minnesota ==ReferencesExternal links== * Terrace Mill Category:Buildings and structures in Pope County, Minnesota Category:Grinding mills on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1903 Category:Mill museums in Minnesota Category:Museums established in 1979 Category:Museums in Pope County, Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pope County, Minnesota Category:Watermills in the United States ","title":"Terrace Mill"},{"id":"46904411","text":"The Amazing Race 27 was the twenty-seventh installment of the American reality television show The Amazing Race. It featured eleven teams of two, with each team centered on a pre-existing relationship between the cast members such as marriage, dating, or best friends. Teams competed in a race around the world for a grand prize. This season premiered on September 25, 2015. Dating news reporters Kelsey Gerckens and Joey Buttitta were the winners of this season. ==Production and filmingDevelopment=== Venice Beach in Los Angeles. Similar to The Amazing Race 25, the show's Twitter page announced an open start at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California and invited fans to join in sending the new teams off on their Race on June 22, 2015. The open start revealed that teams would head to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This season covered across five continents and ten countries, including visits to Argentina, Zambia, France, the Netherlands, Poland, India, the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau and a first-time visit to Zimbabwe. During the Speed Bump in the ninth leg, Tanner and Josh had to complete the Roadblock challenge, one after the other, marking the first time since the introduction of the Speed Bump wherein no Speed Bump boards existed throughout the racecourse. This was also the first time since the introduction of the U-Turn that three U-Turns were used, unlike the usual two U-Turns in previous seasons. The Race also featured both a Double U-Turn and a single U-Turn for the first time on the same racecourse, with the single U-Turn board making its first appearance since Season 16. It was also the first time that a U-Turn board was placed at the Detour decision point, before the Detour itself. Although Fitbit and Travelocity continued sponsoring the show, Ford discontinued their sponsorship for this season. This season was, therefore, the first American edition, or any International version, with no production- provided vehicles to be driven by the racers since The Amazing Race's inception in 2001. This also meant that teams had to use public transportation such as a taxi to get to the airport in the first leg. Also in the season, Phil doesn't introduce the name of the teams for the first time in the series; instead, the teams introduce their lifestyle. Starting with the fifth episode, episodes began with a shortened intro. ===Casting=== The cast included TMZ editor Kelly Berning and post production supervisor Shevonne Sullivan, former New York Jets cheerleaders Tiffany Chantell Torres and Krista DeBono, former America's Best Dance Crew contestants Ernest \\"E-Knock\\" Phillips and Jayjion \\"Jin Lao\\" Greer, Justin Scheman and Diana Bishop who are known for their viral \\"Amazing Race\\" proposal video, and reporters Kelsey Gerckens and Joey Buttitta from KEYT-TV. Future appearances After the season aired, winners Kelsey & Joey got engaged during their interview on Home and Family, and eventually married on August 25, 2017. On January 22, 2020, they both appeared on an episode of CBS's Let's Make a Deal, which was taped on July 13, 2019 while Kelsey was pregnant with their son, and won $1,000. On May 25, 2016, Kelsey & Joey and Tiffany & Krista appeared on an Amazing Race-themed The Price is Right primetime special. On November 1, 2017, Krista DeBono appeared as the Pit Stop greeter for Leg 2 of HaMerotz LaMillion 6, the Israeli version of The Amazing Race, at Times Square in New York City. Justin & Diana appeared on Season 30 in attendance at the Starting Line. On March 1, 2020, Alex Manard appeared on an episode of Discovery Channel's Naked and Afraid and lasted the full 21 days in the Amazon rainforest of Yasuni, Ecuador. ==Results== The following teams participated in the 27th season of The Amazing Race.

If placed next to a leg number, this indicates the Fast Forward was available but not used. *A indicates that the team decided to use the first Express Pass on that leg. A indicates the team had previously been given the second Express Pass and used it on that leg. *An _underlined_ leg number indicates that there was no mandatory rest period at the Pit Stop and all teams were ordered to continue racing. An _underlined_ team placement indicates that the team came in last on a \\"continue racing\\" leg and was ordered to continue racing. *A or a indicates that the team chose to use one of the two U-Turns in a Double U-Turn; or indicates the team who received it; indicates that the team was U-Turned, but they used the second U-Turn on another team; and around a leg number indicates that the Double U-Turn was available for that leg but not used. *An team's placement indicates that the team came in last on a non-elimination leg and had to perform a Speed Bump during the next leg of the Race. # Justin & Diana attempted to do the Fast Forward on Leg 1, but due to high wind speeds the task was deemed unsafe until conditions improved. As a result, no team claimed the Fast Forward. # Kelly & Shevonne completed the Detour after 3 hours and 45 minutes; however, they never made it to the Pit Stop. After all the other teams had already checked in at the Pit Stop, Phil came to the Copacabana Beach to inform them of their elimination. # Denise & James Earl initially arrived 5th, but were issued a 30-minute penalty after Denise verbally helped her son during the Roadblock. Logan & Chris checked-in during their penalty time, dropping Denise & James Earl to 6th. # Tanner & Josh used their Express Pass to bypass the Roadblock on Leg 4. Before using the Express Pass, Josh elected to perform the Roadblock; this is reflected in the total Roadblock count.https://twitter.com/JoshMAhern/status/656149690296070144 When Tanner & Josh arrived 2nd at the Pit Stop, Phil ordered all teams to continue racing and they were required to give the Express Pass to another team on the next leg of the Race. They had to hand it to Phil immediately at the Pit Stop and tell him which team should have it. # Tiffany & Krista used their U-Turn on Justin & Diana; however, they had already passed the U-Turn point and were therefore unaffected by it. # Denise & James Earl used the Express Pass given to them by Tanner & Josh to bypass the Detour on Leg 5. # For their Speed Bump in Leg 9, Tanner & Josh both had to individually complete the Roadblock. Since Tanner opted to do the Roadblock before finding out they both had to do the Roadblock, only Tanner's performance is reflected in their total Roadblock count. # Justin & Diana initially arrived 3rd, but were issued a 55-minute penalty (30-minute standard penalty plus 25-minutes for time gained) for taking a ferry from Kowloon (Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal) instead of the Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal, as the clue specifically instructed. This did not affect their placement. ==Episode title quotes== Episode titles are often taken from quotes made by the racers. #\\"A Little Too Much Beefcake\\" – Justin #\\"Get in There and Think Like a Dog\\" – Justin #\\"Where My Dogs At?\\" – Ernest #\\"Good Old Fashioned Spit in the Face\\" – Josh #\\"King of the Jungle\\" – Joey #\\"My Tongue Doesn't Even Twist That Way\\" – Justin #\\"Full Speed Ahead, Captain!\\" – Justin #\\"Krakow, I'm Gonna Get You\\" – Tanner #\\"It's Always the Quiet Ones\\" – Krista #\\"Bring the Fun, Baby!\\" – Justin #\\"It's Not Easy Beating Green\\" – Krista #\\"We Got a Chance, Baby!\\" – Justin ==Prizes== The prize for each leg was awarded to the first place team for that leg.

Airdate: September 25, 2015 *Los Angeles, California, United States (Venice Beach) (Starting Line) * Marina del Rey (Mother's Beach to Burton Chace Park) * Los Angeles (Los Angeles International Airport) to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport) * Rio de Janeiro (Lagoa Heliport to Urca Hill via Christ the Redeemer ) ** Rio de Janeiro (Clube São Conrado Free Flight ) * Rio de Janeiro (Copacabana Beach) *Rio de Janeiro (Arpoador Lookout) In the only Fast Forward of the Race, one team had to go to Clube São Conrado Free Flight, where they had to ride a hang glider from Pedra Bonita and soar above the city to win the Fast Forward award. In the event of unfavorable weather conditions, the task would not be available until conditions improved. The first Detour of the Race on Copacabana Beach was a choice between Sand or Sidewalk. In Sand, teams had to play footvolley against local professional players. While the pros could not use their hands, the teams could. If teams could score six points before the pros scored eighteen, they would receive their next clue. In Sidewalk, teams had to solve a giant geometric slide puzzle derived from the Portuguese pavement style of the Copacabana pavement to receive their next clue. ;Additional tasks *From the Starting Line, teams had to take a taxi to Mother's Beach, grab a Schiller water-bike, then pedal it to host Phil Keoghan in Burton Chace Park to receive plane tickets to their first destination: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The first team to complete this task received the only tickets on the first flight, while all the other teams departed a half-hour later on the second flight. *At Lagoa Heliport, teams had to pick a number and take a helicopter past Christ the Redeemer to Urca Hill. Once they landed, the heliport manager asked the teams, \\"What's the name of the monument you passed during the flight?\\" If teams gave the correct answer of Christ the Redeemer, they received their next clue. ===Leg 2 (Brazil → Argentina)=== Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, teams visited the room where Argentine Pope Francis was baptized inside the Basílica María Auxiliadora y San Carlos. Airdate: October 2, 2015 * Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport) to Buenos Aires, Argentina (Ministro Pistarini International Airport) *Buenos Aires (Basílica María Auxiliadora y San Carlos ) * Buenos Aires (Palermo Neighbourhood or Gabriel del Campo Antiques and Lezama Park) *Buenos Aires (Bartolomé Mitre 4272 ) *Buenos Aires (Campo Argentino de Polo) The Detour was a choice between Cartoneros or Fletero. In Cartoneros, teams traveled to the Palermo Neighbourhood at the intersection of Uriarte, Fray Justo Santa Maria, and El Salvador Streets, where they had to pick up a cart, collect cardboard from recyclable bins, and transport it to a truck to be weighed. Once the cardboard reached a total weight of at least , the garbage worker would give teams their next clue. However, there were only eight carts available at a time. In Fletero, teams traveled to Gabriel del Campo Antiques near Plaza Dorrego to pick up a statue, in pieces, and bring it to a truck. One team member would sit in the front and give the driver directions, while the other would hold the statue pieces in the back until reaching their next destination, the gazebo at Plaza Intendente Sebeer. Once at the park, teams had to properly reassemble the statute to receive their next clue from the park director. In the first Roadblock of the Race, one team member had to learn and properly perform a tango routine, which included a second half where they were harnessed and had to finish the steps on the wall of a stage, to receive their next clue. ;Additional tasks *Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, teams had to locate the church where Pope Francis was baptized, leaving them to figure out that this refers to the Basílica María Auxiliadora y San Carlos. Once at the church, teams had to pick a number in the order in which they arrived. The following morning, teams went inside the church, one at a time, to find the altar room where the priest gave them their next clue. *After completing the Roadblock, teams were told to go to \\"The Cathedral of Polo\\", leaving them to figure out it referred to the Campo Argentino de Polo. ===Leg 3 (Argentina)=== For the Roadblock in the Pampas region, team members had to properly hang racks of lamb and beef to make asado, an Argentine national dish. Airdate: October 9, 2015 * Buenos Aires (Retiro Bus Station) or El Talar (El Talar Bus Terminal) to San Antonio de Areco (Areco Bus Station) *San Antonio de Areco (La Porteña) *San Antonio de Areco (Plaza Principal) * San Antonio de Areco (Boliche de Bessonart and Riverside or La Cinacina Estancia ) *San Antonio de Areco (Parque Criollo y Museo Gauchesco Ricardo Güiraldes) In this leg's Roadblock, one member from each team had to properly hang two racks of lamb and one rack of beef ribs onto a set of metal grills to cook the meat asado-style. Once the hanging meats met the head cook's standards (i.e., skewered with the bones oriented in the correct direction and secured on all sides), the head chef would give them their next clue. The Detour was a choice between Horse or Carriage. In Horse, teams had to pick a polo mallet from the plaza and walk to Boliche de Bessonart to change into polo gear. Then, they had to walk to a riverside to pick out a fake horse that needed to be properly tacked and pushed back to the plaza.

Produced by Luis Dubuc, Cory Kilduff and John LaMonica. It was released on October 27, 2014, through Warner Bros. Records as the band's major label debut. ==Background== The project was formed in 2011 by Luis Dubuc after his previous project, The Secret Handshake, was dissolved. Dubuc initially announced the project on August 8, 2011 via the Mystery Skull's official Tumblr account, where they posted a video of the song Amazing. He later followed this post with a 5-song EP on December 30, 2011. Since then Mystery Skulls has performed in multiple college towns, signed with Warner Bros. Records, and has collaborated with multiple artists such as Brandy Norwood and Nile Rodgers. ==ReceptionCritical=== Critical reaction to Forever was mixed to positive. In an extremely positive review of the album, Matt Collar of Allmusic said: The debut full-length album from Los Angeles' Mystery Skulls, 2014's Forever, showcases the group's infectious, '80s-influenced disco, R&B;, and dance-oriented soul. Primarily centered around the talents of lead singer, songwriter, and musical mastermind Luis Dubuc, Mystery Skulls make pulsing, laser-toned R&B; that touches upon vintage '70s and '80s club music as much as it does contemporary R&B;, techno, and EDM. In that sense, cuts like \\"The Future,\\" \\"Fantasy,\\" and \\"Forever\\" fit just as nicely alongside cuts by Daft Punk and Grum as they do tracks from such similarly inclined artists as Sam Sparro and Justin Timberlake. What helps set Mystery Skulls apart from the rest of the electro-R&B; pack is Dubuc's lithe vocal abilities. Blessed with soulful phrasing, a burnished middle vocal range, and a knack for ascending into a lusty falsetto croon, Dubuc comes across as less the pulsating center of a robotic hive mind, à la Daft Punk, and more like an improbable cross between Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump and '90s R&B; prodigal son D'Angelo. It also doesn't hurt the album, or Dubuc's cred for that matter, that he's joined here on \\"Magic\\" and \\"Number 1\\" by both Chic guitar legend Nile Rodgers and '90s soul diva Brandy. Musically, while most of the songs on Forever are set to deep programmed grooves and heavy synth basslines, Dubuc nonetheless strikes an even balance between his use of synthesizer (his main instrument), real piano, drums, and orchestral strings. Ultimately, it's this sophisticated balance that helps Forever sound both organic and computerized, warmly familiar, and utterly fresh.http://www.allmusic.com/album/forever-mw0002753839 ===Commercial=== The album debuted on Billboard 200 at No. 141, and No. 3 on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, selling 3,000 units in its first week. ==Track listingCharts== {  - !align=\\"left\\"Chart !align=\\"left\\"Peak position - align=\\"left\\"US Billboard 200http://www.billboard.com/artist/6304642/mystery-skulls/chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"141 - align=\\"left\\"US Top Electronic Albumshttp://www.billboard.com/artist/6304642/mystery-skulls/chart?f=322  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3 - align=\\"left\\"US Top Heatseekershttp://www.billboard.com/artist/6304642/mystery-skulls/chart?f=324  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2 } ==References== Category:2014 debut albums Category:Warner Records albums ","title":"Forever (Mystery Skulls album)"},{"id":"46904459","text":"Mina Q'asa (Spanish mina mine, Quechua q'asa mountain pass, \\"mine pass\\", also spelled Minajasa) is a mountain in the Wansu mountain range in the Andes of Peru, about high.

The water was to be sprinkled on a person who had touched a corpse, on the third and seventh days after doing so, in order to make the person ritually clean again.Numbers 19:11-13 A tent in which someone had died was similarly considered to be unclean.Numbers 19:14 The water was to be used as follows: :An unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the heifer burnt for purification from sin, and running water shall be put on them in a vessel. A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or a grave. The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, wash his clothes, and bathe in water; and at evening he shall be clean.Numbers 19:17-19 NKJV The water was used again in for the purification on the metallic booty brought back by the Israelites following their victory over the Midianites. In other biblical translations the water is referred to as water of expiation (Douay- Rheims Bible), water of separation (King James Version), water of cleansing (New International Version) or water for impurity (American Standard Version, Revised Standard Version).

It complements Denver Public Library, which serves the Denver city and county, as well as the Arapahoe Library District, which serves Arapahoe County. The Aurora Public Library predates its county library district, Arapahoe, by more than thirty years, while serving the more niche population of Aurora. ==Overview== The first Aurora Public Library, opened in 1929 In 1925, the Aurora Women's Club began raising money to finance the opening of Aurora's first public library. The grassroots effort led to the opening of the first branch of the Aurora Public Library in 1929. The Aurora City Council recognized the library in October of that year, and has supported the library since. In 2009, the City of Aurora shut down several libraries due to a budget initiative failure, which left the system unable to fund all operating branches. The closure of the Mission Viejo library led to a lawsuit between the Mission Viejo subdivision, which had a prior agreement with the City of Aurora to keep the branch open for 50 years, beginning in 1973. After two years of closure, the Mission Viejo branch was reopened with limited hours. The city maintained that the closure of the library met all legal requirements for closure. Following the lawsuit, a temporary settlement was reached between the city and the homeowners association, leaving the library in an interim state until a tax initiative was passed. The initiative would either fund the library for continued operation, or let the original lawsuit continue. In December 2011, rather than issuing a 90-day notice to close the library again, the City of Aurora scheduled a study session to discuss the library. Following the session, Aurora agreed to keep the library open until at least August 10, 2025. After opening a PC center in Kmart in June 2013, the Aurora Public Library PC center was awarded the \\"Top Innovator\\" award for the placement, availability, and quality of service provided by the PC center. Due to the substantial amount of traffic and recognition, hours were expanded to seven days a week shortly thereafter. In October 2013, FEMA classified the central branch of the Aurora Public Library as a disaster recovery center, to help with disaster recovery for severe weather and flooding. ==Services== The Aurora Public Library has five branches, four separate computer centers, and a satellite location at Aurora Community College, all of which provide hard-copy books, periodicals, audio CDs, DVDs, internet, and database access. In addition to traditional library services, the Aurora Public Library offers events, including story-time, baby dance, and a summer-reading program. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Aurora Public Library Catalog Search Category:Public libraries in Colorado Category:1929 establishments in Colorado Category:Organizations established in 1929 Category:Education in Aurora, Colorado Category:Libraries established in 1929 ","title":"Aurora Public Library (Colorado)"},{"id":"46904623","text":"An attack was plotted by Boston-area resident Usaama Rahim. Rahim initially planned to behead Pamela Geller but when that proved too difficult, he told his nephew David Wright on June 2, 2015, that he had decided to behead a police officer instead. However, Rahim was under 24-hour police surveillance, and the police moved that day to arrest Rahim. During the attempted arrest, the police shot and killed Rahim. Wright was arrested and initially charged with attempting to destroy evidence. Later, a third man, Nicholas Rovinski, was arrested, and both Wright and Rovinski were charged with conspiracy to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). ==Investigation== The FBI said that Rahim had been under surveillance since at least late May, when he bought three knives on Amazon.com. On May 26, investigators recorded Rahim telling Wright that he had bought a knife that was \\"good for carving\\" and referring to \\"thinking with your head on your chest\\", which the FBI said was a reference to beheading. Investigators said both Wright and Rahim were followers of a violent form of Islamic extremism. Chairman Michael McCaul of the House Homeland Security Committee said that Rahim had been under investigation because he had been communicating with ISIS and spreading ISIS propaganda online. According to CNN, his Twitter feed showed that he had been communicating with Mujahid Miksi, an alias for Mohamed Abdullahi Hasan, a Minnesota man fighting with Al-Shabaab. According to a court affidavit, Wright later told investigators that he agreed with Rahim's plot and supported it. ===Jihadist connections=== According to The Atlantic, although Wright, Rahim and Rovinski were regarded as isolated, lone wolf actors at the time of their arrests, it later emerged that the three were \\"part of a wider network that was in communication with Islamic State operatives in Syria.\\" In 2015 Rahim and Wright provided the arrangements and raised the funds that enabled American would-be jihadi Zulfi Hoxha to travel to Syria, where he became a significant figure in ISIS. ==Shooting== At 7 a.m. on June 2, 2015, Rahim was walking to a bus stop and then approached by six plainclothes law enforcement officers at a CVS Pharmacy parking lot in the Roslindale neighborhood in Boston. The officers attempted to serve Rahim an arrest warrant for alleged threats against police officers. Rahim was reportedly wielding a military-style knife at the officers, and the officers backed away. Two officers, a police officer and an FBI agent, discharged their firearms. Three shots were fired, striking Rahim. The shooting was recorded inside a nearby Burger King restaurant, and shows Rahim being obscured by a light pole when he was shot. Authorities have stated that the officers made demands that Rahim drop his weapon but he refused. Rahim's family stated that he was shot in the back, although authorities said Rahim lunged at the officers and was the aggressor in the altercation.Video of Boston terror suspect Usaama Rahim being fatally shot released, CBS News, June 8; 2015. ==Aftermath== After Usaama Rahim was shot, his brother Ibrahim Rahim wrote on Facebook that Usaama was confronted by police at a bus stop while on a cell phone with their father. Ibrahim also wrote that Usaama had been shot three times in the back. That post began gaining acceptance, but police countered it by stating that Usaama Rahim had lunged at officers with a large knife and was shot in the front. Police Commissioner William Evans said the video showed the police retreating 15 or 20 yards while ordering Usaama to drop his weapon. The police showed community leaders a video of the shooting. After watching the video, Darnell Williams, president of the Urban League, said the video corroborated the police account—that Rahim was not on his cell phone and had not been shot in the back. Ibrahim Rahim also backed away from his earlier post after seeing the video. == Nicholas Rovinski arrest == On June 11, 2015, the FBI arrested Nicholas Rovinski, also known as Nuh Amriki and Nuh al Andalusi, in relation to the plot. Both Wright, also known as Dawud Sharif Abdul Khaliq, and Rovinski were charged with conspiracy to provide material support to ISIL On September 20, 2016, Rovinski's lawyer William W. Fick announced that his client would change his plea to \\"guilty\\" as he had \\"renounced violence and disavowed any sympathy for\\" the Islamic State, describing him as \\"a vulnerable young man who fell deep into a rabbit hole of extremist ideology.\\" Fick was quoted as saying, \\"Nicholas is prepared to accept personal responsibility for the conspiracy crimes charged and to face the grave penalties that will follow,\\" and \\"Nicholas hopes he will have opportunities in the future to help others reject twisted ideas and avoid making the same mistakes he did.\\" ==Sentencing== On 20 December 2017, David Wright was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment by US District Court Judge William G. Young.

The broad concept is that it is desirable for cross-border insolvencies to be managed by a single officeholder as a single estate rather than a series of piecemeal and unconnected proceedings in different countries, and that this should be recognised globally. In practice, whilst many countries will recognise foreign bankruptcy proceedings, in many instances the courts have set some limits on the recognition of insolvency proceedings, such that the courts apply this principle of modified universality whereby the courts retain a discretion to assess whether the overseas proceedings are consistent with their own principles of justice and public policy. But, subject to that safeguard, the courts will generally defer to the proceedings which are regarded as the \\"main proceedings\\" for the purposes of getting in and distributing assets of the insolvent company. The principal is referred as to modified universalism in that it strives to find a balance between purely territorial bankruptcy systems, and entirely universal international bankruptcy system. Credit for the invention of the modern term is usually given to Professor Jay Westbrook.McGrath & Ors v Riddell & Ors (Conjoined Appeals) [2008] UKHL 21 at para [7] The concept of modified universalism broadly underpins the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and the EC Insolvency Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000). Similarly, Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code (which is based upon the UNCITRAL Model Law) is heavily predicated on the concept of modified universalism. The concepts of universalism and modified universalism have, predictably, shifted and evolved over time. In English law the concept of universalism is usually used in contrast to the alternative theory of judicial cooperation in cross-border insolvencies referred to as the doctrine of unity.Rubin v Eurofinance SA [2012] UKSC 46 As has been judicially noted: \\"The meaning of the expression 'universalism' has undergone a change since the time it was first used in the 19th century, and it later came to be contrasted with the 'doctrine of unity.' In 1834 Story referred to the theory that assignments under bankrupt or insolvent laws were, and ought to be, of universal operation to transfer movable property, in whatever country it might be situate, and concluded that there was great wisdom in adopting the rule that an assignment in bankruptcy should operate as a complete and valid transfer of all his movable property abroad, as well as at home, and for a country to prefer an attaching domestic creditor to a foreign assignee or to foreign creditors could 'hardly be deemed consistent with the general comity of nations ... [T]he true rule is, to follow out the lead of the general principle that makes the law of the owner's domicil conclusive upon the disposition of his personal property,' citing Solomons v Ross as supporting that doctrine: Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, 1st ed (1834), pp 340-341, para 406.\\"Rubin, at para [17] ==Codification== A number of countries throughout the world have sought to apply some form of modified universalism through passing statutes or other forms of codified laws. As noted above, US bankruptcy law substantially implements the principles of modified universalism in the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law in Chapter 15. In the United Kingdom the same UNCITRAL Model Law has been substantially implemented by way of the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030). In addition to the United States and the United Kingdom, approximately 17 other countries have adopted cross-border insolvency laws modelled on the UNCITRAL Model Law, including Canada, Japan and Australia. In the other member states of the European Union (other than Denmark), a variation of the doctrine applies under the auspices of EC Insolvency Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings. In other jurisdictions various forms of ad hoc cross-border cooperation exist on the basis of a foreign main proceeding.See for example under British Virgin Islands bankruptcy law Part XIX of the Insolvency Act, 2003; and under Cayman Islands bankruptcy law the Foreign Bankruptcy Proceedings (International Cooperation) Rules, 2008. ==Common law== Under the common law (i.e. in the absence of specific statutory provisions in countries which are based upon common law systems) the main proponent of the concept in recent times has been Lord Hoffman. In HIH [2008] 1 WLR 852McGrath & Ors v Riddell & Ors (Conjoined Appeals) [2008] UKHL 21 (9 April 2008) he said: ===Evolution of the concept=== The concept of some form of universalism is not a modern innovation. In English law in cases as ancient as Solomons v Ross (1764) 1 H Bl 131n and Re African Farms 1906 TS 373 there has been tacit recognition of the principle. In Galbraith v Grimshaw [1910] AC 508 Lord Dunedin stated that there should be only one universal process of the distribution of a bankrupt's property and that, where such a process was pending elsewhere, the English courts should not allow steps to be taken in its jurisdiction which would interfere with that process.\\"Now so far as the general principle is concerned it is quite consistent with the comity of nations that it should be a rule of international law that if the court finds that there is already pending a process of universal distribution of a bankrupt's effects it should not allow steps to be taken in its territory which would interfere with that process of universal distribution.\\" at 513 However, bankruptcy laws have for the most part historically developed along territorial lines, and in many jurisdictions those insolvency laws were outstripped by the development of international business. The more recent focus on the principle was driven by the more recent decisions of the Privy Council by the decisions in HIH and Cambridge Gas,Cambridge Gas Transportation Corporation v Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Navigator Holdings Plc [2006] UKPC 26 predominantly through the efforts of Lord Hoffman. In the latter case Lord Hoffman opined: Commentary on the decisions was mixed. Whilst some legal commentators applauded the attempt to develop a system of comity to ensure the fair treatment of claimants in international bankruptcies, others criticised the decision for subverting domestic law and for the unstructured and philosophical reasoning which lead to broad principles rather than defined rules. Concern was expressed that in his judgments Lord Hoffman sought to apply broad aspirational principles rather than specific rules. In Cambridge Gas he relied upon the availability of a scheme of arrangement under Manx law as a basis for recognising a Chapter 11 judgments in the United States where the US court had not been in a position to exercise jurisdiction over all of the parties. Lord Hoffman rationalised this on the basis that the purpose of insolvency is not to determine rights (like a conventional civil judgment) but rather to implement a system for the administration of claims. His judgments were also criticised for simply assuming the doctrine of corporate personality should be disregarded in such circumstances. The Supreme Court of Ireland declined to follow Cambridge Gas and HIH in its decision in In re Flightlease (Ireland) Ltd [2012] IESC 12. ===The Rubin decision=== The momentum which was generated towards a broad modified universalism at common law was abruptly arrested in a subsequent majority decision of the Privy Council in Rubin v Eurofinance SA. The leading judgment was given by Lord Collins, with whom Lord Sumption and Lord Walker agreed. In particular they rejected Lord Hoffman's suggestion that the availability of a scheme of arrangement under domestic law made it appropriate to recognise the Chapter 11 relief from abroad. Lord Collins stated: \\"although statute law may influence the policy of the common law, it cannot be assumed, simply because there would be a statutory power to make a particular order in the case of domestic insolvency, that a similar power must exist at common law. So far a Cambridge Gas suggests otherwise, the Board is satisfied that it is wrong\\". Lord Collins amplified that \\"to apply insolvency legislation by analogy 'as if' it applied, even though it does not actually apply, would go so far beyond the traditional judicial development of the common law as to be a plain usurpation of the legislative function\\". They also rejected the earlier statements of Lord Hoffman that insolvency proceedings were, by their nature, different from civil claims. Accordingly, as a result of Rubin whether or not a judgment of a foreign court in insolvency proceedings will be recognised or not will depend upon the ordinary principles of recognition of foreign judgments in the law of the relevant forum - there are no special rules for insolvency proceedings. Although substantially overruling his judgments, the Privy Council in Rubin described Lord Hoffman's opinion in Cambridge Gas as \\"brilliantly expressed\\" and his speech in HIH as \\"equally brilliant.\\"At para [92] ===Non-English common law=== Although the cases of HIH, Cambridge Gas and Rubin are all treated as stating principles of English law, curiously each one of the decisions is a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from another common law jurisdiction (HIH was on appeal from Bermuda, Cambridge Gas was on appeal from the Isle of Man, and Rubin was on appeal from the Cayman Islands). ===Current position=== Although there have been some knee-jerk reactions to the Rubin decision as heralding the death of modified universalism, it is important to keep the decision in context. Modified universalism as a concept is still a fundamental part of a number of codified legal systems, whatever the limits applied to the common law doctrine in Rubin. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the series of decisions in Cambridge Gas, HIH and Rubin focused on two relatively narrow points of the doctrine, namely: (1) whether a judgment of a foreign court in relation to the proper administration insolvency proceedings should be binding against persons who were not party to that judgment (to which Rubin has decisively answered \\"no\\"At paras [128] and [129]), and (2) whether a creditor who lodges a claim in liquidation proceedings administered by the court is taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction of that court (to which Rubin indicates the answer is \\"maybe\\"At para [87]). But treating the Rubin decision as stating some wider principle is danger, particularly as the Privy Council was keen to move away from wide statements of principle and focus on narrow and fact specific rules. Indeed, in Rubin the Privy Council stressed that the common law still generally favours universalism.At para [202] and [203] ==External links== * http://www.blakemorgan.co.uk/training- knowledge/articles/2014/11/10/decision-appeal-court-bermuda-Cambridge-gas/ * http://www.lawgazette.com.sg/2012-06/444.htm * http://www.wlrk.com/webdocs/wlrknew/AttorneyPubs/WLRK.23102.13.pdf * http://www.paulhastings.com/assets/publications/2284.pdf ==Footnotes== Category:Bankruptcy Category:Cross-border insolvency Category:United States bankruptcy law Category:Insolvency law of the United Kingdom ","title":"Modified universalism"},{"id":"46904639","text":"Konrad Kaczmarek (born 1 March 1991) is a Polish footballer who plays as a forward, most recently for Chrobry Głogów. ==External links== * * ==References== Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Polish footballers Category:Ekstraklasa players Category:I liga players Category:II liga players Category:Śląsk Wrocław players Category:Olimpia Grudziądz players Category:KS Polkowice players Category:ŁKS Łódź players Category:Chrobry Głogów players Category:People from Głogów Category:Sportspeople from Lower Silesian Voivodeship ","title":"Konrad Kaczmarek"},{"id":"46904649","text":"Evžen Vohák (born 15 March 1975) is a retired Czech football player who played in the Czech First League for SK České Budějovice and Dukla Prague.

La Ceppède was a Christian poet and wrote Alexandrine sonnets in Middle French. He is best known for authoring Les Théorèmes sur le Sacré Mystère de Nostre Rédemption, a sequence of 515 sonnets, published in two volumes in 1613 and 1622. Taken together, the sonnets are an exegesis on the passion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ and take a heuristic approach. == Early life == Jean de La Ceppède was born circa 1550 in Marseille.Jean de La Ceppède (1550?-1623), Bibliothèque nationale de France His father was Jean- Baptiste de La Ceppède and his mother, Claude de Bompar.Claude François Achard, Dictionnaire de la Provence et du Comté-Venaissin: Histoire des hommes illustres de la Provence, J. Mossy, 1786, p. 167 According to Keith Bosley, the La Ceppède family was of Spanish heritage and may have been related to Saint Teresa of Avila, who was born a Cepeda. Bosley (1983), page 5. He received a Doctorate in Law. == Career == La Ceppède became an Advisor to the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence on October 22, 1578. He advised Perrinet de Rouillas. He became the President of the Court of Audit in 1583, replacing Hughes de Bompar de Magnan. He became its First President on July 14, 1608, replacing Jean de Rollands de Réauville and, as the President of a Parliament Court, La Ceppède was enrolled in the ranks of the Nobles of the Robe. Despite his devoutly Roman Catholic Faith, La Ceppède supported the claim of the Calvinist Henri of Navarre to the throne of France during the French Wars of Religion. For this reason, La Ceppède was arrested in 1589, after the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence fell to the armies of the militantly anti- Protestant Catholic League. La Ceppède attempted to escape disguised as a shoemaker, but was shot and recaptured. La Ceppède was later released on the orders of a senior member of the League who held him in esteem. It was only in 1596 that Marseilles fell to the armies of the now-Catholic King Henri IV. Bosley (1983), page 5. La Ceppède acquired the estate of Aygalades from Melchion de Fallet on March 31, 1599. As a result, he became known as the Seigneur (or \\"Lord of the Manor\\") of Ayglades. The estate was home to a community of Carmelites, and La Ceppède funded the reconstruction of their chapel. ==Literary career== During the French Wars of Religion, La Ceppède belonged to a Royalist literary circle which included the son of Nostradamus. During the same period, he began writing the sonnets that appear in the Theorems. Keith Bosley (1983), From the Theorems of Master Jean de La Ceppède: LXX Sonnets, page 5. As France was increasingly reunified by the armies of King Henri IV, La Ceppède published his first collection of poems, which was an imitation of the Seven Penitential Psalms. According to Keith Bosley, La Ceppède's book was one of many peace offerings to the new King by the poets of Provence, where support for the Catholic League had been overwhelming. Bosley (1983), page 5. Accord to a 2012 article about La Ceppède by Christopher O. Blum, \\"It was in 1594, at the end of the French Wars of Religion, that he published his first work, an Imitation of the Penitential Psalms of David. In a dedicatory epistle that was an extended meditation upon theme of shipwreck, he declared his desire to 'dispose his soul and, with it, poor France' to look to the Cross for safety and to take 'the good David' as guide for 'this perilous navigation.' To paraphrase or imitate the Psalms was a common undertaking in those days. La Ceppède’s efforts may be likened to those of some of the best-known poets of the period, including his friend Malherbe (Psalm 146), the Castilian friar Luis de Léon (Psalm 130), and George Herbert (Psalm 23). The recitation of the seven penitential psalms (Psalms 6, 33, 38, 51, 102, 130, and 143) was then a popular Lenten practice, and La Ceppède’s imitations, each accompanied with a lengthy prayer, succeed in expressing the sentiments of a contrite and humble heart. The work also included a number of other poems, including twelve sonnets that he offered in the hope that 'they would give some consolation to Christian souls amidst the numerous evils that they suffer' and as an advanced offering from a more ambitious task upon which he was already laboring, the Theorems upon the Sacred Mystery of Our Redemption.\\" A Poet of the Passion of Christ by Christopher O. Blum, Crisis Magazine, April 2, 2012. When it was published in 1613, La Ceppède dedicated the first volume of the Theorems to the Queen Mother, Marie de' Medici. He also sent a copy to Saint Francis de Sales, who had been a highly successful Catholic missionary among the French Protestants of the Chablais and who was then the Roman Catholic Bishop of overwhelmingly Calvinist Geneva. In response to La Ceppède's frequent comparison of Jesus Christ to figures from Greek and Roman mythology, the Bishop wrote, \\"[I am] drawn by that learned piety which so happily makes you transform the Pagan Muses into Christian ones.\\" Bosley (1983), page 5. When the second volume of the Theorems appeared in 1622, La Ceppède dedicated it to King Louis XIII, in celebration of both the King's recent coming of age and his military victory against an uprising of the Huguenots of Languedoc, which had been led by Henri, Duke of Rohan. Bosley (1983), page 5. Accord to Christopher Blum, \\"The Theorems is not only poetry, it is a splendid work of erudition, as each sonnet is provided with a commentary linking it to Scriptural and Patristic sources and, especially, to the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas. The work bears the mark of the Renaissance: the sonnet, that choice mode of expressing romantic love, is here purged and elevated and put in the service of the epic tale of God’s love for man. As La Ceppède put it in his introduction—which can be read in Keith Bosley’s admirable translation of seventy of the sonnets—the harlot Lady Poetry had been unstitched of 'her worldly habits' and shorn of her 'idolatrous, lying and lascivious hair' by the 'two-edged razor of profound meditation on the Passion and death of our Saviour.'\\" A Poet of the Passion of Christ by Christopher O. Blum, Crisis Magazine, April 2, 2012. == Personal life == La Ceppède married Madeleine de Brancas-Ceyreste, the daughter of Gaspard de Brancas-Forcalquier and Françoise d’Ancezune, and widow of Etienne de Mantin. The wedding took place on April 30, 1585. They had a daughter, Angélique, who married Henri de Simiane, Seigneur (or Lord) of La Coste. He married a second time, to Anne de Faret, the daughter of Accurse de Faret, the Squire of Avignon, on February 11, 1611. == Death== La Ceppède died, loaded down with honors, at Avignon in July 1623. Keith Bosley (1983), From the Theorems of Master Jean de La Ceppède: LXX Sonnets, page 5. ==Legacy== In the year following Jean de La Ceppède's death, Cardinal de Richelieu became King Louis XIII's Minister of State and the practices of Baroque literature were replaced by Neo-Classicism in French poetry. To this day, the French poetry of the Renaissance is often looked down on and François de Malherbe is often praised for breaking its mold. La Ceppède's verses were accordingly consigned to oblivion until 1915, when they were unearthed by Henri Bremond and appeared in the first volume of his book Histoire littéraire du Sentiment religieux en France. Since then, La Ceppède's poetry has experienced a revival. It has appeared in multiple poetry anthologies and several scholarly works have been written about its author. Bosley (1983), pages 3-5. Following his death in 1623, Jean de La Ceppède's former estate grew into a village called Les Aygalades,Emile Perrier, Un village provençal : les Aygalades, Marseille, 1919 which is now part of the 15th arrondisement of Marseille. In 1689, part of the estate was purchased by the aristocratic de Guillermy family, who built upon it the Bastide de la Guillermy, which is now the oldest building in the city. ==See also== *The Inklings *John of the Cross *Metaphysical poets *Richard Crashaw *Robert Southwell == References External links== *A Poet of the Passion of Christ by Christopher O.

The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215 This range of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920 (referred to alternatively as the Crystal Period, classical Cubism, pure Cubism, advanced Cubism, late Cubism, synthetic Cubism, or the second phase of Cubism), was practiced in varying degrees by a multitude of artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg—Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Henri Laurens, and Jacques Lipchitz most noticeably of all. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the French poet and art critic Maurice Raynal as 'crystal' Cubism.Christopher Green, Late Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference that proceeded from a cohesive stance toward art and life. As post-war reconstruction began, so too did a series of exhibitions at Léonce Rosenberg's Galerie de L'Effort Moderne: order and the allegiance to the aesthetically pure remained the prevailing tendency. The collective phenomenon of Cubism once again—now in its advanced revisionist form—became part of a widely discussed development in French culture. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a return to order; based upon the observation of the artists relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself.Thomas Vargish, Delo E. Mook, Inside Modernism: Relativity Theory, Cubism, Narrative, Yale University Press, 1999, p. 88, Crystal Cubism, and its associative rappel à l’ordre, has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader ideological transformation towards conservatism in both French society and French culture. In terms of the separation of culture and life, the Crystal Cubist period emerges as the most important in the history of Modernism. ==BackgroundBeginnings: Cézanne=== Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow Cubism, from its inception, stems from the dissatisfaction with the idea of form that had been in practiced since the Renaissance.Albert Gleizes, L'Epopée, written in 1925, published in Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929. First published under the title Kubismus, 1928. English translation, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, by Peter Brooke This dissatisfaction had already been seen in the works of the Romanticist Eugène Delacroix, in the Realism of Gustave Courbet, in passing through the Symbolists, Les Nabis, the Impressionists and the Neo- Impressionists. Paul Cézanne was instrumental, as his work marked a shift from a more representational art form to one that was increasingly abstract, with a strong emphasis on the simplification of geometric structure. In a letter addressed to Émile Bernard dated 15 April 1904, Cézanne writes: \\"Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point.\\"Erle Lora, Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs, Foreword by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006 Cézanne was preoccupied by the means of rendering volume and space, surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes. Increasingly in his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom. His work became bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly nonrepresentational. As his color planes acquired greater formal independence, defined objects and structures began to lose their identity. ===The first phase=== Georges Braque, 1908, Maisons et arbre (Houses at l'Estaque), oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further.Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York A reevaluation in their own work in relation to that of Cézanne had begun following a series of retrospective exhibitions of Cézanne's paintings held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.Daniel Robbins, Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985 By 1907, representational form gave way to a new complexity; subject matter progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953 From the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, an exhibition which officially introduced \\"Cubism\\" to the public as an organized group movement, and extending through 1913, the fine arts had evolved well beyond the teachings of Cézanne. Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, now they had been toppled. \\"It was a total regeneration\\", writes Gleizes, \\"indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realized that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it\\". The evolution towards rectilinearity and simplified forms continued through 1909 with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles; visible in the works of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay.Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, DortmundAlbert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Du \\"Cubisme\\", Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913) Pre-war: analysis and synthesis The Cubist method leading to 1912 has been considered 'analytical', entailing the decomposition of the subject matter (the study of things), while subsequently 'synthetic', built on geometric construction (free of such primary study). The terms Analytic Cubism and Synthetic Cubism originated through this distinction. By 1913 Cubism had transformed itself considerably in the range of spatial effects. At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants Jean Metzinger exhibited his monumental L'Oiseau bleu; Robert Delaunay L'équipe du Cardiff F.C.; Fernand Léger Le modèle nu dans l'atelier; Juan Gris L'Homme au Café; and Albert Gleizes Les Joueurs de football. At the 1913 Salon d'Automne, a salon in which the predominating tendency was Cubism, Metzinger exhibited En Canot; Gleizes Les Bâteaux de Pêche; and Roger de La Fresnaye La Conquête de l'Air. In these works, more so than before, can be seen the importance of the geometric plane in the overall composition. Historically, the first phase of Cubism is identified as much by the inventions of Picasso and Braque (amongst the so-called Gallery Cubists) as it is with the common interests towards geometrical structure of Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier (the Salon Cubists).Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993, Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60. As Cubism would evolve pictorially, so too would the crystallization of its theoretical framework advance beyond the guidelines set out in the Cubist manifesto Du \\"Cubisme\\", written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger in 1912; though Du \\"Cubisme\\" would remain the clearest and most intelligible definition of Cubism.

Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to continue making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an evasion of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation. Juan Gris, October 1916, Portrait of Josette Gris, 116 x 73 cm, Museo Reina Sofia This period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new mindset; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The flat surface became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting. Rather than relying on the purely intellectual, the focus now was on the immediate experience of the senses, based on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions' [\\"La forme, modifiant ses directions, modifiait ses dimensions\\"], while revealing the \\"basic elements\\" of painting, the \\"true, solid rules - rules which could be generally applied\\". It was Metzinger and Gris who, again according to Gleizes, \\"did more than anyone else to fix the basic elements... the first principles of the order that was being born\\". \\"But Metzinger, clear-headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done.\\" Ultimately, it was Gleizes who would take the synthetic factor furthest of all. The divers Cubist considerations manifested prior to World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now been replaced by a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary set of principles that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic. This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at Léonce Rosenberg's gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens, Auguste Herbin, Joseph Csaky, Gino Severini and Pablo Picasso—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by Maurice Raynal, an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed.Anna Jozefacka, Leonard A. Lauder, Research Center for Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2015 Raynal had been associated with Cubists since 1910 via the milieu of Le Bateau-Lavoir. David Cottington, Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-garde and Politics in Paris 1905-1914, Yale University Press, 1998, p. 152, Raynal, who would become one of the Cubists most authoritative and articulate proponents,David Cottington, Cubism and Its Histories, Manchester University Press, 2004, pp. 151-153, endorsed a wide range of Cubist activity and for those who produced it, but his highest esteem was directed toward two artists: Jean Metzinger, whose artistry Raynal equated with Renoir and who was 'perhaps the man who, in our epoch, knows best how to paint'. The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'. In 1915, while serving on the front line, Raynal suffered a minor shrapnel wound to the knee from exploding enemy artillery fire, though the injury did not necessitate his evacuation.L'Intransigeant, 9 July 1915, p. 2, National Library of France Upon returning from the front line, Raynal served briefly as director for publications of Rosenberg's l'Effort moderne.Le Siècle, 8 April 1919, p. 3, National Library of FranceLectures, Le Nouveau Spectateur, No. 5, 10 July 1919, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France For Raynal, research into art was based on an eternal truth, rather than on the ideal, on reality, or on certitude. Certitude was nothing more than based on a relative belief, while truth was in agreement with fact. The only belief was in the veracity of philosophical and scientific truths.Maurice Raynal, Quelques Intentions du Cubisme, éditions de L'Effort moderne, Paris, 1919 Femme au miroir (Lady at her Dressing Table), oil on canvas, 92.4 x 65.1 cm, private collection \\"Direct reference to observed reality\\" is present, but the emphasis is placed on the \\"self-sufficiency\\" of the artwork as objects unto themselves. The priority on \\"orderly qualities\\" and the \\"autonomous purity\\" of compositions are a prime concern, writes art historian Christopher Green. Crystal Cubism also coincided with the emergence of a methodical framework of theoretical essays on the topic, by Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Fernand Léger, Gino Severini, Pierre Reverdy, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Maurice Raynal. ===Metzinger=== Even before Raynal coined the term Crystal Cubism, one critic by the name of Aloës Duarvel, writing in L'Elan, referred to Metzinger's entry exhibited at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune as 'jewellery' (\\"joaillerie\\").La Tombola artistique au profit des artistes polonais victimes de la guerre, 28 décembre 1915 au 15 janvier 1916, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, 25, boulevard de la Madeleine, published in L'Elan, Number 8, January 1916 Another critic, Aurel, writing in L'Homme Enchaîné about the same December 1915 exhibition described Metzinger's entry as \\"a very erudite divagation of horizon blue and old red of glory, in the name of which I forgive him\\" [une divagation fort érudite en bleu horizon et vieux rouge de gloire, au nom de quoi je lui pardonne].Échos, 1915 et la peinture, L'Homme Enchaîné, Paris, A3, No. 455, Saturday, 8 January 1916 (front page) During the year 1916, Sunday discussions at the studio of Lipchitz, included Metzinger, Gris, Picasso, Diego Rivera, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Pierre Reverdy, André Salmon, Max Jacob, and Blaise Cendrars.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9–24 In a letter written in Paris by Metzinger to Albert Gleizes in Barcelona during the war, dated 4 July 1916, he writes: > After two years of study I have succeeded in establishing the basis of this > new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist > perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a > metaphysical perspective—I take full responsibility for the word. You can't > begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working > outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no > more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. > I have made a whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement > [déplacement], of reversal [retournement] etc. I have read Schoute, Rieman > (sic), Argand, Schlegel etc. The actual result? A new harmony. Don't take > this word harmony in its ordinary [banal] everyday sense, take it in its > original [primitif] sense. Everything is number. The mind [esprit] hates > what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible. That is > the secret. There in nothing more to it [pas de reste à l'opération]. > Painting, sculpture, music, architecture, lasting art is never anything more > than a mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the > internal and the external, the self [le moi] and the world. (Metzinger, 4 > July 1916)Peter Brooke, Higher Geometries, Precedents: Charles Henry and > Peter Lenz, The subjective experience of space, Metzinger, Gris and Maurice > Princet The 'new perspective' according to Daniel Robbins, \\"was a mathematical relationship between the ideas in his mind and the exterior world\\". The 'fourth space' for Metzinger was the space of the mind. In a second letter to Gleizes, dated 26 July 1916, Metzinger writes: > If painting was an end in itself it would enter into the category of the > minor arts which appeal only to physical pleasure... No. Painting is a > language—and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a > bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a > right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, > however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture—the End, it > is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916) Continuing, Metzinger mentions the differences between himself and Juan Gris: > Someone from whom I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I > cannot understand why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, > I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take > from things what seems to me to have meaning and be most suitable to express > my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those > stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting. At the Cycle-Race Track (Au Vélodrome), oil and sand on canvas, 130.4 x 97.1 cm, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice Le Fumeur (Man with Pipe), oil on canvas, 129.7 x 96.68 cm, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh Some of the ideas expressed in these letters to Gleizes were reproduced in an article written by the writer, poet, and critique Paul Dermée, published in the magazine SIC in 1919,Jean Metzinger, Une Esthétique, by Paul Dermée, SIC, Volume 4, Nos. 42, 43, March 30 and April 15, 1919, p. 336. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library but the existence of letters themselves remained unknown until the mid-1980s. While Metzinger's process of distillation is already noticeable during the latter half of 1915, and conspicuously extending into early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918. Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1915-16 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912-13, in paintings such as Au Vélodrome (1912) and Le Fumeur (c.1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief. Metzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a \\"new perspective\\" in accord with the \\"laws of displacement\\". In the case of Le Fumeur Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in Au Vélodrome. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non- essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards Soldier at a Game of Chess (1914–15), and a host of other works created after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as L'infirmière (The Nurse) location unknown, and Femme au miroir, private collection. > If the beauty of a painting solely depends on its pictorial qualities: only > retaining certain elements, those that seem to suit our need for expression, > then with these elements, building a new object, an object which we can > adapt to the surface of the painting without subterfuge.

(Jean Metzinger, quoted in Au temps des > Cubistes, 1910-1920)Jean Metzinger, quoted in Au temps des Cubistes, > 1910-1920, exhibition catalogue, Paris, Galerie Berès, 2006, p. 432. > Reproduced in Christie's Paris, 2 May 2012, Lot 23 notes For Metzinger, the Crystal period was synonymous with a return to \\"a simple, robust art\\".Jean Metzinger, quoted in Maurice Raynal, Modern French Painters, Tudor Publishing Co., New York, 1934, p. 125 Crystal Cubism represented an opening up of possibilities. His belief was that technique should be simplified and that the \\"trickery\\" of chiaroscuro should abandoned, along with the \\"artifices of the palette\\". He felt the need to do without the \\"multiplication of tints and detailing of forms without reason, by feeling\\": :\\"Feeling! It is like the expression of the old-school tragedian in acting! I want clear ideas, frank colors. 'No color, nothing but nuance', Verlaine used to say; but Verlaine is dead, and Homer is not afraid to handle color\\". (Metzinger) ===Gris=== Le Goûter (Tea Time) (left), and Juan Gris, 1912, Hommage à Pablo Picasso (right) Juan Gris' late arrival on the Cubist scene (1912) saw him influenced by the leaders of the movement: Picasso, of the 'Gallery Cubists' and Metzinger of the 'Salon Cubists'. John Golding, Visions of the Modern, University of California Press, 1994, , p. 90Picasso Posse: The Mona Lisa of Cubism, Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast His entry at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, Hommage à Pablo Picasso, was also an homage to Metzinger's Le goûter (Tea Time). Le goûter persuaded Gris of the importance of mathematics (numbers) in painting.John Richardson: A Life of Picasso, volume II, 1907–1917, The Painter of Modern Life, Jonathan Cape, London, 1996, p. 211 As art historian Peter Brooke points out, Gris started painting persistently in 1911 and first exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled Hommage à Pablo Picasso). \\"He appears with two styles\\", writes Brooke, \\"In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the Goûter and of Metzinger's later work in 1912. In the other, the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken\\".Peter Brooke, On \\"Cubism\\" in context, online since 2012 Art historian Christopher Green writes that the \\"deformations of lines\\" allowed by mobile perspective in the head of Metzinger's Tea-time and Gleizes's Portrait of Jacques Nayral \\"have seemed tentative to historians of Cubism. In 1911, as the key area of likeness and unlikeness, they more than anything released the laughter.\\" Green continues, \\"This was the wider context of Gris's decision at the Indépendants of 1912 to make his debut with a Homage to Pablo Picasso, which was a portrait, and to do so with a portrait that responded to Picasso's portraits of 1910 through the intermediary of Metzinger's Tea-time.Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin Von Maur, Juan Gris: [catalogue of the Exhibition], 1992, London and Otterlo, p. 160 While Metzinger's distillation is noticeable during the latter half of 1915 and early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918. Juan Gris, 1915, Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan, oil on canvas, 115.9 x 88.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art Kahnweiler dated the shift in style of Juan Gris to the summer and autumn of 1916, following the pointilliste paintings of early 1916; in which Gris brought into practice Divisionist theory via the incorporation of colored dots into his Cubist pictures. This timescale corresponds with the period after which Gris signed a contract with Léonce Rosenberg, following a rally of support by Henri Laurens, Lipchitz and Metzinger.Christian Derouet, Le cubisme \\"bleu horizon\\" ou le prix de la guerre. Correspondance de Juan Gris et de Léonce Rosenberg −1915-1917, Revue de l'Art, 1996, Vol. 113, Issue 113, pp. 40–64 \\"Here is the man who has meditated on everything modern\\", writes Guillaume Apollinaire in his 1913 publication The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations, \\"here is the painter who paints to conceive only new structures, whose aim is to draw or paint nothing but materially pure forms\\". Apollinaire compares the work of Gris with the \\"scientific cubism\\" of Picasso... \\"Juan Gris is content with purity, scientifically conceived. The conceptions of Juan Gris are always pure, and from this purity parallels are sure to spring\\".Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics, University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248, The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 2: Miscellany Number, Anderson, Margaret C. (editor), New York, 1922-12, Winter 1922, pp. 49-60 And spring they did. In 1916, drawing from black and white postcards representing works by Corot, Velázquez and Cézanne, Gris created a series of classical (traditionalist) Cubist figure paintings, employing a purified range of pictorial and structural features. These works set the tone for his quest of an ideal unity for the next five years. \\"These themes of pictorial architecture and the \\"constants\\" of tradition were consolidated and integrated\\", writes Green et al; \\"The inference was there to be drawn: to restore tradition was to restore not only an old subject-matter in new terms, but to find the unchanging principles of structure in painting. Cohesion in space (composition) and cohesion in time (Corot in Gris) were presented as a single, fundamental truth\\". Gris himself stressed the relativity and ephemerality of \\"truth\\" in his paintings (as a function of him) as in the world itself (as a function of society, culture and time); always susceptible to change. From 1915 to late 1916, Gris transited through three different styles of Cubism, writes Green: \\"starting with a solid extrapolation of the structures and materials of objects, moving into the placement of brilliant coloured dots drifting across flat signs for still-life objects, and culminating in a flattened 'chiaroscoro' realised in planar contrasts of a monochromatic palette\\". Gris's works from late 1916 through 1917, more so than before, exhibit a simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in the artists Woman with Mandolin, after Corot (September 1916) and in its epilogue Portrait of Josette Gris (October 1916). Juan Gris, 1917, Seated Woman (Mujer sentada), 116 × 73 cm, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum The clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly control the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism. In April 1919, following exhibitions by Laurens, Metzinger, Léger and Braque, Gris present nearly fifty works at Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort moderne. This first solo exhibition by GrisJuan Gris, Biography and Works, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza coincided with his prominence among the Parisian avant-garde. Gris was presented to the public as one of the 'purest' and one of the most 'classical' of the leading Cubists.Christopher Green, Juan Gris, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 Pablo Picasso, 1918, Arlequin au violon (Harlequin with Violin), oil on canvas, 142 x 100.3 cm, Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio Gris claimed to manipulate flat abstract planar surfaces first, and only in subsequent stages of his painting process would he 'qualify' them so that the subject-matter became readable. He worked 'deductively' on the global concept first, then consecrated on the perceptive details. Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works. Gris's open window series of 1921-22 appears to be a response to Picasso's open windows of 1919, painted in St. Raphael. By May 1927, the date of his death, Gris had been considered the leader of the second phase of Cubism (the Crystal period). ===Picasso=== While Metzinger and Gris were painting in advanced geometric form during the second phase of Cubism, Picasso worked on several projects simultaneously. Between 1915 and 1917, he began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. \\"Hard- edged square-cut diamonds\\", notes art historian John Richardson, \\"these gems do not always have upside or downside\\".John Richardson, A Life of Picasso: The Triumphant Years, 1917-1932, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Dec 24, 2008, pp. 77-78, Letter from Juan Gris to Maurice Raynal, 23 May 1917, Kahnweiler- Gris 1956, 18 \\"We need a new name to designate them,\\" wrote Picasso to Gertrude Stein: Maurice Raynal suggested \\"Crystal Cubism\\".Paul Morand, 1996, 19 May 1917, p. 143-4 These \\"little gems\\" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called return to order.

Returning to Paris in 1918, Csaky began a series of Cubist sculptures derived in part from a machine-like aesthetic; streamlined with geometric and mechanical affinities. By this time Csaky's artistic vocabulary had evolved considerably from his pre-war Cubism: it was distinctly mature, showing a new, refined sculptural quality. Few works of early modern sculpture are comparable to the work Csaky produced in the years directly succeeding World War I. These were nonrepresentational freely-standing objects, i.e., abstract three-dimensional constructions combining organic and geometric elements. \\"Csaky derived from nature forms which were in concordance with his passion for architecture, simple, pure, and psychologically convincing.\\" (Maurice Raynal, 1929)Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society The scholar Edith Balas writes of Csaky's sculpture following the war years: > \\"Csáky, more than anyone else working in sculpture, took Pierre Reverdy's > theoretical writings on art and cubist doctrine to heart. \\"Cubism is an > eminently plastic art; but an art of creation, not of reproduction and > interpretation.\\" The artist was to take no more than \\"elements\\" from the > external world, and intuitively arrive at the \\"idea\\" of objects made up of > what for him constant in value. Objects were not to be analyzed; neither > were the experiences they evoked. They were to be re-created in the mind, > and thereby purified. By some unexplained miracle the \\"pure\\" forms of the > mind, an entirely autonomous vocabulary, of (usual geometric) forms, would > make contact with the external world.\\" (Balas, 1998, p. 27) These 1919 works (e.g., Cones and Spheres, Abstract Sculpture, Balas, pp. 30–41) are made of juxtaposing sequences of rhythmic geometric forms, where light and shadow, mass and the void, play a key role. Though almost entirely abstract, they allude, occasionally, to the structure of the human body or modern machines, but the semblance functions only as \\"elements\\" (Reverdy) and are deprived of descriptive narrative. Csaky's polychrome reliefs of the early 1920s display an affinity with Purism—an extreme form of the Cubism aesthetic developing at the time—in their rigorous economy of architectonic symbols and the use of crystalline geometric structures. Csaky's Deux figures, 1920, Kröller-Müller Museum, employs broad planar surfaces accented by descriptive linear elements comparable to Georges Valmier's work of the following year (Figure 1921).Georges Valmier, Figure, 1921, oil on canvas, 97.1 x 74.9 cm Csaky's influences were drawn more from the art of ancient Egypt rather than from French Neoclassicism. Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Le Guitariste (The Guitar Player) With this intense flurry of activity, Csaky was taken on by Léonce Rosenberg, and exhibited regularly at the Galerie l'Effort Moderne. By 1920 Rosenberg was the sponsor, dealer and publisher of Piet Mondrian, Léger, Lipchitz and Csaky. He had just published Le Néo-Plasticisme—a collection of writings by Mondrian—and Theo van Doesburg's Classique-Baroque-Moderne. Csaky's showed a series of works at Rosenberg's gallery in December 1920. Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Instruments de musique (Still Life), bas relief, stone For the following three years, Rosenberg purchased Csaky's entire artistic production. In 1921 Rosenberg organized an exhibit titled Les maîtres du Cubisme, a group show that featured works by Csaky, Gleizes, Metzinger, Mondrian, Gris, Léger, Picasso, Laurens, Braque, Herbin, Severini, Valmier, Ozenfant and Survage. Csaky's works of the early 1920s reflect a distinct form of Crystal Cubism, and were produced in a wide variety of materials, including marble, onyx and rock crystal. They reflect a collective spirit of the time, \\"a puritanical denial of sensuousness that reduced the cubist vocabulary to rectangles, verticals, horizontals,\\" writes Balas, \\"a Spartan alliance of discipline and strength\\" to which Csaky adhered in his Tower Figures. \\"In their aesthetic order, lucidity, classical precision, emotional neutrality, and remoteness from visible reality, they should be considered stylistically and historically as belonging to the De Stijl movement.\\" (Balas, 1998) Jacques Lipchitz recounted a meeting during the First World War with the poet and writer close to the Abbaye de Créteil, Jules Romains: > I remember in 1915 when I was deeply involved in cubist sculpture but was > still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had a visit from the > writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, > \\"I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal.\\" And he answered in a > slightly mocking way, \\"What do you know about crystals?\\" At first I was > upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about > it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a > form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.Jacques > Lipchitz, his life in sculpture, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, > New Series, Vol. 30, No. 6 (Jun. - Jul., 1972), published by The > Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 285 (PDF) Henri Laurens, Céline Arnauld, reproduced in Tournevire, Edition de \\"L'Esprit nouveau\\", 1919Henri Laurens, in Celine Arnauld, Tournevire: Roman.

The International Dada Archive, The University of Iowa Libraries Henri Laurens, 1920, Le Petit boxeur, 43 cm, reproduced in Život 2 (1922) Both Lipchitz and Henri Laurens—late adherents to Cubist sculpture, following Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky, Umberto Boccioni, Otto Gutfreund and Picasso—began production in late 1914, and 1915 (respectively), taking Cubist paintings of 1913-14 as a starting point.Douglas Cooper, \\"The Cubist Epoch\\", Phaidon Press Limited, 1970, in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Both Lipchitz and Laurens retained highly figurative and legible components in their works leading up to 1915-16, after which naturalist and descriptive elements were muted, dominated by a synthetic style of Cubism under the influence of Picasso and Gris. Between 1916 and 1918 Lipchitz and Laurens developed a breed of advanced wartime Cubism (primarily in sculpture) that represented a process of purification. With observed reality no longer the basis for the depiction of subject, model or motif, Lipchitz and Laurens created works that excluded any starting point, based predominantly on the imagination, and continued to do so during the transition from war to peace. In December 1918 Laurens, a close friend of both Picasso and Braque, inaugurated the series of Cubist exhibitions at L'Effort Moderne (Lipchitz showed in 1920), by which time his works had wholly approached the Cubist retour à l'ordre. Rather than descriptive, these works were rooted in geometric abstraction; a species of architectural, polychromed multimedia Cubist constructions. ==Criticism== Pablo Picasso, Femme assise dans un fauteuil (Woman sitting in an armchair), reproduced in L'Elan, Number 9, 12 February 1916 From its first public exhibition in 1911, art critic Louis Vauxcelles had voiced his contempt for Cubism. In June 1918, Vauxcelles, writing under the pseudonym Pinturrichio, continued his attack:Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), Le Carnet des ateliers, Le Carnet de la Semaine, 9 June 1918, p. 9 > Integral Cubism is crumbling, vanishing, evaporating. Defections, every day, > reach the headquarters of pure painting. Soon Metzinger will be the last of > his species, representative of an abandoned doctrine. \\"And if one shall > remain, he'll whisper painfully, I'll be the one\\". (Vauxcelles, 1918) The following month, Vauxcelles forecast the final demise of Cubism by the fall of 1918.Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), De Profundis, Le Carnet de la Semaine, 28 July 1918, p. 6 With the fall came the end of the war, and in December, a series of exhibitions at Galerie l'Effort Moderne of Cubist works demonstrated that Cubism was still alive. Defections by Diego Rivera and from the Cubist circle, cited by Pinturrichio, proved to be insufficient grounds upon which to base his prediction. Vauxcelles even went as far as organizing a small exhibition at the galerie Blot (late 1918) of artists that appeared to be anti-Cubist; Lhote, Rivera and Favory among them. Allies in Vauxcelles ongoing battle against Cubism included Jean-Gabriel Lemoine (L'Intransigeant), Roland Chavenon (L'Information), Gustave Kahn (L'Heure), and Waldemar George (), who would soon become one of the leading post-war supporters of Cubism. Inversely, once a steadfast supporter of Cubism, André Salmon in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming it to have been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, and Blaise Cendrars, joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of lived experience toward a universe of purified objects. Similarly, Cendrars wrote in an article published May 1919 \\"The formulae of the Cubists' are becoming too narrow, and can no longer embrace the personality of the painters\\".Blaise Cendrars, Modernités, I, Quelle sera la nouvelle peinture?, La Rose Rouge, 3 May 1919. Reproduced in Aujourd'hui, Paris 1931, p. 98 ===Counter attacks=== Georges Braque, 1917, Guitare et verre (Guitar and Glass), oil on canvas, 60.1 x 91.5 cm, Kröller- Müller Museum, Otterlo The poet and theorist Pierre Reverdy had surpassed all rivals in his attacks on the anti-Cubist campaign between 1918 and 1919. He had been in close contact with the Cubists prior to the war, and in 1917 joined forces with two other poets who shared his points of view: Paul Dermée and Vicente Huidobro. In March of the same year Reverdy edited Nord-Sud.Pierre Reverdy, Nord-Sud, Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library The title of the magazine was inspired by the Paris Métro line that extended from Montmartre to Montparnasse, linking these two focal points of artistic creativity.André Breton, Œuvres complètes No. 1, Gallimard, La Pléiade, 1988, note 3, p. 1075 Reverdy began this project towards the end of 1916, with an art world still under the pressures of war, to show the parallels between the poetic theories of Guillaume Apollinaire of Max Jacob and himself in marking the burgeoning of a new era for poetry and artistic reflection. In Nord-Sud Reverdy, with the help of Dermée and Georges Braque, exposed his literary theories, and outlined a coherent theoretical stance on the latest developments in Cubism.Étienne-Alain Hubert, note au tome 1 des Œuvres complètes de Pierre Reverdy, Flammarion, page 1298 His treatise On Cubism, published in the first issue of Nord-Sud,Pierre Reverdy, Sur le Cubisme, Nord- Sud, Volume 1, Number 1, 15 March 1917, pp. 5-7, Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library did so perhaps most influentially.Pierre Reverdy, Arts, Nord-Sud, Volume 2, Number 16, October 1918, p. 4, Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library With his characteristic preference for offense rather than defense, Reverdy launched an attack against Vauxcelles' anti-Cubist crusade: > How many times has it been said that the art movement called Cubism is > extinguished? Each time that a purge occurs the critics of the other side, > who ask only that their desires be taken as facts, shout defection and howl > for its death. This is nothing basically but a ruse, because Pinturrichichio > [sic], of the Carnet de la Semaine and the others know very well that the > serious artists of this group are extremely happy to see go... those > opportunists who have taken over creations the significance of which they do > not even comprehend, and were attracted only by the love of buzz and > personal interest. It was predictable that these unrecommendable and > compromising people would renounce their endeavors sooner or later. > (Reverdy, 1918) Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 10, 1 December 1916 Another vigorous supporter of Cubism was the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg. By the end of 1918—filling in the vacuum left in the wake of D.-H. Kahnweiler's imposed exile—Rosenberg purchased works by almost all of the Cubists. His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider- ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to Le Carnet de la Semaine denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, in Rosenber's Hôtel particulier, 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris. This series of large exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists—began 18 December with Cubist sculptures by Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive, and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to Christopher Green, \\"this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its \\"new collective form\\" marked by \\"intellectual rigor\\". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction\\".

The first exhibition of Purist Art opened on 21 December 1918, with works by Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (later called Le Corbusier), who claimed to be successors of pre-war Cubism.L'Intransigeant, 31 January 1921, p. 2, National Library of France The beginnings of a Purist manifesto in book-form had been published to coincided with the exhibition, titled Après le cubisme (After Cubism):Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, Après le cubisme, Éditions des Commentaires, Paris, 1918 > The War over, everything organizes, everything is clarified and purified; > factories rise, already nothing remains as it was before the War: the great > Competition has tested everything and everyone, it has gotten rid of the > aging methods and imposed in their place others that the struggle has proven > their betters... toward rigor, toward precision, toward the best utilization > of forces and materials, with the least waste, in sum a tendency toward > purity.Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, Après le cubisme, quoted > in Paul Mattick, Art In Its Time: Theories and Practices of Modern > Aesthetics, Routledge, 2003, pp. 77-77, Amédée Ozenfant, 1920-21, Nature morte (Still Life), oil on canvas, 81.28 cm x 100.65 cm, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Ozenfant and Jeanneret felt that Cubism had become too decorative,Philip Speiser, Villa La Rocca, Fondation Le Corbusier, September 2009, p. 10 practiced by so many individuals that it lacked unity, it had become too fashionable. Their clarity of subject matter (more figurative, less abstract than the Cubists) had been welcomed by members of the anti-Cubist camp. They showed works that were a direct result of observation; perspectival space only slightly distorted. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, like Lhote, remained faithful to the Cubist idiom that form should not be abandoned. Some of the works exhibited related directly to the Cubism practiced during the war (such as Ozenfant's Bottle, Pipe and Books, 1918), with flattened planar structures and varying degrees of multiple perspective.

Crès et Cie, 1925 In 1915, in collaboration with Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, Ozenfant founded the magazine L'Élan, which he edited until late 1916.L'élan, Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library In 1917 he met Jeanneret, with whom he would join forces between 1918 and 1925 on a venture called Purism: a variation of Cubism in both painting and architecture. In collaboration with the pro-Cubist writer, poet, and critique Paul Dermée, Ozenfant and Jeanneret founded the avant-garde journal L'Esprit Nouveau, published from 1920 to 1925. In the last issue, Jeanneret, under the pseudonym Paul Boulard, writes of how the laws of nature were manifested in the shape of crystals; the properties of which were hermetically coherent, both interiorly and exteriorly. In La peinture moderne, under the title Vers le crystal, Ozenfant and Jeanneret liken the properties of crystals with the true Cubist, whose œuvre tends toward the crystal.Jan de Heer, The Architectonic Colour: Polychromy in the Purist Architecture of Le Corbusier 010 Publishers, 2009, p. 139, > Certain Cubists have created paintings that can be said to tend toward the > perfection of the crystal. These works seem to approach our current needs. > The crystal is, in nature, a phenomenon that affects us most because it > clearly shows the path to geometric organization. Nature sometimes shows us > how forms are built through a reciprocal interplay of internal and external > forces... following the theoretical forms of geometry; and man delights in > these arrangements because he finds in them justification for his abstract > conceptions of geometry: the spirit of man and nature find a factor of > common ground, in the crystal... In true Cubism, there something organic > that proceeds from the inside to the outside... The universality of the work > depends on its plastic purity. (Ozenfant and Jeanneret, 1923-25) A second Purist exhibition was held at the Galerie Druet, Paris, in 1921. In 1924 Ozenfant opened a free studio in Paris with Fernand Léger, where he taught with Aleksandra Ekster and Marie Laurencin.Judi Freeman, \\"Ozenfant, Amédée\\", Grove Art Online. Retrieved 26 November 2012 Ozenfant and Le Corbusier wrote La Peinture moderne in 1925. In final issue of L'élan, published December 1916, Ozenfant writes: \\"Le Cubisme est un movement de purism\\" (Cubism is a movement of purism).Amédée Ozenfant, Notes sur le cubisme, L'élan, Number 10, 1 December 1916, p. 3. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library And in La peinture moderne, 1923–25, with Cubism visibly still alive and in highly crystalline form, Ozenfant and Jeanneret write: > We see the real cubists continue their work, imperturbable; they are also > seen to continue their influence on spirits... They will arrive more or less > strongly depending on the oscillations of their nature, their tenacity or > their concessions and analysis [tâtonnement] that are characteristic of > artistic creation, to search for a state of clarification, condensation, > firmness, intensity, synthesis; they will arrive at a true virtuosity of the > game of shapes and colors, as well as a highly developed science of the > composition. Overall and despite the personal coefficients, one can discern > a tendency towards what might be imaged in saying: tendency toward the > crystal. The Crystal Cubists embraced the stability of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right to the core of its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: \\"that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of Naturalism was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, was something in its own right with its own laws\\". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: \\"the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone\\". ==Gleizes== Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R.

Guggenheim Museum, New York This work, a precursor to Crystal Cubism, consists of broad, overlapping planes of brilliant color, dynamically intersecting vertical, diagonal, horizontal lines coupled with circular movements.Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 These two works, according to Gleizes, represented a break from 'Cubism of analysis', from the representation of volume of the first period of Cubism. He had now undertaken a path that lead to 'synthesis', with its starting point in 'unity'.Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914, La guerre, Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15.

Dépôt du Centre Pompidou, 1998). The 1920 version, reproduced in Ozenfant, Jeanneret, La peinture moderne, was reworked in 1923 This unity, and the highly crystalline geometricized materialization consisting of superimposed constituent planes of Crystal Cubism would ultimately be described by Gleizes, in La Peinture et ses lois (1922–23), as 'simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane'. The synthetic factor was ultimately taken furthest of all from within the Cubists by Gleizes. Gleizes believed that the Crystal Cubists—specifically Metzinger and Gris—had found the principles on which an essentially non- representational art could be built. He felt that the earlier abstract works of artists such as František Kupka and , lacked a solid foundation.July 09: Futurism at the Tate Modern: a review by Peter Brooke, From Cubism to Classicism, Painting and its Laws, From Cubism to Classicism by Gino Severini / Painting and its laws by Albert Gleizes, Francis Boutle, 2001 , In his 1920 publication, Du Cubisme et les moyens de le comprendre, Gleizes explained that Cubism was now at a stage of development in which fundamental principles could be deduced from particular facts, applicable to a defined class of phenomena, drawn and taught to students. These basic theoretical postulates could be as productive for future developments of the fine arts as the mathematically based principles of three-dimensional perspective had been since the Renaissance.Peter Brooke, Victor Poznanski and the exhibition L'art d'aujourd'hui, 1925, Gleizes - ups and downs of Cubism ===Painting and its Laws=== Albert Gleizes undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in Painting and its Laws (La Peinture et ses lois), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, and as a book in 1924.Albert Gleizes, Painting and Its Laws, summary by Peter BrookePierre Alibert, Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme, Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, In La Peinture et ses lois Gleizes deduces the fundamental laws of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the physical laws. This theory, subsequently referred to as translation-rotation, \\"ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich\\", writes art historian Daniel Robbins, \\"as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms\\". One of Gleizes's primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists fantaisie, can it be attained?Albert Gleizes, La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme, La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form Albert Gleizes, front cover of Action, Cahiers Individualistes de philosophie et d'art, Volume 1, No. 1, February 1920 The approach: Gleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: \\"The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation\\" (p. 31); \\"Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste\\" (p. 42); \\"The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]\\" (p. 43); \\"The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact\\" (p. 56); \\"Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion\\" (p. 59); \\"The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting\\" (p. 22).Albert Gleizes, Le Cubisme et la Tradition, Montjoie, Paris, 10 February 1913, p. 4. Reprinted as A Propos du Salon d'Automne, in Tradition et Cubisme, Paris, 1927. Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art. Continuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p. 62). \\"The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition\\" (p. 63). Defining the laws: Rhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp. 35, 38, 51). This mechanism is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefore both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian , the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization. The problem set out by Gleizes was to replace anecdote as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color. Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various symmetries such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions. (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another. The choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through translation and rotation. Schematic illustrations: 1\\\\. Movements of translation of the plane to one side Space and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer. 2\\\\. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane Another movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine. 3\\\\. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane resulting in the creation of a spatial and rhythmic plastic organism With these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is \\"a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states\\". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism. 4\\\\. Plastic spatial and rhythmic system obtained by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side Fig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a \\"plastic spatial and rhythmic system\\", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more complex than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the possibilities of the plane to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power. [L'exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d'un univers matériel en dehors de l'intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la possibilité du plan de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance]. ==The end-product== Throughout the war, to Armistice of 11 November 1918 and the series of exhibitions at Galerie de L'Effort Moderne that followed, the rift between art and life—and the overt distillation that came with it—had become the canon of Cubist orthodoxy; and it would persist despite its antagonists through the 1920s: > Order remained the keynote as post-war reconstruction commenced. It is not > surprising, therefore, to find a continuity in the development of Cubist art > as the transition was made from war to peace, an unbroken commitment to the > Latin virtues along with an unbroken commitment to the aesthetically pure. > The new Cubism that emerged, the Cubism of Picasso, Laurens, Gris, Metzinger > and Lipchitz most obviously of all, has come to be known as \\"crystal > Cubism\\". It was indeed the end-product of a progressive closing down of > possibilities in the name of a \\"call to order\\". (Christopher Green, 1987, p. > 37) More so than the pre-war Cubist period, the Crystal Cubist period has been described by Green as the most important in the history of Modernism: > In terms of a Modernist will to aesthetic isolation and of the broad theme > of the separation of culture and society, it is actually Cubism after 1914 > that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and > especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 > did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded > insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its > own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. > It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned > with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism now, because it was only > then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are > closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American > Modernism in the sixties and after. (Green, 1987, Introduction, p. 1) Art historian Peter Brooke has commented on Crystal Cubism, and more generally on the Salon Cubists: :\\"A general history of Salon Cubism, however, still needs to be written, a history that could be extended to include the wonderful collective phenomenon which Christopher Green has called 'Crystal Cubism' — the highly structured work of the Cubist painters... who remained in Paris during the war, most notably Metzinger and Gris. An opening up of this early Cubism in all its intellectual fullness would... reveal it as being not only the most radical movement in painting of the past century but, still, the most rich in possibilities for the future\\".

He served one term in the Wisconsin State Senate as a Republican. ==Early life== Colman was born on July 28, 1828, in Rochester, New York, a city co-founded by his grandfather, Colonel Nathaniel Rochester. As a young man, he trained as a civil engineer and worked on the Erie Canal. He moved to Empire, Wisconsin, in 1852, at age 24, and took up farming, though he continued to look for work as an engineer. ==Civil War service== In the fall of 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Colman assisted in raising a company of volunteers to answer President Abraham Lincoln's call for three-year enlistments. Colman was made 1st Lieutenant of his company, which became Company A of the 18th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The regiment mustered into service on March 15, 1862, under Colonel James S. Alban, who selected Lieutenant Colman as Adjutant. The 18th Wisconsin arrived at St. Louis on March 31, and then took barges up the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. The regiment arrived around noon on Saturday, April 5, and were assigned to the command of General Benjamin Prentiss, marching the rest of the day to reach his headquarters, going into camp at dusk without supper. During the night, Confederate forces under Albert Sidney Johnston marched to within two miles of the Union lines and attacked near dawn on Sunday, April 6, the start of the Battle of Shiloh. The regiment was hastily arranged into battle lines. Initially, their left was supported by the 15th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but they had not yet been supplied with ammunition and were forced to withdraw as a result. After about two hours of fighting, the entire division began a retreat, it was around this time that Lieutenant Colman was severely wounded when he was shot in the head. He was carried from the field by 2nd Lieutenant Thomas J. Potter, who was also wounded in the battle. Lieutenant Colman's life was likely saved by Potter's action, as he was considered unlikely to survive the head wound. Both Colman and Potter were sent home on medical leave following their injuries. Potter died of his wound five months later. Colman carried the bullet in his head for the rest of his life. Despite the severity of his injury, Colman was able to return to service with the regiment and participated in the Vicksburg campaign in the spring of 1863. He was present at the Battle of Jackson, Mississippi, and was wounded again at the Battle of Champion Hill. After his second wound, he transitioned to the Veteran Reserve Corps and participated in the recruiting service, first with a recruiting station in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, then at Madison, Wisconsin, and St. Louis, Missouri, before being sent to Washington, D.C., where he served on the Examining Board. In January 1865, he was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel for the newly organized 49th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment and joined the regiment in Missouri where they engaged in guard duty until the end of the war. The regiment mustered out of service on November 8, 1865. Colman received a promotion to Colonel shortly before mustering out. ==Postbellum career== Shortly after the war, Colman was appointed Superintendent of Public Property in Madison and served there for about one and a half years. After that he became involved in the banking industry and was, for nine years, treasurer of the Fond Du Lac Savings Bank. In 1877, Colman returned to Empire, Wisconsin, and was elected Sheriff of Fond du Lac County for a two year term, running on the Republican Party ticket. He remained in Empire, working as cashier for the Mihills Manufacturing Company and was elected City Treasurer for two terms. In 1881, he was elected to represent Fond du Lac County in the Wisconsin State Senate for the 1882 and 1883 sessions, but with the ratification of changes to senate and assembly terms in 1881, Colman's term was effectively extended through 1884, though no additional legislative business occurred that year. On September 4, 1898, he died in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, while attending services at Grace Episcopal Church. ==Personal life and family== Colman was a grandson of Colonel Nathaniel Rochester, who was the namesake and one of the founders of Rochester, New York. His sister, Cornelia Colman, married Union Army General Edward S. Bragg, of the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who later became a U.S. Congressman. ==References== - Category:Politicians from Rochester, New York Category:People from Empire, Wisconsin Category:Wisconsin state senators Category:Wisconsin sheriffs Category:Wisconsin Republicans Category:People of Wisconsin in the American Civil War Category:Union Army colonels Category:American shooting survivors Category:1828 births Category:1898 deaths Category:Military personnel from Rochester, New York Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Edward Colman (American politician)"},{"id":"46904796","text":"Padasak Tanviriyavechakul (; , born 17 May 1995) is a Thai table tennis player.

Emerging Energies had been looking to construct a wind farm in northeast Wisconsin since 2004. The permits were secured from the town of Glenmore in 2007. In 2009, Emerging Energies sold a 90 percent stake in the project to Central Hudson Energy Group. Construction on the wind farm began in April 2009. The farm began commercial operation in December 2010, selling the power to Wisconsin Public Service Corporation. In 2011, Duke Energy purchased Shirley Wind. == Electricity Production == {  +Generation Shirley Wind Power Plant (MW-h) and Capacity Factor !Year !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec !Annual (Total) ! !Capacity Factor (%) - !2010 - - - - - - - - - - 1,583 1,337 !2,920  10.0 - !2011 4,059 6,386 4,705 6,086 6,287 4,082 2,741 2,167 3,722 5,131 6,573 6,289 !58,228  33.2 - !2012 7,956 4,996 7,113 5,913 5,448 4,766 2,710 3,130 4,257 6,210 5,628 5,602 !63,729  36.4 - !2013 7,648 5,768 5,165 7,285 5,312 2,906 2,616 2,503 3,863 4,922 7,470 5,310 !60,769  34.7 - !2014 8,538 6,449 6,588 7,281 4,768 4,071 3,633 2,223 3,655 6,082 6,870 4,859 !65,018  37.1 - !2015 5,757 5,244 6,056 6,108 6,181 2,969 3,110 3,843 3,840 6,503 8,037 7,117 !64,766  37.0 - !2016 5,688 6,335 5,045 5,991 4,910 3,668 3,307 2,297 4,421 4,875 5,849 7,966 !60,350  34.4 - !2017 5,931 6,297 6,609 6,443 5,467 4,625 2,330 2,069 2,645 5,967 6,578 6,518 !61,479  35.1 - !2018 7,247 5,268 5,940 4,741 4,032 2,783 2,328 2,516 2,827 5,102 4,852 5,319 !52,955  30.2 - !2019 *            !  0.0 - !2020             !  0.0 } * Data not available ==Health hazard== Soon after the wind farm went into operation, local residents began complaining of health problems they said were caused by low frequency noise stemming from the wind turbines. Ultimately, over 75 local residents filed complaints with the Brown County Board of Health. In January 2012, the Brown County Board of Health requested emergency aid from the state to assist families suffering from the effects of the wind farm. In January 2013, a study of the low frequency noise was completed, which showed that three of the houses studied had evidence of low frequency noise, but in only one house was that noise coming from the outside. However, the study could not conclude that the health effects experienced by local residents were caused by the wind farm. In October 2014, the Brown County Board of Health declared the Shirley Wind farm a \\"human health hazard\\", based on the complaints of local residents, becoming the first board of health in the country to make such a declaration. In December 2015, after reviewing studies and evidence, Brown County Health Director Chua Xiong declared that there was insufficient evidence linking the wind turbines to the illnesses suffered by local residents. This decision was called into question after an Open Records request revealed that Xiong experienced migraines when near the wind turbines. She said: \\"The times I have been out there by the Wind Turbines, l get such migraine headaches, I think I should take some preventative Tylenol before I head out there.\\" Migraines are a frequently observed symptom reported to the Brown County Health Department by people living near Shirley Wind's turbines when they are operating. Xiong resigned her position the day before the emails were revealed to a local citizen's group through an Open Records request. ==See also== *Wind power in Wisconsin *Solar power in Wisconsin *Wind power in the United States *List of wind farms == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Brown County, Wisconsin Category:Wind farms in Wisconsin Category:Duke Energy ","title":"Shirley Wind"},{"id":"46905018","text":"Romance in Rio is a studio album by singer/songwriter Stephen Bishop.

In 1900 she was caught up in the Boxer Rebellion. Douw’s father was Volckert Pieter Douw, a land owner in Albany, New York, whose family had arrived from Holland and settled in 1638. Douw’s mother was Helen Louise Franchot, daughter of Judge Stanislas Pascal Franchot, who was born in France and settled in Oswego County, New York. Douw was born on April 19, 1835, the eldest of eight children. Her family home was Wolvenhoeck, Greenbush on the east bank of the Hudson. By intermarriage she was related to many of the old and influential families including: Van Rensselaer, Beekman, Ten Broeck, De Peyster, Van Cortlandt and Livingston. In 1869 Douw made her first visit to China on behalf of the Woman's Union Missionary Society of America for Heathen Lands (WUMS). Later renamed the Woman's Union Missionary Society of America. She went to Beijing with two other women, Mrs Catherine Bonney and Miss Emily Adams, to open a boarding school for girls. In 1881 the mission was moved to Shanghai at which time a day-school was added to the facility. WUMS was one of the first organisations to permit single women to carry out this type of missionary work. They played an important role, working with women in situations where the presence of male missionaries would be inappropriate or forbidden. Some years later Douw funded the building of a female pavilion at the Pekin Presbyterian Hospital and paid for the attendance of a female doctor for this same reason. The hospital was run by Boudinot Currie Atterbury, a Presbyterian doctor from a wealthy family in America. Douw, was related to Atterbury via the Van Rensselaer family and she became one of his largest sponsors. Douw returned several times to China to continue her work. She set up a fund with the Woman’s Union Missionary Society of America for evangelistic work in Shanghai called the Douw Foundation. This supported two missionaries, a bible school and women teachers. She also funded her own Christian Alliance Mission in Beijing. In 1900 she was at the mission during the Boxer Rebellion when she and other missionaries were trapped in the foreign Legations. They were eventually rescued by a combined international force of troops and she returned to America, but never fully recovered from this experience and died in 1911. ==NotesReferences== Category:1835 births Category:1911 deaths Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American Protestant missionaries Category:American expatriates in China Category:De Peyster family Category:Van Rensselaer family Category:Protestant missionaries in China ","title":"Deborah Matilda Douw"},{"id":"46905129","text":"John Cox Wickwire (December 21, 1899 – August 20, 1994) was a Canadian politician.

It was first formally described in 1984, declared extinct in 1992, rediscovered in 2004, removed from the \\"extinct\\" list in 2013 and found to have a population of at least 25,000 in 2015. It is a small erect shrub with crowded hairy leaves and red flowers. In 2014 Craven, Edwards and Cowley proposed that the species be renamed Melaleuca accedens. ==Description== Calothamnus accedens grows to a height of about and has a single trunk, sometimes with papery bark, but is densely branched. Its leaves are crowded at the ends of the branches, stiff and needle-like, mostly long and wide. They are covered with long, whitish hairs at first but become glabrous with age and have distinct oil glands. The flowers are a shade of dark pink to crimson and arranged in clusters of 4 to 10, mostly on one side of the stem. The petals are long with a prominent vein in the centre. The stamens are arranged in claw-like bundles with 15 to 21 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs in February and is followed by fruits which are woody, cup-shaped or cylindrical capsules, long and in diameter. ==Taxonomy and naming== Calothamnus accedens was first formally described in 1984 by Trevor Hawkeswood from a specimen found on a roadside between Piawaning and Wongan Hills. The population in that area was apparently destroyed during roadwork in the 1980s and the species declared extinct in 1992. In 2004 a specimen was collected in a botanical survey, then other populations were located so that by 2007, the population size was estimated at more than 25,000 and the species was removed from the endangered list. The specific epithet (accedens) is derived from \\"Latin, meaning approximating or resembling.\\" The name refers to this species close relationshipe to C. brevifolius and C. hirsutus. ==Distribution and habitat== Calothamnus accedens occurs in the area between Perth and to the north of Perth in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy soils over laterite. ==Conservation== This species was removed from the extinct list on 6 March 2013 and is recommended for removal from all lists under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Although some populations are in areas outside protected zones, it is estimated that at least 20,000 individual plants are in a national park. It is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Western Australian government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that is rare or near threatened. ==References== accedens Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1984 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ","title":"Calothamnus accedens"},{"id":"46905325","text":"The Alice River is a river located on the Cape York Peninsula of Far North Queensland, Australia.

It participates in the regions semi-professional competition, the Illawarra Premier League. Port Kembla FC home ground is Wetherall Park, located in the suburb of Primbee on the Port Kembla peninsula. The club is the most successful of all the Illawarra Premier League teams having won both the Premiership seven times, and the Championship nine times. Port Kembla has also won the Bert Bampton Cup – the knockout club competition for the region – a record five times. The first premiership, grand final and Bert Bampton Cup success was achieved in 1995 under head coach and 1974 Australian World Cup player Adrian Noddy Alston. The club has had several well-known footballers play with the club, including ex A league and NSL players Jeromy Harris, Jon Angelucci, Mineo Bonetig, Tony Pezzano, Jock Morlando, Daniel Beltrame, Robbie Davies, Dominic Longo, Andrew Ravanello and Port Kembla junior and current A-League player Corey Gameiro. ==HistoryFoundation=== Port Kembla FC was founded in 1966 by a group of Italian migrants in the Marina coffee lounge in Warrawong. Soon they began playing matches against a group of players from the Italo coffee lounge in neighbouring Port Kembla with the losers having to pay for the winners dinner. Eventually both sides got together and decided it would be a better idea to form a single club and enter it into a local competition. With the majority of the players being of Italian heritage and background, they decided to call the club Warrawong Azzurri however this was unsuccessful as the head football body Soccer Australia were trying to eliminate ethnic names for football clubs in the aim of reducing tensions between rival ethnic backgrounds. A further application of Lake Heights Blues was similarly rejected on the same grounds. However the president of former Port Kembla club Port Kembla Dunubia approached the group and inquired if they were interested in taking Danubia's spot in the local competition. Both parties agreed, and having settled upon the name of Port Kembla FC the club was born. ===Illawarra Premier League=== Port Kembla initially struggled to find a permanent home ground for the first couple of decades, playing in local parks until 1980 when they received permission to build a ground in nearby Primbee – Wetherall Park -, which is their home ground still today. Success would not come easily, not quickly for Port Kembla with the club not winning their first silverware in the Illawarra Premier League until 1995 when they won both the Premiership and Grand final, 29 years after their foundation. After winning the 1996 grand final, they wouldn't see further success until the flood gates literally opened post-2000, when they finished first 4 years in a row from 2000 to 2004, as well as backing up and winning the grand final in 2000, 2003, and 2004. They won the premiership against in 2010, and won both the premiership and grand final in 2013. ==Honours== *Illawarra Premier League :Premiers (7): 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2013 :Grand Final Winners (9): 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2013, 2017 *Bert Bampton Cup :Winners (4): 1991, 1995, 1998, 2005, 2007 *Premier League Player of the Year : (1999) Mineo Bonetig, (2001) Michael Clare *Premier League Golden Boot : (2001) Nick Polimenakos, (2003, 2004) Shane McGirr, (2013) Nuno Peres ==Notable former players and coaches== * Corey Gameiro – Junior player at the club, Formerly playing in the A-League with Brisbane Roar and Central Coast Mariners. * / Adrian Alston – English born footballer who represented Australia 43 times, scoring 7 goals from 1969 to 1970, including at Australia's inaugural FIFA World Cup in West Germany in 1974 where West German coach Helmut Schön famously stated \\"We have nothing to fear from Australia....apart from Adrian Alston\\".

Known for his gigantic trompe-l'œil-style murals in central Tehran, Ghadyanloo has become the most prolific Iranian public artist with over 100 murals across the globe in the USA, the UK, Russia and his native Iran. Ghadyanloo also creates paintings, with surreal and minimalistic themes. While his colourful commissioned mural works have led to him being simplistically coined as Iran’s answer to Banksy by the press, Ghadyanloo is more inclined to draw comparisons with European surrealist painters such as Magritte, Girgio de Chirico and the minimal lines of modernist 20th century architects such as Le Corbusier. Mehdi takes his inspirations of Giorgio de Chirico, Magritte, and the minimalism of Le Corbusier, and turns them into a voice all of his own. ==Early life and education== Ghadyanloo was born in Karaj, Iran (a suburb of Tehran) in 1981. His father was a farmer and his mother a carpet weaver. He grew up during the Iran–Iraq War in which his father served as a soldier. Until age 18, Ghadyanloo lived and worked on his family's farm in Karaj. He enrolled in the University of Tehran, studying painting in the university's Fine Arts faculty. He graduated from the university in 2004. He later earned a master's degree in animation from Tarbiat Modares University. He gained a wider public attention after he was commissioned by the Ministry of Beautification of Iran to paint walls around the capital Tehran. From 2004 to 2011 to he had done more than hundred painted wall pieces that are both loved by the public and citizens and art critics and curators. It was very soon he attracted the interest of the international press, galleries like Richard Howard-Griffin, major public commissions for murals on Kings Cross and The Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy in 2016 in Dewey Square, Boston. In March 2017 he had the first exhibition in two years entitled Spaces of Hope in the Howard Griffin Gallery, London. == Career == In 2006, Ghadyanloo responded to an open call for submissions from Tehran's Bureau of Beautification. He submitted concepts which the Bureau approved, and he then began painting murals throughout the city. By 2014, Ghadyanloo had painted over 100 murals on formerly blank walls in Tehran and the murals that he created employed tromp l’oeil techniques. In early 2015, he held his first exhibition in Britain entitled Perception at the Howard Griffin Gallery in London which proved so popular that all the canvases sold out before the exhibition opened. He also painted several murals in the city, including one in Shoreditch. In March 2017 Ghadyanloo staged the exhibition \\"Space of Hope\\" in London at the 14,000 square foot Ambika P3. The paintings in the exhibition were compared to those of Le Corbusier. Same year in October, Ghadyanloo became the first Iranian artist to be commissioned in both Iran and the US since the revolution in 1979, when he completed a major public commission for the Rose Kennedy Greenway project in Boston, US. A mural emblazoned across a 5,230 sq. ft. wall opposite the city’s South Station. \\" In 2018 , joined by a small team of muralists from his hometown, he completed Rebuilding the Sky in Almetyevsk, Russia, in similar style to his perspective- challenging and illusion-based works in Tehran. Ghadyanloo wanted to add joyfulness and color to the concrete look of the city. Around the same time, he also painted a piece titled The Fraud and Hope on the rooftop of the OK Center for Contemporary Art in Linz, Austria, which depicts a huge water swirl and a gaping black hole. The piece was created as commentary on the issue of the global warming, melting ice, and the role of water, but also references migration crises and the artist’s personal phobias. In 2019 he was commissioned by World Economic forum to design and paint a large-scale painting titled Finding Hope specifically for 2019 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. == Exhibitions == 2020\\\\.

Skin temperature trends do not necessarily reflect air temperature trends. The effects of climate change in Antarctica may include rising temperatures and increasing snowmelt and ice loss.The Danger of a Runaway Antarctica March 31, 2016, A summary study in 2018 incorporating calculations and data from many other studies estimated that total ice loss was 43 gigatons per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatons per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017. ==Effects== The continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is positive and significant at >0.05 °C/decade since 1957.Retrieved=2009-01-22 The West Antarctic ice sheet has warmed by more than 0.1 °C/decade in the last 50 years, with most of the warming occurring in winter and spring. This is somewhat offset by cooling in East Antarctica during the fall. This effect is restricted to the 1980s and 1990s. Research published in 2009 found that overall the continent had become warmer since the 1950s, a finding consistent with the influence of man-made climate change: :\\"We can't pin it down, but it certainly is consistent with the influence of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels\\", said NASA scientist Drew Shindell, another study co-author. Some of the effects also could be natural variability, he said.Antarctica study challenges warming skeptics, Jan 21, 2009, ===2000s=== The British Antarctic Survey, which has undertaken the majority of Britain's scientific research in the area, had the following positions in 2006: * Ice makes cold climate- sensitive by introducing a strong positive feedbacks loop. * Melting of continental Antarctic ice could contribute to global sea-level rise. * Climate models predict more snowfall than ice melting during the next 50 years, but the models are not good enough for them to be confident about the prediction. * Antarctica seems to be both warming around the edges and cooling at the center at the same time. Thus it is not possible to say whether it is warming or cooling overall. * There is no evidence for a decline in the overall Antarctic sea ice extent. * The central and southern parts of the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula have warmed by about 2.4 °C. The cause is not known. * Changes have occurred in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica. September 20, 2007 NASA map showing previously un-melted snowmelt The area of strongest cooling appears at the South Pole, and the region of strongest warming lies along the Antarctic Peninsula. A possible explanation is that loss of UV-absorbing ozone may have cooled the stratosphere and strengthened the polar vortex, a pattern of spinning winds around the South Pole. The vortex acts like an atmospheric barrier, preventing warmer, coastal air from moving into the continent's interior. A stronger polar vortex might explain the cooling trend in the interior of Antarctica. In their latest study (September 20, 2007) NASA researchers have confirmed that Antarctic snow is melting farther inland from the coast over time, melting at higher altitudes than ever and increasingly melting on Antarctica's largest ice shelf. There is also evidence for widespread glacier retreat around the Antarctic Peninsula.IPCC 2007, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, 2007, page 376. ===2010s=== Researchers reported on December 21, 2012 in Nature Geoscience that from 1958 to 2010, the average temperature at the mile-high Byrd Station rose by 2.4 degrees Celsius, with warming fastest in its winter and spring. The spot which is in the heart of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. West Antarctica warming fast; Temperature record from high-altitude station shows unexpectedly rapid rise December 21, 2012 Science News A study of the Antarctic Peninsula, a small subregion of Lesser Antarctica, published in 2017 found that the temperature trends at the northern tip of the Peninsula, the north-east region of the Peninsula, and the South Shetland Islands \\"shifted from a warming trend of 0.32 °C/decade during 1979–1997 to a cooling trend of -0.47 °C/decade during 1999–2014\\" but that this variation was absent from the south-west region of the Peninsula. A 2018 systematic review of all previous studies and data by the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) found that Antarctica lost 2720 ± 1390 gigatons of ice during the period from 1992 to 2017, enough to contribute 7.6 millimeters to sea level rise once all detached icebergs melt. Most ice losses occurred in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. The overall loss has substantially accelerated since the 2012 IMBIE assessment: an average loss of 43 gigatons per year during the first ten years, 1992 to 2002, rose to an average of 220 gigatons per year in the last 5 years. East Antarctica appears to have experienced a net gain of a relatively small amount of ice during the 25-years although uncertainty is greater due to subsidence of the underlying bedrock. Through his ongoing study, climate scientist, Nick Golledge, has estimated that Antarctic ice sheets will continue to melt and will have a profound effect on global climate.According to Golledge's analysis, by the year 2100, 25 centimeters of water will have been added to the world's ocean, as water temperature continues to rise. === 2020s === A study made by a group of scientists in 2020, found that in the years 1989 - 2018 the south pole had warmed by 1.8°C, three times more than the global average. From this warming 0.8°C is due to natural cycles that can cause after similar cooling, but 1.0°C is from Climate Change. methane in Antarctica and report that \\"the rate of microbial succession may have an unrealized impact on greenhouse gas emission from marine methane reservoirs\\". 50px Text and images are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ==ReferencesExternal links== * White Ocean of Ice Antartica and climate change blog * published on April 10, 2019 PBS NewsHour Category:Climate change by continent Category:Climate of Antarctica Category:Effects of climate change ","title":"Climate change in Antarctica"},{"id":"46905636","text":"This is a list of Bosnian European Film Award winners and nominees.

It billed itself as \\"Radio Free St. Louis\\". The KDNA call letters are currently used by a different station, a Spanish language station at 91.9 in Yakima, Washington, and the 102.5 FM frequency in St. Louis is currently occupied by a station with the call letters KEZK-FM which broadcasts in the \\"Adult Contemporary Format\\". KDNA in St. Louis was founded by Jeremy Lansman and Lorenzo Milam.St. Louis Journalism Review, October 1997. Lansman was from the area, had attended Clayton High School (Clayton is a suburb of St. Louis), and had formally studied radio. Lansman met Milam in Seattle, Washington while the two were working at an alternative radio station there called KRAB. Milam provided the initial funding ($50,000) for KDNA, and, after competition for the frequency from the First Christian Fundamentalist Church, eventually the Federal Communications Commission granted Lansman and Milam a license. The radio station broadcast from 4285 Olive in Gaslight Square in the center of St. Louis, an area, according to Leonard Slatkin, where \\"the majority of nightlife used to be concentrated, but [by] the late ’60s had [been] reduced...to a set of run-down and decrepit buildings\\".Conducting Business: Unveiling the Mystery Behind the Maestro, Leonard Slatkin, Amadeus Press, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 2012, pp.90-91. Slatkin was Assistant Conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra at the time, and after an on-air interview at the station, he agreed to host his own weekly show called the Slatkin Project, which aired from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM Thursdays. Slatkin characterizes the station as having been \\"run by a group of slightly aging hippies, most of whom lived on the premises. Whoever got up first in the morning would turn on the transmitter. There was no NPR at the time and stations like these were usually referred to as alternative, or underground, radio with little or no format.\\" He goes on to write that, \\"KDNA was busted a couple of times for drugs and violating all sorts of building and FCC codes. But I loved every minute of my three years there.\\" (Lansman and two staff members were once charged with violating state drug laws, but Lansman maintained the drugs were planted and the charges were eventually dropped.) Among the many diverse shows that aired on KDNA was a ragtime piano program that began March 7, 1972 and continued for some time every Tuesday from 8:00 PM until 9:00 PM hosted by Trebor Tichenor, then pianist with the St. Louis Ragtimers who played regularly on the Showboat Goldenrod.Fat Chance, April 1972 After a pledge drive failed to yield enough money to allow the station to continue, Lansman and Milam sold the station to Cecil Heftel for $1.4 million in June 1973.

Frequent pauses in the bassoon's monologue and dry, harsh punctuation add to the effect of \\"recitativo\\", and the final and most vehement statement morphs over a protracted trill and flippant F major resolution into the second half of the movement, Allegro gioviale, which features syncopated rhythmsSeen and Heard International, Concert Review, Glyn Pursglove, December 2011. throughout. The orchestra plays a jazz-like chromatic theme and builds darkly towards the bassoon's entry, which in turn plays an acrobatic, ironically jocular theme, rejecting the first one heard in the orchestra. This manic and facetious character persists throughout the movement; the bassoon eventually reprising the expository theme before \\"breaking character\\" and distorting it greatly with jarring, angstful interjections (foreshadowing the next movement) and then performing a series of ascending scales, thematically inverting the descending string scales in the exposition, and runs up to a top F before the movement tumbles to a close. The Largo cantabile has been described as haunting, lyrical and colourfulArkivmusic.com, Fanfare Review, Ronald E. Grames with some fine contributions of the solo violin and the harp. The mood is humid, dejected, and desolate, with the bassoon's vocal top-octave lines creating a strained-voice effect of crying or wailing. The orchestra fades out, and the bassoon, alone, grimly proceeds into the last section. The Fugato, the final section, belies its relatively austere title and includes some enchanting\\" effects. The plaintive mood from the prior section of the movement focuses and becomes sinister, and a tenebrous interplay of soloist and orchestra ensues, taking on characteristics of a danse macabre. The fugato structure is exploited to create dialogue between the soloist and orchestra, especially between bassoon and solo violin; the sentiments of the solo line and orchestra are in much greater accord here than in the Allegro Gioviale. The movement gains speed and power towards the finale, but at the end moves forcefully and unexpectedly into D major, the bassoon howling a final high D at the close. Although a fairly short concerto, the Jolivet calls for masterful levels of technique and control, and great variety and depth of character. It is one of the most difficult concerti in the bassoon's repertoire, and has been called a \\"delight for virtuosos\\".. ==Movements== 1A. Recitativo 1B. Allegro gioviale 2A. Largo cantabile 2B.

(Source: Arabic Persian Research Institute, Tonk, Rajasthan) Hafiz Mehmood Shirani (1880 - 1946) was an Indian researcher and poet during the British eraZaman, Owahedur (2015). \\"Hafiz Mahmud Shirani's Contribution to Shahnameh Studies and Indo-Persian Literature\\" and father of famous Urdu poet Akhtar Sheerani. He started teaching Urdu at Islamia College, Lahore in 1921. In 1928 he moved to Oriental College, Lahore. He was a researcher and his popular theory was \\"Punjab Mein Urdu\\" which made him famous. Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani died in his native town of Tonk. == Life of Shirani == Hafiz Mohammad Mahmood Khan Shirani alias Mohammad Michael was born on October 5,1880, in Tonk of Rajasthan where his father, Mohammad Ismail Khan held some important poets. His ancestors belonged to the Afghan tribe named Shirani which had come to India with Mahmood Ghaznavi and stayed back in Tonk. In his child Sherani received religious education; later, he was sent to Jodhpur for learning English and subsequently admitted to Oriental College, Lahore from where obtained the Degree of Munshi Fazil. He developed a taste for poetry and wrote a few poems, including “Tipu Sultan”. Soon he realised that he had the instincts of researcher, linguist and archaeologist, and gave up writing poetry. After his entrance examination, Shirani was sent to London to study Law in 1904. But the death of his father in 1906 interrupted his education and he had to return home. Family feuds over property saddened him and he returned to England to complete his law studies. It is a difficult period for Shirani, but then something happened that changed the course of his life. He had picked up a book, apparently in a bad shape from an old bookshop. It was a rare book and Lusac and Company paid him a good amount for it. Later he collected two thousand rare volumes which he donated to the Library he had established for the London-based Pan Islamic Society of which he was an active member. Lusac & Company realised his worth and employed him as their collector of antiques. He edited Dr. Hyde’s The Rise and progress of Islam with a useful appendix and notes which was published by the Company. His interest in legal education gradually diminished and he started devoting more time to the study of scripts, research, ancient history and culture, etc. Shirani on his return to India had a stint at teaching as well and for sometime lectured at the Islamic College, Lahore. His research papers now appeared in the noted magazines Makhzan and Urdu. He wrote a number of Papers on daqiqi, Qabusnama and Firdausi’s Shahnama. His critical treatise on Maulana Shibli Naumani’s Shr-ul Ajam earned a name of researcher and critic of extraordinary calibre and erudition. From 1925 onwards, he published his articles in the oriental College magazine. His range of Interest covered both of Urdu and Persian languages and Literatures. At the request of Abdullah Yusufee, he wrote his reputed book Punjab mein Urdu which made him a linguist of no small achievement. The book was published in 1928 by the Anjuman-e-Urdu of Islamic College. In 1928 he became a Lecturer of Urdu Literature at Punjab University. This renowned critic and researcher of Persian and Urdu language & literature, died in Tonk on February 15, 1946. == Works of Shirani == *Books **Tanqid-e- Sherul Ajam **Firdausi par char Maqale **Rise and progress of Mohammedanism **Maqalat-e-Hafiz Mahmood Shirani **khaliqe Bari *Articles **Eusuf va Zulekha-e Firdausi **Firdausi ka mazhab **Hijv Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi **Farsi Shayeri aur unki qadamat irtebate Aruz **Mirza Ghalib ka kalam Urdu-Farsi **Mathnavi-e Arwatul Wasqi of Shahabi **Hindustan mai Mughlon se qabl farsi Adab **Khazain-ul Futuh az Amir Khosrau **Number of papers on Daqiqi and Qabusnama == Theory About Origin of Urdu == Hafiz Mehmood Shirani is credited with the theory that says Urdu was born in Punjab. He says since Mahmud of Ghazni had conquered Lahore and Muslims stayed there for some 200 years before invading Delhi, Urdu must have taken shape during that period and, in a way, the Punjabi language gave birth to Urdu. Some two centuries later, Mr Sherani says, Muslim conquerors brought this new language to Delhi with them. He also enlisted some similarities between Urdu and Punjabi. Shirani was in fact not the first to reach this conclusion and before him some renowned linguists and scholars such as Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, T. Graham Bailey and Mohiuddin Qadri Zor had expressed similar views, however Shirani was the first to try to thoroughly prove the theory. Sabzwari and Masud Husain Khan proved this theory was incorrect. Aside from historical aspects, they showed that in addition to similarities between the two languages, there were a large number of syntactical and morphological differences that proved that Urdu was not the daughter of Punjabi. == References External links== * Category:1880 births Category:Urdu poets Category:1946 deaths Category:Urdu writers from British India Category:20th-century Urdu writers Category:Literary critics of Urdu Category:Urdu essayists Category:Urdu scholars Category:Urdu letter writers Category:People from Tonk district Category:Urdu theologians Category:20th-century poets ","title":"Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani"},{"id":"46905978","text":"Gymnastics Society Sibiu (, ) was a German sport club based in Sibiu.

He was born in the village of Gokarna, now known as Gokarna Nawab Bari Complex, in Nasirnagar Upazila, Brahmanbaria District, which was earlier integrated into the greater Comilla District that was a part of Hill Tipperah.Princely States of India, before Partition His father was Syed Riazat Ullah, the editor of The Doorbeen, a Persian-language weekly journal. ==Education== Syed Shamsul Huda's primary education—in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Bengali, and the science of Islam—was completed at home under his father. He was then admitted to Hooghly High Madrasah at Calcutta to complete a traditional education. After that, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree from Presidency College in 1884, and a Bachelor of Law (BL) degree from Calcutta University in 1886. He received a Master of Arts (MA) degree, in Persian, privately from Presidency College in 1889. Huda was schooled in many fields of knowledge, and became one of the most eloquent, articulate, and educated Muslims of his generation. He had an important role as Muslim scholar, leader, and politician in British India at the beginning of the twentieth century. ==Career== Huda joined the Calcutta Madrasah in 1885 as a lecturer in Arabic and Persian. Two years later, he left the madrasah to practice law before the Calcutta High Court and gradually became involved in politics. The Indian National Congress was established in 1885 by Calcutta's Hindu leaders. This political body was proposed to symbolize all the people of India, together with Hindu and Muslim population. Prominent Indian Muslim leaders including Sir Syed Ahmad Khan CSI, Nawab Abdul Latif and Syed Ameer Ali, firstly gave their full support to this political body. But later on, the Hindu Congress leaders began practicing partition. Muslim leaders called Second Annual Meeting of the Calcutta Union about the political attitude and future plan of the Congress in 1895. Syed Shamsul Huda attended and addressed to stop the issue on the title of \\"Indian Politics and the Muhammadans\\" and in this way he became the top of the political dialogue. In his speech, he highlighted the political rule of the Indian Muslim and suggested ways they could make the Congress more united and effective political body. Huda's first role as a political leader was in opposing the budget for 1905, in which spending for colleges, hospitals, and other institutions was predominantly for those in districts near Calcutta. He proposed a policy of increased spending for such institutions for East Bengal as well, which was eventually established, and proved advantageous to the Muslims of Eastern Bengal, while being opposed by elite Hindus. As a man of education, political consciousness, and perception, Huda articulated the new situation. He wrote: He also mentioned on another occasion: Tagore Law Lecture -'The Principles of the Law of Crimes in British India' Huda was made a fellow of Calcutta University in 1902. He was invited to give the Tagore Law Lecture, which was published by Butterworth & Co,(India) Ltd, under the title The Principles of the Law of Crimes in British India.; He developed a theory of the basic law of offenses, following along the lines of the work of British jurists such as Jeremy Bentham, William Austin, and William Blackstone. He presided over the Provincial Muhammadan Educational Conference at Rajshahi in 1904. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of East Bengal and Assam in 1908. He was a President of the All India Muslim League in 1910. He became a member of the Imperial Legislative Council between 1911 and 1915, as a Leader for the Muslims of East Bengal. Thomas Gibson-Carmichael (seated) and (standing left to right) Huda, Frederick William Duke, and P C Lion Chitty Between 1912 and 1919, Huda was a member of the governor of Bengal's executive council.Elite Conflict in a Plural Society: Twentieth- century Bengal, J. H. Broomfield, University of California press, page 51; Who's who in India, Poona 1923; and Who's Who, 1923 (London, 1923). He was awarded the title of nawab in 1913. He was made KCIE in 1916. He was designated a judge on the Calcutta High Court in 1917, becoming the second Muslim from Bengal to occupy a seat, after Justice Syed Ameer Ali. Thomas Gibson-Carmichael stated: Huda became the first Indian Muslim president of the reformed legislative council of undivided Bengal in 1921. Surendranath Banerjee stated: ==Contributions to education== Huda was a patron of the Muslim students of Bengal during a difficult period. He created student accommodations by founding the Carmichael Hostel for rural university-going Muslim students in Calcutta. For the establishment of the Elliot Madrasah Hostel in 1898, he obtained two-thirds of the funds from the government, with the remainder, a sum of Rs. 5,400, being contributed by the Nawab Abdul Latif Memorial Committee. Huda created the post of \\"assistant director for Muslim education\\" for each division. He sanctioned the large sum of Rs. 900,000 from the Bengal government to purchase land to establish a government college for Muslims in Calcutta. Because of the First World War, the opening ceremony was postponed until 1926, when Abul Kasem Fazl-ul-Haq became education minister of the united province. In 1915, on his ancestral property, he founded Gokarna Syed Waliuallah High School, which was named after his same-aged uncle. It was the first government-aided school in Nasirnagar Upazila for Hindu and Muslim students. The University of Dhaka was established in 1921 by Lawrence Ronaldshay, the Governor of Bengal, who served as chancellor and who designated Huda as a life member of the university. On Huda's recommendation, Lord Ronaldshay appointed Sir A. F. Rahman as a provost. Huda financed the journals Sudhakar (1889), The Urdu Guide Press, and The Muhammadan Observer (1880).Indian Muslim and Partition of India, S.M. Akram, Atlantic Publishers and Distributors, pages 298–299. Religious constraints prevented women from gaining an education in Bengal. He supported and encouraged the Bengal Women's Education Project, founded by Begum Rokeya for women's education and development. ==Death== Huda lived at 211 Lawyer Circular Road, Calcutta. He died on 14 October 1922, at the age of 61, and was buried in Tiljola Municipal graveyard.

He played briefly with Richmond, in 1892 and 1893, but otherwise was with South Melbourne until their final VFA season in 1896. His sudden death during the 1897 VFL season was considered a severe loss to football. ==CareerVFA years=== Born in 1867, McKay played originally for the South Ballarat Football Club. He began at South Melbourne in 1886 and became a leading member of the team. Regarded as one of the best all-round players in the colony, McKay was a regular Victorian representative in intercolonial matches. A forward, he was the competition's leading goal-kicker in the 1888 VFA season, credited with either 49 or 50 goals depending on the source. South Melbourne were premiers that season, the first of three successive premierships McKay was part of. In 1892 he went over to Richmond, but returned to South Melbourne after two seasons. Dinny McKay preparing to kick In the 1896 VFA season he played in the premiership play-off against Collingwood, which is retrospectively treated as Victoria's first grand final. Collingwood won by one goal, and McKay with two goals was the game's only multiple goal-kicker. ===1897 VFL season=== The following year, South Melbourne were a foundation club in the inaugural VFL season. McKay has the distinction of kicking South Melbourne's first VFL goal, which came late in the second quarter of their opening round loss to Melbourne at Lake Oval, with a snap shot at goal that bounced through. In round seven, against Fitzroy, he kicked two goals in a game which finished in the VFL's first ever draw. His 14 goals in 1897 included three on both matches against Carlton, and were enough to be South Melbourne's leading goal-kicker. As South Melbourne failed the make the finals, McKay's season ended in round 14, a one-point win over Fitzroy at Lake Oval on 7 August, which was his 14th VFL appearance, having not missed a game all year. ==Death== On 17 August 1897, at the age of 29, McKay died at Melbourne Hospital, where he had gone with an internal complaint. He had suffered a burst appendix and died from peritonitis. His death was not, as was believed for many years, the result of an on-field injury. His funeral was one of the largest to have been held in the South Melbourne area, attended by representatives from all of the league, VFA and leading junior clubs. Nearly 150 vehicles were in the cortege and it was written that the funeral took close to 30 minutes to pass any given point. He had been married with two children, the eldest three and a half years old, the youngest 18 months. ==ReferencesCategory:1867 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Richmond Football Club (VFA) players Category:South Ballarat Football Club players Category:Deaths from peritonitis Category:1897 deaths Category:South Melbourne Football Club (VFA) players ","title":"Dinny McKay"},{"id":"46906209","text":"Richard Kennar (born 10 December 1994), also known by the nickname of \\"Richie\\", is a Samoan professional rugby league footballer who last played as a and er for the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL.

Three major expeditions were carried out in Qatar throughout the mid-20th century, with the first being launched by a Danish team who began work in the 1950s. This was followed by British and French expeditions in 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Approximately 200 archaeological sites were discovered during these expeditions, with the most extensive being the coastal areas of Al Da'asa, Ras Abrouq and Al Khor Island. Artifacts such as flint tools, Ubaid and Barbar pottery and encampments were found in situ. Apart from the discovery of ancient artifacts, many prehistoric rock art sites containing over 900 varieties of petroglyphs were uncovered during the 1950s and 1960s. Most carvings are cup and ring marks. These are accompanied by less numerous depictions of animals, boats and symbols. The Qatar National Museum was established in Doha in 1975. Qatar passed an antiquities law in 1980 to protect its archaeological sites. In the late 2000s, the Qatar Museums Authority began organizing joint archaeological projects with numerous European universities and institutions. ==Expeditions== Archaeological site of Ruwayda Along with Bahrain, Qatar was excavated 1878 by a British officer named Captain Edward Law Durand. It was the first archaeological research mission to take place in the country. Beginning in 1956, large-scale archaeological excavation programs were launched by the government in various parts of the country. That year, Geoffrey Bibby and Peter Glob embarked on an expedition in Qatar where they discovered two Paleolithic sites in Ras Uwainat Ali (about 10 km north of Dukhan).Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 33. In 1957, a Danish team organized a comprehensive survey on the peninsula which uncovered 11 sites, most of which were situated along the coast. They recovered flint from the newly discovered sites, in addition to collecting artifacts from the sites discovered a year prior by Bibby and Glob. The excavations continued in the proceeding years, resulting in the unearthing of additional Paleolithic sites and Neolithic occupational sites. In 1960, under the supervision of Holger Kapel and Hans Jørgen Madsen, the Danes excavated the most significant yet-discovered archaeological site in the peninsula, located approximately 5 km south of Dukhan. The site contained a large concentration of flint tools, which included arrowheads, knives and scrapers.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 34. The Danish expedition ended in 1964. A British team led by Beatrice De Cardi undertook expeditions from November 1973 to January 1974 to collect artifacts for the establishment of a national museum. Their most significant find was the site of Al Da'asa, which contained numerous Ubaid potsherds.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 36. The Mission Archéologique Français à Qatar, a French team led by Jacques Tixier, surveyed and excavated several sites in Qatar beginning in 1976. The French excavations ended by 1982. They published their findings in two volumes. The first volume was written by Jacques Tixier in 1980, with the other being published by Marie‐Louise Inizan in 1988. From 1988 to 1991, the Japanese Archaeological Mission to the Persian Gulf surveyed the area. The mission comprised Masatoshi A Konishi, Takeshi Gotoh and Yoshihiko Akashi. They made major contributions towards the study of the Umm Al Maa site. ===Recent cooperative projects=== UCL. A five-year collaboration between the University of Birmingham and the Qatar Museums Authority commenced in 2008. The project was named 'The Qatar National Historic Environment Record'. It researched and documented terrestrial and marine areas in Qatar. In 2009, the Qatar Museums Authority initiated the Qatar Islamic Archaeology and Heritage Project (QIAH) in tandem with the University of Copenhagen. The main focus of the project was the historic town of Al Zubarah and nearby settlements. Zubarah was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. The Wales Qatar Archaeological Project was launched in 2010 as a collaboration between the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, QIAH and the Qatar Museums Authority. The project's main focus was coastal sites in northern Qatar, including Ruwayda and Rubayqa. In 2010, the University College London opened a campus in Doha following an agreement with Qatar Foundation and Qatar Museums Authority. As part of the agreement, UCL will provide training for the Qatar Museums Authority and conduct joint excavations. UCL announced its 'Origins of Doha' project in 2012 which aims to investigate the archaeological record of Qatar's capital city. The German Archaeological Institute and Qatar Museums Authority reached an agreement in 2012. As part of the agreement, the German Archaeological Institute conducted surveys and excavations in the southern portion of Qatar. Joint training of Qatari and German archaeologists was also included in the agreement. ==National Museum== Plans for a national museum were drawn up in the 1970s. It was inaugurated in Doha in 1975, shortly after the excavations led by De Cardi. The antiquities department had an active role in surveys and excavations thereafter. They excavated the sites of Al Wusail and Zubarah.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 39. In 2005, the Qatar Museums Authority was established. ==Classification of archaeological periods== {  - + Archaeological periods (proposed by Muhammad Abdul Nayeem)Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 20. - !

Areas marked by large depressions or with substantial groundwater tend to yield the highest propensity of archaeological findings. In Qatar, the northern sector contains a higher-quality groundwater supply than does the south, thus, historically, more permanent settlements were founded in the north, particularly near the coast. Conversely, the south section is typified by temporary nomadic outposts which were most likely constructed during periods of favorable weather that would enable access to surface or groundwater. In some cases, areas with no potable water would still be regularly visited by nomadic herdsman as the water would be safe to drink for their camels. Southern archaeological sites such as Shagra and Asaila, which are also two of the oldest Neolithic sites in the peninsula, are exceptions to the poor water supply in this region as they are located next to depressions. ==Paleolithic findings== The Danish team uncovered a temporary encampment at Al Wusail in 1957. They posited it to be a late Paleolithic site used by hunters, as supported by the numerous flint tools found in situ. It was again excavated in 1989 and 1991 by a Qatari team.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 136. In 1961, the Danish archaeological team excavated approximately 30,000 stone implements from 122 paleolithic sites. Most of the sites were situated along the coastline. Macrolithic tools such as scrapers, arrowheads and hand axes dating to the Lower and Middle paleolithic periods were among the discoveries. Holger Kapel classified 68 Paleolithic sites into four cultural groups based on flint typology, designating letter terms to each group, in 1964.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 43. In 1967, he revised the nomenclature of the four groups. Group A was deemed to be the oldest culture, with Group C following behind, leaving Groups B and D as the most recent culture groups.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 44. Tools from Group A were found at elevations 250–300 feet above sea level, Group C tools were found at elevations 25–40 feet, and Group D tools occurred roughly a few feet above sea level. ===Taqan culture=== In 1964, the Danish group discovered a tool making site at Umm Taqa. Lead archaeologist Holger Kapel claimed that there was no site like it elsewhere in the peninsula.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 35. Archaeologist G.H. Smith, who partook in the later British expedition, suggested that Umm Taqa belonged to a distinct culture.De Cardi (1978), p. 36. A survey conducted in 2013–14 designates the tool making industry as the 'Taqan industry' and dates it to the Upper Paleolithic. Lithic assemblages at the site consisted 359 pieces. The most notable variance of the Taqan industry from the other groups classified by Kapel was the method used to prepare blade cores. ==Neolithic findingsPottery=== A protected archaeological site in Zekreet. Ubaid pottery originating from Mesopotamia was discovered in five primary sites in Qatar: Al Da'asa, Ras Abrouq (Bir Zekrit), Al Jubeigib and Al Khor Island.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 179. The two most extensive Ubaid sites in the peninsula are found in Al Da'asa and Ras Abrouq.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 182. Comparative analysis revealed that at least half of the excavated pottery originated from southern Mesopotamia, mainly from the sites of Eridu, Ur and Tell al-'Ubaid. The Ubaid period transpired from c. 6500 to 3800 BC. In Ras Abrouq, the pottery consists of fragments of rims of painted jars and bowls and is dated to the late fourth millennium.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 190. The majority of pottery recovered in Al Da'asa dates to the early Ubaid period.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 181De Cardi (1978), p. 44. ===Settlements=== One of the oldest yet-discovered settlements was found in 2009 on the northwest coast in Wadi Debayan. Carbon dating of organic remains divulged human habitation dating back to 7500 years in the past. It is thought to have been occupied over a stretch of 5000 years before being abandoned sometime in the Bronze Age. Remnants of marine life, plant material and structural components were among the artifacts found in situ. Fragments of pottery originating from the early Ubaid period were also recovered. Ras Abrouq, on the western shoreline, was found to contain a ring- like structure, hearths, Ubaid pottery, cairns, and stone tools. In addition, many fish bones and snail shells were recovered.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 118. G.H. Smith, an excavator of the site, suggested that it was a seasonal encampment and that its inhabitants had trade relations with nearby civilizations.De Cardi (1978), p. 80. ===The Dark Millennium=== Most of the fourth millennium BC and parts of the third millennium BC have been dubbed the 'Dark Millennium'. Coinciding with the decline of the Ubaid period cultures, this period is characterized by a dearth of archaeological remnants. Archaeologists have attributed this lapse to a lowering of lake levels and increasing desertification around this time, both of which impacted the peninsula's arability and discouraged sedentary lifestyles. ==Bronze Age findingsPottery=== Excavations in Ras Abrouq and Al Khor Island yielded Barbar ceramics originating from the Dilmun civilization dating to the third millennium BC.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 197 A 1977 expedition discovered non- Barbar pottery in Al Khor Island, also dating to the third millennium BC, with geometrical patterns similar to the pottery of the Umm an-Nar Culture in present-day United Arab Emirates.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 207. The ceramics documented in Al Khor Island consist of medium-sized jars and cooking pots. Three fragments of red pottery, thought to originate from the Arabian coast, were discovered in excavations conducted in Al Da'asa in 1973. ===Other objects=== Excavations of chambered cairns in Ras Abrouq revealed 108 beads made of stone and shell.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 211.De Cardi (1978), p. 121. A bead made of carnelian, which is foreign to Qatar, was found in a hearth in Al Da'asa.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 212. A plethora of jewelry made with beads dating to the mid-Bronze Age were uncovered by a French expedition in Al Khor in 1976. The beads were of different sizes and were made from materials such as obsidian, carnelian and bone. A single bronze arrowhead was found on the east coast of Qatar in Al Wusail.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 218. ===Settlements and industry=== Excavation of the Kassite dye site on Al Khor Island. A settlement in Al Wusail was carbon dated to 2000 BC by a Japanese team who carried out excavations in 1995. It is purported to be a fishing settlement due to the large number of fish bones and sea shells at the site.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 142. The Kassites operated a purple dye industry on Al Khor Island from c. 1400 to 1100 BC. Between 1980 and 1982, the French expedition found 3,000,000 crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds on the islands. ==Iron Age findings== A burial site containing 50 cairns, found in northwest Qatar in Umm Al Maa and Lisha, dates back to the Iron Age. It was first discovered and excavated by the Danish archaeological team in 1957. The Danes measured the cairns to be 10 m in diameter and roughly a meter in height. The Japanese Archaeological Mission later excavated the site from 1988 to 1991. In the later period of excavations, they discovered two burial complexes containing a chain of burial mounds.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 158. Two of the burial mounds contained skeletons with iron arrowheads and an iron sword by their side. Further discovered burial sites contained grave goods such as potsherds, jewelry, and metal fragments. Most of the burial sites were plundered by grave robbers. The site falls in a period between 300 BC and 300 AD. An excavation team in 2008–09 noted that the mounds may have been built by local nomads. To date, no archaeological evidence of Iron Age settlements have been discovered in the peninsula.Casey, Vine (1991), p. 16. This is likely due to adverse climatic changes rendering Qatar less inhabitable during this period. ==Nestorian sitesQasr Al Malehat=== A site on the south-east coast of Qatar, near Al Wakrah, revealed the remnants of a structure purported to be a church. It was built directly on limestone bedrock and a hearth was found inside the ruins. Radiocarbon dating indicates the site was occupied in the early 7th century AD, and potsherds recovered from the surrounding area evidences continued occupation until the mid to late 8th century. The ceramics are consistent with those found in other Nestorian sites in the Eastern Arabia and the structure bears resemblance to the excavated church in Jubail. ===Umm Al Maradim=== An excavation carried out in 2013 uncovered a Nestorian cross in Umm Al Maradim, a site in central Qatar. The cross is made of hard stone and measures between 3 and 4 cm. A number of hearths and potsherds were found at the site, though no structures were discovered.Kozah, Abu-Husayn, Abdulrahim, Al-Thani. pp. 29–30. ==Abbasid sites== Settlements dating to the Abbasid- period (750–1253) were mostly intended to be permanent sites of occupation. A cluster of Abbasid archaeological sites are found near the north-west coast and include Ar Rakiyat, Umm Al Kilab, Ghaf Makin, Mussaykah, Murwab, and Al- Haddiyah. Structures that were excavated at these sites were roughly aligned with Mecca. All of the sites are situated next to rawdas (depressions), ensuring a reliable water supply. ==Rock art== Dot carvings at Jebel Jassassiyeh. Rock carvings in Jebel Jassassiyeh depicting an object. Ancient rock carvings have been discovered in eight separate locations: Jebel Jassassiyeh, Jebel Fuwayrit, Freiha, Al Ghariyah, Al Jumail, Simaisma, Al Wakrah and Al Qassar. Most of these sites were discovered by Danish archaeological teams in the 1950s and 1960s.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 220. The rock carvings are classified in a number of categories, including human and animal representation, boat representation, cup-marks, large cavities, geometric designs, tribal marks, and hand and footprints. ===Jebel Jassassiyeh=== A large number of rock carvings were discovered by the Danish team in Jebel Jassassiyeh, in northeast Qatar, in 1961. Variations in motifs and technique indicates that the carvings were made through various historical periods.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 221. Cup-marks are the most common forms of art among the nearly 900 carvings. Other carvings include ships, animals, foot-prints and tribal marks (known as wasum). Different animals are depicted, such as ostriches, turtles and fish. A large number carvings illustrate boats. The boats are of different sizes and types, and some contain oars while others do not.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 233. Jebel Jassassiyeh is the only rock art site in Qatar where boat depictions have been recorded.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 234. The dating of the boat carvings is inconclusive,Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 243. though archaeologist Muhammad Abdul Nayeem tentatively dated them to the third century BC.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 244. However, a study conducted in 2012 which tested nine samples of carvings, including boat carvings, concluded that the oldest of the samples had a minimum age of less than 300 years. The study found no evidence to support the view of the carvings dating back millenniums. In later carvings, the boats appeared with sails. In some of the rock carvings, sails appear without boats. Some of the ancient carvings were modified at later periods, with devices such as ropes and anchors being added.De Cardi (1978), p. 190. ===Freiha=== In 1956, Geoffrey Bibby and Peter Glob discovered several hundred cup-marks carved in rock in Freiha. Their sizes range from 5 to 23 cm and have depths of 1 to 10 cm, with most being 5 cm in diameter and having a depth of 1 to 3 cm. Bibby and Glob noted that the cup-marks are similar to those found in Bahrain dating to the Dilmun period. Several hand and footprints were also documented in Freiha.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 258. Geometrical designs were recorded at Freiha in four places. They measure 11 to 15 cm in width and 11 to 12 cm in height. Peter Glob believed that they were carved by an ancient fertility cult.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 256. This theory was disputed by Muhammad Abdul Nayeem, who believes that they are simply abstract symbols or tribal marks. ===Al Qassar=== Al Qassar, a site 5 km northeast of Doha, was found to have rock carvings of human and animals by an excavation team in 1979. Most of them have been eroded beyond recognition. Stone blocks containing still-recognizable carvings were cut off and transported to the Qatar National Museum for preservation.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 222. One petroglyph, which contains two different panels carved by more than one individual, depicts two horse riders and a camel. The riders, one behind the other, are holding lances in their upraised hands. The second rider appears to be chasing the first, as his lance is pointed towards the other rider's back.Abdul Nayeem, p. 231. The figure of the second rider is leaning in a forward position, with the lance projecting from his upper body. In front of the riders is a camel with incomplete body features. Muhammad Abdul Nayeem dates the carving to the second millennium BC.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 232. ==ReferencesSources== * * ","title":"Archaeology of Qatar"},{"id":"46906481","text":"Dermata Cluj was a football club from Cluj-Napoca, Cluj County, dissolved in 1967. ==History== The shoes factory from Cluj-Napoca called Echo Cluj created the team and was the main sponsor of the team until 1948.

He spent his childhood at Caddebostan neighborhood of Kadıköy, Istanbul, on the coast of Sea of Marmara. He changed his rowing boat with a sailboat as soon as he became a high school student. He finished Galatasaray High School in 1948, and went to the United Kingdom to study textile engineering at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. In 1952, Boro made his first ocean voyage from British Islands to the Caribbean Islands on the -long sailboat Ling together with an Englishman. The story of his travel that lasted six months was published in serial format in the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet, and was compiled in his book titled Bir Hayalin Peşinde (literally: In Pursuit of a Dream) later in 2004. ==Circumnavigation the globe== Route of Sadun Boro's global circumnavigation between 1965–68. Global Circumnavigation of Sadun Boro and his wife Oda in front of the Kalamış Marina's main entrance at Kadıköy, Istanbul, Turkey. His -long sloop was laid down at the workshop of Athar Beşpınar in Salacak neighborhood of Üsküdar, Istanbul in 1963, and named Kısmet (Turkish for \\"Fortune\\"). The sail, he manufactured in the textile plant, he was working at Çukurova, southern Turkey. Boro began his westabout (east to west) voyage to circumnavigate the globe on 22 August 1965, accompanied by his German-born wife Oda Boro. He set sail from Istanbul, passed Strait of Gibraltar crossing Mediterranean Sea and reached Canary Islands, where they took a housecat aboard and named it \\"Miço\\" (Turkish for \\"shipmate\\"). Crossing the Atlantic Ocean, he arrived in Barbados and Caribbean Islands. Passing through the Panama Canal, he sailed crossing Pacific Ocean to Galápagos Islands, Marquesas Islands, Tuamotu Archipelago, Tahiti, Society Islands, Tonga Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides and New Guinea. His route went then through Torres Strait to Timor, Indonesia and Singapore. Crossing the Bay of Bengal, he was in Ceylon (today: Sri Lanka). He sailed then on Arabian Sea and Red Sea and then was carried by a truck from Eilat to Haifa. In Mediterranean Sea again, his last stop before completing his globe circumnavigation was Israel. On 15 June 1968, after 1,028 days of an ocean voyage, he arrived in Istanbul, where he was welcomed by his mother, and cheered as a national hero. Becoming the first ever Turkish global circumnavigator, he paved the way for global circumnavigation of Turkish sailors. The memories about his voyage around the world were published as newspaper serialization in the daily Hürriyet at that time, and were written down later in his popular book Pupa Yelken (Turkish for \\"Full Sail\\"). Erected in front of the Kalamış Marina's main entrance in Kadıköy, Istanbul, a monument featuring Sadun Boro at boat's wheel of his sloop and his wife Oda standing next, both sailing on the globe commemorates his achievement. ==Later years== Between 1977–79, Sadun Boro sailed with his wife and then-eight-year-old daughter Deniz to the Caribbean and the East Coast of the United States. After 1980, he settled down in Bodrum and Gökova, known for its idyllic coasts full of forests and turquoise sea. He devoted himself to the protection of nature at the Turkish Riviera, in particular in Gökova, Göcek and Fethiye. Boro aimed to instil love for nature and sea to young people with his articles published in newspapers and journals. As a lover of Gökova, he had a mermaid statue erected with an inscription atop a rock in the middle of Okluk Bay. The inscription reads Boro's words as \\"This mermaid has traveled many seas and horizons to find the heaven that she dreamed of. She traveled continents, islands and bays, until she reached Gökova.\\" His latest book, titled Vira Demir (Turkish for \\"Haul Up the Anchor\\"), is a guide for sailors. Boro donated his sloop Kısmet, he sailed 46-year long about with, to the Rahmi M. Koç Museum, a museum in Istanbul dedicated to the history of transport, industry and communications, which was founded by the wealthy businessman Rahmi Koç, who also circumnavigated the globe between 2004–06. Sadun Boro lived in Okluk Bay, Gökova on board his catamaran named Son Bahar (Turkish for \\"Autumn\\" or \\"Last Spring\\"). ==Illness and death== Sadun Boro was diagnosed with bladder cancer a couple of years ago. He was first treated in Marmaris, where he lived, and then transferred to the American Hospital in Istanbul. However, he was airlifted by helicopter back to Muğla on 14 May 2015 as he wished to spend his rest of life on board of his sailboat. At 9:15 hours local time on 5 June 2015, he died at age 87 in the intensive care unit of a hospital at Marmaris, where he was taken into three days before. His last will was to be buried under the pine, to which his sailboat is secured mooring at İngilizlimanı (literally: English Harbor) in Gökova. For its realization, a cabinet decision is necessary. He was interred in Karacasöğüt Cemetery in Marmaris following a memorial tour in the bays of the Turkish Riviera he admired on board of his catamaran Son Bahar accompanied by many boats and vessels of the Turkish Coast Guard and a frigate of the Turkish Navy. He was survived by his wife Oda and his daughter Deniz (Turkish for \\"Sea\\"). ==Works== * * * ==Other Turkish circumnavigators of the globe== Turkish sailors circumnavigated the globe following Sadun Boro, listed chronologically: {class= !Sailor !!

His football career started at Oxford United where he made seven substitute appearances in two seasons. In 2008, he had a loan spell at Southern League Division One South & West club Abingdon United. In June 2009, he signed for newly promoted Southern League Premier Division club Didcot Town on a free transfer, following his release from Oxford days after helping the team lift the Oxfordshire Senior Cup. In 2009, he moved on to Southern League South & West Division club North Leigh. In two seasons at Eynsham Park, he scored 80 goals. In September 2011 he had a trial with Cheltenham Town but went on to sign for Forest Green Rovers, having rejected a move to Newport County. ===Forest Green Rovers=== His first goals for the Nailsworth club came in a 4–1 win over Alfreton Town as Taylor netted a hat-trick. He went on to score a further seven goals as Forest Green finished 10th in the Conference Premier. In his second season at the club he scored 11 times in league and cup competitions, earning himself a contract extension to summer 2014. He struggled for form in his third season and was loaned out to fellow Conference Premier club Chester in January 2014 until the end of the season. Having scored six times in seven matches, he was recalled by his parent club, but failed to score again in his remaining 12 appearances. ===Bristol Rovers=== In June 2014, Taylor signed for recently relegated Conference Premier club Bristol Rovers, reportedly rejecting offers from former club Oxford United and Chester as well as Mansfield Town and Kidderminster Harriers. His Bristol Rovers career got off to a difficult start as he scored just three times in his first 18 matches. He finished the season with 20 goals, including one in each of the play-off semi-final matches against Forest Green Rovers. He played the full 120 minutes of the play-off Final and scored Rovers' second penalty of the shoot-out as Rovers secured an immediate return to the Football League. Taylor scored his first Football League goal in a 3–1 win against Barnet. A successful start to his season resulted in Taylor scoring eight goals in all competitions before mid November, including two goals against Carlisle United. Taylor reached 14 goals in all competitions before Christmas, including hat-tricks in a 3–0 victory against Wycombe Wanderers and a 4–1 win against Hartlepool United. On the final day of the season, Bristol Rovers achieved promotion to League One by scoring a dramatic winner in the 92nd minute. Lee Brown scored the decisive goal after Taylor himself hit the post. Taylor finished the season with 27 goals and five assists, outscoring every player in the Football League. Taylor proceeded to score on his League One debut against Scunthorpe United in a 3–1 loss. On 18 October 2016, Taylor scored a second-half hat-trick to earn a point for the Rovers against Milton Keynes Dons in a 3–3 draw. ===Bristol City=== On 31 January 2017, Taylor left Bristol Rovers to join rivals Bristol City, activating the release clause reported to be £300,000. Taylor became the first player to move directly from Bristol Rovers to Bristol City since Trevor Morgan in 1987. In October 2017, as part of an interview for the BBC Points West programme, Bristol City manager Lee Johnson described how he received a death threat during the 2016–17 season after signing Taylor. During this episode Johnson moved house after his family's home address was put online. On 11 February 2017, Taylor made his first start for Bristol City, in a league match away to Derby County. He scored his first goal for the club in the 14th minute, firing home from close range after teammate Aden Flint saw his header cleared off the line. Taylor would go on to play a key role in City's next two goals, the match eventually ending 3–3. During the 2017–18 season Bristol City reached the semi finals of the EFL Cup and Taylor scored in the victories against Premier League opponents Stoke City and Crystal Palace, as well as setting up the 93rd-minute winner in the quarter-final victory over cup holders Manchester United. Oxford United (loan) On 19 August 2019, Taylor joined Oxford United on loan till the end of the season. He made his debut in a 4–2 League One defeat to Burton Albion on 20 August 2019, and scored his first goal in a 6–0 away victory over Lincoln City on 21 September.

It is notable for its football team which played one season in the Divizia A, the highest Romanian league at that time. ==History== CSM Suceava was founded on 19 July 1972, incorporating the sections of football, track and field, rugby and volleyball. During the years, more sections were added and offered to its members, among them archery, baseball, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, handball, ice hockey, rowing, speed skating and swimming. The current setup includes archery, boxing, ice hockey, rugby, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. ===Football=== Being one of the founding sections, the football team rose through the ranks of the Romanian league system before eventually gaining promotion to the Divizia A at the end of the 1986–87 season. However, competition there proved to be too strong and relegation back to Divizia B was the logical consequence, a league in which the team played for the rest of its existence. Before the 1993–94 season, the name was changed to Bucovina Suceava, after the name of the region Bukovina. Bucovina at the end of the 1996–97 season, merged with Foresta Fălticeni, creating the most successful team in the history of Suceava County, the new team being called Foresta Suceava, with the home ground in Suceava, on Stadionul Areni. Bucovina became the second team of Foresta Fălticeni, being called Foresta II Fălticeni, playing his matches on Nada Florilor, Fălticeni. ==Chronology of names== In 1957, Flamura Roşie Burdujeni moved to Suceava, becoming Progresul Suceava. {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text- align: left;\\" - !

On the way to Newcastle approximately from the coast of Queensland in the Coral Sea when the chief cook, Cesar Llanto, was reported missing. Australian authorities were notified, and the ship turned around, and a 36-hour search commenced. A company official, Kosaku Monji, was dispatched to investigate and landed in Brisbane and helicoptered to the vessel along with two security officers. The ship was diverted to Port Kembla and was met by a large number of Australian Federal Police officers who searched the ship and collected evidence. Although all of the crew had not been interviewed, the ship proceeded to Newcastle, where the body of the chief engineer, Hector Collado, was found with multiple injuries after having toppled over the edge of a railing and fallen as the ship berthed. New South Wales Police officers investigated, with many of the seamen being taken from the vessel to be interviewed. Nearly all the crew and the captain of the vessel were flown out of the country two days later. Four days after the second death, the vessel steamed out of Newcastle and back to Japan, where it berthed at Kudamatsu Port two weeks later. The ship was unloaded for three days when the body of Kosaku Monji was found crushed in a conveyor belt. ==References== Category:Bulk carriers Category:Maritime incidents in 2012 ","title":"MV Sage Sagittarius"},{"id":"46907118","text":"Notable Slovak football transfers in the summer transfer window 2015 by club.

Usually an antihero, he is similar to the Byronic hero. The man alone tends to epitomise existentialism, and, in the words of the academic E. H. McCormick is \\"the solitary, rootless nonconformist, who in a variety of forms crops up persistently in New Zealand writing\\". Men alone figure frequently in the literature of newly settled or recently colonised countries such as Australia and especially New Zealand, and the term is likely to have found popularity with the publication of the \\"Great Kiwi Novel\\", Man Alone by John Mulgan in 1939 (this novel's title itself originated in a quotation from Ernest Hemingway's To Have and Have Not). The man alone is, by nature, a loner, either by choice or as a result of circumstances beyond his control. This state of separation from society is often literal, in that the man alone will often live physically separate from society as a hermit or working in the wilds of the country. At other times, the state is psychological only; the man alone may live within the presence of others but be emotionally separate or aloof from them. The sense of physical or psychological separation between the man alone and society often results in the man alone facing interactions with authority which become kafkaesque through mutual misunderstanding. ==Examples of the man alone in literature and film== *Johnson, in Man Alone, by John Mulgan *John Hobson, in The Quiet Earth, by Craig Harrison *Smith in Sleeping Dogs, based on Smith's Dream by C.

Stein, who had been the Green Party's presidential nominee in 2012 (receiving 469,627 votes) would once again secure the Green Party nomination and lose in the general election, this time receiving 1.07% of the popular vote and no electoral college delegates. She formally announced her second presidential bid during an appearance on Democracy Now! on June 22, 2015. On June 15, 2016, she reached the necessary number of delegates for the presumptive Green nomination. On August 1, 2016, Stein announced that she had selected international human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate. Stein officially received the Green Party presidential nomination on August 6, 2016, at the party's nominating convention in Houston, Texas. ==Background== Stein speaking at a campaign event in Mesa, Arizona On February 6, 2015, Stein announced the formation of an exploratory committee for a campaign for the Green Party's presidential nomination in 2016.Pindell, James (February 6, 2015) \\"Jill Stein, Green Party candidate, considers a second run for president\\", The Boston Globe. Retrieved June 6, 2015 In a June 2015 interview on The Alan Colmes Show, Stein said that she would announce her intention to run for President \\"certainly before the summer is up, probably a lot sooner than that\\". In December 2015, Stein took part in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris, speaking at several forums. That same month, Stein took part in RT's tenth anniversary celebration conference in Moscow, speaking alongside international leaders. On February 24, Stein was invited to speak at the Oxford Union at the University of Oxford in England. In March 2016, Stein was one of only two presidential candidates to receive an A rating for their health plan from Physicians for a National Health Program, an advocacy group for single-payer health care, out of an analysis of the health plans of six presidential candidates, including the top two Democratic candidates and the top three Republican candidates. In May 2016, the Marijuana Policy Project released a voter guide of the candidates of the four largest political parties (Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Green) in the 2016 election. Stein received an A+, tying her with Gary Johnson and placing her above the Democratic and Republican candidates. ==History== Stein began taking part in the 2016 Green Party presidential primaries in February 2016. Stein was immediately the front-runner and was described as \\"steamrolling to victory.\\" On June 15, 2016, the Stein campaign announced that it had received 203 delegates, enough to win the nomination on the first ballot at the 2016 Green National Convention. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention the Green Party encouraged Bernie Sanders supporters to switch support. Stein officially won the Green Party nomination on August 6, 2016. ==Fundraising== In an e-mail to supporters on June 10, 2015, Stein wrote \\"I'm preparing to make a big announcement next week.\\" She also challenged her supporters to raise $10,000 in that time period. Two days later on June 12, Stein's campaign sent another e-mail indicating that she had surpassed that goal and raised her fundraising goal to $30,000. Stein noted that she would seek to qualify for matching funds from the federal government by raising at least $5,000 from residents of 20 states before receiving the nomination in 2016. The e-mail indicated that she had already raised more than the requisite amount from residents of California and that Washington State, New York, and others were very close behind. In September, Stein's campaign said they had met the $5,000 mark in five states (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington) and had received at least half of that amount in eight others. As of November 22, 2015, Stein's campaign had surpassed the requisite fundraising totals in at least 9 states. On November 28, Richard Winger of Ballot Access News reported that Stein would likely qualify for the initial public funding before January 1, 2016. However, on January 3, Ballot Access News reported that Stein's campaign had only qualified in 13 states. It said that the campaign was trying to qualify in 8 others. On January 8, Stein's campaign announced it had enough contributions to qualify for FEC funds. Nevertheless, the campaign did not submit its request for matching funds and accompanying documentation until March 28, after which the FEC declared Stein eligible for matching funds on April 14, 2016. In January 2017, Stein and her campaign received the final amount of matching funds from the FEC. The final check equaled $134,900. Overall, the campaign received $590,935.39 in matching funds. ==Platform and issues== Stein with supporters at a rally in Boston, Massachusetts The Stein platform is labeled a 'power to the people plan.'

Based on 2004 - 2008 electoral college apportionment. :B. Based on 1992 - 2000 electoral college apportionment. ==Results== This map shows the percentage of the popular vote Jill Stein earned in each county. On Election Day, Stein finished in 4th with over 1,457,216 votes (more than the previous three Green tickets combined) and 1.07% of the popular vote. However, she finished three million votes under Gary Johnson as the Greens once again finished behind the Libertarian Party, though they did gain more votes than Independent candidate Evan McMullin and Constitution Party candidate Darrell Castle.http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/2016presgeresults.pdf At the state level, Stein exceeded 2% vote share in Hawaii (12,737, or 2.97%), Oregon (50,002, or 2.50%) and Vermont (6,758, or 2.14%), while winning her most votes in California (278,657, or 1.96%). In 22 other states, she crossed 1% of the vote. At the county level, Stein won her highest percentage of the vote of any county in the United States in Humboldt County, California (4.36%), and she achieved the third-place finish in Humboldt and Mendocino, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Alameda counties in California, Multnomah County, Oregon (3.25%), San Juan County, Washington (4.33%), most counties in Hawaii (Kalawao, Maui, Hawaii and Kauai), and four out of all five boroughs of New York City (Kings, Queens, Bronx and New York counties), in addition to Prince George's County, Maryland and Menominee County, Wisconsin. In Kalawao County, Hawaii, Stein received 25% of the vote and came in 2nd place after Hillary Clinton, although only 20 total votes were cast in the county. === Recount petitions === On November 23, Stein launched a public fundraiser to pay for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, asserting that the election's outcome had been affected by hacking in those states. Changing the outcome of these three states would make Clinton the winner, and this would require showing that less than 60,000 votes had been counted for Trump which should have been counted for Clinton. Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on November 25. Stein subsequently filed for a recount in Pennsylvania on November 28, and in Michigan on November 30. After unfavorable rulings by the courts, Stein abandoned her recount bid in December 2016. On December 18, 2017, the Washington Post reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee is looking at the presidential campaign of Green Party's Jill Stein for potential \\"collusion with the Russians.\\" ==See also== *Green Party presidential primaries, 2016 *Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016 ==ReferencesExternal links== Stein, Jill Stein, Jill Stein, Jill ","title":"Jill Stein 2016 presidential campaign"},{"id":"46907246","text":"Mischievous Susana (Spanish:La pícara Susana) is a 1945 Mexican musical comedy film directed by Fernando Cortés and Zacarías Gómez Urquiza and starring Mapy Cortés, Luis Aldás and Fernando Cortés.Rivera p.43 ==Cast== * Mapy Cortés as Susana Martínez * Luis Aldás as Miguel Ángel Pérez * Fernando Cortés as Don Andrés Martínez Rico * Alfredo Varela as Señor Badu * Luis G.
