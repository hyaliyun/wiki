Note the poor contrast in the overexposed part of the sky not covered by the filter. The same image with washed-out (white) pixels colored red. Note that clouds that are washed out without the GND filter show detail behind the filter. A graduated neutral-density filter, also known as a graduated ND filter, split neutral-density filter, or just a graduated filter, is an optical filter that has a variable light transmission. Typically half of the filter is of neutral density which transitions, either abruptly or gradually, into the other half which is clear. It is used to bring an overly-bright part of a scene into the dynamic range of film or sensor. For example, it can be used to darken a bright sky so that both the sky and subject can be properly exposed. ND filters can come in a variety of shapes and sizes and densities and can be used in all types of photographic applications from still photography, motion photography and scientific applications. Center-spot filters are ND graduated filters that are slightly opaque in the center and are clear at edges. These are used for special effects or to compensate for light falloff that is natural with large optics. ==History== The same image with a GND-like effect applied to the right side of the image using a computer. While the overall effect is similar, regions of the image that were washed out are not recovered. Graduated filters were used in the early twentieth century, for example for darkening skies in landscape photos. One advertised brand was called the \\"Lifa graduated filters for sky, cloud, and landscape photography. These \\"sky filters\\" were not necessarily neutral, since they were used for black-and-white photography, and sometimes used a yellow top half to darken blue skies more. In a discussion at the Royal Photographic Society in 1910, some \\"debatants\\" held the use of such \\"graduated color screens\\" to be quite limited. In more modern times, the use of graduated ND filters was popularized by Galen Rowell. Singh-Ray sold them as \\"The Singh- Ray set of 4 Galen Rowell Graduated Neutral-Density Filters.\\" Although its importance may have lessened with the advent of the modern digital darkroom, graduated ND filters are still an important tool for professionals because a digital sensor that is clipping (\\"blown out\\" or \\"washed out\\") captures no usable data in the clipped area, an effect which cannot be corrected with later processing because data has been lost. ==Types== A Cokin 3-stop (ND8) graduated ND filter. Stacked cases of Cokin filters. The filter comes in many types but can be separated into two basic categories: *Hard edge *Soft edge A hard edge is used when there is an abrupt change in brightness, such as a field with a horizon to a bright sky. A soft edge is a wider, smoother change from light to dark. This is used when the light and dark portions are not distinctly separated, such as a mountain and sky. A soft edge filter is less noticeable than a hard edge. It also has the benefit of making the sky more intense, darkening the sky the closer on the top. Below is a picture of what a hard edge and soft edge filter would look like. Image:Grad-nd-soft-edge.svgSoft-edge GND filter Image:Grad-nd-hard- edge.svgHard-edge GND filter ==Multi-shoots high dynamic range== As an alternative to split graduated neutral density filters, some digital cameras offer built-in high-dynamic- range imaging (HDR) which allow the camera to capture and then combine different exposures of the same subject matter when shooting in RAW image format. However, as long as a sufficiently short exposure time is available, it is possible to exactly mimic the effect of a graduated neutral density filter by using two exposures of the same scene one or several stops apart and blending them with a graduated mask in an image editor. This method has the advantage that the shape of the mask can be freely defined in editing. The disadvantage is that it only works with static subjects using a tripod. ==References== ==External links== * An effective demonstration picture Category:Optical filters ","title":"Graduated neutral-density filter"},{"id":"2567335","text":"Khizar Humayun Ansari is a British academic who was awarded an OBE in 2002 for his work in the field of race and ethnic relations.

Queen Elizabeth I was his godmother, and two of her favourite earls, whose Christian name he bore, were his godfathers. He had been in her Essex's expedition to Cambridge, and had afterwards served in the Netherlands, under Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange. He was even given temporary command of English forces during the Siege of Rheinberg in the summer of 1601. The long Continental wars throughout the peaceful reign of King James I had been treated by the English nobility as schools of arms, as a few campaigns were considered a graceful finish to a gentleman's education. He was created Earl of Lindsey on 22 November 1626 and took his title from the northern of the three parts of Lincolnshire, the old Kingdom of Lindsey. ==The entrepreneur== The Lindsey Level in The Fens, between the River Glen and The Haven, at Boston, Lincolnshire was named after the first Earl Lindsey as he was the principal adventurer in its drainage. The drainage work was declared complete in 1638 but the project was neglected with the onset of the Civil War so that the land fell back into its old state. When it was drained again, more than a hundred years later, it was called the Black Sluice Level. There is more information under the article Twenty, Lincolnshire. ==The English Civil War== As soon as Lord Lindsey had begun to fear that the disputes between the King and Parliament must end in war, he had begun to exercise and train his tenantry in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, of whom he had formed a regiment of infantry. With him was his son Montagu Bertie, Lord Willoughby who had seen some service against the Spaniards in the Netherlands, and after his return had been made a captain in the Lifeguards, and a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. Anthony van Dyck has left portraits of the father and the son; the one a bald-headed, alert, precise-looking old warrior, with the cuirass and gauntlets of earlier warfare; the other, the very model of a cavalier, tall, easy, and graceful, with a gentle reflective face, and wearing the long lovelocks and deep-point lace collar and cuffs characteristic of Queen Henrietta's Court. As Lord Lindsey was a most experienced soldier of 59 years of age at the start of the English Civil War, King Charles I had appointed him General-in-chief of the Royalists for the Battle of Edgehill. However, the King had imprudently exempted the cavalry from Lindsey's command, its general, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, taking orders only from the King. Rupert was only 22 years old, and although an experienced soldier who had fought in the Thirty Years' War, he had not yet learnt that cavalry should also be used in support of infantry and not just against the enemy's cavalry. ===Battle of Edgehill=== At eight o'clock, on the morning of 23 October 1642 King Charles was riding along the ridge of Edge Hill, and looking down into the Vale of the Red Horse, a fair meadow land, here and there broken by hedges and copses. His troops were mustering around him, and in the valley he could see with his telescope the various Parliamentary regiments, as they poured out of the town of Kineton, and took up their positions in three lines. \\"I never saw the rebels in a body before,\\" he said, as he gazed sadly at the subjects arrayed against him. \\"I shall give them battle. God, and the prayers of good men to Him, assist the justice of my cause.\\" The whole of his forces, about 11,000 in number, were not assembled till two o'clock in the afternoon, for the gentlemen who had become officers found it no easy matter to call their farmers and retainers together, and marshal them into any sort of order. Lord Lindsey, who was an old comrade of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, the commander of the Parliamentarian forces, knew that he would follow the tactics they had both together studied in Holland, little thinking that one day they should be arrayed one against the other in their own native England. He had a high opinion of Essex's generalship, and insisted that the situation of the Royal army required the utmost caution. Rupert, on the other hand, had seen the swift fiery charges of the fierce troopers of the Thirty Years' war, and was backed up by Patrick Ruthven, Lord Ruthven, one of the many Scots who had won honour under King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. A sudden charge of the Royal horse would, Rupert argued, sweep the Roundheads from the field, and the foot would have nothing to do but to follow up the victory. The King, sad enough at having to fight at all with his subjects, and never having seen a battle, seemed entirely bewildered between the ardent words of his spirited nephew and the grave replies of the well-seasoned old Earl. Eventually the King, willing at least not to irritate Rupert, desired that Ruthven should array the troops in the Swedish fashion. It was a greater affront to the General-in-chief than the king was likely to understand, but it could not shake the old soldier's loyalty. He gravely resigned the empty title of General, which only made confusion worse confounded, and rode away to act as colonel of his own Lincolnshire regiment, pitying his master's perplexity, and resolved that no private pique should hinder him from doing his duty. His regiment was of foot soldiers, and was just opposite to the standard of the Earl of Essex. In the afternoon the Royal forces marched down the hill. It was at this time that Sir Jacob Astley prayed \\"O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day; if I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me;\\" then, rising, he said, \\"March on, boys.\\" Amid prayer and exhortation, the other side awaited the shock, as men whom a strong and deeply embittered sense of wrong had roused to take up arms. Prince Rupert's charge was fully successful. No one even waited to cross swords with his troopers, but all the Roundhead horse galloped headlong off the field, hotly pursued by the Royalists. But the main body of the army stood firm, and for some time the battle was nearly equal, until a large troop of the enemy's cavalry who had been kept in reserve, wheeled round and fell upon the Royal forces just when their scanty supply of ammunition was exhausted. Step by step, however, they retreated bravely, and Rupert, who had returned from his charge, sought in vain to collect his scattered troopers, so as to fall again on the rebels. Some were plundering, some chasing the enemy, and none could be got together. Memorial to Lord Lindsey and his son Montague in the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Edenham, Lincolnshire ===Death=== Lord Lindsey was shot through the thigh bone, and fell. He was instantly surrounded by the rebels on horseback; but his son, Lord Willoughby, seeing his danger, flung himself alone among the enemy, and forcing his way forward, raised his father in his arms thinking of nothing else, and unheeding his own peril. The throng of enemy around called to him to surrender, and, hastily giving up his sword, he carried the Earl into the nearest shed, and laid him on a heap of straw, vainly striving to staunch the blood. It was a bitterly cold night, and the frosty wind came howling through the darkness. Whether the battle were won or lost, the father and son knew not, and the guard who watched them knew as little. Lord Lindsey himself murmured, \\"If it please God I should survive, I never will fight in the same field with boys again!\\"–no doubt deeming that young Rupert had wrought all the mischief. His thoughts were all on the cause, his son's all on him. It proved impossible to stop his wounds bleeding and gradually the old man's strength ebbed away. Toward midnight the Earl's old comrade Essex had time to understand his condition, and sent some officers to enquire for him, and promise speedy surgical attendance. Lindsey was still full of spirit, and spoke to them so strongly of their broken faith, and of the sin of disloyalty and rebellion, that they slunk away one by one out of the hut, and dissuaded Essex from coming himself to see his old friend, as he had intended. The surgeon, however, arrived, but too late, Lindsey was already so much exhausted by cold and loss of blood, that he died early in the morning of the 24 October 1642, as he was being carried through the gates of Warwick Castle where other Royalist prisoners were being kept. His son, despite King Charles' best efforts to obtain his exchange, remained a prisoner of the Parliamentary side for about a year.Guide to Warwick Castle (unpaginated). Lindsey is buried in St Michael and All Angels Church, Edenham, Lincolnshire. Lord Lindsey should not be confused with Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford, who also fought for the King at the Battle of Edgehill. ==Marriage and issue== In 1605, Lindsey married Elizabeth Montagu (d. 30 November 1654, sister of Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton). They had thirteen children: *Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey (1608–1666) *Hon. Sir Roger Bertie (d. 15 October 1654), married Ursula Lawley, daughter of Sir Edward Lawley *Hon.

The village lies on the north bank of the Wylye, about southeast of the town of Warminster. The civil parish includes most of the small neighbouring settlement of Tytherington, and the deserted village of Imber. ==History== Chalk downland north of Heytesbury village has prehistoric earthworks including long barrows and round barrows. Strip lynchets are visible north and east of Cotley Hill. The parish lies between the Iron Age hillforts of Scratchbury Camp and Knook Castle. A Romano-British settlement has been identified on Tytherington Hill, in the far south of the parish. Chapperton Down, west of Imber, has evidence of settlement and field systems from the same period and earlier. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a small settlement of eight households at Hestrebe, with a church. The hundred of Heytesbury, south and east of Warminster, comprised seventeen places. The Hungerford family held land at Heytesbury by the 1390s, and reared sheep in the surrounding area in the next century. Family members include Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford of Heytesbury. John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–1872) described Heytesbury as follows: > HEYTESBURY, a small town, a parish, a sub-district, and a hundred, in Wilts. > The town stands on the river Wylye, and on the Somerset and Weymouth > railway, near Salisbury Plain, 4 miles SE by E of Warminster; was known, to > the Saxons, as Hegtredesbiryg; took afterwards the names of Haresbury, > Haseberie, and Heightsbury; is now commonly called Hatchbury; was, in the > time of Stephen, the residence of the Empress Maud; was, in 1766, nearly all > destroyed by fire, and afterwards rebuilt; consists now chiefly of a single > street; possesses interest to tourists as the central point of a region > abounding in British, Roman, Saxon, and Danish remains; and gives the title > of Baron to the family of A'Court.

An elementary school was provided in 1838, immediately southwest of the church. By 1858 there were 50-60 pupils and 40-50 infants. The school moved to a new site, off the High Street west of the church, in 1900, and came under Wiltshire County Council control in the early years of that century. Children of all ages attended until 1931 when those over 11 transferred to the new Avenue Senior School at Warminster. The school continues to serve Heytesbury and Tytherington as Heytesbury CofE Primary School. == Religious sites == === Church of England === Church of St Peter and St Paul A church was mentioned at Hestrebe in the Domesday Book of 1086 and became a collegiate church in the 12th century. The present parish church is from the 13th century and is a Grade I listed building. At Tytherington, a chapel was founded in the 12th century. The small church of St James is mainly from the 16th and is Grade II* listed. St Giles' Church, Imber, dates from the late 13th century and is a Grade I listed building. It is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. === Non-conformist === A Congregational chapel was built in Heytesbury village in 1812 and replaced c. 1868\\\\. The chapel closed sometime after 1955. There was a Primitive Methodist chapel at Tytherington. ==Notable people== Elizabeth Wydeville (1437–1492), wife of Edward IV, mother of Elizabeth of York and the two murdered princes, was probably exiled or housed at the East Manor, with Elizabeth of York and her four sisters, following the sudden illness and subsequent death of Edward IV.Alison Weir, Elizabeth of York: A Tudor Queen and Her World, pp 114 David Baldwin, The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York The antiquary William Cunnington (1754–1810) was of Heytesbury, and investigated many prehistoric sites on the downs. Heytesbury House was built for the Ashe à Court family. Sir William à Court was created a Baronet in 1795 and the Baronry of Heytesbury was created in 1828 for his son, also Sir William. The poet Siegfried Sassoon spent the latter part of his life at Heytesbury House, which he purchased in 1933. His son George Sassoon grew up there and inherited the house on his father's death in 1967; he lived there until 1996, when it was sold. Major-General Glyn Gilbert (1920–2003) settled at Heytesbury. ==Notable buildings== Heytesbury House, a country house rebuilt in 1782, is Grade II* listed. In 1985 the southern part of the park surrounding the house was the subject of a compulsory purchase order to allow construction of the A36 bypass, separating the house from its cricket field and requiring a new entrance to be made from the west. The gate piers and curved flanking walls at the former southern entrance, from the early 19th century, are still standing. In the early 21st century the house and stables were converted into several residences. Hospital of St John and St Katherine The Hospital of St John and St Katherine was founded in 1442 by Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford and re-endowed in 1472 by Margaret, widow of his son Robert. The almshouse provided housing for twelve poor unmarried men and one woman (who was responsible for domestic duties), under the oversight of a chaplain or warden appointed by the Chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral. There was a school-house and from time to time a schoolmaster. Around 1769 the hospital burned down and a new building was erected, of two stories around three sides of a courtyard. The architect was Esau Reynolds (1725–1779) of Trowbridge.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Reynolds, Esau\\" In 1968 the building was designated as Grade II listed. The hospital continues as a registered charity. Heytesbury lock-up On the High Street is a small octagonal village lock-up or blind house, probably dating from the 18th century. ==Local government== A parish council known as \\"Heytesbury, Imber and Knook\\" covers this parish and the neighbouring parish of Knook. Local government services are provided by Wiltshire Council, which has its offices in nearby Trowbridge. ==Transport== The A36 road bypasses the village to the north; an Ordnance Survey map of 1958 shows the road's earlier route along the High Street. The Wessex Main Line railway (opened here in 1856) runs to the south, and until 1955 there was a station on the Heytesbury-Tytherington road. ==See also== *Heytesbury (UK Parliament constituency) *Baron Heytesbury ==References== ==External links== * Parish of Heytesbury, Imber, Knook and Tytherington * History of Heytesbury at Wiltshire Community History * History of Heytesbury House – David Gray Category:Villages in Wiltshire Category:Civil parishes in Wiltshire ","title":"Heytesbury"},{"id":"2567363","text":"Hindon is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, about west of Salisbury and south of Warminster. It is in the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Hindon was a market town but is now a village. ==History== Hindon is a planned settlement, unlike most English villages which have evolved piecemeal over the millennia. If previous settlement in the area was present, no evidence within the village itself has yet been discovered. There are prehistoric field systems and Bronze Age round barrows on the downs nearby. According to the Estates' Account Rolls of the Bishop of Winchester, Bishop Peter des Roches of Winchester planned the borough as a centre for markets and fairs in 1218; at that time the land was part of East Knoyle parish. The main period of building was between 1218 and 1220 and even today, the medieval settlement pattern can be seen: the main tenements flanked either side of the High Street, with narrow burgage plots running behind the buildings. By c.1250 there were some 150 houses in the village. There were 77 poll-tax payers in 1377. Hindon became a parliamentary borough (see Hindon constituency) in the later Middle Ages, and continued to return two members until it was disenfranchised in 1832; it was reckoned to be an exceptionally corrupt borough even by the standards of the time. Its central position in south-west Wiltshire made it a centre of local government: between 1530 and 1660 it was sometimes a venue for quarter sessions and in 1786 was made the centre of a petty sessional division. Hindon's prosperity was due to its markets and fairs, and its position on and near main roads. Almost immediately after the foundation of the village in 1218 a weekly market was held and this continued for centuries: Hindon was noted for its market in the mid and late 16th century. As a corn market it was rated by John Aubrey as second only to Warminster in c.1650, and in c.1707 it was coupled with Chippenham as a great Wiltshire market. In the 19th century the sale of pigs and sheep comprised a sizeable share of the market business, but by the later 19th century the market declined rapidly, and finally ceased in the early 1880s. Stabling at the Grosvenor Arms (once the Angel Inn), an old coaching inn in Hindon Coaching was probably the major industry in the village in the 18th century and early 19th century. The main London-Exeter road ran across the downs, and in 1754 there were fourteen inns and public houses in the village, with associated stabling for the horses. Such was the vitality of Hindon that it quickly recovered after the disastrous fire of 1754. In 1801 the population was 793. In 1830 London coaches from Exeter left daily from the Swan and from Barnstaple nightly from the Lamb Inn, and there were corresponding services westwards. Stabling can still be seen at the Grosvenor Arms (also known at various times in its history as the Angel Inn): the exterior of the stable block facing Angel Lane bears a text which reads: GROSVENORS ARMS GOOD STALL STABLEING [sic] AND LOCK-UP COACH HOUSES. The population of the village reached a peak of 921 in 1831 when there were some 190 houses. Other trades undertaken in the village over the centuries include weaving, linen and tick-weaving, silk twist manufacture, inn-keeping, baking, brewing, clock-making, gunpowder manufacture, and wood, metal and leather working. A school was built on the east side of the village in the 1850s, at the expense of Lady Octavia Shaw-Stewart. Children of all ages attended until 1961, when those aged 11 transferred elsewhere. Several reasons for Hindon's decline have been put forward: its disenfranchisement in 1832; the railway connection of London to Taunton and Exeter in the 1840s which reduced coach traffic significantly (coupled with the opening of the station at Tisbury, southeast of Hindon, in 1859); and a general decrease in road traffic. By 1875 all but two of Hindon's inns were closed down. The High Street was lined with trees in 1863. These still remain, mostly lime but with a few oak trees. The trees are pollarded annually, giving the wide straight village street an almost French look. Hindon is mentioned in A Shepherd's Life: Impressions of the South Wiltshire Downs by W. H. Hudson, published in 1910. Hudson stayed in the Lamb Inn in the spring and summer of 1909. Chapter 16 of the book concerns Hindon, in which Hudson describes the village thus: 'Hindon is a delightful little village, so rustic and pretty amidst its green, swelling downs ... its last state, sober and purified, is very much better than the old. For although sober, it is contented and even merry, and exhibits such a sweet friendliness toward the stranger within its gates as to make him remember it with pleasure and gratitude.' He relates stories about Hindon's social and natural history. ==Religion== A chapel was built when Hindon was founded, but was almost certainly closed by the later 14th century. In 1405 it was refounded and partially rebuilt. In 1650 it was recommended that Hindon should become a parish, but it remained a chapelry and until 1869 there was still no right of marriage in the chapel, although inhabitants could be baptised and buried there. In 1804 the church (known as the Free Chapel) comprised a nave and chancel with a south tower, the lower part of which served as a porch. The tower and possibly part of the nave and chancel dated from the 12th century, while the west doorway and window and a south window of the nave were later medieval. In 1836 the church was enlarged: a north aisle was added, as well as a window in the nave; by 1864 marriages were being performed in the church. However, this incarnation of the church was short-lived. Parish status was assigned in 1869 and in November of that same year the Free Chapel was demolished, along with a few adjacent buildings, to make way for a new church. By July 1871, construction was completed, and the new parish church of St John the Baptist, designed by T. H. Wyatt, was consecrated. This survives largely unaltered. There is a strong tradition of non-conformity in the West Country, and Hindon was no exception to this. In 1787 a dwelling-house was certified for Independents, and in 1810 a Congregational church was built at nearby Fonthill Gifford. In 1836 a room in Hindon was certified for Primitive Methodists and five years later the Providence Chapel was built for them behind the south side of the High Street. In 1896 that chapel was replaced by one on the north side of the street, where it still stands, although now converted into a private dwelling. ==The Great Fire of Hindon== On 2 July 1754, a large fire swept through the village, burning 144 houses and buildings to the ground. Charitable donations from across the south of England helped in the process of rebuilding. ==Present day== The village has two pubs: The Grosvenor Arms and The Lamb. The school continues as Hindon Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School, having merged with the school at East Knoyle (leading to closure of the East Knoyle site) in 1984 and later becoming a Voluntary Aided school. In 2004 Hindon won the Best Medium-sized Village in Wiltshire Award and in 2006 the Laurence Kitching Award for Best Kept Village in Wiltshire. Both awards are judged by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE). Three long-distance footpaths pass through Hindon: the Wessex Ridgeway, Monarch's Way and Orange Way. ==Notable people== *Henrietta Scott, Countess of Dalkeith – born in Hindon c. 1677. *'Monk' Lewis, Gothic novelist, was an MP for Hindon from 1796 to 1801. *Tony Streather (1926–2018), Army officer and mountaineer, the first man to climb two peaks higher than 25,000 ft, retired to Hindon. ==References== ==Sources== * Beresford, Maurice W, 'Six New Towns of the Bishop of Winchester' Medieval Archaeology 3, pages 200–202 (1959) * Beresford, Maurice W, New Towns of the Middle Ages Lutterworth Press (1967) * Dewhurst, Richard,The Church in Hindon Hindon: Hindon Publishing (2000) * Dewhurst, Richard, Crosstracks to Hindon Salisbury: The Hobnob Press (2005) * Sheard Norah, The History of Hindon Printed by The Shaston Printers Ltd, Shaftesbury, Dorset, UK (1979) ==External links== * Village page at Nadder Valley Focus * Hindon photographs on Geograph.org.uk * English Heritage Images of England website: type 'Hindon' in the search box for photographs of listed buildings in Hindon Category:Villages in Wiltshire Category:Civil parishes in Wiltshire ","title":"Hindon, Wiltshire"},{"id":"2567371","text":"==Champions== ===Major League Baseball=== *World Series: Oakland Athletics over New York Mets (4–3); Reggie Jackson, MVP *All-Star Game, July 24 at Royals Stadium: National League, 7–1; Bobby Bonds, MVP ===Other champions=== *College World Series: USC *Japan Series: Yomiuri Giants over Nankai Hawks (4–1) *Big League World Series: Lincolnwood, Illinois *Little League World Series: Tainan City, Taiwan *Senior League World Series: Taipei, Taiwan Winter Leagues *1973 Caribbean Series: Tigres del Licey *Dominican Republic League: Tigres del Licey *Mexican Pacific League: Yaquis de Obregón *Puerto Rican League: Cangrejeros de Santurce *Venezuelan League: Leones del Caracas ==Awards and honors== *Baseball Hall of Fame **Roberto Clemente **Billy Evans **Monte Irvin **George Kelly **Warren Spahn **Mickey Welch *Most Valuable Player **Reggie Jackson (AL) Oakland Athletics **Pete Rose (NL) Cincinnati Reds *Cy Young Award **Jim Palmer (AL) Baltimore Orioles **Tom Seaver (NL) New York Mets *Rookie of the Year **Al Bumbry (AL) Baltimore Orioles **Gary Matthews (NL) San Francisco Giants ==MLB statistical leaders== { cellpadding=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:auto;border: 1px solid gray;\\" - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"font-size: larger;\\" !  colspan=2  American League  colspan=2  National League - style=\\"background:lightblue;\\" !

Even the family dogs were traded. *March 20 – In a special election held by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, the late Roberto Clemente receives 393 of 424 votes to earn entry into the Hall of Fame. The Hall's Board of Directors had earlier waived the five-year-wait rule for Clemente. *March 29 – Orange baseballs, the brainchild of Oakland Athletics owner Charlie Finley, are used in the Athletics' 11–5 exhibition loss to the Cleveland Indians. ===April–June=== *April 6: **At Three Rivers Stadium, 51,695 fans watch as the jersey #21 of the late Roberto Clemente is retired. The Pittsburgh Pirates then beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7–5, with a ninth-inning rally. **At Fenway Park, Ron Blomberg of the New York Yankees becomes the first designated hitter in major league history. He is walked by Boston Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant in his first plate appearance. **At Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, Tony Oliva of the Minnesota Twins becomes the first designated hitter to homer, with a first-inning shot off Catfish Hunter. *April 10 – The Kansas City Royals open their new park, Royals Stadium, with a 12–1 rout of the Texas Rangers. The game is attended by 39,464 fans braving 39-degree weather. *April 17 – Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Dick Ruthven, signed from Fresno State, makes his major league debut without ever playing in the minor leagues. He starts against the Montreal Expos, allowing four runs in less than two innings, but did not figure in the decision as the Phillies won 9-6. *April 27 – In 50-degree weather, Kansas City Royals rookie Steve Busby no-hits the host Detroit Tigers 3–0. It is the first Royals no-hitter, and the first in Tiger Stadium since Virgil Trucks' in . With the designated hitter rule in effect, Busby becomes the first pitcher of a no-hitter to not come to bat. *May 8 **For the second time in his career, Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hits a home run out of Dodger Stadium. His blast off Andy Messersmith hits the right field pavilion roof 470 feet away. His first home run, a 506-foot shot, came off Alan Foster on August 5, . The Los Angeles Dodgers win, 7–4. **In a 9–7 losing effort against the San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals ace Bob Gibson makes his 242nd consecutive start. It is a new 20th-century record, passing that of Red Ruffing who never pitched in relief the last ten years of his career. *May 9 – Johnny Bench of the Cincinnati Reds hit three home runs off Philadelphia's Steve Carlton for the second time in his career, in a 9–7 victory. Bench drove in seven runs. *May 15 – Nolan Ryan of the California Angels pitches the first of his seven career no hitters, defeating the Kansas City Royals, 3–0. *May 24 – Willie Davis of the Los Angeles Dodgers gets 6 hits, all singles in a 7-3 19 inning loss to the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium. The record still stands as of 2017 for most hits in a game by a Dodgers player. *June 7 – Dave Winfield of the University of Minnesota, the fourth pick in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, will go straight to the major leagues with the San Diego Padres. The Milwaukee Brewers use their third overall pick to select Robin Yount. *June 9 – After the Old Timers' Game at Shea Stadium, Willie Mays puts on his own show with a home run and a circus catch, and the New York Mets top the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2. For Mays, older than a half dozen of the old Mets, it is the 655th homer of his career. Rusty Staub drives in two runs to back Jon Matlack. In the Old Timers' Game, the Brooklyn Dodgers/New York Yankees team loses to the Mets 1–0 in two innings. *June 13 – At Riverfront Stadium, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Rick Wise loses a no-hitter when the Cincinnati Reds' Joe Morgan singles with one out in the ninth inning. It will be the only hit Wise allows in an 8–0 shutout win. Wise, who no-hit the Reds at Riverfront in , was bidding to join Addie Joss as the only pitchers to throw two no–hitters against the same team. *June 19 **In a Dodgers 4–0 victory over Cincinnati, Pete Rose (single) and Willie Davis (HR) each collect their 2,000th career hit. **Dave Winfield debuts in a San Diego Padre 7-3 loss to the Houston Astros. Winfield—who was also drafted by the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL and basketball's Atlanta Hawks (NBA) and Utah Stars (ABA) -- would go 1 for 4 in his debut, and never spend a day in the minor leagues. After a 22-year career, he is voted into baseball's Hall of Fame. *June 20 **Cy Acosta of the Chicago White Sox becomes the first American League pitcher to bat since the DH rule went into effect. Acosta strikes out in the eighth inning, but is credited with an 8–3 victory over the California Angels. **Bobby Bonds leads off with a home run, but the Giants lose 7–5 to Cincinnati. It is Bonds' 22nd leadoff home run, breaking Lou Brock's National League record. *June 23 – Pitcher Ken Brett of the Philadelphia Phillies tops the Montreal Expos 7–2, and hits a home run for his fourth consecutive game, setting a major league record. Previously, Brett hit home runs on June 9, 13, and 18. He will total 10 for his career. *June 28 – Willie Stargell hits his 300th career home run helping the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6–0. ===July=== *July 1 – Luis Aparicio of the Boston Red Sox steals the 500th base of his career in a 9–5 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. It is the highest total in the American League since Eddie Collins retired in 1930. *July 3 – Brothers Gaylord Perry (Indians) and Jim Perry (Tigers) pitch against each other for the only time in their careers. Neither finishes the game, but Gaylord is charged with the 5–4 loss. Two Norm Cash home runs help the Tigers. *July 4 – The Minnesota Twins bring their first-round June draft pick, pitcher Eddie Bane, straight to the major leagues, in an attempt to boost interest and attendance (the brainchild of owner Calvin Griffith). Bane brings a 40-4 record with him from Arizona State University, and goes seven innings in his debut, a no-decision start. A crowd of 45,890 is on hand at Metropolitan Stadium. *July 9 – In a record-setting walkathon between the Cincinnati Reds and Montreal Expos, 25 bases on balls are handed out as Montreal strolls to an 11–6 win. Well off the American League's two-team mark of 30, this tops the National League record of 23, last reached on July 7, 1911. Six Montreal pitchers walk 16, one short of the record for an NL team, while two Reds pitchers walk nine. Hal King pinch hits a grand slam for the Reds in the 6th inning, his second pinch homer in nine days. *July 11: **Jim Northrup, batting leadoff for the Detroit Tigers, drives in eight runs in a 14–2 win over Texas. **In San Diego, the Pittsburgh Pirates drub the Padres 10–2. Willie Stargell contributes the 302nd home run of his career to pass Ralph Kiner as the all- time Pirate home run leader. **The New York Mets sell Jim Fregosi to The Texas Rangers. *July 15: **Willie McCovey hits his 400th career home run helping San Francisco Giants beat Pittsburgh Pirates 12–0. **Nolan Ryan pitches his second no hitter of the season (and second of seven for his career. He strikes out seventeen Detroit Tigers as the Angels win, 6–0. *July 20 – Wilbur Wood starts both games of a doubleheader for the Chicago White Sox, and loses both games to the New York Yankees, 12–2 & 7–0. *July 21 – Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hits a Ken Brett fastball into the left-center field stands for a two- run home run during an 8–4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. It is career home run #700 for Aaron, only the second player to reach that milestone. Babe Ruth, with 714, is the other. *July 24 – The National League wins the All-Star Game at Kansas City, 7–1. A record 54 players are used, including Willie Mays, who strikes out in his final All-Star appearance, and Catfish Hunter, who sustains a fractured thumb that will sideline him for four weeks. Hunter has a 15–3 record at the time. Johnny Bench Bobby Bonds and Willie Davis All hit home runs for the N.L. And Bonds edged out Willie Davis for the game M.V.P. By 1 vote. *July 30 – At Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, Jim Bibby of the Texas Rangers no-hits the Oakland Athletics 6–0. The no-hitter is the first in the history of the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchise. ===August=== *August 1 – With the score tied at 2–2 in the top of the ninth at Fenway Park, in an incident that typifies both the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry and the feud between the two catchers involved, Thurman Munson of the New York Yankees barrels into Carlton Fisk of the Boston Red Sox while trying to score on Gene Michael's missed squeeze attempt. The incident triggers a 10-minute bench- clearing brawl in which both catchers are ejected. The Red Sox win 3–2 in the bottom of the ninth, with Mario Guerrero's two-out single scoring Bob Montgomery (who had replaced the ejected Fisk) for the winning run. *August 5 – Atlanta Braves knuckleballer Phil Niekro no-hits the San Diego Padres 9–0. He walks three and strikes out four in recording the first no-hitter by the franchise in Atlanta. *August 6 – An exhibition game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Atlanta Braves held at Milwaukee draws 33,337. The Brewers win, 7–5, in the fourth and last exhibition between the two teams. But the big thrill is provided by Hank Aaron, who hits a home run. *August 7 – Two days after Phil Niekro's no-hitter, the Braves purchase Joe Niekro, Phil's pitching brother, from the Detroit Tigers. *August 11 – Chicago White Sox rookie Brian Downing cracks his first major league hit, a home run off Detroit's Mickey Lolich. Downing's debut dinger is a first in the majors since at least 1945 – an inside-the-park homer. It'll be matched in two years by the Giants Johnnie LeMaster, who will do it in his first at bat. *August 15 – In Pittsburgh, Cincinnati Reds ace Jack Billingham beats the host Pittsburgh Pirates 1–0, notching his seventh shutout of the season. This ties the club record set by Hod Eller back in 1919. *August 17 – The New York Mets' Willie Mays hits the 660th (and last) home run of his career off Don Gullett of Cincinnati, but the Reds win 2–1 in 10 innings at Shea Stadium, after pinch hitter Hal King bats a walk-off home run, his third pinch homer of the year. *August 21 – Against the Cleveland Indians at Cleveland Stadium, Stan Bahnsen of the Chicago White Sox has a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth on a single by ex-teammate Walt Williams. The hit is the only one Bahnsen allows as the White Sox defeat the Indians 4-0. ===September=== *September 3 – After 11 years at the helm (944–806 .539), Ralph Houk resigns as the New York Yankees' manager. The 'Major' will manage the Detroit Tigers next season. *September 3 – The San Francisco Giants overcome a 7 – 1 deficit to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 11 – 8 at Candlestick Park during a nationally televised Monday Night baseball game on NBC. Bobby Bonds hit a walk-off grand slam into the right field seats to win the game for the Giants. *September 6 – Brothers Felipe Alou and Matty Alou are released by the New York Yankees. Felipe is sold to the Montreal Expos and Matty goes to the St. Louis Cardinals. *September 7 – Whitey Herzog is fired by the Texas Rangers with the club in the American League West cellar at 47-91. Del Wilber serves as interim manager for one game before owner Bob Short names Billy Martin, fired by the Tigers earlier in the season, as Herzog's permanent replacement. *September 19 – The Pittsburgh Pirates lose the first game of a crucial three game series at Shea for first place 7–3 to the New York Mets when Cleon Jones has just the second two home run performance of his career (the first time was on April 6, in the season opener against the Philadelphia Phillies). *September 20 – At Shea Stadium, in the top of the thirteenth inning, with Richie Zisk on first, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Dave Augustine belts what appears to be a home run over the left field wall. New York Mets left fielder Cleon Jones turns to play the ball off the wall and the ball hits the top of the wall and goes right into Jones' glove on the fly. He turns and throws to relay man Wayne Garrett, who throws home to catcher Ron Hodges to nail Zisk at the plate. Following the \\"Ball on the Wall\\" play, the Mets win the game in the bottom half of the inning to move within half a game of the first place Pirates. *September 27 – Capping a memorable season, Nolan Ryan strikes out 16 Minnesota Twins en route to a 5–4, 11-inning win for the California Angels. Rich Reese is Ryan's final strikeout, his 383rd of the season, which breaks Sandy Koufax's season record. *September 30 – The New York Yankees play their final game in the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Detroit Tigers 5–2. Yankee Stadium remains closed until 1976 while undergoing major renovations. ===October–December=== *October 1 – Two make-up games were played after the scheduled end of the regular season on September 30: the Mets won at the Cubs 6–4 and the Pirates lost at home to the Padres 3–4; making a potential second game between the Cubs and Mets unnecessary. *October 8 – In Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, the New York Mets' Rusty Staub homers in the first and second innings as the Mets crush the Cincinnati Reds 9–2 at New York's Shea Stadium, in a game featuring a bench-clearing brawl involving future Phillies teammates Pete Rose and Bud Harrelson. *October 10 – Like , no one thought the Mets would win the National League pennant, but they amazingly did as New York's Tom Seaver hurls the Mets into the World Series with a 7–2 victory over the Reds in Game 5 of the 1973 National League Championship Series. New York has 13 hits in the contest. *October 13 – The Oakland Athletics score two unearned runs in the third inning of game one of the 1973 World Series when the usually sure handed Félix Millán allows a ground ball to go through his legs. They are the only runs New York Mets starter Jon Matlack allows, but they are enough to give Oakland the 2–1 game one victory. *October 14 – In one of the more bizarre games in World Series history, the Mets defeat the Athletics 10-7 in 12 innings in Game 2 by scoring four runs in the 12th, three of which were the result of two errors by Oakland second baseman Mike Andrews. After the game, Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley forced Andrews to sign a false affidavit stating he was disabled, which would have rendered him ineligible for the remainder of the series. A's manager Dick Williams rallied to Andrews' defense and commissioner Bowie Kuhn nullified the affidavit. Nevertheless, Finley ordered Williams to bench Andrews for the remainder of the series. Williams, in defiance, sent Andrews to the plate as a pinch hitter in Game 4 in New York three nights later as the Mets' home crowd gave a standing ovation. *October 21 – Bert Campaneris and Reggie Jackson hit two-run home runs in the third inning as the Oakland Athletics defeated the New York Mets, 5–2, in Game Seven of the World Series, for their second straight World Championship. Jackson is selected the Series MVP. *October 23 – Athletics owner Charlie Finley reveals that he will not release manager Dick Williams from his contract unless he receives adequate compensation from the team that signs him. Williams had resigned following the World Series victory two days earlier. *November 27 – San Francisco Giants left fielder Gary Matthews, who hit .300 with 12 home runs and 58 RBI in 145 games, outpolls eight others receiving 11 of 24 nominations for the National League Rookie of the Year Award. The runners-up are Steve Rogers (P), Bob Boone (C), Dan Driessen (3B), Elías Sosa (P), Ron Cey (3B), Johnny Grubb (CF), Davey Lopes (2B) and Richie Zisk (RF). ==Movies== *Bang the Drum Slowly ==Births== ===January=== *January 2 – Mike Metcalfe *January 3 – Da Rond Stovall *January 5 – Fred Rath Jr. *January 5 – Ramón Tatís *January 8 – Mike Cameron *January 9 – Aaron Holbert *January 10 – Gary Rath *January 14 – Troy Brohawn *January 14 – Rod Myers *January 15 – Chris Cumberland *January 15 – Wayne Gomes *January 19 – Chris Stynes *January 20 – Julio Santana *January 23 – Nelson Paulino *January 24 – Mike Glavine *January 25 – Terrell Wade *January 28 – Jacob Cruz *January 29 – Brian Edmondson *January 29 – Jason Schmidt *January 30 – Bob Henley ===February=== *February 3 – Ryan Long *February 4 – Chris Coste *February 8 – Keith McDonald *February 14 – Daniel Garibay *February 18 – Shawn Estes *February 22 – Rick Heiserman *February 22 – Russ Johnson *February 23 – Jason Boyd *February 24 – Stubby Clapp ===March=== *March 4 – Brian Barber *March 4 – Rick Eckstein *March 5 – Felipe Crespo *March 5 – Ryan Franklin *March 6 – Terry Adams *March 6 – Roberto Durán *March 8 – Mark Lukasiewicz *March 8 – Justin Thompson *March 9 – Aaron Boone *March 9 – C.

The series features an eponymous prisoner of the jail Inzepocket (\\"in the pocket\\" with a French accent). In Dutch, the series' name is Jaap. ==History== Bobo first appeared in a mini–récit (mini-story) in Spirou magazine on May 11, 1961 In the early years, it was written by Rosy, who also took artistic responsibility during a brief period in the 1970s. Eventually, the character evolved into its own series, mostly consisting of short stories, and a few full length (i.e. 44 pages) stories. Fifteen albums appeared until the 1990s, when the series ended its run. ==Synopsis== Bobo was sentenced to twenty years in jail for stealing a bicycle (it was the bicycle of the sentencing judge). Bobo is always trying to escape in various ways, usually by digging, and thus make his way to the beaches of Acapulco. Other major characters are the prison's manager who is fond of pies and cookies; the prison bully who has it in for Bobo and his various schemes; the Professional, a grumpy old prisoner who insists that everything be done \\"by the book,\\" his copy of which dates back to before the prison reform movement (at his insistence, the Professional lives in an old dungeon, wears a ball-and-chain, does heavy labor and only eats stale bread and dirty water); and Stonie the warden, who always carries a stone (left over after building the prison), and which he is constantly trying to get rid off, but his colleagues insist that he carries. There is also Julot-les-pinceaux (Julian Brush), Bobo's outside accomplice who is always coming up with various schemes to get his beloved boss out of the nick. ==Computer game== A six-stage computer game was made (released in 1988), with the player steering Bobo through six tasks: feeding soup to his hungry inmates in the mess hall whiles killing flies; peeling an ever-increasing mount of potatoes; cleaning the floor of the prison office hallway; helping his numerous mates escape via a trampoline; running over a set of three high-mounted power lines; and finally, stopping your cellmates from snoring when you are trying to sleep. The purpose of the game is not to reach a certain goal, but to collect as many points as possible in the short space of time given in most of the tasks. Failing in these task is inevitable—like in the first, the inmates get hungry very quickly as time passes, and eventually someone puts the soup pot on Bobo's head; and in the third an increasing number of guardsmen, dogs and inmates keep running through the hallway, staining the floor with their dirty shoes. ==References== * Bobo publications in Spirou BDoubliées * Bobo albums Bedetheque Footnotes ==External links== * Paul Deliège interview on Auracan.com Category:Dupuis titles Category:Belgian comics characters Category:1961 comics debuts Category:Belgian comic strips Category:Humor comics Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961 Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional prison escapees Category:Fictional Belgian people Category:Male characters in comics Category:Comics adapted into video games ","title":"Bobo (Belgian comic)"},{"id":"2567393","text":"The Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis () is a dynastic order of chivalry founded 5 April 1693Hamilton, Walter. \\"Dated Book-plates (Ex Libris) with a Treatise on Their Origin\\", P37.

It was intended as a reward for exceptional officers, notable as the first decoration that could be granted to non-nobles. By the authorities of the French Republic, it is considered a predecessor of the Legion of Honour, with which it shares the red ribbon (though the Legion of Honour is awarded to military personnel and civilians alike). Although officially abolished by the government authorities of the July Revolution in 1830 following the French Revolution, its activities carried on as a dynastic order of the formerly sovereign royal family. As such, it is still recognised by the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry.Icoregister ==Members== Letter granting Sieur des Chaillons the title of Knight, 25 March 1730 The King was the Grand Master of the order, and the Dauphin was automatically a member as well. The Order had three classes: *Grand-Croix (Grand Cross) *Commandeur (Commander) *Chevalier (Knight) The entire order included 8 Grand Crosses, 28 Commanders and a variable number of Knights. Officers of the Order included, after the Grand Master, a Trésorier (Treasurer), a Greffier (Registrar) and a Huissier (Gentleman Usher). The badge of the order consisted of a portrait of Saint Louis surrounded by the motto « LUD(OVICUS) M(AGNUS) IN(STITUIT) 1693 » (\\"Louis the Great instituted it in 1693\\"). The reverse features a sword interlaced with a laurel crown and a white sash, with the inscription « BELL(ICAE) VIRTUTIS PRAEM(IUM) » (\\"reward of wartime valour\\"). Knights wore the badge suspended from a ribbon on the breast, Commanders wore a red ribband (sash) over the right shoulder, and recipients of the Grand Cross wore the ribband as well as a star on the left breast. The general assembly of the Order was held annually on 25 August, the feast day of Saint Louis, in the residence of the King. Conditions for being inducted did not include nobility; however, Catholic faith was mandatory, as well as at least ten years' service as a commissioned officer in the Army or the Navy. Members of the Order received a pension. Hereditary nobility was granted to a knight's son and grandsons. Another decoration, the Institution of Military Merit (:fr:Institution du mérite militaire) was created for the Protestant officers in service of the French king (mainly foreign mercenaries, as French Protestants were not tolerated at the time). Until the death of Louis XIV, the medal was awarded to outstanding officers only, but it gradually came to be an award that most officers would receive during their career. On 1 January 1791, during the French Revolution, a decree changed the name to décoration militaire (\\"military decoration\\"). It was subsequently withdrawn on 15 October 1792. One of the first acts of Louis XVIII was to reinstate the Order of Saint Louis, using it to award officers of the Royal and Imperial armies alike. In 1830 the new king Louis-Philippe abolished the order, which was never reinstated.

It may be used with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is most useful for clients on networks masqueraded by symmetric NAT devices. TURN does not aid in running servers on well known ports in the private network through a NAT; it supports the connection of a user behind a NAT to only a single peer, as in telephony, for example. TURN is specified by . An update to TURN for IPv6 is specified in . The TURN URI scheme is documented in . == Introduction == NATs, while providing benefits, also come with drawbacks. The most troublesome of those drawbacks is the fact that they break many existing IP applications, and make it difficult to deploy new ones. Guidelines have been developed that describe how to build \\"NAT friendly\\" protocols, but many protocols simply cannot be constructed according to those guidelines. Examples of such protocols include multimedia applications and file sharing. Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) provides one way for an application to traverse a NAT. STUN allows a client to obtain a transport address (an IP address and port) which may be useful for receiving packets from a peer. However, addresses obtained by STUN may not be usable by all peers. Those addresses work depending on the topological conditions of the network. Therefore, STUN by itself cannot provide a complete solution for NAT traversal. A complete solution requires a means by which a client can obtain a transport address from which it can receive media from any peer which can send packets to the public Internet. This can only be accomplished by relaying data through a server that resides on the public Internet. Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) is a protocol that allows a client to obtain IP addresses and ports from such a relay. Although TURN almost always provides connectivity to a client, it is resource intensive for the provider of the TURN server. It is therefore desirable to use TURN as a last resort only, preferring other mechanisms (such as STUN or direct connectivity) when possible. To accomplish that, the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology can be used to discover the optimal means of connectivity. ==Protocol== The process begins when a client computer wants to contact a peer computer for a data transaction, but cannot do so due to both client and peer being behind respective NATs. If STUN is not an option because one of the NATs is a symmetric NAT (a type of NAT known to be non-STUN compatible), TURN must be used. First, the client contacts a TURN server with an \\"Allocate\\" request. The Allocate request asks the TURN server to allocate some of its resources for the client so that it may contact a peer. If allocation is possible, the server allocates an address for the client to use as a relay, and sends the client an \\"Allocation Successful\\" response, which contains an \\"allocated relayed transport address\\" located at the TURN server. Second, the client sends in a CreatePermissions request to the TURN server to create a permissions check system for peer-server communications. In other words, when a peer is finally contacted and sends information back to the TURN server to be relayed to client, the TURN server uses the permissions to verify that the peer-to-TURN server communication is valid. After permissions have been created, the client has two choices for sending the actual data, (1) it can use the Send mechanism, or (2) it can reserve a channel using the ChannelBind request. The Send mechanism is more straightforward, but contains a larger header, 36 bytes, that can substantially increase the bandwidth in a TURN relayed conversation. By contrast, the ChannelBind method is lighter: the header is only 4 bytes, but it requires a channel to be reserved which needs to be periodically refreshed, among other considerations. Using either method, Send or channel binding, the TURN server receives the data from the client and relays it to the peer using UDP datagrams, which contain as their Source Address the \\"Allocated Relayed Transport Address\\". The peer receives the data and responds, again using a UDP datagram as the transport protocol, sending the UDP datagram to the relay address at the TURN server. The TURN server receives the peer UDP datagram, checks the permissions and if they are valid, forwards it to the client. This process gets around even symmetric NATs because both the client and peer can at least talk to the TURN server, which has allocated a relay IP address for communication. While TURN is more robust than STUN in that it assist in traversal of more types of NATs, a TURN communication relays the entire communication through the server requiring far more server bandwidth than the STUN protocol, which typically only resolves the public facing IP address and relays the information to client and peer for them to use in direct communication. For this reason, the ICE protocol mandates STUN usage as a first resort, and TURN usage only when dealing with symmetric NATs or other situations where STUN cannot be used. ==See also== *Interactive Connectivity Establishment ==External links== * Category:Internet protocols Category:Network protocols Category:Network address translation Category:Voice over IP Category:Application layer protocols ","title":"Traversal Using Relays around NAT"},{"id":"2567412","text":"Ruins of the Quilmes civilization, Tucumán Province. The Quilmes people, also known as Kilmes, were an indigenous tribe of the Diaguita group settled in the western subandean valleys of today’s Tucumán province, in northwestern Argentina. They fiercely resisted the Inca invasions of the 15th century, and continued to resist the Spaniards for 130 years, until being defeated in 1667. Spanish invaders relocated the last 2,000 survivors to a reservation (reducción) 20 km south of Buenos Aires. This 1,500 km journey was made by foot, causing hundreds of Quilmes to die in the process. By 1810, the reservation was abandoned as a result of its having become a ghost town. The survivors ultimately settled in what is now the city of Quilmes. The Quilmes Indians were one of the fiercest cultures which resisted the Incas but eventually fell to the Spaniards. Today, there are only a few Quilmes left in Tucumán Province. ==Quilmes ruins== On the way to Cafayate, 182 km from San Miguel de Tucumán, the Ruins of Quilmes may be seen; this is a fortified citadel which was raised by the Quilmes Indians. One of the most important archaeological locations in Argentina, the ruins were discovered by ethnographer and historian Samuel Lafone Quevedo in 1888 and restored in 1978. As of 2007, this archaeological site is in private hands, and has a private hotel on its territory. ==Population== Population at the beginning of the second half of the 17th century, is estimated in about 2,000 families, approximately 10,000 persons. When the Calchaquí Wars ended survived about 2,000 people (1665), which were taken prisoners and deported to a reservation located near Buenos Aires. But to the reservation just arrived only 200 families (about 1,000 people). In 1726, there were 141 people. William Beresford found a ghost town when he visited the reservation during the first British invasion of the River Plate in 1806. According to the last parish priest of the reserve, the last natives died in the late 18th century. The population was decimated by the high rate of infant mortality and epidemics.

All photographs benefit from being developed. With film this could be done at the print lab, or an inexpensive home darkroom. With digital, many cameras are set up to do basic photo enhancement (contrast, color saturation) immediately after a picture is exposed, and to deliver a finished product. Higher end cameras, however, tend to give a flatter, more neutral image that has more data but less \\"pop,\\" and needs to be developed in the digital darkroom. Setting up a film darkroom was primarily an issue of gathering the right chemicals and lighting; a digital darkroom consists of a powerful computer, a high-quality monitor setup (dual monitors are often used) and software. A printer is optional; many photographers still send their images to a professional lab for better results and, in some cases, a better price. While each implementation is unique, most share several traits: an image editing workstation as the cornerstone, often a database-driven digital asset management system like Media Pro 1 to manage the collection as a whole, a RAW conversion tool like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Capture One, and in many cases the software that came with the camera is used as an automated tool to \\"upload\\" photos to the computer. The machine itself is almost always outfitted with as much RAM as possible and a large storage subsystem - big hard drives. RAID and external USB and FireWire drives are popular for storage. Most photographers consider a DVD-burner essential for making long term backups, and keep at least one set off-site. The term was coined by Gerard Holzmann of Bell Labs for a book entitled Beyond Photography: The Digital Darkroom, in which he describes his pico image manipulation language (not to be confused with the pico programming language).Beyond Photography: The Digital Darkroom == Software == The software employed in a digital darkroom varies greatly depending on the photographer's needs, budget and skill. The following are general areas and examples of software. Image Acquisition: entails downloading images from a camera or removable storage device or importing from a scanner. Windows XP and Windows Vista both include an inbuilt wizard for importing images, including scanning images. Many professionals however may choose an importation tool built into image management software such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Apple Aperture, ACDSee, Capture One, or darktable. Image Library Management: involves managing images in a photographer's library and may extend to backing up images. Software such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Apple Aperture and Media Pro 1 are examples of major image management software. RAW Software: software, either stand alone or as part of image library management software that is designed to import and process RAW images. Most digital cameras capable of outputting RAW images will include a program or plug-in for this purpose such as Canon RAW Image Converter. Commercial Programs such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Apple Aperture and Capture One, as well as open source projects such as darktable and RawTherapee, include extensive support for RAW importation and processing. Image Editing: There are countless image editing suites, programs and tools available. Adobe Photoshop is among the most highly used in professional circles as are programs from Apple Inc., Microsoft, Macromedia (now Adobe), ACD, Phase One and various open source projects. Consumers may use professional software or choose less expensive options such as Adobe Photoshop Elements, Capture One Express or free open source options such as The GIMP. Camera Control Software: software that can remotely control a camera from a computer connected via USB (tethered shooting). Normally included as utilities with camera, these allow photographers to control the camera from a nearby computer. Cameras such as the Canon 40D include such software and a live view mode so that a user may use a computer to control numerous functions of the camera while seeing a virtual viewfinder onscreen. Capture One is one of the pioneer software programs used for tethered shooting which is very useful especially for studio photographers. Capture PilotReview Capture Pilot v1.2 With Camera Control is a photography app with camera control. The photographer is able to use a virtual camera display on an iPhone or iPad to remotely fire the camera and control capture parameters such as ISO sensitivity, exposure mode, shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation. Capture Pilot requires Capture One to function. == Hardware == As image size and resolution increases, so do the requirements for hardware in a digital darkroom. Computer: A computer in a digital darkroom typically have a generous amount of RAM, often 4GB or more, coupled with discrete graphics and a powerful multicore processor. For much of the 1980s and 90s, Macintosh based systems were dominant in the digital imaging market as Adobe's powerful new Photoshop software had only then been developed for the Mac. However, Windows-based systems such as Dell's high-end Precision range have become increasingly popular in recent times; better value for money than Apple's high-end Mac Pro and a more familiar Operating System are both factors that affect the choice of many prospective buyers of photo- editing systems. Cameras/Scanners: Digital cameras and image scanners are increasing in quality, including the amount of colour they can capture and output. Many newer digital cameras can support wider colour spaces such as Adobe RGB and have higher resolution analog-to-digital converters; 14 bits rather than the common 12 bits. Displays: Professionals may use premium displays from companies such as EIZO and Dell which are capable of displaying a wider range of colours than consumer oriented devices. Printers: In addition to computers and displays, digital darkrooms may include printing equipment, ranging from smaller size printers for proofing to large format productions printers. Scanner and studio photographic equipment may also be included. == Digimage Arts program == Digital Darkroom is also the trademarked name of an image editing program for the Macintosh published by Digimage Arts.Bot generated title --> == References == Category:Digital photography Category:Photo software ","title":"Digital darkroom"},{"id":"2567420","text":"Samuel \\"Sam\\" Bingham (184516 June 1905) was the Mayor of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada between 1897 and 1898.Dave Mullington \\"Chain of Office: Biographic Sketches of Ottawa's Mayors (1847-1948)\\" (Renfrew, Ontario: General Store Publishing House, 2005) He was born in Bytown's Lower Town to Irish Catholic parents in 1845.

He served as the Dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business from 2004 to 2019, where he remains the Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and Economics. On September 13, 2018 he announced that he would retire from his position after his contract expired on June 30, 2019. Hubbard previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 1991 to 1993, and as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2001 to 2003. Hubbard is a Visiting Scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, where he studies tax policy and health care. He was criticized for his reports and papers on deregulation during the 2008 banking crisis. ==Early life== Born September 4, 1958, Hubbard was raised in Apopka, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. His father taught at a local community college and his mother taught at a high school. Hubbard's younger brother, Gregg, is a member of the country-pop band Sawyer Brown. Hubbard is an Eagle Scout. A member of the chess team, he was a stellar student who graduated at the top of his class. He scored well enough on his College Level Examination Program to enter the University of Central Florida with enough credits to graduate with two degrees in three years. He obtained his B.A. and B.S. degrees summa cum laude from the University of Central Florida in 1979, and his masters and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1983. ==Career== ===Academic=== Hubbard has been at Columbia University since 1988, being Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and Economics since 1994. He was named Dean of Columbia Business School on July 1, 2004. ===Government=== Hubbard was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 1991 to 1993.American Enterprise Institute, R. Glenn Hubbard From February 2001 until March 2003, Hubbard was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush. A supply-side economist, he was instrumental in the design of the 2003 Bush Tax cuts —an issue which split the economics profession on ideological lines, with those leaning left opposed and those leaning right supportive. See Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts. He was tipped by some media outlets to be a candidate for the position of Chairman of the Federal Reserve when Alan Greenspan retired, although he was not nominated for the position. ===Political advisor=== Hubbard served as economic advisor to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, a position he also held during Romney's 2008 presidential campaign.Romney Taps Bush Hands to Shape Economic Policies, February 24, 2012 In August 2012, Politico identified Hubbard as \\"a likely Romney appointee as Federal Reserve chairman or Treasury secretary\\".\\"Who's on the inside track for a Romney Cabinet\\" by MIKE ALLEN and JIM VANDEHEI, Politico, August 28, 2012, Retrieved 2012-08-28 Hubbard was an economic advisor for the Jeb Bush 2016 presidential campaign. After Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, Hubbard was mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary (which eventually went to Steven Mnuchin), and also as a potential Fed chair, a role expected to become open in February 2018. Hubbard had been critical of both Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, including after Bush had suspended his campaign. In August 2016, Hubbard declined say which candidate he supported in the general election, but did say that Trump's taxation plans and their impact on economic growth were in a \\"direction\\" somewhat better than Clinton's plans.

Ferguson argues that deregulation led to the 2008 international banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch. In the interview, Ferguson asks Hubbard to enumerate the firms from whom he receives outside income as an advisory board member in the context of possible conflict of interest. Hubbard, hitherto cooperative, declines to answer and threatens to end the interview with the remark, \\"You have three more minutes; give it your best shot.\\"Transcript excerpt on \\"A Searing Look At Wall Street In 'Inside Job', Charles Ferguson interviewed by Melissa Block\\", which aired October 1, 2010 on NPR's All Things Considered. During the program, Ferguson explained to Melissa Block, \\"Well, the entire interview was fairly contentious, as you can imagine. It surprised me somewhat to realize that these people were not used to being challenged, that they'd never been questioned about this issue before. They clearly expected to be deferred to by me and I think by everybody.\\" After the release of the film, Columbia ramped up ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify their conflict of interest disclosure requirements.\\"‘Inside Job’ prompts new look at conﬂict of interest policy,\\" published April 13, 2011, in the Columbia Spectator. (Columbia Business School professor Michael Feiner, a member of the faculty committee of Columbia's Sanford C. Bernstein and Co.

His work for Countrywide Financial for $1200/hr, attesting that the lender's loans were no worse than a control group of mortgages and not fraudulent, was examined by an attorney for MBIA. MBIA was suing Countrywide over its mortgage practices. ==Books== Hubbard is the author of a number of economic and socioeconomic texts, with a focus on deregulation, conservative fiscal policy and taxation.

Two successive masonry castles were built on a ridge above the River Ithon known as Castle Bank () in the thirteenth century, replacing a wooden motte-and-bailey castle constructed by the Normans nearby. Cefnllys was also the site of a borough and medieval town. Controlling several communication routes into the highlands of Mid Wales, the castles were strategically important within the Welsh Marches during the High Middle Ages. As the seat of the fiercely contested lordship and cantref of Maelienydd, Cefnllys became a source of friction between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Roger Mortimer in the prelude to Edward I's conquest of Wales. Castle Bank is often considered to be the site of an Iron Age hillfort, but there is no firm evidence to corroborate this. It has also been speculated that the princely court of a native Welsh ruler was situated nearby. The first castle at Cefnllys, north of the ridge, was a motte-and-bailey thrown up during the early stages of the Norman invasion of Wales by the Anglo-Norman baron Ralph Mortimer, beginning a long association between the powerful Mortimer family and Cefnllys. Around 1242, after a century of prolonged conflict in the region, Ralph Mortimer II built a masonry castle on the north-east flank of Castle Bank, which quickly became the principal symbol of Mortimer hegemony in Wales. The castle was captured and slighted in 1262 by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales and Gwynedd, during a war with Henry III of England, and Cefnllys featured prominently in the ensuing peace treaty. The construction of a new castle on the south-east side of the hill by Roger Mortimer was a contributing factor to Llywelyn's refusal to swear fealty to Edward I in 1275, leading to war in 1277. The castle may have been sacked during the revolts of Madog ap Llywelyn (1294–95) and Owain Glyndŵr (1400–09), but remained occupied until at least the mid-15th century, when it was described in a series of poems by the bard Lewys Glyn Cothi. Both castles on Castle Bank are now entirely ruinous and only traces remain; the sole surviving medieval structure at Cefnllys is St Michael's Church. The town was unsuccessful and disappeared altogether as a result of the Black Death and subsequent bubonic plague outbreaks, economic remoteness and changing frontier military conditions, although Cefnllys retained its borough status until the 19th century. ==Etymology== Cefnllys derives from the Welsh words cefn, meaning 'ridge', and llys, meaning 'mansion' or 'court'. Llys is associated with the unfortified courts of medieval Welsh rulers and may refer to the administrative manor (maerdref) of a local lord. The name is first mentioned in 1246 as Keventhles and the form Kevenlleece, standard in the 19th century, is recorded by 1679. Another name for the settlement and parish, Llanfihangel Cefn-llys (\\"church of St Michael at Cefnllys\\"), appears in records and refers to the medieval church which still stands. An older name, Dinieithon (also Dineithon and Castell Glan Iethon), meaning \\"fort on the River Ieithon\\" (din being Old Welsh for 'fort', cognate with dun), is also related to fortifications at Cefnllysparticularly the earlier Norman castle, which is sometimes called \\"Cefnllys Old Castle\\". Dinieithon or Swydd Diniethon (\\"shire of Dinieithon\\") was the name of the commote within the cantref (hundred) of Maelienydd. ==Location== The isolated ridge of Castle Bank is located east of the modern town of Llandrindod Wells, Powys. It occupies a key position at the junction of several tributary valleys of the River Ithon, giving commanding views over an important communication corridor into Central Wales. Cefnllys was caput (administrative centre) of Maelienydd, part of the Welsh region of Rhwng Gwy a Hafren (). As the English Marcher lords expanded their control westward, Maelienydd formed a core part of the turbulent area known as the middle march, together with Gwrtheyrnion and Elfael. The castle was viewed as a forward defence against Welsh incursions by towns along the English border, particularly Hereford. ==Description== Aerial overview, showing the earlier castle (centre-left) and later castle (top-right). The River Ithon near Cefnllys Castle Bank is a naturally defensible position, protected on three sides by a loop of the River Ithon. The hill is open access land, and the highest point is above sea level. The mottes of two castles are situated at opposite ends of the hill, the ruins heavily deformed and mostly rubble; only their basic characteristics have been identified. The northern castle consisted of a keep within a triangular inner bailey, with an accompanying outer bailey which may been entered via a gatehouse at its north-east corner. The main feature of the later southern castle was a circular (or octagonal) tower inside a walled court, separated from the main part of the ridge by a deep rock-cut ditch. There was probably a small bailey to the south-west, and a scarp across the main ridge suggests the southern half of Castle Bank may have formed a large north bailey. The outline of a building in this area is likely to be the oak hall recorded at Cefnllys in the 15th century. A stone curtain wall and rampart extended along most of the hilltop rim. St Michael's Church sits at the western foot of the hill next to the Ithon, to the west. Earthworks surrounding the church are commonly supposed to be the remains of the medieval town. Alternatively, several historians infer that the primary settlement was sited within the enclosure of Castle Bank, adjacent to the castles. During the borough's later history, the population may have been dispersed along the valley, instead of being focused in a nucleated settlement. The Norman motte-and-bailey castle was located on the bank of the Ithon further upstream, north of Castle Bank. ==History== No archaeological excavation has been undertaken at Cefnllysmodern understanding of the site's history rests on contemporary texts. Prior to the 14th century, sources are limited to accounts of military campaigns and the castles are referenced in the Welsh chronicles Brut y Tywysogion and Annales Cambriae. Greater stability following Edward I's conquest of Wales resulted in a growth of documentary evidence in the Welsh Marches, though at Cefnllys this is largely restricted to rudimentary public records as the majority of the Mortimer estate archives have been lost. An extensive topographical survey combined with photogrammetry was carried out at Castle Bank in 1985 by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW), with a follow-up appraisal in 2006. ===Hillfort origins=== A number of scholars have suggested that the medieval castles utilised the remains of an Iron Age hillfort. Indications of a pre-Roman provenance include the ridge's large, elongated enclosure of , interpretation of visible earthworks and the extensive use of scarping and ditching to artificially steepen the gradient of slopes surrounding the hilltop. The archaeologist A. E. Brown has tentatively linked the entrance hollow-way with this period, and the banks encircling the hilltop could also have an Iron Age origin. Other features previously posited as pre-Roman were determined to be medieval by the 2006 RCAHMW report, although it did not rule out the possibility of a hillfort. The complexity of earthworks on Castle Bank is compounded by alterations caused by later agricultural use and quarrying, making confident assessment difficult. Among recent studies, Martin & Silvester(2011) state that the large bailey's Iron Age origins have been \\"convincingly argued\\", while Scourfield & Haslam(2013) surmise, on the basis of the RCAHMW report, that \\"the hill is no longer considered as having been first fortified in the Iron Age\\". ===Initial medieval activity=== Cefnllys is connected in tradition with Elystan Glodrydd, a 10th-century prince of Buellt and founder of the regional dynasty. The court of a Welsh ruler is assumed to have been sited nearby, but the time period, duration and precise location of such a llys are unresolved. In a Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust report for Cadw, Robert Silvester observed that the motte-and-bailey north of Castle Bank is considered a probable site, granting that a llys in this setting is more likely to have superseded the castle than predated it, and no physical traces have been found. A silver thumb-ring recovered on Castle Bank may date from an early medieval period of Welsh occupation, and the circular graveyard ringed by yew trees could denote a pre- Norman origin of St Michael's Church. However, there is no substantive archaeological or written evidence to support any of these claims. The timber motte-and-bailey north of Castle Bank is assumed to be the work of Ralph Mortimer of Wigmore. One of a group of Norman barons who overran the region in 1093, Ralph is credited with the construction of a castle in Maelienydd named \\"Dynyetha\\", probably between 1093 and 1095. After his death , the area was retaken by the Welsh and remained a disputed territory throughout the 12th century. Dinieithon was last documented in 1179, but was not described as a castle, suggesting that it had been destroyed, abandoned or possibly reused as a llys. English control was still far from secure when Llywelyn the Great, ruler of the ascendant Welsh state of Gwynedd, established his authority over southern Powys between 1208 and 1216, acting as protector and suzerain of the local Welsh dynasty. The historian Paul Remfry has speculated that the northern castle at Castle Bank may have been started in the period 1216–1234 under Llywelyn's direction, although it is generally considered to be a Mortimer creation. ===First masonry castle=== The death of Llywelyn in April 1240 led to an internal power struggle within Gwynedd, presenting Ralph Mortimer II with an opportunity to strengthen his position in Maelienydd. By the end of Henry III's Welsh campaign of August 1241, Ralph was in full control of the cantref and had secured submissions from the local nobility. To consolidate these gains, Ralph ordered the \\"strengthening\\" of a \\"castle in Maelienydd\\" in 1242, which in his absence was undertaken in the name of his young son Roger Mortimer. This work is identified with the north-eastern castle at Castle Bank; \\"strengthening\\" (firmavit) may imply the reconstruction of an existing castle in stone, particularly as the establishment of a castle at Cefnllys is not explicitly recorded. Subsequent primary source references to Cefnllys describe it as the \\"new castle\\". Upon Ralph's death in 1246, Cefnllys Castle is listed in a patent roll as passing into the custodianship of the crown until Roger's coming of age. Starting in 1256, a large Welsh uprising led by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the new prince of Gwynedd, caused an English military reversal across Wales. By the time a truce was signed in 1260, Cefnllys had become Roger's most advanced outpost following the loss of the neighbouring commote of Gwrtheyrnion and the castle at Builth. In late November 1262, Cefnllys was seized from Roger's constable Hywel ap Meurig by a small band of Welshmen, who entered the castle \\"by treachery\\" and took Hywel and his family captive, before sending word to Llywelyn of their success and torching the castle. In response, Roger Mortimer levied an army of Marcher lords and arrived at Cefnllys to start repairs on the walls, but was caught off guard when Llywelyn surrounded him with a larger force. After a three-week siege within the damaged and unprovisioned castle, during which Llywelyn's soldiers sacked Roger's other castles at Bleddfa and Knucklas, Roger was forced to negotiate safe passage. Llywelyn allowed the Marcher force to retreat, a chivalrous gesture probably designed to strengthen his case at future peace negotiations, before destroying the remaining defences and continuing his campaign against England. The impact of Cefnllys' fall is illustrated in a letter written to Henry III by Peter of Aigueblanche, bishop of Hereford, as he fled for Gloucester: \\"Mortimer's castle of Cefnllys has capitulated: Roger and his retinue have left unharmed. All this has led to rumour of treachery and the whole March is in terror.\\" The peace signed at the Treaty of Montgomery in September 1267 was a major success for Llywelyn, granting him formal recognition as Prince of Wales. Even though Cefnllys remained outside of his direct control and Roger Mortimer was permitted to rebuild the castle, Roger would provisionally hold the land on Llywelyn's behalf, as long as Llywelyn could demonstrate his right to it. Cefnllys, and the ambiguous clause regarding it, would become an imminent point of contention. ===Second masonry castle=== The \\"wide and deep ditch\\" separating the southern keep from the ridge concerned Llywelyn. Roger Mortimer moved quickly to refortify Castle Bank after the Treaty of Montgomery. The northern castle may have been repaired before the end of 1267, when Llywelyn wrote to Henry III complaining about the status of Cefnllys. Roger then started building a new, stronger castle on the southern side of the ridge, which Llywelyn, who interpreted the treaty as only permitting repairs to the existing castle, viewed as a provocation. Llywelyn sent a letter to Edward I on 22 July 1273 or 1274 protesting Roger's \\"new work\\", and requested that Edward prevent construction from continuing, lest he take action himself. The argument over Cefnllys was foremost among a series of territorial disputes between Llywelyn and the Marcher lords, which fed into a deteriorating climate of suspicion and distrust, further increased when Edward accepted defectors from Llywelyn's realm in 1274. The historian Robert Rees Davies has written that Llywelyn, who also faced intense financial and domestic pressure, came to suspect \\"an orchestrated attempt to undermine his hard-won gains, especially in the middle March, and to subvert the terms of the Treaty of 1267\\". These grievances escalated into Llywelyn's refusal to pay homage to Edward I in 1275 and fuelled Edward's determination to pacify the insubordinate prince, culminating in Edward's subjugation of Wales between 1277 and 1283. A morning view of Castle Bank, with the earthworks clearly visible. The ring of yew trees around the church hint at a pre-Norman foundation. The surrounding earthworks may be the site of the town. Cefnllys was not directly attacked in the ensuring conflict, but formed part of a chain of garrisoned castles encircling Llywelyn's territories, which contributed to the rebellion's suppression. Roger died in 1282 and his heir, Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer, paid for a garrison of 8 horsemen and 20 footmen throughout the second phase of fighting (1282–3). In October 1294, Cefnllys was listed as one of the castles captured by \\"Rees ap Morgan\\" during the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn, although the archaeologists Browne & Pearson have expressed uncertainty over this account. In 1306, the castle passed into the hands of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, who led an unsuccessful rebellion against Edward II which resulted in the confiscation of his holdings, including Cefnllys, in 1322. Roger returned from exile in 1326 and successfully overthrew Edward, briefly becoming de-facto ruler of England alongside Queen Isabella, until he was executed in 1330 by Edward III. Cefnllys was forfeited by the Mortimers as punishment, but returned to the family the following year. Repairs of the castle and its hall were carried out from 1356 to 1357, and at the outbreak of the Welsh uprising led by Owain Glyndŵr in 1400, Cefnllys was in temporary royal custody. Records show that it was defended by a well- provisioned force of 12 spearmen and 30 archersa detailed register of supplies sent to the castle in 1403 survives. This may have been insufficient, as a 1405 grant to Richard Grey described the lordship as \\"burned and wasted by the Welsh rebels\\", though it is unclear whether the castle itself was sacked or if the destruction was limited to its hinterland. The castle survived into the 15th century in a reparable state, but its upkeep was increasingly neglected as advances in warfare and shifting social patterns undermined its importance. The death of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, of plague in 1425 marked the end of the Mortimer male line and the castle was inherited by Edmund's nephew Richard, Duke of York, who paid for repair work and appointed officials from a new class of Welsh office-holders to manage his distant estate. Throughout the Marches, minor Welsh nobles were rising to positions of local power, and they preferred the comfort of oak courts to draughty stone castles: in the view of historian Richard Suggett, change was \\"expressed architecturally by the decay of the masonry castles... and by the building of new timber halls at or near the castle sites by the Welshmen of influence within a lordship\\". The pre- eminent mid-15th century travelling poet Lewys Glyn Cothi composed four poems regarding Cefnllys, including one which describes such a hall on Castle Bank. The poems, which survive in a manuscript from 1468 (although they probably date from 1432 to 1459), praise the Welshman Ieuan ap Phylip, who was constable of Cefnllys Castle and receiver of the lordship of Maelienydd. Ieuan had a two-storey hall built to exhibit his status and entertain guests, and, uniquely, Lewys' poetry records the name of the master carpenter as Rhosier ab Owain. The accession of Richard's son and heir, Edward, to the English throne in 1461 caused Cefnllys to become crown property. It was included in a grant of predominantly ruinous castles to Prince Arthur by Henry VII in 1493, and the antiquarian John Leland recorded that the castle was \\"now downe\\" in the first half of the 16th century. The castle was described as ruins in a 1687 deed of sale. ==Castle town== St Michael's Church The Mortimers encouraged the development of a castle town at Cefnllys in order to consolidate their hold on the surrounding land, as well as the wider cantref. The date of its establishment is unrecorded, and its existence is first documented in 1297 with the granting of a market charter. It was accorded borough status in 1304, when it possessed 25 burgesses, a church and a town mill. Records of pontage indicate the existence of a toll bridge, and a deer park was recorded in 1360. The presence of a manor at Cefnllys was highly unusual given the upland terrain, and demonstrates the Mortimers' efforts to establish manorialism in Maelienydd. Their rule was unpopular among the local Welsh, who in 1297 took their complaints to Edward I, compelling Edmund Mortimer to restore the traditional court at nearby Cymaron as an alternative to the manorial court at Cefnllys Castle. The lord's authority remained limited to the district surrounding the castle and only limited tribute, rather than rent, was extracted from the wider Welsh community. The lack of visible remains has meant the town's location has not been conclusively proven. The population may have been small enough to fit within the enclosure of Castle Bank, and supporters of this interpretation emphasise the settlement's military role as a garrison town. In this view, the stone wall surrounding Castle Bank would have formed part of the town defences. The more frequent explanation is that the settlement was concentrated around St Michael's Church, where there would have been easy access to the mill and a nearby spring. A series of earthworks surrounding the church may represent raised causeways, sunken roads and medieval house platforms, although archaeological finds have been mostly from the Tudor period or later. The church's structure is of 13th century origin, but the date of its founding is unknown and it was heavily restored in 1895. The town was small, remote and short-lived: growth stalled before 1332 and in 1383 it was recorded as having only 10 residents. Davies comments that its location, accompanying a castle site chosen for defensiveness and ability to radiate strategic power, undermined its economic viability: \\"the artificiality of [its] commercial setting was too obvious once the military opportunities... had been removed\\". The economic weakness of Cefnllys is also emphasised by historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham. Major outbreaks of bubonic plague across Britain in 1349, 1361–62 and 1369 contributed to its failure, and the persistent threat of violent conflict within the March expedited its demise. Cefnllys remained a borough after the decline of the medieval settlement, and in 1831 it comprised, besides the church and castle ruins, 16 inhabitants in \\"three Farm Houses and one small Cottage\\". == See also == * * Cefnllys (medieval town) * Maelienydd ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ==External links== * Cefnllys Castle Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales – 2006 RCAHMW report on Castle Bank, with a summary of historical context and visible earthworks. * Cefnllys site details National Monuments Record of Wales – Coflein information page with links to digital images, details of associated sites and information on archive records.

Historic forms, such as Haberberui from 1290, demonstrate that Gaelic inbhir, \\"estuary\\", has succeeded the original Brittonic element aber, with the same meaning (c.f. Welsh aber). ==History== Inverbervie appears in written history at least as far back as the 12th century AD; in a document relating to Arbroath Abbey, Simon of Inverbervie is noted as having witnessed a charter transferring the lands of Balfeith to the Abbey. The settlement was formerly a royal burgh from 1342 to 1975 and a parliamentary burgh from 1708 to 1950, the former status being conferred by David II of Scotland for hospitality he and his Queen received when shipwrecked there the previous year when returning from exile. A small harbour in the town was important in early years but despite improvements by Thomas Telford in 1819, disappeared by 1830 owing to the buildup of the shingle bar at the river mouth. The first flax spinning mill in Scotland was established here at the Haughs around 1790 and by 1910 there were nine in operation employing 500-600 workers. As a result of this, the population of the settlement peaked at over 2,500 around the turn of the 20th Century but has since declined owing the downturn in that industry. The town was within the county of Kincardineshire until 1975, when the county was merged into the Grampian Region. The Aberdeenshire unitary council area, which now includes Inverbervie, was created when the region system was eradicated in 1996. Aberdeenshire is also the name of another former county which was merged into the Grampian Region in 1975. Prominent local buildings include Hallgreen Castle, founded in 1376, standing on a bluff overlooking the sea towards the southern end of the town. ==Climate== Inverbervie has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb). ==Parliamentary burgh== Jubilee Bridge The parliamentary burgh which existed from 1708 to 1950 was a component of the Aberdeen district of burghs of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. In 1832 Inverbervie became a component of the Montrose district of burghs. In 1950 it was merged into the North Angus and Mearns constituency. North Angus and Mearns was replaced with new constituencies in 1983. With effect from the 2011 Scottish Parliamentary elections, Inverbervie will be back within the Mearns and Angus constituency, following boundary changes. Bervie Beach ==Attractions== Inverbervie has The Bervie Chipper which in 1998 was awarded the title Fish & Chip Shop of the Year 1997. ==Media== * The local newspaper is the Mearns Leader which is published by Johnson Press and edited in the neighbouring town of Stonehaven. * Bervie is served by local radio station, Mearns FM. Broadcasting from nearby Stonehaven in the Townhall, Mearns FM aims to keep Bervie up to date with local and charity events, as well as playing music. Staffed completely by volunteers, Mearns FM is run as a not for profit organisation, broadcasting under a community radio licence, with a remit to provide local focus news events and programming. Jointly funded by local adverts and local and national grants, it has one of the largest listening areas of any community radio station owing to the Mearns' distributed population. The station was set up to try to bring these distant communities together. ==Education== * Bervie Primary School serves Bervie and the surrounding rural area. The school roll is 229, but has a capacity of 342. In 2019, the school officially opened its rebuilt nursery extension. In its last HMIe inspection Bervie became a notable primary school after being highly rated and featured in a video of the top 90 primary schools in Scotland. * Mackie Academy in Stonehaven is where most teenagers attend. Mackie has a roll of 1200. ==Community groups== Bervie Church Bervie contains many prominent community groups: Bervie Church Bervie Church is part of Arbuthnott, Bervie and Kinneff Church. It is on the main street in close proximity to the school. The parish also owns the Church Centre (formerly the manse) next to the church, and the Herd Centre (formerly YWCA Hall) at the bottom of Town Head. In 2010, the Rev. Dennis Rose became the minister, and he served the congregation until June 2016. In March 2019, the Rev Andrew Morrison became the minister. He is currently the third youngest minister in the denomination. Scouting and Guiding Bervie has an active Scout group based in their church street hut. Scouts (10.5-14), Cubs (8-10.5), and Beavers (6-8) are all held. Bervie is part of the Kincardineshire Scout District. There are Guides (10-14yrs) and Rainbows (5-7yrs) who also hold meetings in the Scout Hall. The Brownies (7-10yrs) hold meetings in the Burgh Hall. The Living Rooms The Living Rooms Christian Centre and Coffee Shop is in the school car park behind the church. The Living Rooms is an evangelical centre which aims to reach out to people. The Coffee Shop is a popular centre of the community. Services of worship are held in the centre as well as prayer meetings, a youth group, and other special events. Gala and fireworks Every year the Gala Committee organise the climax of the community diary in June. As part of this event, a 'citizen of the year' and 'young citizen of the year' prizes are awarded. The fireworks display is organised and held by the caravan site every year on the Sunday nearest to Bonfire Night. ==Transport== Inverbervie has regular bus links to Stonehaven, Montrose, Aberdeen and Perth. It was served by Bervie railway station, the terminus of a branch line from Montrose, from 1865 to 1951, with freight services discontinued in 1966. ==Notable residents== * Hercules Linton, designer of the Cutty Sark clipper shipAlan Murphy, Scotland, 2004, Footprint Travel Guides, 692 pages ==See also== * List of burghs in Scotland * Aber and Inver as place-name elements * Allardice Castle * Arbuthnott, Bervie & Kinneff Parish Church ==References== Category:Towns in Aberdeenshire Category:Burghs ","title":"Inverbervie"},{"id":"2567505","text":"Kilrenny from the air Parish Church Kilrenny is a village in Fife, Scotland.

It lies west of Lockerbie, in Dumfries and Galloway. ==History== ===Etymology=== The name Loch Mhabain is possibly a corruption of Loch Mhaol Bheinn (\\"Lake on the bare mountain\\"). It is likely however, that the name Lochmaben represents the Roman name Locus Maponi. This name is Brittonic in origin, and contains the element luch, meaning \\"marshy or brackish water\\" (Welsh llwch, Gaelic loch), and the name Mapon, a deity name meaning \\"Great (divine) son or youth\\". The first part of the name could also be explained as log, an element derived from Latin locus, \\"a place\\". ===Early inhabitants=== Lochmaben has been inhabited since earliest times due to its strategic position on the routes from England to Scotland and Ireland, to the small lochs surrounding it and to the relatively fertile soil in the area. The first inhabitants may have lived in crannogs in the lochs. After the Roman departure from the area around Dumfries the locale had various forms of visit by Picts, Saxons, Scots and Danes culminating in a decisive victory over the native Britons in 890 for Giric mac Dúngail (Modern Gaelic: Griogair mac Dhunghail,Giric mac Dúngail is the Mediaeval form. known in English simply as Giric and nicknamed Mac Rath (\\"Son of Fortune\\");Skene, Chronicles, p. 87. fl. c. 878-889), who was a king of the Picts or the king of Alba, at what is now Lochmaben. ===Lords of Annandale=== The Kirk loch at sunset By 1160, the Anglo-Norman de Brus (Bruce) family had become the Lords of Annandale. Robert de Brus Lord of Skelton in the Cleveland area of Yorkshire, was a notable figure at the court of King Henry I of England, where he became intimate with Prince David of Scotland, that monarch's brother-in- law. When the Prince became King David I of Scotland, in 1124, Bruce obtained from him the Lordship of Annandale, and great possessions in the south of Scotland. (de Brus was nevertheless buried at Guisborough, the place of his birth). By the 15th century the Lordship was in the hands of Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany. Following his death in 1485 it, and the castle of Lochmaben, were annexed to the Crown by Act of Parliament dated 1 October 1487.Cokayne, G. E.,The Complete Peerage, edited by the Hon. Vicary Gibbs, vol. 1, London, 1910, p. 81. ===Castles and battles=== Lochmaben Castle ruins Lochmaben Castle in an 1886 etching At some point in the 13th century the Bruces built a castle, probably a keep, at Lochmaben, the remains of which now lie under a golf course. It is claimed that King Robert the Bruce was born there, which is why the town adopted the motto \\"E Nobis Liberator Rex\\" (\\"From us is sprung a liberator king\\") on its coat of arms. However, this claim is relatively late; it cannot be ruled out, but his birthplace was more likely Turnberry Castle. Bruce certainly battled the English over this area during the Wars of Scottish Independence. The English King Edward replaced the castle with a much sturdier structure at the south end of Castle Loch around 1300 and its remains still show the massive strength of its defences. Archibald Douglas, Lord of Galloway, with the assistance of the Earls of March and Douglas, after a siege of nine days, took Lochmaben Castle from the English and \\"razed it to the ground\\" on 4 February 1384/5. The castle and barony became a possession of the Earls of March, but when the 10th Earl was forfeited and then reinstated, in 1409, it is noted that it was \\"with the exception of the castle of Lochmaben and the Lordship of Annandale.\\" The Battle of Lochmaben Fair was fought on 22 July 1484: a force of 500 light horsemen led by Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany and James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas invaded Scotland, but were defeated. On 16 January 1508/9, at Edinburgh, Sir Robert Lauder of The Bass (d.1517/8), knight, was appointed \\"Captain and Keeper of the King's castle and fort of Lochmaben, with all pertinentes\\" and other privileges etc., for three years.The Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland edited by M. Livingstone, I.S.O., vol.1, 1488-1529, Edinburgh, 1908, number 1799, pps: 273/274. In 1605 the Depute Lieutenant of the Borders, Sir William Cranstoun of that Ilk (later 1st Lord Cranstoun), was Keeper of Lochmaben Castle.James Balfour Paul,The Scots Peerage, under 'Cranstoun' pp. 592/3. Lochmaben remained important and had a turbulent history until some time after the early 17th century by which time the castle had seen its last siege and was gradually abandoned. ===Town=== The town had prospered and become a Royal Burgh in 1447, and a Royal Charter in 1579. Its importance waned with the peace that was to become the norm, but it had sufficient resources to build a substantial Tolbooth (later the village Hall) in 1723. The town is well found with a broad main street and the town is set in rolling countryside. The railway came in 1863, with Lochmaben a stop on the Dumfries to Lockerbie line, and brought easy communication both north and south. It closed to passengers in 1952 and to freight in 1966. ==Governance== Lochmaben is in the parliamentary constituency of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, David Mundell is the current Conservative Party member of parliament. It is part of the South Scotland region in the Scottish Parliament, being in the constituency of Dumfriesshire. Oliver Mundell of the Conservatives is the MSP. Before Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents vote to elect MEP's for the Scotland constituency. ==Healthcare== Lochmaben Hospital was opened in 1905 as an infectious diseases hospital but, with the virtual demise of these diseases, it is now a modern 16-bed community facility caring for both physical and psychiatric problems. ==Education== The town has its own school: Lochmaben Primary School. ==Recreation== It also has an 18-hole golf course surrounding the Kirk loch on the edge of the town. Lochmaben has 3 main lochs: Kirk Loch, Castle Loch and the Mill Loch. It also has 2 smaller lochs: The Blind Loch and the Upper Loch. The town’s lochs thrive with both sailing and fishing taking place throughout the year. In some years in winters of prolonged frost curling has taken place on the frozen lochs, mostly the Kirk Loch. A long-distance walking route called Annandale Way running through Annandale (from the source of the River Annan to the sea) was opened in September 2009. The route passes through Lochmaben and along the bank of Castle Loch. It offers interesting walking from Lochmaben on a day walk basis. ==Economy== Arla Foods owns a factory in the town. ==Notable people== *Angus Douglas - Scottish international footballer *David Harvey (footballer) - resides in Lochmaben *William Jardine - co-founder of the Hong Kong based conglomerate Jardine, Matheson & Co *Sir William Paterson - one of the founders of the Bank of England and the main proponent of the ill-fated Darien Scheme *Maitland Pollock - professional footballer *William Wright Smith - botanist ==See also== *Lochmaben Stone *Battle of Sark ==References== ==External links== *Its page in the Gazetteer for Scotland *A summary of Lochmaben, including accommodation and activities *The Lochmaben and District Community Initiative website providing information about the community of Lochmaben and the surrounding district * The Visitation of Yorkshire, 1563/4, by William Flower, Norroy King of Arms, and edited by Charles B.

It is also the seat of the Shire of West Arthur. At the 2011 census, Darkan had a population of 490. ==History== The area was originally settled by William John Gibbs and his family in the 1860s. Gibbs established a property called \\"Darkan\\", using a local Aboriginal name which means Black Rock. The townsite developed when the Collie to Narrogin railway line was built, and in 1906, the townsite was gazetted. The town grew quickly thereafter, with a Road Board being established and numerous shops and services being established in the following years. The railway closed in the early 1990s, but the surrounding productive wool growing and mixed farming area along with tourism have ensured the town's survival. In 1928 a 12 year old girl Ivy Lewis was murdered by John Milner, who was later hanged for his crime. ==Present day== Darkan is the social and political centre in the Shire of West Arthur. The town has a roadhouse, supermarket, telecentre, golf course, shire hall, hotel, synthetic tennis courts, basketball courts, primary school and a skatepark. A more recent addition is \\"The Shed\\", a workshop mainly for the town's retirees that consists of a woodworking and a metal working area for the construction of numerous personal projects. A heritage trail (the Road Board Office, Shire Office and Pioneer Hall (1911)) has been established in the town. The town is surrounded by a fertile (lateritic/alluvial soils), high rainfall (approx 650mm per year) wheat/sheep area that makes use of a small range of services in the town and the Co-operative Bulk Handling grain storage bin about 3 km to the east. 10 km to the west is Six Mile Cottage, a very small two-room slab house built by a sleeper cutter for the railway in the early 1900s, and jarrah, flood gum and wandoo bushland reserves, filled with wildflowers in spring, are a short drive away. ==References== ==External links== * Shire of West Arthur * Albany Gateway - West Arthur (locally produced site) * SMH Travel - Darkan Category:Towns in Western Australia Category:Wheatbelt (Western Australia) Category:Grain receival points of Western Australia ","title":"Darkan, Western Australia"},{"id":"2567554","text":"Pedro Luis Serrano was a Spanish sailor who was supposed to have been marooned for seven or eight years in the sixteenth century on a small desert island.

He had no access to fresh water and lived off the blood and flesh of sea turtles and birds and was insane by the time he was rescued.Souhami, Diana (2001) Selkirk's Island, Weidenfeld & Nicolson The tale of Serrano may have been loosely based on the historical case of \\"Maestre Joan\\", who stranded on cay of what is now named Serrana Bank in 1528, and was rescued eight years later..

It was founded in 1554 as \\"The Free Grammar School of King Philip and Queen Mary\\" \\"for the education, instruction and learning of boys and young men in grammar; to be and to continue for ever.\\" After forty two years of sharing the school buildings with the boys, the newly built Girls Grammar School opened in 1957, and merged with the Boys' Grammar School in 1985. CRGS celebrated its 450th anniversary in July 2004, an event marked by the planting of a tree by Prince Andrew. The same time, Mr Stuart Holt retired as headteacher, having started in 1991. He announced his retirement in October 2003. He was succeeded by Mrs Judith Child, who was headteacher until 2018, when she announced her retirement. In September 2018, she was replaced by Mr James Keulemans; a former international rugby player. After becoming a Grant Maintained School in September 1991, Clitheroe Royal Grammar School became a Foundation School with a Foundation under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Most recently, on 1 January 2011, the school converted to Academy School Status under the Academies Act 2010. Clitheroe Royal Grammar School continues to thrive on two sites, with the Sixth Form Centre occupying the historic buildings on York Street, and the Main School at the former Girls' Grammar School buildings on Chatburn Road. ==Intake== The Main School intake each year is 150 children, who have each reached the required standard in the school's entrance examination, with places being offered preferentially to candidates living within the school's defined 'Catchment Area'. Pupils are then divided into five forms, named after the initials of the form tutor, and each assigned a house (C, R, G, S and T). This means the pupil population at Main School is about 720 (150 in each of the first four years, and 120 in the last). This will eventually reach 750 total pupils in 2020 (150 in each of the five years) Sixth Form entry is based on GCSE performance and takes in around 330 students per year. The matriculation requirements are five grade Bs at GCSE, with at least a Grade C in English Language and Mathematics, while some subjects also require specific grades in related GCSE subjects.http://www.crgs.org.uk/sixth- form/admissions/ ==Sixth form== York Street Building The school was originally based at St Mary's churchyard, and was moved to the York Street site in 1814, in rooms that are now used to teach Art and Foreign Languages. The school was extended in 1878, and again in 1914, to include what is now the Library. In 2009, the site was extended further to create more classrooms and a conference room. The sixth form centre has a wider selection of courses and is one of the largest sixth forms in the United Kingdom. ==Commemoration Day== Every year the school holds a commemoration day to remember the founding of the school, on St. John the Baptist's Day in the local parish church of Mary Magdalene. From the Statutes, dated 1622: : We ordaine and be yt a Statute of this Schoole for ever. That from henceforth once every year upon St John Baptists day called Midsommer day in the forenoone there shalbee a Sermon preached in the Church of Clitherow where the Maister Usher and Schoolers of the said Schoole shalbee p'sent before the Governors of the said Schoole and therein shalbee a comemoracon of the foundation of the said Schoole with an exhortation to the said Governors Schoolmr and Usher that they faithfully and diligently p'forme their duties. Or, modernised: : Let this be a Statute of this school forever. Every year upon St John the Baptist's day (Midsummer's day) in the morning there shall be a Sermon preached in Clitheroe Church where the Master Usher and Scholars of the School shall be sent before the Governors the School and there shall be a commemoration of the foundation of the School with an exhortation to the Governors, Headteacher and Usher that they faithfully and diligently perform their duties. ==Language College bid== After failing in the bid to become a Technology College, a language college committee was set up at CRGS in the autumn term of 2005, seeking to get specialist Language College status for the school. The bid was successful, and the school now receives extra funding for expansions and developments into further language areas. As a result of the new status, taster courses in Mandarin, Urdu and Russian were being held, which were intended to be extended to the local community. This is no longer the case. The building programme has been completed, and contains four classrooms and two store rooms. In 2008, the school was awarded the Foundation International School Award in 2008 and the Full Award in 2009, recognising the outstanding work with partner schools in France, Germany, Spain and Italy. The school still runs annual exchange trips to the partner schools in both Germany and France, as well as several foreign visits for music and sport, including the annual Isle of Man visit for Year 7 pupils. The school no longer holds such a status, with the classification now being abandoned as of 2010. ==School newspaper== The school newspaper, the Royal Blazer, was printed three times a year until 2006. The paper was distributed within school free of charge, and was put up for sale in the local area. Pupils were encouraged to contribute articles on subjects important to them and the local community. There is set to be a new version of the paper published sometime before the end of the academic year. ==Notable former pupils== * Sir William Addison (1905-1992), historian and author * William Blezard (born 1921), composer * Pattie Coldwell (1952-2002), television presenter and journalist * Bryan Cowgill (1927-2008), senior BBC TV executive who devised Grandstand and Match of the Day, Controller of BBC1 from 1974 to 1977 * Martin Dobson (born 1948), footballer for Burnley and England * Ross Eccles (born 1937), contemporary artist * Peter Hargreaves (born 1946), co- founder of Hargreaves Lansdown * Judith Hart, Baroness Hart of South Lanark DBE PC, (1924-1991), senior Labour Party politician, MP for Lanark and Clydesdale * Michael Hindley (born 1947), Labour MEP from 1984 to 1994 of Lancashire East, and from 1994-9 of Lancashire South * Captain James King (1750–1784), Royal Navy officer who saw service on Captain Cook's third voyage * Samantha Murray (born 1989), modern pentathlon London 2012 Silver Olympic Medalist * Norman Myers, environmentalist * Dixon Robinson (1795-1878), Lancashire Lawyer, Steward of the Honor of Clitheroe, Landowner, Limeburner, and Philanthropist, resident of Clitheroe Castle. * Thomas Starkie \\"School, Clitheroe Grammar.\\" (1782-1849), lawyer and jurist * Jon Schofield (born 1985), Kayak K2 200m London 2012 Bronze Medalist, 2016 Olympic silver medallist. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Clitheroe *List of English and Welsh endowed schools (19th century) ==References== ==External links== * Clitheroe Royal Grammar School - Official Website * Ofsted - Recent Ofsted Report *League Table Results - Latest results for 2009 Category:1554 establishments in England Category:Academies in Lancashire Category:Educational institutions established in the 1550s Category:Grammar schools in Lancashire * Category:Schools in Clitheroe ","title":"Clitheroe Royal Grammar School"},{"id":"2567563","text":"Ahmet Necip Fazıl Kısakürek (May 26, 1904 - May 25, 1983) was a Turkish poet, novelist, playwright, and Islamist ideologue. He is also known simply by his initials NFK. He was noticed by the French philosopher Henri Bergson, who later became his teacher. ==Biography== Necip Fazıl in 1916 In his own words, he was born in \\"a huge mansion in Çemberlitaş, on one of the streets descending towards Sultanahmet\\" in 1904. His father was Abdülbaki Fazıl Bey who held several posts including deputy judge in Bursa, public prosecutor in Gebze and finally, judge in Kadıköy. His mother was an emigree from Crete. He was raised at the Çemberlitaş mansion of his paternal grandfather Kısakürekzade Mehmed Hilmi Efendi of Maraş; he was named after his great- grandfather Ahmed Necib, as well as his father, Fazıl. He studied in many schools during his primary education, including the French School in Gedikpaşa, Robert College of Istanbul, as well as the Naval School. He received religious courses from Ahmed Hamdi of Akseki and science courses from Yahya Kemal at the Naval School but he was actually influenced by İbrahim Aşkî, whom he defined to have \\"penetrated into deep and private areas in many inner and outer sciences from literature and philosophy to mathematics and physics\\". İbrahim Aşkî provided his first contact with Sufism even at a \\"plan of skin over skin\\". \\"After completing candidate and combat classes\\" of Naval School, Kısakürek entered the Philosophy Department of Darülfünûn and graduated from there (1921–1924). One of his closest friends in philosophy was Hasan Ali Yücel. He studied in Paris for one year with the scholarship provided by the Ministry of National Education (1924–1925), until the scholarship was cancelled. After returning home in 1926, he worked at Holland, Osmanlı and İş Banks (1926–1939), and gave lectures at the Faculty of Linguistics and History and Geography and the State Conservatoire in Ankara and the Academy of Fine Arts in İstanbul (1939–1942). Having established a relation with the press in his youth, Kısakürek quit civil service to earn his living from writing and magazines. Necip Fazıl's life took a turn in 1934, when he met Abdülhakim Arvasi, a sheik of the Sufi Naqshbandi order. He became one of his most notable disciples, remaining a follower until the sheik's death in 1943. Appropriating his anti-semitic ideas from Europe, Kısakürek regarded Jews as the corrupting element within Western civilization, and described them as the originator of Marxism and capitalism. He held them responsible for the early conflicts between Muslims and the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Kısakürek's publications included the Turkish translation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and praise for Henry Ford's The International Jew, as well as a political program in which he wrote: “Chief among these treacherous and insidious elements to be cleansed are the Dönmes and the Jews.\\"Marc David Baer. \\"An Enemy Old and New: The Dönme, Anti- Semitism, and Conspiracy Theories in the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic\\". Jewish Quarterly Review 103.4 (2013): pp. 523–555. Project MUSE. Web. 12 Aug. 2014. Necip Fazıl was awarded the First Prize of C.H.P. Play Contest in 1947 with his play Sabır Taşı (Stone of Patience). Kısakürek was awarded the titles of \\"Great Cultural Gift\\" by the Ministry of Culture (25 May 1980) and \\"Greatest Living Poet of Turkish\\" by the Foundation of Turkish Literature upon the 75th anniversary of his birth. Necip Fazıl Kısakürek died on 25 May 1983 in his house at Erenköy after an illness that \\"lasted long but did not impair his intellectual activity and writing\\" and was buried in the graveyard at the Eyüp Cemetery on the ridge of Eyüp after an eventful funeral. ==Islamist nationalist ideology== Kısakürek sought to replace the Kemalist secular notion of nationalism by an Islamist one. Within Turkish Islamism, he represented the concept of \\"Islamization from above\\" through the capture of government. Since the late 1970s, Kısakürek has been an icon for Turkish Islamists. Many cadres of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) have been inspired by his rhetoric, including Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who met Kısakürek while still a student and attended his funeral at the start of his political career. ==Literary career== In his own words, having \\"learned to read and to write from his grandfather in very young ages\\", Kısakürek became \\"crazy about limitless, trivia reading\\" until the age of twelve starting from \\"groups of sentences belonging to lower class writers of the French\\" Having been involved in literature with such a reading passion, Necip Fazıl states that his \\"poetry started at the age of twelve\\" and that his mother said \\"how much I would like you to be a poet\\" by showing the \\"poetry notebook of a girl with tuberculosis\\" lying on the bed next to his mother's bed when he went to visit her staying at the hospital, and adds: \\"My mother's wish appeared to me as something that I fed inside but I was not aware of until twelve. The motive of existence itself. I decided inside with my eyes on the snow hurling on the window of the hospital room and the wind howling; I will be a poet! And I became\\". The first published poem of Necip Fazıl is \\"Kitabe\\", a poem that was later included in his book Örümcek Ağı (Spider Web) with the title \\"Bir Mezar Taşı\\"(A Gravestone); it was also published in the Yeni Mecmua (New Magazine) dated 1 July 1923. By 1939, his poems and articles were appearing in magazines such as Yeni Mecmua, Milli Mecmua, Anadolu, Hayat and Varlık, and Cumhuriyet newspaper. After returning home from Paris in 1925, Necip Fazıl stayed in Ankara intermittently. On his third visit, he published a magazine called Ağaç on 14 March 1936 by providing the support of some banks. Ağaç, the writers of which included Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar, Ahmet Kutsi Tecer and Mustafa Şekip Tunç, decided to follow a spiritualist and idealist line on the contrary to the materialist and Marxian ideas supported by the writers such as Burhan Belge, Vedat Nedim Tör, Şevket Süreyya Aydemir and İsmail Husrev Tökin of closed Kadro magazine owned by Yakup Kadri and which influenced the intellectuals of the time greatly. Kısakürek later transferred to Ağaç (Tree) magazine published during six volumes in Ankara to İstanbul, however, unable to establish a viable reader base, the magazine was closed at the 17th volume. Necip Fazıl next began to publish the magazine called Büyük Doğu (Great East). Starting in 1943, the magazine was published intermittently as weekly, daily and monthly. In 1978, he was prosecuted because of his controversial articles and publications and the magazine was forced to close. Necip Fazıl also published a political humor magazine called Borazan (Bugle), of which only three volumes were published. ==Bibliography== ===Poetry=== * Örümcek Ağı (1925) (Spider Web) * Kaldırımlar (1928) (Pavements) * Ben ve Ötesi (1932) (Me and Beyond) * Sonsuzluk Kervanı (1955) (Caravan of Infinity) * Çile I (1962) (Anguish I) * Şiirlerim (My poems) (1969) * Esselâm (1973) (Welcome) * Çile II (1974) (Anguish II) * Bu Yağmur (This Rain) * Canım İstanbul (My Dear Istanbul) ===Novels=== * Aynadaki Yalan (1980) (The Lie in the Mirror) * Kafa Kağıdı (1984-Published as a series in Milliyet newspaper) ===Stories=== * Birkaç Hikâye Birkaç Tahlil (1932) (Some Stories and Some Analyses) * Ruh Burkuntularından Hikayeler (1964) (Stories From Soul Shatters) * Hikâyelerim (1970) (My Stories) ===Memoirs=== * Cinnet Mustatili (1955) (Rectangle of the Possessed) * Hac (1973) (Hajj) * O ve Ben (1974) (He and I) * Bâbıâli (1975) (The Sublime Porte) ===Plays=== * Bir Adam Yaratmak (To Create A Man) * Tohum (Seed) * Reis Bey (Mr. Judge) * Para (Money) * Sabır Taşı (Stone of Patience) * Ahşap Konak (Wooden Mansion) * Kanlı Sarık (Bloody Turban) * Püf Noktası (The Thin Line) * İbrahim Ethem * Yunus Emre * Abdülhamin Han (Abdulhamid Khan) * Mukaddes Emanet (The Holy Escrow) * Siyah Pelerinli Adam (The Man With Black Cloak) * Parmaksız Salih (Fingerless Salih) ==See also== * List of contemporary Turkish poets ==References== * Biyografi.net - Biography of Necip Fazıl Kısakürek * Antoloji.com - Necip Fazıl Kısakürek : Selected poetry * Biyografi.info - Biography of Necip Fazıl Kısakürek * Yrd.Doç.Dr.Adem Çalışkan, “Necip Fazıl Kısakürek’in ‘Çile’ Adlı Şiiri ve Çözümlemesi / Necip Fazıl Kısakürek's Poem ‘Çile’ (Anguish) and Its Analysis\\", Uluslararası Sosyal Araştırmalar Dergisi / The Journal of International Social Research, Volume: 9, Issue: 42, February 2016, pp. 68–107. ==External links== * Necipfazil.com - A website dedicated to Necip Fazıl Kısakürek * Necip Fazıl Kısakürek's Life and Works * Necip Fazıl Kısakürek * * Listen NFK Category:1904 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Turkish male poets Category:Turkish male writers Category:Turkish anti-communists Category:Turkish Islamists Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Burials at Eyüp Cemetery Category:20th-century Turkish poets Category:Antisemitism in Turkey Category:Islamic nationalism ","title":"Necip Fazıl Kısakürek"},{"id":"2567577","text":"The Dulce River (in Spanish Río Dulce, in Quechua Misky Mayu) is the most important river in the Argentine province of Santiago del Estero. The Dulce River's source is in Tucumán Province under the name of Salí River, though it receives tributaries from Salta Province, and changes names when reaching Santiago del Estero. It runs southeast throughout the province, and then feeds the Río Hondo in Córdoba Province before emptying into the Mar Chiquita salt lake. There is also a dam in the limit with Tucumán Province called Río Hondo dam, with a lake formatted with the connection of four rivers of Tucumán. This lake is experiencing pollution due to the lack of control of the emissions of polluting substances into the Salí River, caused mainly by the pulpmills located in Tucumán.

The Los Quiroga Dam in the northwest, finished in 1956, provides water for that area, but has produced a decrease in the precipitations of the southeastern part of the province. == References == Category:Rivers of Argentina Category:Rivers of Santiago del Estero Province Category:Ramsar sites in Argentina ","title":"Dulce River (Argentina)"},{"id":"2567578","text":"WHPX-TV, virtual channel 26 (UHF digital channel 28), is an Ion Television owned-and-operated station licensed to New London, Connecticut, United States and serving the Hartford–New Haven television market. The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WHPX-TV's offices are located in New London, and its transmitter is located on Rattlesnake Mountain in Farmington, Connecticut. WHPX-TV's facilities also serve as the main studio for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) purposes for sister stations WPXQ-TV and WLWC in Providence, Rhode Island. ==History== The station began operation on September 15, 1986 as independent station WTWS, with transmitter in the Oakdale neighborhood of Montville near Lake Konomoc. It was owned by C&S; Broadcasting with majority owner Neil Denenberg and ran a low-budget general entertainment format. In 1988, the station took over some programming from WHCT-TV (channel 18, now Univision affiliate WUVN) as a result of that station's financial problems. In 1990, the station also began to acquire programming that WTXX (channel 20, now WCCT-TV) chose not to renew. It also offered to pick up WTXX's programming inventory in 1992, but WTXX's owner (Renaissance Broadcasting) declined. The station had added more infomercials to its lineup by 1993. Two years later, it was sold to Paxson Communications, and switched to Paxson's standard schedule of religious programming in the morning, infomercials in the afternoon and evenings, and worship programming overnight after affiliating with inTV. The rights to its programming were acquired by LIN Television, which placed those shows on WTVU (channel 59, now WCTX). Paxson then began programming WHCT in 1997, and sold WTWS to Roberts Broadcasting. Roberts, in turn, sold the station to DP Media the following year. However, DP Media was owned by—and named for—Devon Paxson, son of Paxson Communications founder Bud Paxson. Paxson then cut its ties with WHCT and took control of WTWS. The station then affiliated with Pax TV (the predecessor to Ion Television) that year, and changed its call letters to WHPX-TV to reflect its affiliation. Paxson bought DP Media in 2000. From 2001 until 2005, WHPX re-aired newscasts produced by NBC owned-and-operated station WVIT (channel 30). ==Digital television== RabbitEars TV Query for WHPX ===Analog-to-digital conversion=== WHPX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 26, on February 17, 2009, to conclude the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.List of Digital Full-Power Stations The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 34 to channel 26.

His books on pagan subjects are published under the pseudonym Géza von Neményi. Active in Germany's neopagan scene since the early 1980s, he founded the Heidnische Gemeinschaft which attracted media attention and controversy in that decade. After leaving the organization, he founded the Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft in 1991. Nahodyl has also been involved in local politics for several parties, most recently Alternative for Germany. == Early life == Árpád von Nahodyl was born in Cologne, West Germany. He grew up in West Berlin. He has a degree in visual communication from the Berlin University of the Arts. == Pagan revivalism == In 1982, he advertised for people interested in studying mythology and performing pagan rites. A small group was formed. Due to the isolation of West Berlin, the group came to study local history and tried to localize historical cult sites in the city. The group had a romantic conception of paganism. It characterized it as a nature religion and treated witchcraft as a synonym for folk religion. The group was eventually formalized as the Heidnische Gemeinschaft (Pagan Community). In the mid-1980s, the group came to the attention of journalists, who called it a cult and associated it with the 1978 Jonestown mass murder. City officials, church officials and newspapers such as Bild-Zeitung (24 February 1984) and Der Spiegel (7 January 1985) alleged that the group was based on Nazi ideology, due to its Germanic imagery and interest in German history. The group was not specifically political, although some members did maintain far- right contacts. Nahodyl, under his pseudonym Géza von Neményi, began to appear in public at events in an attempt to explain what the group was about. Journalists, politicians and other neopagans associated Neményi with Ariosophy and blood and soil ideology, so the group remained controversial in the German mainstream. Having left the Heidnische Gemeinschaft, Neményi founded the organization Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft (GGG) in 1991. The GGG took its name from Germany's first neopagan organization, which had been founded by Ludwig Fahrenkrog before World War I and became defunct in 1964. The practices of Neményi's GGG have included recitations of hymns from the Rigveda and belief in reincarnation. The organization has also been influenced by Theosophy and New Age, from which it absorbed Gnosticism and neoshamanism. In 2003, Neményi became the centre of a controversy when he launched himself as the highest authority for all \\"traditional pagans\\" in the country. He gave himself the title Allsherjargode, derived from the medieval Icelandic title allsherjargoði. Neményi argued that this institution would solve the problems caused by the failures to establish an umbrella organization for German pagans. The move was met with fierce resistance within the German neopagan scene. Among the books he has written under the name Géza von Neményi are Heidnische Naturreligion. Altüberlieferte Glaubensvorstellungen, Riten und Bräuche (1988), Heidentum und NS-Ideologie (1997) and Heilige Runen. Zauberzeichen des Nordens (2004). ==Political activity== In the 1980s, Nahodyl was a board member for the Berlin section of the Green Party. In 1985, he along with his brother came under investigation during a purge of party members with far-right sympathies. Both brothers denied having any such sympathies, but were still expelled from the party. After this Nahodyl was active in the Social Democratic Party for a period. In 2014, he was a candidate for Alternative for Germany in the local elections in Bad Belzig. ==See also== * Heathenry (new religious movement) * Neopaganism in German- speaking Europe ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== : : : : : : ==Further reading== : ==External links== *Allsherjargode website Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from Berlin Category:German neopagans Category:Neopagan writers Category:Founders of neopagan movements Category:Adherents of Germanic neopaganism Category:20th-century German writers Category:21st-century German writers Category:German non-fiction writers Category:Alliance 90/The Greens politicians Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Alternative for Germany politicians ","title":"Árpád von Nahodyl"},{"id":"2567586","text":"A fresco portrait of a man holding a papyrus roll, Pompeii, Italy, 1st century AD In Roman law, status describes a person's legal status. The individual could be a Roman citizen (status civitatis), unlike foreigners; or he could be free (status libertatis), unlike slaves; or he could have a certain position in a Roman family (status familiae) either as head of the family (pater familias), or as a lower member (filii familias). == Status civitatis == In the Roman state, according to Roman civil law (ius civile), only Roman citizens had the full civil and political rights. In regard to status civitatis, in the Roman state, there were cives, Latini and peregrini, and foreigners. Outside the Roman state, there were externi, barbari and hostes. == Status familiae == Status familiae is the legal status of an individual in the family. The pater familias had the authority in the family (patria potestas), and everyone was subjected to him based on adgnatio (kinship only from father's side). This had an impact in private law. There is a distinction between alieni iuris (persons under patria potestas) and sui iuris (persons autonomous of patria potestas, who could only be the pater familias himself). Filius familias had ius suffragii and ius honorum, but in the area of private law he was restricted because of patria potestas. == Status libertatis == The social and legal status of slaves in the Roman state was different in different epochs. In the time of old civil law (ius civile Quiritium) slavery had a patriarchal shape (a slave did the same job and lived under the same conditions as his master and family). After Rome's victorious wars, from the 3rd century BC, huge numbers of slaves came to Rome, and that resulted in slave trade and increased exploitation of slaves. From that time on, a slave became only a thing (res)- servi pro nullis habentur. ===Legal status=== The legal state of slaves was based on the fact that the slave was not a subject but an object of law. A master had the right of ownership over the slave. He could sell him, give him in pawn but certainly could not harm or kill him. If someone injured his slave, a master could initiate legal proceedings and demand protection. The ownership over the slave was called dominica potestas, and not dominium like the ownership of objects and animals. In the Roman legal system, a slave did not have a family. His sexual relationships with other slaves was not marriage (matrimonium), but a cohabitation without legal consequences (contubernium). Masters could also give over a certain amount of property (such as land, buildings), known as peculium, to a slave for his management and use. This peculium was protected under Roman law and inaccessible by the owner. This was another tool slaves could use to purchase their freedom. === Means of becoming a slave=== The oldest means of becoming a slave was to be captured as an enemy in war. However, even a foreigner could become free again and even a Roman citizen could become a slave. Slavery was hereditary, and the child of a slave woman became a slave no matter who the father was. However, according to classical law, a child of a slave became free (ingenuus), if his or her mother was free, even for a short period of time, during the pregnancy. There were a number of means by which a free man could become a slave in Roman society. *According to Twelve Tables: ::Æris confessi rebusque iure iudicatis XXX dies iusti sunto. ::A person who admits to owing money or has been adjudged to owe money must be given 30 days to pay. ::Post deinde manus iniectio esto. In ius ducito. Ni iudicatum facit aut quis endo eo in iure vindicit, secum ducito, vincito aut nervo aut compedibus XV pondo, ne maiore aut si volet minore vincito. Si volet suo vivito, ni suo vivit, qui eum vinctum habebit, libras faris endo dies dato. Si volet, plus dato. ::After that, the creditor can lay hands on him and haul him to court. If he does not satisfy the judgment and no one is surety for him, the creditor may take the defendant with him in stocks or chains... *Also citizens involved in the false presentation of slavery for benefit could become slaves. If a free man were sold as a slave, then after proving that he is free he shared proceeds from the sale with the party that sold him. A praetor could deprive the seller of his freedom (vindicatio in libertatem). *Convicts (most of them sentenced to death), could become slaves and their property would belong to state. *A female Roman citizen could become a slave (under senatus consultum Claudianum form 52) if she had \\"mutual living\\" (contubernium) with another man's slave despite the master's objection. === Termination of slave status === After the Punic wars, Rome started the mass exploitation of slaves. However, the development of industry, trade and other branches of economy required skilled free workers that took interest in their jobs. A slave could get free by the act of manumission, by which a master would release him from his authority. Manumissions were different in different epochs. The old civil law (ius civile Quiritium) recognized three kinds of manumissions: *Manumissio censu, was done by a master in the time of the Centuriate assembly. A master wishing to free his slave needed only to enter him in the censor's list as a citizen. *Manumissio vindicta, was the liberation of a slave by a fictitious plea for freedom (vindicatio in libertatem). It was done before a magistrate when some citizen (adsertor libertatis) touched a slave by a stick (vindicta), and by right words said that the slave is a free man. If a master did not object to that claim (in iure cessio), a magistrate would validate the slave's freedom (addictio). This had been done under the old civil law (ius civile Quiricium) *Manumissio testamento, was the liberation of a slave by a will. In a will master usually said \\"Stichus servus meus liber esto\\", and the slave would be free and without patron. **Manumissio testamento fideicommissaria, was when a master asked his successor to release a slave. If that slave was made free, the man who released him became his patron. *Manumissio inter amicos, was liberation of a slave by a statement in front of friends. Praetors protected these free slaves (by the Lex Junia Norbana, these people lived as free but died as slaves). This kind of manumission originated at the end of the republic. **Manumissio per epistulam, same as above, just done by a statement in a letter. *Manumissio per mensam was similar to the above manumissions. This one was not as formal as manumissions in time of old civil law, but had the same value as praetoric manumissions. Manumissions of this kind originated in the time of empire. *Manumissio in ecclesia, were manumissions made in the time of Christian emperors in front of a priest. At the beginning of the empire, because of the number of manumissions, legal limitations of manumissions were made. These limitations were implemented by two laws: Lex Fufia Caninia and Lex Aelia Sentia. According to Roman law, slaves that were freed (libertinus, in regard to his master libertus) became Roman citizens, but they had many fewer rights than Roman citizens that were born free (ingenuus). The slave's former master now became his patron (patronus), and the libertus still had obligations towards him (this was regulated by law). The libertus had to be obedient and respectful to his patron (obsequium et reverentia). The patron could punish a disobedient libertus, In older times he could even kill him (ius vitae necisque), but later he could not. In some circumstances he could even ask a magistrate to turn the libertus into a slave once again (accusatio ingrati). ==References== ==External links== *The Roman Law Library *Symbols Status Civitatis Category:Roman law ","title":"Status in Roman legal system"},{"id":"2567593","text":"Apodiscus is a genus of trees belonging to the family Phyllanthaceae first described as a genus in 1912.

It was officially founded on June 8, 1914 but World War I caused its official activities to begin only in 1935. It was founded at the headquarters of the Brazilian Federation of Rowing Societies (Federação Brasileira das Sociedades de Remo) as an initiative from the Metropolitan League of Athletic Sports (Liga Metropolitana de Esportes Atléticos). The BOC has multiple sources of income, but its principal means of funding is its 2% share of all the profits from the Brazilian National Lottery and other games of chance. The BOC is presided by Paulo Wanderley Teixeira, and its principal project is the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro. ==Attributions== The BOC is responsible for enrolling Brazilian athletes in every Olympic Games. The policy used by the institution is the \\"meritorious inclusion\\". This means that the BOC does not hold Olympic Trials; all Brazilian athletes that meet the requirements set forth by their sport's International Federation for participation in the Games are automatically enrolled by the BOC in their respective Olympic event -- if the country has a limited number of berths in any given event in the Games and the number of athletes meeting the criteria for qualification exceeds it, the BOC will then respect the official rankings of the sport, or any other criterion used by the sport's Federation for ranking purposes, and enroll the top ranked athletes to the limit of berths assigned to the country in the Games. National teams may qualify through pre- Olympic tournaments and/or international events that award berths in the Games; individual athletes, depending on their sport, may also qualify by achieving a certain minimum performance or time for the Games (e.g. in Swimming, where athletes qualify when they swim their event in a certain time). The BOC has a policy of never requesting \\"inclusion berths\\" in the Olympic Games: every country's Olympic Committee is entitled to request that the International Olympic Committee include athletes of that nationality in events to which they had not qualified, so long as the country in question had no athletes qualified when it had a right to enroll athletes in any given event; any national Olympic Committee may also request those berths if it has not reached the number of athletes that it had been assigned, which would cause the Olympic draws to diminish. As an example, if no Brazilian athletes were to succeed in qualifying for the Olympic Weightlifting event, then no Brazilian athlete will participate in the given Olympics, because the BOC will not request the enrollment of any athlete that has not achieved qualification on his or her own merit. This could be observed, for instance, in the Weightlifting event of the 2004 Summer Games, when no Brazilian athlete participated, even though the BOC could have requested a special inclusion for representation purposes. ===Olympic bids=== The Brazilian Olympic Committee submitted official bids to host the Olympic Games. In Brazil, the BOC is the final authority for submitting a bid, and no Brazilian city may bid without BOC endorsement. Brasília made a bid for 2000, but withdrew early before the final election. The city of Rio de Janeiro had been the preferred candidate, having made bids for 1936, 2004 and 2012. The Rio bid was eventually accepted in 2009 to host the 2016 Summer Olympics on its fourth bid submission. In 2004, when it was time to submit the bids for the 2012 games (ultimately awarded to London, Great Britain), the city of São Paulo contested the automatic choice of Rio de Janeiro as the natural Brazilian candidate. São Paulo insisted that it could produce a bid that would be more competitive than that of Rio de Janeiro. The BOC could only submit one national bid and decided to settle the issue internally, by a vote of all registered members of the BOC. Both cities were required to present their bid for the Games (as if it were being presented to the IOC members) for evaluation by the delegates voting. The result was a landslide in favor of Rio de Janeiro, and the BOC then submitted the city's bid for the Games. In 2017, The International Olympic Committee provisionally suspended Carlos Arthur Nuzman, president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, in a vote-buying case to guarantee Rio de Janeiro as city host of the 2016 Summer Olympics. ==Confederations== The national Confederations whose sports are part of the Olympic Program are directly linked to the BOC, but the entity also works with many \\"Associated Confederations\\", which are those whose sports are not part of the Olympic Program in the present. ===Directly linked=== * Brazilian Archery Confederation * Brazilian Associated Fighting Styles Confederation * Brazilian Athletics Confederation * Brazilian Aquatic Sports Confederation * Brazilian Badminton Confederation * Brazilian Baseball and Softball Confederation † * Brazilian Basketball Confederation * Brazilian Boxing Confederation * Brazilian Canoeing Confederation * Brazilian Ice Sports Federation * Brazilian Cycling Confederation * Brazilian Equestrian Confederation * Brazilian Fencing Confederation * Brazilian Football Confederation * Brazilian Snow Sports Confederation * Brazilian Grass and Indoor Hockey Confederation * Brazilian Gymnastics Confederation * Brazilian Handball Confederation * Brazilian Judo Confederation * Brazilian Modern Pentathlon Confederation * Brazilian Rowing Confederation * Brazilian Basketball Confederation * Brazilian Sailing and Motors Sports Confederation * Brazilian Shooting Confederation * Brazilian Taekwondo Confederation * Brazilian Table Tennis Confederation * Brazilian Tennis Confederation * Brazilian Triathlon Confederation * Brazilian Volleyball Confederation * Brazilian Weightlifting Confederation † In June 2005, the International Olympic Committee announced that both Baseball and Softball would be excluded from the Olympic Program as of the 2012 Summer Olympics, to be held in London, United Kingdom.

He became a prolific philatelic author, especially on English, Irish and Scottish postmarks and also produced popular Postal History Annuals and island series books. He wrote some 200 books and at least 10,000 articles. Mackay's interest in the postal history of St Kilda had been formed during his time stationed there during his army service in the 1950s. == Theft from the British Museum == In 1972 Mackay was dismissed from his job as an assistant keeper at the British Museum in London after he was convicted at the Old Bailey of stealing valuable proof stamps.\\"Writer in disgrace as book halted by publisher\\" Stephen Breen & Catherine Lockerbie, The Scotsman. He had pleaded guilty to five charges of stealing progressive proofs on loan from the Crown Agents from the Museum in 1965 and 1966 and was fined £1000.

He then turned to biography, where he was less successful. Through the 1980s he worked on a biography of Robert Burns which was published in 1992 to favourable reviews and which won the Saltire Society Book of the Year Award. Subsequent biographies of Allan Pinkerton and William Wallace received more mixed reviews. 1996 saw the release of Michael Collins: A Life, a work about the life of the famed Irish revolutionary which received excellent reviews. Mackay also wrote books under a number of different pseudonyms, including Ian Angus, William Finlay, Bruce Garden, Alex Matheson and Peter Whittington.Author PseudonymsInternational Who's Who of Authors, 2004, p.356 ==Accusations of plagiarism== In 1998, he published a biography of Alexander Graham Bell. It was on the market briefly before Robert V. Bruce published a damning indictment, detailing sustained plagiarism of his own work, Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude. Far from being a little-known work, the latter had in fact been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1973. The indictment, published in the American Historical Association's house journal, counted instances of plagiarism on 80 percent of the pages published. Mackay paid his publishers to withdraw the book from circulation, and Bruce agreed not to sue.Robert V.

While initially well received, and the subject of flattering reviews in the trade press, it was soon discovered that it was practically a copy of what those same reviews had marked as the last work on the man, that by Samuel Eliot Morison in 1942. That biography too had won the Pulitzer.

It began serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh in 2002. In 2005, the manga was adapted into an anime television series and a PlayStation 2 video game. Three original video animation (OVA) episodes were later released from February to April 2007. Another two-episode OVA project titled Strawberry Marshmallow Encore was released in 2009. There is an unrelated manga titled . ==Plot== ===Themes=== According to the manga, Strawberry Marshmallow is set in Hamamatsu, Japan. Seasons play an important role throughout Strawberry Marshmallow as the characters are involved in many normal seasonal activities. The series is speckled with many small, music- related allusions, such as Ana's dog Frusciante being named after John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while episode eight of the anime sees two goldfish called Richard and James. The title itself was inspired from \\"Mashimaro\\", a single by Japanese rock artist Tamio Okuda.Cover of The Strawberry Marshmallow Drama CD Volume 3. The characters, from left to right, are: Nobue, Miu, Matsuri, Ana, Chika, and Satake (the dog). ===Characters=== ; : :Nobue is the eldest main character. She is Chika's older sister and usually has final authority on all matters. She often tries to \\"borrow\\" money from Chika to buy cigarettes. Nobue is perpetually searching for a part-time job to earn money for more cigarettes to calm her nicotine addiction. :The story suggests that Nobue derives some kind of sensual pleasure from watching the girls do cute things. In this respect, Nobue appears to appreciate the moe aesthetic. It is seen during the anime that Nobue prefers Matsuri and Ana over Chika and Miu. :The Nobue character changed from the manga to the anime. In the manga, she is a sixteen-year-old high school freshman,Nobue: \\"By the way, my name is Nobue Ito. I'm 16. Just your average, every-day high school freshman.\\" Strawberry Marshmallow (in English) vol.1 p.5 while in the anime she is a twenty-year-old junior-college student. Her age is presumably changed because of her smoking and drinking habit, both becoming legal in Japan at age twenty. In the first episode of the anime, she initially introduces herself as a sixteen-year-old, intended to be a joke as she quickly states that she is really twenty. She tends to act somewhat less mature in her manga incarnation, doing things such as tricking Matsuri into thinking that Miu is dead. Her appearance changes radically in the early stages of the manga, especially her hair, which goes from blond to dark brown (and is black in the anime). ; : :Chika is one of two twelve-year-olds in the story. Chika is the same age as Miu, and attends the same class as her neighbor Miu. Chika is a cheerful girl who shows more common sense than the other girls, especially Miu. Her main role in the series is that of an average, twelve-year-old girl, which is emphasized in the first manga volume, where Nobue describes Chika as specializing 'in being totally generic'. Her special skill is cooking, especially baking cookies. Chika is Nobue's little sister. She is nicknamed Chi-chan or just Chi. ; : :Miu is another twelve-year-old girl who is depicted in the story as having a problem-child personality. A childhood friend of Chika, she lives next door to the Ito house and attends the same class as Chika. Miu likes to say random things out of the blue and often plays pranks on Matsuri and Ana, but is most of the time interrupted by Nobue (and sometimes by Chika), ending up lying face-down on the floor. She has the least common sense or manners of the girls, and is rarely taken seriously because of her weird ideas and comments. She seems to harbor some sort of jealousy of Ana and Matsuri, because Nobue finds them cuter. She does not have any delicacy and tends to do things that bother people around her. Miu is nicknamed \\"Mi- chan\\". Miu has been described as \\"Yotsuba Koiwai with fangs\\". :While she is often causing trouble for the other girls, an interview with the cast that was published in volume 4 of the manga series reveals that Miu is extremely fond of Chika, whom she dubs as her 'one and only'. The interview also goes on to claim that Miu derives satisfaction from amusing Chika, and that she will never go to bed before making sure that Chika's room light is turned off. There are also scenes within the manga which hint at signs of lesbianism from Miu towards Chika; when Miu reveals that the both of them have kissed and rubbed each other's breasts, Chika makes no attempt to deny the claims or defend herself. ; : :Matsuri, nicknamed \\"Mats\\" in the manga, is an eleven- year-old glasses-wearing girl with a pet ferret named John, and is depicted as having a very timid personality in the story. She is often the subject of Miu's teasing and can resort to crying and hiding behind Nobue. She is one grade below Chika and Miu, in the same class as Ana, with whom she quickly became friends. Matsuri discovers that Ana can speak Japanese fluently and helps her hide both her Japanese language skills and her lack of English language skills from the rest of their class. While she has gray hair in the anime, her hair is white in the manga.Matsuri: \\"It's just...I don't like you teasing me about my white hair...\\" Strawberry Marshmallow (in English) vol.1 p.57 ; : :Ana is an eleven-year-old girl who originally came from Cornwall, England, five years before the series, but seems to have forgotten how to speak English. She first pretends that she speaks only English, but it is not long before she is discovered by Matsuri while speaking very polite Japanese. Matsuri tries to help her re-learn English. Ana is often teased by Miu because of her name, Ana Coppola, which in Japanese sounds like a typical psychomime (a form of onomatopoeic sound). Ana really dislikes her last name for that and becomes angry every time Miu calls her \\"Coppola-chan\\". Miu also makes things worse by spelling her name in kanji to mean . Ana's \\"proper Japanese\\" personality is reflected by her very traditionally feminine and polite speaking style. And her impressive knowledge of Japanese words, kanji, customs and traditions makes her more \\"Japanese\\" than most Japanese people (which she also tries to hide). Later in the series, her ability to speak Japanese is discovered by the other students in her class. Ana owns a pet dog. ==Media== ===Manga=== Nobue's character design evolved rapidly in the first volume before achieving a stable model for the rest of the series. The Strawberry Marshmallow manga, written and illustrated by Barasui, began serialization in ASCII Media Works's Dengeki Daioh magazine on February 15, 2002. The first tankōbon was released on January 27, 2003, and seven volumes have been released as of March 27, 2013. The manga has been licensed and is published by Tokyopop in both the United States and Germany; the French company Kurokawa also have licensed the manga. Early chapters of the manga break the fourth wall, especially in the first volume, where Chika often turns to face the readers when describing her plight. ===Anime=== A 12-episode Strawberry Marshmallow anime series produced by Daume and directed by Takuya Satō aired in Japan between July 14 and October 13, 2005 on the TBS Japanese television network. The anime series was licensed for English language distribution by Geneon, but due to the shutdown of their anime division, the series went out of print. The anime series was later re-licensed by Sentai Filmworks. Three original video animation (OVA) episodes were later released between February 23 and April 25, 2007. A two-episode OVA series titled Strawberry Marshmallow Encore was released between January 23 and March 25, 2009. ===Audio CDs=== Five Strawberry Marshmallow drama CDs were released between July 22, 2005 and August 25, 2006 on the Frontier Works record label. They use the same voice actresses as the anime. There have also been four character song singles (one for each girl except Nobue), two soundtrack albums for the original anime, and two soundtrack albums for the OVA. ===Visual novel=== Screenshot from the visual novel featuring Matsuri. The visual novel, under the original title of Ichigo Mashimaro, was developed by ASCII Media Works for the PlayStation 2 based on the series under an all-ages CERO rating. The game was first released on August 11, 2005, and was re-released on March 8, 2007 under a 'The Best' budget price. ===Differences between media=== There are several, large differences between the manga and anime versions of the series such as the much earlier introduction of Ana in the anime than the manga. In the manga, Ana does not appear until the second volume, while she makes her debut in the second episode of the anime. Events that take place in the manga never appeared in the anime, and chapters that were adapted were mixed together or were altered. For example: episode seven of the anime, \\"Going to the Sea\\", mixes elements of episode nine, \\"Critical Investigation\\", and ten, \\"Beach Challenge\\" of the first volume of the manga. While Ana is present in the anime episode, she was not in the manga versions at all. Character designs were extremely inconsistent in the early stages of the manga, before Barasui knew that Strawberry Marshmallow would become a series. Character designs are even more inconsistent with the visual novel, which uses a mix between the manga and anime's styles while throwing in some new departures of its own. For example: Matsuri has blonde hair in the visual novel, whereas she has white or gray hair in other mediums. Early chapters of the manga also had Miu drawn almost identical to Chika, with their hair length being the only visible difference between them. In addition, some of the girls' personalities are slightly different in each media: Matsuri is shown to be a little more defensive in the manga than her anime counterpart, which was demonstrated by her slapping or shoving Miu away when the latter got overboard with her pranks, while she never (deliberately) laid a finger on Miu in the anime. There are also subtle differences in Miu and Chika's personalities between the manga and the anime: Miu is more random and unpredictable in the manga compared to her anime counterpart. Chika is also targeted by Miu more often in the manga as compared to the anime (but not as much as Matsuri is), resulting in more outbursts of anger from her in the manga. ==Reception== Strawberry Marshmallow has received positive reviews in English. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network has described Strawberry Marshmallow as \\"a clever little comedy that delivers laughs via its straight-faced approach\\" and has mentioned that \\"There is something uniquely appealing about Marshmallow's deadpan delivery\\". Dirk Deppey from The Comics Journal stated that \\"Barasui sets up his comic situations with little if any extraneous padding and plays out the resulting gags with the skill and grace of a master craftsman\\". Erica Friedman of Yuricon has called the series \\"too-cute-to-hate\\". Friedman has also criticized the English-language adaptation of the manga for not providing any translations for sound effects and not giving any explanations for some puns. Jason Thompson, writing about The Last Uniform for the appendix to Manga: The Complete Guide, contrasts the two series and calls Strawberry Marshmallow \\"purely juvenile gaze-into-the-girls-world stuff\\". ==References== ==External links== *Strawberry Marshmallow at Dengeki Daioh *Strawberry Marshmallow at TBS * Category:2005 anime television series Category:2005 video games Category:2007 anime OVAs Category:2009 anime OVAs Category:ASCII Media Works manga Category:Bishōjo games Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Dengeki Comics Category:Dengeki Daioh Category:Geneon USA Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:MediaWorks games Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Sentai Filmworks Category:Shōnen manga Category:Slice of life anime and manga Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System original programming Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Visual novels Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Strawberry Marshmallow"},{"id":"2567658","text":"Until 1 January 2007 Sydthy municipality was a Danish municipality (Danish, kommune) in the former Viborg County on the west coast of Vendsyssel-Thy, a part of the Jutland peninsula in west Denmark.

Dregen and Eriksson had been roadies for Entombed, while Håkansson was a childhood friend of Andersson's. The Hellacopters were initially conceived as a side project for Andersson and Dregen, but it eventually became the main songwriting and performance vehicle for Andersson. The band, together with The Hives, is considered one of the most important Swedish bands in the garage rock revival and one of the most influential rock bands in Sweden. The band released their Swedish Grammy-winning debut album Supershitty to the Max! in 1996. Just before a tour opening for Kiss, the band recruited keyboardist and percussionist Anders Lindström (also known as Boba Fett or Boba) on a part- time basis; he would become a full-time member in 1999. After the album Payin' the Dues in 1998, Dregen left the band to return to Backyard Babies full-time, and Mattias Hellberg and Danne Andersson were recruited to complete the band touring responsibilities. After the release of Grande Rock, which featured additional guitar playing from both Lindström and Hellberg, Robert Dahlqvist was hired as a full-time lead guitarist in 1999. With the lineup now solidified, the band released three more studio albums and a cover album, with many EPs and limited edition releases as well. The Hellacopters disbanded amicably in 2008 so the members could move on to other projects. Eight years later, the band reassembled in 2016, initially for an exclusive performance at Sweden Rock Festival to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of their award- winning debut album Supershitty to the Max!. ==Band history== ===Formation and Supershitty to the Max!=== Original guitarist and founding member Dregen performing live. The band name was inspired by a magazine article discovered by Andersson and Dregen while on tour with Entombed in San Francisco. The article was about how the CIA was spying with helicopters on marijuana fields in Mexico and that the Mexicans called them \\"Hellacopters.\\" The first Hellacopters rehearsal took place on November 4, 1994 as just a jam session, after two more rehearsals the band released their first single \\"Killing Allan\\" in January 1995 on their own label Psychout Records. After releasing their second single \\"1995,\\" the Hellacopters were signed by White Jazz Records and they released their debut album Supershitty to the Max! in June 1996. The album was recorded all live in only 26 hours. The band won a Swedish Grammy for the album. Anders \\"Boba Fett\\" Lindström, guitarist of the Swedish rock band The Diamond Dogs, was then recruited to play keyboards shortly before they supported Kiss on their Scandinavian dates in June 1997. ===Payin' the Dues and Dregen's departure=== The band recorded their follow-up album Payin' the Dues in February 1997. The record barely managed to break into the top 20 in Sweden and the top 30s in Finland. Andersson then left Entombed completely to concentrate full-time on the Hellacopters. A Swedish tour included a show at the second largest stage at the Hultsfred Festival, while the band famously played a secret gig backstage on a small makeshift stage.Goodnight Cleveland bonus material In 1998 the band toured Europe with Gluecifer, with whom they recorded the split album Respect the Rock. Soon after, Dregen left the band and returned to Backyard Babies. With Dregen's departure in the middle of an extensive tour, the band recruited guitarists Chuck Pounder and Mattias Hellberg for their tours of Scandinavia and U.S./Canada, respectively. While on tour in America the band also had the opportunity to jam with legendary Detroit rockers Scott Morgan of the Sonic's Rendezvous Band and Wayne Kramer of the MC5, beginning long working relationships with both. ===Grande Rock and Dahlqvist's debut=== In September 1998 the band recorded their third album Grande Rock. Due to the absence of a second guitarist, Lindström and Hellberg both contributed on guitar. The album's 1970s classic rock sound was a departure from their previous albums, which featured a louder Detroit punk rock and garage rock sound. One reason for this was that the band recorded the album in an older studio from the 1970s in the Swedish woods, where they learned from an older and more experienced engineer who knew how to create the vintage seventies sound the band desired. Grande Rock became the band's first album to break into the Swedish top ten, before dropping out of the list after one week. For the ensuing tour, the band considered recruiting an American guitarist but hired Robert Dahlqvist. With Dahlqvist as a full-time replacement for Dregen the band set out on tour along with Wayne Kramer, The Nomads and Powder Monkeys. ===High Visibility with Chips Kiesbye=== In 2000 the band headed back into the studio to record their first album with Robert Dahlqvist who by then had earned the nickname \\"Strängen\\" or \\"Strings\\" due to all the strings he had broken during rehearsals. It was also their first time working with producer Chips Kiesbye, who had worked with artists such as Sahara Hotnights, Millencolin, Thåström, The Nomads, The Turpentines, his own band Sator, and many other Swedish rock bands. Kiesbye would become their producer of choice and he produced all of the band's subsequent studio albums. High Visibility spent twelve weeks on the Swedish charts and was certified gold in that nation. The band set out on a Scandinavian and European tour in support of the album along with the then-unknown band The Hives as their opening act. High Visibility was later released in the United States and the band's tour was chronicled in the documentary Goodnight Cleveland. The title is a reference to the mockumentary This Is Spınal Tap in which Derek Smalls yells \\"Hello Cleveland\\" to an unseen audience while the band tries to find their way onto the stage. Andersson adapted the phrase at the end of the band's show at the Agora Ballroom. ===By the Grace of God and side projects=== Kenny Håkansson in front of a By the Grace of God backdrop. In early 2002, the band released their first compilation of non-album tracks Cream Of The Crap Vol. 1, the CD's booklet contained one half of a poster designed by Andersson the second half of the poster was included in the second volume of the Cream of The Crap series. The band recorded 20 songs for their fifth album at Polar Studios in Stockholm, 13 of the 20 songs were included on By the Grace of God. It became the band's most commercially successful album, debuting at number two in Sweden and number eight in Finland, and the band was rewarded with another gold record in Sweden. The title track also spent seven weeks on the Swedish singles chart and gained significant airplay on radio and TV. The band also had the opportunity to be the opening act for The Rolling Stones and ZZ Top in Stockholm and Helsinki. Before recording their next album, the band decided to take a break to find time to focus on other projects. Nicke Andersson worked on his side project The Solution with Scott Morgan, releasing the album Communicate! in 2004; he also contributed backing vocals for The Cardigans album Long Gone Before Daylight. Dahlqvist started a side project called Thunder Express and also recorded the album Fula Gubben Hitler with Swedish singer/songwriter Stefan Sundström; Dahlqvist was pictured on the album's cover suspended on a cross. Dahlqvist also toured along with former Hellacopters member Mattias Hellberg in support of the album. ===Rock & Roll Is Dead=== During the Hellacopters' break, the second compilation of non-album tracks Cream Of The Crap Vol. 2 was released. The band claims they have enough material for a Vol. 3 and a Vol. 4, but there are no plans for more parts in the Cream of the Crap series. Eriksson and Lindstrom also did a small DJ tour in Italy before joining up with the rest of the band to record and release Rock & Roll Is Dead in 2005. The name is a reference to the band's opinion about the state of the music industry. The album entered the Swedish album charts as number three and reached the top twenty in Finland. In March 2006 The Hellacopters went on their first American tour in three years, and also toured Sweden with The Hives, Millencollin, Backyard Babies and The Soundtrack of our Lives on the Where the Action Is Tour. The track \\"Nothing Terribly New\\" was also mentioned several times as one of E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt's favorite garage rock songs. ===Head Off and break-up announcement=== On October 12, 2007, The Hellacopters announced they would be breaking up after releasing their seventh full-length album Head Off, a collection of cover songs. According to the band, the reason for the breakup was to quit while they were still on top and not because of tension within the band. The album was originally presented as a regular Hellacopters studio album so that the fans would keep an open mind about the music. Håkansson also felt that it was fitting for the fans to get to know eleven new great bands to check out after the band's break up. The album debuted at number four in the Swedish charts and in the top 20 in Finland and Norway. The last Hellacopters shows were played at Debaser Medis in Stockholm October 25 and 26; the concerts were filmed and streamed live on the band's MySpace page. Several friends and collaborators of the band were in the audience, including members of Sahara Hotnights, Entombed, Burst, Stefan Sundström, Texas Terri, Pernilla Andersson and \\"Demons\\" (who was the opening band for most of the dates on the tour). The band will also release a double live album, like many of their favorite bands from the 1970s did, with recordings from their entire \\"Tour Before the Fall.\\" === Hiatus activities === Nicke Andersson performing live with Imperial State Electric. Frontman Nicke Andersson continues to work with his other band Death Breath, originally a side project while he was with The Hellacopters, and plans to record a solo album. He also says that he would like to record and tour once again with his soul band The Solution, but due to all of the different members' involvement with other projects, finding time for everyone to record and tour is difficult. Andersson recently formed the band Cold Ethyl, but this band currently has no intentions of recording or releasing any original material. Robert Dahlqvist returned to his own band Thunder Express, with which he released a Swedish-language album Dunder Tåget with lyrics from Stefan Sundström in early 2009. Kenny Håkansson has plans to form a band with the drummer of the Danish rock band Baby Woodrose; the currently unnamed band is described as \\"psychedelic rock ala 1971.\\" Robert Eriksson is working with his currently unsigned band Tramp and works at a music youth center called Black Sheep in Solna. In March 2016, the first biography of the band, with every member participating, was released in French. The book, The Hellacopters, du kérosène dans les veines by Rudy Charis, was published by Camion Blanc and is due to be released in English in 2018. On 3 February 2017, former guitarist Robert Dahlqvist died at age 40. The band's distributor Sound Pollution stated that Dahlqvist died accidentally at home, having drowned in a bathtub following an epileptic seizure. At the time of his death, he had several concerts and appearances scheduled for the coming weeks, and had nearly completed recording a solo album under the pseudonym Strängen.Familjesidan - Funeral notices === Supershitty to the Max! anniversary reunion === In April 2016, the band announced that their original lineup would be reuniting for the 20th anniversary of the release of their debut album, Supershitty to the Max!, initially playing the 2016 Sweden Rock Festival. The band also announced the release of an exclusive 12-inch vinyl record, with two tracks (\\"My Mephistophelean Creed\\" and \\"Don't Stop Now\\") written during the Supershitty to the Max! sessions but recorded in 2016. The Hellacopters went on to play several international festivals in 2016 and 2017, such as the Roskilde Festival, with (Hanoi Rocks, New York Dolls and Michael Monroe) bass player Sami Yaffa replacing original member Kenny Håkansson for the 2017 shows. ==Musical style== Heavily influenced by early Kiss, punk and rock bands such as MC5, Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Damned, The Stooges and The Heartbreakers as well as bands such as Venom, Blue Cheer and Motörhead the band's debut album - Supershitty to the Max! - contained fast-paced songs and overdriven guitars. While the band's second album - Payin' the Dues - was in similar style as their debut album it also displayed a tighter musicianship and songwriting technique as well as keyboards by Anders Lindström. Grande Rock was the first studio album to be recorded without original guitarist Dregen and was a departure from the band's Detroit rock influenced sound to a more 1970s rock sound. The band continued to evolve their sound throughout their career, while Nicke Andersson claims that all of their music is based around three chords and a chorus the band had no interest in repeating themselves. On the band's later releases, Andersson's vocals incorporated soul influences from his and Scott Morgans side project The Solution. The Hellacopters also recorded many cover songs throughout their career of songs from bands and artist such as Radio Birdman, Misfits, Smokey Robinson, Nationalteatern, Alice Cooper, The Nomads, April Stevens, Sonic's Rendezvous Band, The Dictators, Love and others. However Andersson asserts that there is a difference between the music that inspires him and the music that has an influence on his music, Andersson has mentioned country music artist Guy Clark as an artist that inspires his songwriting without affecting the band's sound. ==Band members== ===Current=== ;Nicke Andersson :Active: 1994-present. :Instruments: lead vocals, guitars, bass (in studio since 2016), clavinet, piano, percussion and e-bow. :Recording contributions: All studio recordings. ;Matz Robert Eriksson :Active: 1994-present :Instruments: drums, percussion, lead and backing vocals. :Recording contributions: All studio recordings. ;Anders Lindström :Active: 1996-present (full-time from 1999). :Instruments: organ, piano, percussion, guitars, backing vocals. :Recording contributions: All recordings from Payin' the Dues and onward. ;Dregen :Active: 1994-1997. 2016-present. :Instruments: guitars, percussion, lead and backing vocals. :Recording contributions: From Supershitty to the Max! to Payin' the Dues. ===Touring=== ;Sami Yaffa :Active: 2017 :Instruments: bass, backing vocals. ;Dolf DeBorst :Active: 2018 onwards. :Instruments: bass, backing vocals. ===Former=== ;Kenny Håkansson :Active: 1994-2016. :Instruments: bass, backing vocals :Recording contributions: All studio recordings. ;Robert Dahlqvist :Active: 1999-2008. *deceased 2017 :Instruments: guitar, backing vocals. :Recording contributions: All recordings from High Visibility and onward. ;Danne Andersson :Active: 1997. :Instruments: guitar, backing vocals :Recording contributions: None. ;Mattias Hellberg :Active: 1997-1998. :Instruments: guitar and backing vocals. :Recording contributions: Contributor to Grande Rock and By the Grace of God. ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:30 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:04/11/1994 till:01/01/2021 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Keyboard value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines1 value:black legend:Studio releases id:Lines2 value:yellow legend:Hiatus and return Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:01/01/1995 LineData = at:06/01/1996 color:black layer:back at:10/01/1997 color:black layer:back at:17/05/1999 color:black layer:back at:16/10/2000 color:black layer:back at:23/01/2002 color:black layer:back at:18/09/2002 color:black layer:back at:04/02/2004 color:black layer:back at:30/11/2004 color:black layer:back at:06/06/2005 color:black layer:back at:21/08/2006 color:black layer:back at:30/03/2008 color:black layer:back at:31/07/2007 color:black layer:back at:03/04/2008 color:yellow layer:back at:06/06/2016 color:yellow layer:back BarData = bar:Nicke text:\\"Nicke Andersson\\" bar:Dregen text:\\"Dregen\\" bar:Chuck text:\\"Danne Andersson\\" bar:Mattias text:\\"Mattias Hellberg\\" bar:Strings text:\\"Robert Dahlqvist\\" bar:Kenny text:\\"Kenny Håkansson\\" bar:Sami text:\\"Sami Yaffa\\" bar:Dolf text:\\"Dolf de Borst\\" bar:Robban text:\\"Robert Eriksson\\" bar:Boba text:\\"Anders Lindström\\" PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Nicke from:04/11/1994 till:end color:Vocals bar:Nicke from:04/11/1994 till:end color:Guitar width:9 bar:Nicke from:04/11/1994 till:end color:Keyboard width:3 bar:Kenny from:04/11/1994 till:30/12/2016 color:Bass bar:Sami from:31/12/2016 till:30/12/2017 color:Bass bar:Dolf from:01/01/2018 till:end color:Bass bar:Robban from:04/11/1994 till:end color:Drums bar:Robban from:04/11/1994 till:end color:Vocals width:3 bar:Dregen from:04/11/1994 till:02/05/1998 color:Guitar bar:Dregen from:04/11/1994 till:02/05/1998 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Dregen from:06/06/2016 till:end color:Guitar bar:Dregen from:06/06/2016 till:end color:Vocals width:3 bar:Chuck from:27/05/1998 till:06/11/1998 color:Guitar bar:Mattias from:02/12/1998 till:19/12/1998 color:Guitar bar:Strings from:01/08/1999 till:30/03/2008 color:Guitar bar:Boba from:26/05/1997 till:end color:Keyboard bar:Boba from:26/05/1997 till:end color:Guitar width:3 ==Selected discography== ;Studio albums * 1996 - Supershitty to the Max! * 1997 - Payin' the Dues * 1999 - Grande Rock * 2000 - High Visibility * 2002 - By the Grace of God * 2005 - Rock & Roll Is Dead * 2008 - Head Off ;Compilations * 2002 - Cream of the Crap Vol. 1 * 2004 - Cream of the Crap Vol. 2 * 2006 - Air Raid Serenades ==Awards and nominations== ;Swedish Grammys: - rowspan=\\"1\\"  1996  Supershitty to the Max!

It had a population of 8,696 in 2011.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000596 ==History== The Garden City style layout of Townhill was overseen by Ernest Morgan, the Swansea city architect, in the early 1920s. ===Townhill Baptist Church=== Townhill Baptist Church was formed on the hill in the late 1920s and the church still meets today on Sunday mornings and evenings in the original building on Powys Avenue. ===Swansea St Nicholas on the Hill and St Jude, Townhill=== St Nicholas on the Hill is the parish church for Townhill and Mayhill In 2015 Both St Jude's and St Nicholas were merged to make The Benefice of Swansea St Nicholas on the Hill and St Jude in St Nicholas Church Townhill and St Judes's church closed. the Parish Church is on the corner of Dyfed Avenue and Powys avenue next to the St Nicholas Community hall - meeting on Sunday mornings and Wednesday mornings. https://parish.churchinwales.org.uk/s464/about/history/information-on-the-old- st-judes-church/ ==Townhill district== The suburb of Townhill falls within the Townhill ward. The district of Townhill consists of a council estate and some private housing spread over a steep hill of the same name bordering Mayhill and visible from the Swansea city centre. The area overlooks Swansea city centre, Swansea Docks and Swansea Bay to the south; and Cockett, Gendros and Cwmbwrla to the north. Local amenities at the top of the hill include a public library, the Townhill Community primary school, a nursery school and some playing fields. Swansea Metropolitan University Had a campus to the west. In 2018 the university opened a new £350 million campus at the SA1 Swansea Waterfront, housing Yr Athrofa: the Institute of Education, and the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering. Staff and students from the city centre Townhill and Mount Pleasant campuses relocatec to SA1, with Townhill closing at the end of the 2017-18 academic year although the university has retained a presence at Mount Pleasant. Townhill is a Communities First area. ==Townhill landform== Backing Swansea city centre to the north is a large slab of sandstone called Townhill. The summit of Townhill is approximately 175m above sea level. At the top of hill lies the housing estate of Townhill which falls away to the north west of the hill. The Mayhill district lies on the northeast face of the hill. The southeastern face of the hill is the steepest and is covered by the district of Mount Pleasant. The Uplands district occupies the southwestern face of the hill which slopes gently downwards towards Singleton Park. ===Rosehill Quarry Community Park=== The hill is rounded by a band of rock which is too steep to develop on and is recognised by the City and County of Swansea council as a wildlife corridor. In this band, on the south side of the hill is the designated Rosehill Quarry Community Park. Rosehill Quarry is a semi-natural urban green space which is not formally cultivated in its entirety. Wildlife areas include a stream, waterfall and several ponds. There are over one hundred species of plants including oak, royal fern and rowan trees. Around thirty species of birds can be found in the park, including sparrowhawk, kestrel, and tawny owl. Additionally, there are frogs, newts, dragonfiles and damselflies including the blue-tailed damselfly, which is used as the quarry's symbol. Recreational facilities in the park include picnic tables, play equipment, and a BMX bike track. The Rosehill Quarry six acre site was quarried for stone for house- building from the 1840s, creating the only flat ground in the area. The area stood derelict for some time until the early 20th century when the area was used as a tennis court which later fell into disuse. In the 1970s, planning permission was granted for a block of flats, which never got built. In the 1970s and 1980s, local residents' initiatives persuaded the local council to buy the land and designate it as a public open space in the Local Plan. The Rosehill Quarry Group was formed, with support from the council, to develop and maintain the quarry as the first community park in Swansea. ===Constitution Hill=== Constitution Hill leads up towards the Townhill district from Swansea city centre. This is a steep sloping cobbled street made famous in the feature film Twin Town, being featured in a scene with a daring car stunt. Constitution Hill is one of the steepest road hills in Swansea. In the early 20th century, the Swansea Constitution Hill Incline Railway operated up and down the hill. The hill is also sometimes used for cycling races held in Swansea. Constitution Hill forms part of the boundary between the Castle and Uplands wards. ==References== *Rosehill Quarry *Townhill Baptist Church Category:Communities in Swansea Category:Districts of Swansea Category:Mountains and hills of Swansea ","title":"Townhill, Swansea"},{"id":"2567696","text":"Chen Chin-feng (; born 28 October 1977) is a retired baseball outfielder who was the first Taiwan-born player playing in Major League Baseball in 2002. Chen is a Taiwanese aborigine of Siraya tribal ancestry. ==Career== In 1999 in the Cal League with Class-A San Bernardino in 1999, he batted .316/.404/.580 with 31 homers, 31 steals, 123 RBIs and 75 walks. Along with outfielder Joc Pederson who did it in AAA in 2014, he is one of only two LA Dodger minor leaguers to have a 30 home run, 30 stolen bases season. Chen playing for Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005 Chen became the first Taiwanese baseball player to play in Major League baseball when he made his debut on September 14, 2002. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers in parts of the 2002-05 seasons, but only sparingly. In 2005, Chen was reluctant to accept a designation for assignment back to Dodgers' Las Vegas 51s AAA team, and try out with another major league team. In 2005, Chen was the first Taiwanese position player to ever get a hit in Major League Baseball, a 2-run RBI single off Colorado Rockies' reliever Bobby Seay. However, Chin-hui Tsao had earlier become the first Taiwanese player to get a hit in the Majors as a pitcher, with the Colorado Rockies on August 18, 2003. Chen batting for Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005 After his contract with the Dodgers organization expired after the 2005 season, Chen announced on December 26, 2005, that he would not return to North America for the 2006 season, but would instead enter the CPBL draft. In 2006, after struggling to make the 25-man roster with the Dodgers, Chen tried out for the Japanese professional league (NPB), and eventually decided to play in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in Taiwan. Chen in 2007 He was promptly selected by the La New Bears as a designated hitter. Chen had completed his first complete baseball season at the hometown Taiwan in 2006. He ranked first in many aspects such as the highest batting average and 81 RBIs for the whole season. He also led the Bears to the championship title and he won his first MVP title for the final series matches. Later on in the second Asian baseball tournament, he showed the best performance again and gained attention from several Japanese and Korean teams, including the Orix Buffaloes. But, Chen did not sign with them and remained in Taiwan. Chen in 2013 Chen announced his retirement from the Chinese Professional Baseball League on September 18, 2016. On September 18, 2016, at the conclusion of his final match, Lamigo Monkeys retired his #52 jersey. ==International career== He was selected Chinese Taipei national baseball team at the 1999 Asian Baseball Championship, 2001 Baseball World Cup, 2003 Asian Baseball Championship, 2004 Summer Olympics, 2006 Asian Games, 2007 Asian Baseball Championship, 2008 Summer Olympics Qualification Final Qualifying Tournament and 2016 exhibition games against Japan. == Achievements == Chen hit the first grand slam in Konami Cup history during the 2006 series. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball players from Taiwan == References == == External links == , or CPBL Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:All- Star Futures Game players Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Chinese Taipei Category:Asian Games gold medalists for Chinese Taipei Category:Asian Games medalists in baseball Category:Baseball players at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Baseball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Baseball players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Baseball players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:La New Bears players Category:Lamigo Monkeys players Category:Las Vegas 51s players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Taiwan Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Olympic baseball players of Taiwan Category:Baseball players from Tainan Category:San Antonio Missions players Category:San Bernardino Stampede players Category:Taiwanese indigenous peoples Category:Taiwanese expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Vero Beach Dodgers players ","title":"Chin-Feng Chen"},{"id":"2567698","text":"André Léon Alphonse Debry (15 June 1898 - 31 August 2005) was, at age 107, one of the last surviving French veterans of the First World War.

The fortress comprises five islands joined together by bridges, and the church is the central feature on the island of Iso Mustasaari (), located at its highest point. It is surrounded by other fortress buildings, but the old parade ground is immediately to the east, and a park lies immediately to the south. It is oriented southwest to northeast so that it would align with the Crownwork Ehrensvärd defense front located to the southwest of the church. Before the design and construction of the Orthodox church, plans were drawn up in the 1820s by architect Carl Ludvig Engel for a church on the same site, but designed in the neoclassical style in keeping with the rest of buildings at the fortress and the buildings in the capital city, Helsinki. The actual church was designed by Konstantin Thon, an official architect of Imperial Russia during the reign of Czar Nicholas I, whose major works included the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the Grand Kremlin Palace, and the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow. The church was named for Saint/Prince Alexander Nevsky, who defeated the Swedes at the Neva battle of 1240. The Alexander Nevsky Church originally had five onion domes. The perimeter fence, constructed from cannons and chains, was erected in the 1870s. The church bell, the largest in Finland, was cast in Moscow in 1885 and weighs 6,683 kilograms. It is now displayed adjacent to the church. The church was elevated to the status of cathedral within the Orthodox faith in 1891. In 1918 the Orthodox church was converted into an Evangelical Lutheran church, as Finland sought to indicate its new-found independence from Russia. The onion domes of the four smaller towers were immediately removed. The church's extensive iconography was warehoused by the city of Helsinki, but their current whereabouts are unknown. During the 1920s, it was decided to give the church an extensive renovation for structural repair as well as incorporation of a more Western design. The design competition was won by architect Einar Sjöström, and the finished church was reconsecrated on 28 April 1929. Another interesting feature from the renovation is that the church's central dome has doubled as a lighthouse since 1929, making it one of only a few churches in the world that has that dual purpose. The lighthouse is officially the Harmaja Range Rear light, and it pairs with the Harmaja lighthouse (4.8 km south in the Gulf of Finland) as the Range Front light. The signal blink is the Morse code for the letter \\"H\\" for Helsinki. Additional renovations have been made in the 1960s (after the church was turned over to the Evangelical Lutheran Parish Union of Helsinki), and again in the late 1980s and 1990s in preparation for the 250th anniversary of Suomenlinna in 1998. The Suomenlinna Church is still a very popular wedding site and one of the first landmarks for people arriving in Helsinki by sea. ==Gallery== File:Suomenlinnan kirkko 1908.jpegSuomenlinna church in 1908, before rebuilding File:Suomenlinna Church - Pipe organ DSC08031 C.JPGThe organ File:Suomenlinna Church - Pulpit DSC08030 C.JPGThe pulpit File:Suomenlinna Church bell.jpgThe bell File:Suomenlinna Church - fence.jpgFence constructed from cannon and chains File:Lighthouse Finland 1408 (4046568327).jpgThe lighthouse beacon ==References== ==External links== *Suomenlinna Governing Body Category:Churches completed in 1854 Category:20th-century Lutheran churches Category:Churches in Helsinki Category:Lutheran churches in Finland Category:Suomenlinna Category:Church buildings with domes Category:Lighthouses in Finland ","title":"Suomenlinna Church"},{"id":"2567705","text":"Khronos is the sixth full-length album by Greek extreme metal band Rotting Christ.

They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools. These specifications are formal in the sense that they have a syntax, their semantics fall within one domain, and they are able to be used to infer useful information. ==Motivation== In each passing decade, computer systems have become increasingly more powerful and, as a result, they have become more impactful to society. Because of this, better techniques are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software. Established engineering disciplines use mathematical analysis as the foundation of creating and validating product design. Formal specifications are one such way to achieve this in software engineering reliability as once predicted. Other methods such as testing are more commonly used to enhance code quality. ==Uses== Given such a specification, it is possible to use formal verification techniques to demonstrate that a system design is correct with respect to its specification. This allows incorrect system designs to be revised before any major investments have been made into an actual implementation. Another approach is to use probably correct refinement steps to transform a specification into a design, which is ultimately transformed into an implementation that is correct by construction. It is important to note that a formal specification is not an implementation, but rather it may be used to develop an implementation. Formal specifications describe what a system should do, not how the system should do it. A good specification must have some of the following attributes: adequate, internally consistent, unambiguous, complete, satisfied, minimal A good specification will have: * Constructability, manageability and evolvability * Usability * Communicability * Powerful and efficient analysis One of the main reasons there is interest in formal specifications is that they will provide an ability to perform proofs on software implementations. These proofs may be used to validate a specification, verify correctness of design, or to prove that a program satisfies a specification. ==Limitations== A design (or implementation) cannot ever be declared “correct” on its own. It can only ever be “correct with respect to a given specification”. Whether the formal specification correctly describes the problem to be solved is a separate issue. It is also a difficult issue to address since it ultimately concerns the problem constructing abstracted formal representations of an informal concrete problem domain, and such an abstraction step is not amenable to formal proof. However, it is possible to validate a specification by proving “challenge” theorems concerning properties that the specification is expected to exhibit. If correct, these theorems reinforce the specifier's understanding of the specification and its relationship with the underlying problem domain. If not, the specification probably needs to be changed to better reflect the domain understanding of those involved with producing (and implementing) the specification. Formal methods of software development are not widely used in industry. Most companies do not consider it cost-effective to apply them in their software development processes. This may be for a variety of reasons, some of which are: * Time ** High initial start up cost with low measurable returns * Flexibility ** A lot of software companies use agile methodologies that focus on flexibility. Doing a formal specification of the whole system up front is often perceived as being the opposite of flexible. However, there is some research into the benefits of using formal specifications with \\"agile\\" development * Complexity ** They require a high level of mathematical expertise and the analytical skills to understand and apply them effectively ** A solution to this would be to develop tools and models that allow for these techniques to be implemented but hide the underlying mathematics * Limited scope ** They do not capture properties of interest for all stakeholders in the project ** They do not do a good job of specifying user interfaces and user interaction * Not cost-effective ** This is not entirely true, by limiting their use to only core parts of critical systems they have shown to be cost-effective Other limitations: * Isolation * Low-level ontologies * Poor guidance * Poor separation of concerns * Poor tool feedback ==Paradigms== Formal specification techniques have existed in various domains and on various scales for quite some time. Implementations of formal specifications will differ depending on what kind of system they are attempting to model, how they are applied and at what point in the software life cycle they have been introduced. These types of models can be categorized into the following specification paradigms: * History-based specification ** behavior based on system histories ** assertions are interpreted over time * State-based specification ** behavior based on system states ** series of sequential steps, (e.g. a financial transaction) ** languages such as Z, VDM or B rely on this paradigm * Transition-based specification ** behavior based on transitions from state-to-state of the system ** best used with a reactive system ** languages such as Statecharts, PROMELA, STeP-SPL, RSML or SCR rely on this paradigm * Functional specification ** specify a system as a structure of mathematical functions ** OBJ, ASL, PLUSS, LARCH, HOL or PVS rely on this paradigm * Operational Specification ** early languages such as Paisley, GIST, Petri nets or process algebras rely on this paradigm In addition to the above paradigms, there are ways to apply certain heuristics to help improve the creation of these specifications. The paper referenced here best discusses heuristics to use when designing a specification. They do so by applying a divide-and-conquer approach. ==Software tools== The Z notation is an example of a leading formal specification language. Others include the Specification Language (VDM-SL) of the Vienna Development Method and the Abstract Machine Notation (AMN) of the B-Method. In the Web services area, formal specification is often used to describe non-functional propertiesS-Cube Knowledge Model: Formal Specification (Web services Quality of Service).

It is situated in a valley some 4.5 miles west of Swansea city centre. The population as of the 2011 census was 4,383. It adjoins the area of Killay. ==History== Dunvant started out as a small village based around the coal industry. The area between Dunvant and Gowerton was once quite heavily industrialised. with four nearby collieries Killan, Bishwell, Bryn Mawr and Dunvant. Bishwell and Bryn Mawr to the south of Gowerton were short- lived and closed in the 1870s. However, the collieries in Dunvant have a longer history. Dunvant closed again in 1914. Killan ceased operations in 1925 following the disaster of 1924 in which five men were killed. At its peak it employed 900 men. Other industry included the Penlan (Dunvant) Brickworks and Quarry which although long since derelict is now an area of conservation and ecological diversity. Development of this part of the South Wales Coalfield was due to the proximity of the Central Wales Line, which first opened to passengers in 1867 taking people from Swansea Victoria station via Blackpill through to Gowerton and beyond. At its peak, the railway carried up to 80 trains a day including express trains to Shrewsbury. Houses in the area sprung up in the form of ribbon development along the roads leading to the area in the early 1920s and 1930s. However, it was in the 1960s that larger housing estates appeared, creating the sub-urban area forming Dunvant today. ==Governance== Dunvant had its own community council, until it was dissolved in 2006. ==Education== Dunvant has two Primary Schools, Pen-y-Fro Primary situated on Priors Crescent (formerly named Dyfnant Primary) and Dunvant School. Dunvant School opened to primary and secondary pupils in 1877 under the headship of Mr John Roach. The school replaced an earlier school in Killay. As the school expanded, the original buildings were insufficient and a number of temporary buildings were provided. The infants school originally operated from a corrugated iron building known as the Tin Shack until a new building was built in 1966 to the north of the junior school. The Tin Shack survived as part of the junior school until it was demolished in the mid 1980s. In 1969, the new Olchfa School opened and many of the staff and older pupils transferred to the new school, with buildings belonging to the Dunvant Secondary School being transferred to the junior school. Even with the new infants school and secondary school, accommodation at Dunvant became overcrowded due to the continued expansion of the large housing estates at Derlwyn and Broadmead. The overcrowding was alleviated in 1976 by the opening of the new Hendrefoilan Primary School in Killay. In 2006, Dunvant Infant and Dunvant Junior Schools merged to form Dunvant Primary School. Many of the temporary buildings on the junior school site have now been removed, and a programme of building works is under way to bring the remaining buildings up to a modern standard. ==Sport and leisure== Ebenezer Congregational Chapel, first home of the Dunvant Male Choir - Côr Meibion Dyfnant Rugby union club Dunvant RFC is based in the village. Dunvant is also home to Dunvant Male Choir which is directed by Jonathan Rogers.

In old sources, it may be called Alphonse's crow-tit; though superficially resembling a tit it is not a member of the Paridae. The native range of this species extends from south-west China to northern Vietnam, and it might have become naturalised in one area in Italy.Bangs (1932), Robson (2007), BLI (2008) ==Description and systematics== This is a medium-sized tawny-coloured parrotbill with the large bill typical of these birds. The specific epithet commemorates the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. Formerly placed in a distinct parrotbill family Paradoxornithidae or with the Old World babblers in the Timaliidae or the tits and chickadees in the Paridae, they are now included with the typical warblers (Sylvia) in the Sylviidae.Alström et al. (2006), Jønsson & Fjeldså (2006), Robson (2007) They might be less close to the great parrotbill (Conostoma oemodium) - which was also in the \\"Paradoxornithidae\\" - than to Chrysomma, or to the fulvettas (Fulvetta) which were often included in the wastebin genus Alcippe. Another relative might be the wrentit (Chamaea fasciata), the only known American member of the Sylviidae in the modern circumscription. The former two, and occasionally also the wrentit, were traditionally considered Old World babblers.Cibois (2003), Alström et al. (2006), Jønsson & Fjeldså (2006), Pasquet et al. (2006), Yeung et al. (2006) Together with the other lineages of parrotbills, these and the golden-breasted fulvetta (Lioparus chrysotis) and species in the genus Rhopophilus form an Asian counterpart to the westward radiation of the typical warblers. Rather than two genera - Paradoxornis and the monotypic Conostoma - the parrotbills are better considered several independent lineages which show pronounced convergent evolution, due to adaptation to reedbed habitat and a more granivorous diet than their skulking warbler-like ancestor. In this case, the ashy-throated parrotbill would probably be assigned to genus Sinoparadoxornis. Lago di Varese (front) and Lago di Comabbio, with the Brabbia Swamp Nature Reserve left of center ==Possible naturalisation in Italy== A population of parrotbills was first discovered in northern Italy in 1995, at the Riserva naturale Palude Brabbia (Brabbia Swamp Nature Reserve), between Cazzago Brabbia on Lago di Varese and Varano Borghi on Lago di Comabbio. In March 1998, 21 individuals were captured and photographed, and provisionally identified as ashy-throated parrotbills. It is not entirely clear, however, whether the birds are indeed S. alphonsiana, its close relative the S. webbiana (vinous-throated parrotbill), both species, or even hybrids between them (as are known from their natural range). While they do not seem to be brown-winged parrotbills (S. brunnea, another close relative), certain identification to species may be impossible without analysis of both nDNA and mtDNA sequence data.Boto et al. (1999) The population is believed to originate from birds escaping from a nearby bird-trader. By 1999, the number of birds in the swamp had grown to at least a hundred individuals; in December 1998, the parrotbills were also observed in two localities on the Lago di Varese. By the early 21st century, the birds are well-established as resident breeders. They are the only self-sustaining parrotbill population found in Europe, as it was discovered that the bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus) - long believed to be an aberrant parrotbill - is actually a distinct lineage with no known relatives among the Passerida.Boto et al. (1999), Alström et al. (2006), BLI (2008) ==Ecology== Contrary to their western Eurasian relatives (the typical warblers), these East Asian birds are small omnivores adapted to living in reed beds. In its native range, the ashy-throated parrotbill inhabits bamboo stands and areas with tall grasses. The parrotbills in Brabbia Swamp Nature Reserve inhabit common reed (Phragmites australis) beds and drier land overgrown with meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea). It feeds on arthropods, seeds and buds; in winter, the Italian birds seem to sustain themselves on insects that hibernate in reed stalks. As in its relatives in (sub)genus Sinoparadoxornis, its eggs are small by parrotbill standards, whitish- to light-blue and unspotted.Boto et al. (1999), Walters (2006), Robson (2007) This bird will disappear if wetlands are drained, but its range is considerable and much of its habitat is remote and little accessed. It is thus considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.BLI (2008) ==Footnotes== ==References== * Alström, Per; Ericson, Per G.P; Olsson, Urban & Sundberg, Per (2006): Phylogeny and classification of the avian superfamily Sylvioidea.

One of his earliest musical experiences was in a band called Blessings, in which he played until 1974 when Ritchie Blackmore hired him as keyboardist for Rainbow. He played with Rainbow on two world tours, until 1977. After his departure from Rainbow, he began a solo career, releasing albums under his own name as well under the pseudonym Planet P Project, and producing for and performing with other artists. ==Early history== Carey had been playing his church's piano during off hours since he was very young, and he was permitted to play the pipe organ as well. He was fascinated by the sound. His family acquired a piano when he was seven, and he \\"lived at that piano\\" until, at age eleven, he got his first acoustic guitar and formed his first group, which played music by The Mamas and the Papas and others. His father gave him a Lowrey organ for his 14th birthday, and he started a rock band with other neighborhood kids, playing music by The Doors. He also played contrabass in his school's orchestra. At age 17, Carey moved to New Hampshire to start a new band called Blessings with a singer he knew, and soon the band had a major recording contract with ABC Dunhill. After two years of working on the project, the band was unable to complete its first album. In a 2013 interview, Carey listed his own involvement with girls, the producer's drug use, and \\"too much bullshit\\" from Dunhill as the reasons the album was never completed. ==Career== ===Rainbow=== While Carey and his band Blessings were in S. I. R. Rehearsal Studios in Hollywood working on material for their unfinished album, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple was in another room, with bassist Jimmy Bain, auditioning musicians for his new band Rainbow. Carey said Blackmore liked what he was hearing in the other room and asked Bain to invite Carey to audition. Out of frustration with his own band's inability to complete their first album, Carey accepted the position with Rainbow when it was offered. He recorded one studio album with Rainbow, the highly acclaimed Rising (1976, #48 on The Billboard 200). Carey's work on the album included the keyboard introduction to the opening track \\"Tarot Woman\\", and the keyboard solo on \\"A Light in the Black\\", the last cut on the album. During Carey's two world tours with Rainbow, live material was recorded and subsequently released as two double LPs, On Stage (1977, #65 on The Billboard 200) and Live in Germany (1990). In addition to the two double LPs, a six-disc CD box set containing music from those tours, Deutschland Tournee 1976, was released in 2006. ===1977–1983: Early solo years=== Carey left Rainbow in 1977 and moved to Germany in 1978, where he began work on his solo career. This was a period in his life when, according to Carey himself, he had health problems due to drug use and spent many 20-hour days in a recording studio (which he co-owned) with his friend and recording engineer Nigel Jopson. He recorded a great deal of instrumental music in many different styles, learning how to engineer and perform well in the recording studio. The studio's other co- owner, producer Peter Hauke, allowed Carey free use of the studio all night for several years, which gave him ample time and opportunity. His first solo album to be released was In the Absence of the Cat, in 1982, on the indie label X-Records. Carey released his second solo album, I Won't Be Home Tonight, on the short-lived but nationally recognized Rocshire label in 1982, along with the single (and music video) \\"West Coast Summer Nights\\". The album peaked at #167 on the Billboard 200, and the single peaked at #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The title track was also released as a single, peaking at #79 on the Hot 100 and #8 on Billboard's Top Rock Tracks chart. Rocshire fell under hard times following the death of its promoter, Stacy Davis (who had appeared in the \\"West Coast Summer Nights\\" video), and was closed down a year later by federal agents following an investigation resulting in the imprisonment for embezzlement of the label's co-owners and seizure of the label's assets. The album rights and masters for I Won't Be Home Tonight were seized by federal authorities, and they remain the property of the US Internal Revenue Service. Carey needed a new label. ===1983–1985: Planet P Project, Geffen, and MCA=== Following the release of I Won't Be Home Tonight, Carey was signed to Geffen Records for his third solo album (later to be released as Some Tough City), but he had a great deal of music written that didn't fit the style of that album. He was able to sign a second record deal with Geffen to record and release that material under the Planet P Project pseudonym, which he would use throughout his career for his more progressive and experimental music. He released his first album under the name Planet P Project in 1983, called Planet P Project (originally titled Planet P), which peaked at #42 on the Billboard 200. On the week ending March 19, 1983, both Planet P Project and Carey's earlier album I Won't Be Home Tonight were climbing Billboard's Rock Albums chart simultaneously, with Planet P Project then at #30 and I Won't Be Home Tonight reaching its peak at #8. (The following week Planet P Project had made it up to #15, though I Won't Be Home Tonight had slipped to the #10 position). Planet P Project received modest reviews (e.g., ref and), despite being listed for two weeks by Billboard as a Top Add. The album, however, contained the more highly acclaimed song \\"Why Me\\", which was released as Planet P Project's first popular single, reaching #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #4 in the magazine's Top Rock Tracks chart. According to Carey, the video for \\"Why Me\\" made a \\"slight impact on early MTV.\\" A follow-up single was released from Planet P Project, \\"Static\\", which reached #24 on Billboard's Top Rock Tracks. In 1983 and 1984, Carey recorded his third solo album, the more successful Some Tough City, and his second Planet P Project album, Pink World. A dispute with the label arose when Geffen's representative was not satisfied with the lyrics to \\"A Fine, Fine Day\\" and \\"The First Day of Summer\\". Then the finished Pink World album was not at all well received by the label. Carey said, \\"Long story short, I got traded like a baseball player to MCA Records, which went ahead and released both of these records.\\" In early 1984, MCA released Some Tough City, with the single \\"A Fine, Fine Day\\" reaching #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chartBillboard.com Retrieved 29 Jul 2010 and also #1 on the Top Rock Tracks chart. A follow-up single, \\"The First Day of Summer\\", reached #33 on the Hot 100 in July 1984 and appeared in the 1985 film Secret Admirer. The album itself, Some Tough City, peaked at #60 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Carey opened for Night Ranger on many dates of their 1984 tour in support of this album. In late 1984. MCA released Planet P Project's double LP rock opera, Pink World (#121 on The Billboard 200), for which Carey wrote the lyrics and music, sang all vocals, and played most of the instruments. Session performers on lead guitar, saxophone, synthesizer (and synth programming), and drums on some tracks made up the rest of the project. The single \\"What I See\\" reached #25 on Billboard's Top Rock Tracks. Both the double LP and the single were released on pink vinyl. A single music video for two songs on Pink World, \\"What I See\\" and \\"Behind the Barrier\\", remained in power rotation or active rotation for ten weeks on the MTV network. Carey's 1985 follow-up solo album, Blue Highway, did not score a hit on radio. Carey has stated the album suffered problems unrelated to him but \\"VERY related to 'the producer.'\\" (Emphasis and quotation marks in original.) ===1985–1989: Music producer, composer, film soundtracks=== Carey began producing and guesting on many major groups from the US and Europe in the mid 1980s. Notables of the many included Jennifer Rush in 1985, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers – Chicago Line in 1988, keyboards and producer. In 1992 with Joe Cocker – Now That You're Gone, Forest McDonald's Color Blind, Chris Norman, Peter Maffay, Milva, and in 2006 from Dire Straits, David Knopfler – Songs For The Siren. In a November 12, 2011 interview on Lkcb 128.4 Internet Radio Carey said 'Ive written over a thousand songs, for myself. other artists, and film and TV productions.'. After his 1987 release Bedtime Story (soundtrack for the German film The Joker with Peter Maffay) he recorded a second soundtrack album, called Wilder Western Inclusive, which featured the hit single \\"Room With A View\\" (#3 on the German Charts, 1989), which stayed 18 weeks on the charts and received gold. A third soundtrack followed in 1999, 'Gefangen in Jemen', accompanying Maffay's second film. ===1989–2009: Later releases and the return of Planet P Project=== Carey continued recording and releasing numerous solo albums during this time and producing music for other artists. In 1989, Carey released his album For You, which featured the singles \\"I Feel Good\\" (#35 on the German Charts) and \\"No Man's Land\\" (feat. Eric Burdon and Anne Haigis). Then he released his albums Storyville (1990), The Long Road (1992) and Cold War Kids (1994). Other releases in the early 2000s included 'Island and Deserts' and several live recordings. Planet P Project returned in 2003–2009 with a trilogy of albums collectively called Go Out Dancing (G.O.D.). The albums were 1931 (2003), Levittown (2008), and Out In The Rain (2009). 'Christmas Hymns' and two cd's of cover songs, 'Stanislaus County Kid I & II' followed in 2009/10. In 2014, a box set of the three Planet P Project Go Out Dancing CDs was released, the G.O.D.B.O.X., which included an earlier bootleg of promotional recordings for the project. ===2009–2010: Over the Rainbow, cancer=== In 2009, Tony Carey and three other ex-members of Rainbow, Joe Lynn Turner, Bobby Rondinelli and Greg Smith teamed up with Jürgen Blackmore, Ritchie Blackmore's son, to form Over the Rainbow to perform Rainbow songs in concerts in Russia and Eastern Europe. Due to illness, however, Tony Carey left Over the Rainbow in the spring of 2009, just prior to the band's live debut at the Sweden Rock Festival, where he was replaced by Paul Morris. In March 2009 Carey was diagnosed with a virulent form of bladder cancer. At one point he was told his odds of survival were ten percent. After twelve weeks in the hospital and five surgeries, he made a full recovery. \\"I tried to get my 'bucket list' finished as quickly as I could; it wasn't a certainty that I'd be around much longer,\\" notes Carey. \\"I'm missing some of my organs; you'll be relieved to hear that the Hammond isn't one of them.\\" Carey's former Rainbow bandmate Ronnie James Dio died of stomach cancer shortly after Carey's recovery. Carey said in a May 28, 2010 interview with Jason Saulnier, \\"I'm very sad about his passing, especially because we got essentially the same disease, and I beat it, and he didn't.\\" ===2010: EBC ROXX=== In 2010 it was announced that Tony Carey had formed a new musical racing project called EBC ROXX with (J.R.) Jürgen Blackmore & Ela. Their first single \\"Silver Arrows\\" was released in March 2010 and was written as the anthem to accompany the first race of Mercedes Formula 1 pilots Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg that season. The project released a full CD entitled Winners later that year. ===2013: Second return of Planet P Project=== After officially dismantling \\"Planet P Project\\" in 2009 with the third and final part to the \\"G. O. D.\\"-trilogy - \\"Out In The Rain\\", Carey again revived the project with the release of \\"Steeltown\\" in 2013, this time merging his solo career name with the project's name ( \\"Tony Carey's Planet P Project\\"). Contributors on this disc include guitarist extraordinaire Ronnie Le Tekro (TNT), Jimmy Durand - guitars and drums, Jostein 'sarge' Svarstad - guitars and Russian guitarist Valery Lunichkin soloed on \\"On The Side Of The Angels\\", Karsten Kreppert drums on \\"The Lady Fair\\". \\"Steeltown\\" is based on Norway & its history, after Carey played and travelled there extensively, both as a solo artist, and with a band consisting of mostly Norwegian musicians. Influenced by the occupation years of World War II and the way Norway as a nation handled this, the work is also a statement about the eternal religious conflicts worldwide. There are plans to tour with \\"Tony Carey's Planet P Project\\" in the near future. Carey lives and works in Mainz, Germany. August 11, 2013 marked his 35th anniversary as a European resident. ===2016: Tony Carey's Rainbow Project: The Dio Years=== In 2016 he realized the long- standing dream of TONY CAREY'S RAINBOW PROJECT: The Dio Years with Don Airey and Norwegian Åge Sten Nilsen, then replaced Doogie White.TONY CAREY’S RAINBOW PROJECT: The Dio Years Featuring Åge Sten Nilsen ===2019: Lucky Us=== In 2019, Carey released 'Lucky Us', a return to simpler people-based themes. \\"I wrote 6 political history lessons; I think I've said all I have to say about that for awhile...Lucky Us is also about winning the lottery of life. .\\" ==Discography== Solo *1982 In the Absence of the Cat (vinyl only) (Reissued on CD [200 copies only] and mp3 download 2011) *1982 I Won't Be Home Tonight / Self titled (Reissued 1987/2003) *1984 Some Tough City (Reissued 1992/2008) *1985 Blue Highway (Reissued 1992/2008) *1987 Bedtime Story (Soundtrack, Reissued 1996) *1988 Wilder Westen Inclusive (Soundtrack) *1989 For You (featuring a single with Anne Haigis & Eric Burdon) *1990 Storyville *1992 The Long Road *1994 Cold War Kids *1999 The Boystown Tapes (Reissued 2007) *2004 Islands and Deserts *2006 Live in Sweden 2006 – Volume #1 *2009 Live In Sweden 2006 – Volume #2 *2009 Christmas Hymns (Self released) *2010 Stanislaus County Kid (Self released) *2011 Stanislaus County Kid, Volume II – Crossing the tracks (Self released) *2011 Live in Europe (Self released) *2019 Lucky Us Single Releases only *1981 Jamie (Maxi single) *1988 Midnight wind (B track for Whitney Houston's – 'One moment in time' single, from the 1988 summer Olympic album) *1991 Wenn die Liebe geht – That's not love to me (with Ina Morgan) *1994 Route 66 (Rose T.C.) *1995 Birds in cages *2004 Überall du (German version of 'Room with a view' featuring Mo Casal) Instrumental *1982 Yellow Power (vinyl only) (limited re-release on CD, 2011) *1982 Explorer (vinyl only) (limited re-release on CD, 2011) *1982 Heaven (vinyl only) (limited re-release on CD, 2011) *1982 No Human (vinyl only) *1984 T.C.P.

Recall that the ordinary class group of K is defined to be :C_K = I_K / P_K,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where IK is the group of fractional ideals of K, and PK is the group of principal fractional ideals of K, that is, ideals of the form aOK where a is an element of K. The narrow class group is defined to be the quotient :C_K^+ = I_K / P_K^+, where now PK+ is the group of totally positive principal fractional ideals of K; that is, ideals of the form aOK where a is an element of K such that σ(a) is positive for every embedding :\\\\sigma : K \\\\to \\\\mathbf R. == Uses == The narrow class group features prominently in the theory of representing of integers by quadratic forms. An example is the following result (Fröhlich and Taylor, Chapter V, Theorem 1.25). :Theorem. Suppose that ::K = \\\\mathbf Q(\\\\sqrt d), :where d is a square-free integer, and that the narrow class group of K is trivial. Suppose that ::\\\\\\\\{ \\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2 \\\\\\\\}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :is a basis for the ring of integers of K. Define a quadratic form :: q_K(x,y) = N_{K/\\\\mathbf Q}(\\\\omega_1 x + \\\\omega_2 y), :where NK/Q is the norm. Then a prime number p is of the form :: p = q_K(x,y)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :for some integers x and y if and only if either :: p \\\\mid d_K\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, :or :: p = 2 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad d_K \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 8, :or :: p > 2 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad \\\\left(\\\\frac {d_K} p\\\\right) = 1, :where dK is the discriminant of K, and ::\\\\left(\\\\frac ab\\\\right) :indicates the Legendre symbol. === Examples === For example, one can prove that the quadratic fields Q(), Q(), Q() all have trivial narrow class group. Then, by choosing appropriate bases for the integers of each of these fields, the above theorem implies the following: * A prime p is of the form p = x2 \\\\+ y2 for integers x and y if and only if ::p = 2 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{or} \\\\quad p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 4. : (This is known as Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.) * A prime p is of the form p = x2 − 2y2 for integers x and y if and only if ::p = 2 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{or} \\\\quad p \\\\equiv 1, 7 \\\\pmod 8. * A prime p is of the form p = x2 − xy + y2 for integers x and y if and only if ::p = 3 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{or} \\\\quad p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 3. (cf. Eisenstein prime) An example that illustrates the difference between the narrow class group and the usual class group is the case of Q(). This has trivial class group, but its narrow class group has order 2. Because the class group is trivial, the following statement is true: * A prime p or its inverse –p is of the form ± p = x2 \\\\- 6y2 for integers x and y if and only if ::p = 2 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{or} \\\\quad p = 3 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{or} \\\\quad \\\\left(\\\\frac{6}{p}\\\\right)=1. However, this statement is false if we focus only on p and not -p (and is in fact even false for p = 2), because the narrow class group is nontrivial. The statement that classifies the positive p is the following: * A prime p is of the form p = x2 \\\\- 6y2 for integers x and y if and only if p = 3 or ::\\\\left(\\\\frac{6}{p}\\\\right)=1 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and}\\\\quad \\\\left(\\\\frac{-2}{p}\\\\right)=1. (Whereas the first statement allows primes p\\\\equiv 1, 5, 19, 23\\\\pmod {24}, the second only allows primes p\\\\equiv 1, 19\\\\pmod {24}.) == See also == * Class group * Quadratic form == References == * A.

Loomis is perhaps best known for showing the roots of Arthurian legend, in particular the Holy Grail, in native Celtic mythology. ==Biography== Roger Sherman Loomis was the son of Henry Loomis and Jane Herring Greene, the grandnephew of William Maxwell Evarts, and the great-great-grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. Born on October 31, 1887, in Yokohama, Japan, he was educated at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College in 1909, a Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1910, and, as a Rhodes Scholar, a Bachelor of Letters (BLitt) degree at New College, Oxford, in 1913. His BLitt dissertation, written under the supervision of Arthur Napier and C. F. Bell, was titled Illustrations of the Romances in Mediæval English Art. He held honorary degrees from Columbia, Williams, the University of Wales, and the University of Rennes in France. He was an instructor at the University of Illinois at Urbana from 1913 to 1918. During the First World War he edited an Army publication Atenshun 21. He left Illinois for Columbia University, where he taught from 1919 until 1958: he was a member of Columbia's English faculty and held an emeritus position there from 1958 until his death in 1966. In 1919, also, Loomis married his first wife, Gertrude Schoepperle Loomis, (1882–1921), a medieval scholar who shared his interest in Arthurian literature (Folklore 38.4 1927 405–407). Truro, Cornwall, in August 1930 Arthurian Society meeting From his early years he studied the influence of Celtic mythology on Arthurian legend, especially the Holy Grail romance. In 1930 Loomis attended the first International Arthurian Congress in Truro, Cornwall, where he, Henry Jenner, Dominica Legge, Eugène Vinaver, and other scholars investigated Arthurian legends. He was a member of the International Arthurian Society (president of American Branch, 1948–1963), the Modern Language Association, the Mediaeval Academy of America (fellow; second vice-president, 1961–1964), the Modern Humanities Research Association, and the American Humanist Association. In 1955–1956 he was an Eastman Professor at the University of Oxford. Loomis wrote ten scholarly books and numerous journal articles. His book A Mirror of Chaucer's World, published in 1965 by Princeton, is a pictorial presentation of drawings, sculpture, paintings and other materials related to Geoffrey Chaucer and his age. His most notable book Arthurian Tradition and Chrétien de Troyes, published by Columbia University in 1949, won the Haskins Medal of the Mediaeval Academy of America. After the death of his first wife in 1921, Loomis married Laura Alandis Hibbard (1883–1960), with whom he collaborated in many of his research and writing efforts. He dedicated one of his final volumes to Gertrude Schoepperle Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis \\"in grateful and loving remembrance\\" (The Grail: From Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol published by the University of Wales 1963; and later by Princeton University, in 1991). Loomis died on October 11, 1966, in Waterford, Connecticut. ==Works== *Illustrations of Medieval Romance on Tiles from Chertsey Abbey (1916) *Freshman Readings (1925) *Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance (1927) *The Art of Writing Prose (1930) with Mabel Louise Robinson, Helen Hull and Paul Cavanaugh *Models for Writing Prose (1931) *The Romance of Tristram and Ysolt (1931) translator *Tristan and Isolt: A study of the Sources of the Romance by Gertrude Schoepperle Loomis, 2d ed., expanded by a bibliography and critical essay on Tristan scholarship since 1912, by Roger Sherman Loomis (New York, B.

In August 1986, the first Catholic Answers Newsletter was published. In January 1990, Catholic Answers published the monthly magazine This Rock. For nine years, Keating served as the editor. In 1988, Keating changed careers and went into apologetics full-time. He has given talks throughout the United States, and has engaged in public debates with Protestants. He has been a columnist for The Wanderer, the National Catholic Register and the Canadian Catholic Review. He has also acted as expert on EWTN's Questions and Answers forum. His avocations include mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, and \\"Jeeping.\\" A 2004 complaint to the Internal Revenue Service by the pro-choice organization Catholics for a Free Choice led to an IRS investigation of Catholic Answers that Keating described as costly and onerous. As a result, he formed a new organization with a separate 501(c)(4) tax status, called Catholic Answers Action, that continued publishing his Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics.Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics This instructs readers not to vote for candidates who would vote for legalisation of any of five \\"non-negotiable\\" issues (abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, human cloning, and gay marriage). Some Catholic dioceses in California and WisconsinDiocesan Lawyers Continue to Ban Voting Guides had earlier attempted to suppress this voting guide in 2004. No official endorsement of this guide has been offered by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops or any official Church body. ==Books== * Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\" (Ignatius Press, 1988) * What Catholics Really Believe (Servant Publications, 1992) * Nothing but the Truth: Essays in Apologetics (Catholic Answers Press, 2000) * The Usual Suspects: Answering Anti-Catholic Fundamentalists (Ignatius Press, 2000) * Controversies: High-Level Catholic Apologetics (Ignatius Press, 2001) * Jeremiah's Lament (Rasselas House, 2015) * No Apology (Rasselas House, 2015) * Anti-Catholic Junk Food (Rasselas House, 2015) * The New Geocentrists (Rasselas House, 2015) * Apologetics the English Way (Rasselas House, 2015) * How to Fail at Hiking Mt.

The original team debuted in X-Force #8 (March 1992), created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld. ==Team biography== When Stryfe travels to the present, Cable follows him with the aim of stopping Stryfe's plans as well as preventing Apocalypse's rise to power. Cable forms a group initially called the Wild Pack, but conflict with Silver Sable (who already had a group called the Wild Pack) forces him to change the name to the Six Pack. Cable travels between the present and his future with his ship Graymalkin, which contained a sentient computer program called Professor (the future version of the program built into X-Factor's Ship). The Six Pack performs many brutal missions, often with a high body count. Later, they are hired by Mr. Tolliver, which puts them in direct conflict with Stryfe. In their last mission, Cable and the Pack confront Stryfe, who gains the upper hand. Hammer decides to surrender vital information to Stryfe, forcing Cable to shoot him in the back. Cable escapes via time-travel, unable to take his friends along. They escape themselves but Hammer ends up paralyzed and Garrison Kane loses both of his arms. Kane is granted robotic arms by the Weapon X program. G.W. Bridge, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. now, acts as liaison to Weapon X. Kane undertakes a mission to destroy Cable. Hammer provides him with vital information and Kane and Cable battle until circumstances bring them together to battle Stryfe once again. Kane's arms are destroyed and Cable uses his time-travel capabilities to take him to the far future. His arms are replaced with liquid metal versions. Domino, Hammer, Kane, and Grizzly operate for some time on their own. In one incident, they battle then team up with the vigilante Nomad. Later, Grizzly goes mad and begins killing people. Domino, after a long battle, is forced to kill him. The original Six Pack X-Force #8 ===Recent developments=== Recently the group has been reformed by S.H.I.E.L.D. under the leadership of G.W. Bridge for the purpose of attacking Cable.Cable & Deadpool #7-12 New members include Constrictor, a mercenary who once shared an apartment with Deadpool, Anaconda, who was formerly employed by the Serpent Society, and Solo, a vigilante bio-teleporter with a penchant for attacking terrorists. Rounding out the group is longtime Six Pack member Hammer. Following their failed attempt to defeat Cable, G.W. and Hammer are placed in suspended animation, while Domino is \\"converted\\" to Cable's side. Solo, Constrictor, and Anaconda join Cable in exchange for money. They are later sent to find Cable, but are trapped in his mind, which is quickly fading away. However, they are all eventually saved by Deadpool and the Fixer, and returned to their bodies. Constrictor eventually abandoned the group, and was, unbeknownst to the reader, replaced by Deadpool. The Six Pack was hired by the American Government to commit acts of terrorism against the fictional country of Rumekistan, being led at this point by Cable. The objective was to taint Cable's reputation so as to crumble his secure reign over the country. They did not succeed, however, as it was all seemingly a part of Cable's \\"Plan.\\" Deadpool also seems to have left the group after their defeat at Cable's hands. The captured Six Pack members are returned to their respective countries by Rumekistan forces. ==Other versions== ===Ultimate Marvel=== :When Six Pack appear, members include Cable, Domino, Hammer, Garrison Kane and Grizzly; Bishop was a member, but sides with the X-Men against Cable.Ultimate X-Men #76 Instead of being assembled in the present, the Six Pack comes from Cable's future, as Grizzly is still a teenager in the present. ==Hammer (Eisenhower Canty)== Hammer was an ally to the mutant Cable and a member of the Six Pack. Hammer appeared in Cable & Deadpool as part of a new 'Six-Pack'. They are hired by the U.S. government as part of a public relations mission against Cable, who by that point was ruling two separate countries. Hammer assists in a raid against the fictional Rumekistan; the intent is to disrupt its recently modified electrical grid and discredit Cable. Eisenhower \\"Ike\\" Canty appears as a member of the Six Pack.Ultimate X-Men #76 He is a large black male with seemingly superhuman strength. This version shows an admiration for the future version of Bobby Drake, claiming of the present one that 'It's been an honor to kick his ass'. ==References== Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza Category:Characters created by Rob Liefeld Category:Fictional mercenaries ","title":"Six Pack (comics)"},{"id":"2567792","text":"Guarapero/Lost Blues 2 is an album by Will Oldham, released in 2000.

The Bermondsey-based club ground-shared at Champion Hill Stadium, the home of Dulwich Hamlet. They were wound up by the High Court, after failing to repay their debts, on 13 May 2009. However, it was announced on 29 May that a new club, Fisher F.C., had been formed. The new club was elected to the Kent League for the 2009–10 season. ==History== The club was founded in 1908 by Michael Culiton, headmaster at Dockland School, to provide sporting facilities for underprivileged youths of Bermondsey. The club was named after the Catholic martyr Saint John Fisher. They are thus one of the few sports clubs in the world to take their name from a person. The club's closest neighbour was fellow \\"dockers\\" Millwall, but as the two teams rarely met in a competitive match there was no strong rivalry. Dulwich Hamlet were often considered the team's closest rivals, despite the former groundshare. The team competed in various district leagues before moving in 1961 to the Parthenon League where they stayed until the end of the 1965/66 season. At this point the club folded and reformed, this time based in Mitcham, joining the Western Section of the Kent Amateur League for the 1967–68 season. Fisher were elected to the Spartan League in 1975 and won back-to-back championships in 1980–81 and 1981–82. The latter season coincided with a move to their present home, the purpose-built stadium at Surrey Docks. Fisher were elected to the Southern League's Southern Division for the 1982–83 season and won the championship at the first attempt, earning promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. 1984–85 saw Fisher reach the first round of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 to Bristol City. In 1986–87 they won the Southern League title and were promoted to the Football Conference. The following year brought another run to the first round of the FA Cup where the 'Fish' again lost 1–0, their nemesis this time being Bristol Rovers. Fisher's success came to an end in 1990–91 when they finished bottom of the Conference and dropped back to the Southern League Premier Division. The following season brought a second successive relegation, to the Southern League Southern Division, where they remained until the turn of the millennium, generally finishing in mid-table. ===Final seasons=== The 1999–2000 season saw the club win the Southern League Eastern Division. However Fisher's success was short-lived, as after just one season in the Southern League Premier Division they were relegated back into the Eastern Division, where in the following season they finished 6th. The following two season saw mid-table finishes, with Wayne Burnett taking over the managerial hotseat in February 2004. Off the field planning permission has been granted for a major redevelopment of the Surrey Docks Stadium and new chairman Sami Muduroglu signalled his intentions with a raft of top signings to push Fisher back towards the heady heights of the Conference and this paid instant dividends in 2004-5 with the Southern League Division One East title and the London Senior Cup. The 'Fish' were promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division for the 2005–06 season. Wayne Burnett resigned as manager for personal reasons on 21 November 2005. Under Justin Edinburgh Fisher finished third in the Isthmian League Premier Division that season, in addition to winning the Isthmian League Cup and London Senior Cup, and beat Hampton & Richmond Borough 3–0 in the play-off final to win promotion to Conference South. The 2006–07 season saw the club finish in 10th place in the Conference South under Edinburgh. Wayne Burnett returned to the club in the summer of 2007, and assembled a supremely talented squad. The Fish played superb attacking football in 2007–08, but ended up finishing 4th, and losing to Hampton & Richmond Borough in the play-offs, the side they had beaten to win promotion two years before. The summer of 2008 saw a player exodus, with six of the previous season's squad moving to Football League clubs. The club's financial difficulties came to a head in the 2008–09 season, as massive debts were found to be piling up. The club stopped paying players in November 2008, then a winding-up order for unpaid income tax issued by the High Court was, on 13 March 2009, adjourned for 49 days until 22 April, and then adjourned for a further 21 days to 13 May 2009. On 18 February 2009 the club claimed to have made history when turnstile operator Donna Powell became one of the first females to manage a male football club in Britain, having raised £250 for the ailing club, although she was unable to prevent Fisher losing 2–1 to Eastleigh.Fisher place faith in manageress BBC News Sport, 17 February 2009 However, she was not actually a manager in the true sense of the term, just a publicity stunt, as Dave Mehmet was never actually relieved of the position. Droylsden had become the first British men's football club to play matches under a female manager following a disagreement between manager Dave Pace and the Manchester F.A. in 2000.Donna Powell may not be the first female manager but she gave Fisher hope (Daily Telegraph blog) accessed 28 July 2010 This result came during a run of sixteen consecutive league defeats between 19 November and 9 March, which saw the club eventually relegated on 28 March.Conference South Table, 31 March 2009 BBC Sport, 31 March 2009 ===Fisher reformed=== Following a meeting in Bermondsey on the evening of 28 May, a supporters trust was formed to take control of all forthcoming club matters, with 42 founding members. Chairman, Martin Eede and club president, Barry Albin-Dyer continue their roles, with several new faces taking more established roles in the running of the club. This meeting announced AFC Fisher as the working title, before finally deciding on Fisher F.C. The club continued to play their home games at the Champion Hill Stadium, and began be playing in the Kent League. ==Stadium== The club's traditional home was the 5,300-capacity Surrey Docks Stadium in Rotherhithe, in the London Borough of Southwark, but home games were played at the ground of Dulwich Hamlet while the Surrey Docks Stadium was redeveloped. The Surrey Docks Stadium is located in the heart of South London's Docklands area, just down the road from the Surrey Quays shopping mall and a short distance from The Den in nearby Bermondsey. The club had plans to redevelop the ground to bring it up to Football League standards by the start of the 2009–10 season. In November 2007 the club announced that it would prefer to move to a new 10,000-seat stadium on the site of the athletics track in Southwark Park,Stadium Proposal Announced Fisher Athletic, 16 November 2007 but that the rebuilding of Surrey Docks Stadium remained a possibility.Olympic Dream – A £35 Million Stadium, Southwark News, 15 November 2007. == Honours == * London Senior Cup ** Winners 1984–85, 1987–88, 1988–89, 2004–05, 2005–06 == References == ==External links== *Match report from 2010/11 season Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Defunct football clubs in London Category:National League (English football) Category:Sport in the London Borough of Southwark Category:Association football clubs established in 1908 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2009 Category:Parthenon League Category:Southern Football League clubs Category:Isthmian League Category:1908 establishments in England Category:2009 disestablishments in England ","title":"Fisher Athletic F.C."},{"id":"2567807","text":"Jablonskia congesta is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Phyllanthaceae.

He was an exceptionally fast bowler. ==Early years== Gilbert was taken from his home near Woodford at the age of three as part of a government policy on Aboriginal people and grew up on farms while living in the Barambah Aboriginal Reserve, now known as Cherbourg, north of Brisbane. He took up cricket at a young age, initially playing as a slow bowler but quickly developing pace cultivated through a flexible wrist that he said was from years of hard work and practice. ==First class career== After playing with the State Colts in 1930, Gilbert was selected in the Queensland Sheffield Shield team in 1931. Gilbert was probably only the fifth Aboriginal Australian to play first-class cricket in Australia, after Twopenny in 1870, Johnny Mullagh in 1879, Jack Marsh in 1900, and Albert Henry in 1902. (Note that the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England was not considered first-class.) In his career, Gilbert played in 19 Sheffield Shield matches, taking 73 wickets at an average of 29.75. A further 14 wickets were taken off touring MCC, West Indies and South African sides. In one match against the touring West Indian team, he took 5/65. Despite his success, it is unlikely that he was ever seriously considered for the Australian Test team due to doubts about his action, his Aboriginality and the fact that he represented Queensland, then a relatively weak team. ==The era of 'protection'== As an Aboriginal man living in Queensland in 1931, Eddie Gilbert was bound by the restrictions of the Protection of Aboriginals Act 1897. This meant that he needed written permission to travel from his Aboriginal settlement each time he played in a first-class match. Reference to his correspondence survives in the Queensland State Archives. (QSA A/4736, Home Secretary, Register of Letters Received, 1931, Extracts - Aborigines General). ==Dismissing Bradman== Gilbert dismisses Bradman for a duck in November 1931 On 6 November 1931 in a match against NSW at the recently opened Brisbane Cricket Ground (the \\"Gabba\\") in Brisbane, he dismissed opener Wendell Bill for a duck with his first ball. The incoming batsman was Don Bradman. Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but he somehow managed to keep the first ball out. The second was a harmless one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but he got back to his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, but it was too quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/don-bradman- and-his-ducks-179098 Bradman recalled years later that the five deliveries he faced from Gilbert in that match were the fastest he had experienced in his career. Bradman said The keeper took the ball over his head, and I reckon it was halfway to the boundary and that the balls from Gilbert were unhesitatingly faster than anything seen from Larwood or anyone else. Although as he added in his autobiography, Bradman thought Gilbert's action was 'decidedly suspect'. Gilbert played against Bradman on two more occasions, as well as Douglas Jardine during the infamous 1932/33 Bodyline tour. ==Bowling action== Gilbert in his follow-through Though he had a controversial action he was called only once for throwing and that for jerking his wrist. Importantly the straightness of his arm was never contradicted by umpires. The occasion of him being called was the match between Victoria and Queensland at the MCG in 1931. The umpire Andrew Barlow, no-balled him 13 times for his action. Alan McGilvray said he had \\"absolutely no doubt\\" that Gilbert was \\"the fastest bowler I ever saw\\" and that \\"no matter how I analyse cricket down the years, I cannot imagine anybody bowling a ball faster than Eddie Gilbert\\". Of the legality of Gilbert's action, McGilvray commented, \\"It was hard to tell whether he actually chucked or not, because he let the ball go with such a fling of his right arm you got precious little sight of it.\\"Alan McGilvray, The Game Goes On, ABC Books, Sydney, 1987, pp. 111-12. ==Retirement== Gilbert retired from the game in 1936 due to poor form whereupon officials in the Queensland Cricket Board and the Aboriginal Protectorate arranged for his return to an Aboriginal settlement. Gilbert died at the Wolston Park Hospital near Brisbane on 9 January 1978, aged 72 after many years of ill health due to alcoholism and mental illness. In 2015 Gilbert's son Barney unveiled the sign at the dedication of the Eddie Gilbert Memorial Field near the hospital, with folk singer Dermot Dorgan offering his tribute song \\"Eddie Gilbert\\" about the life and struggles of the iconic fast bowler.Gould, J. (9 July 2015) A field of dreams for Aboriginal bowler who bounced Bradman Queensland Times ==Recognition== In 2007 Queensland Cricket erected a bronze statue of Gilbert in Greg Chappell Street, outside Allan Border Field, Albion.

Brother Eadulf has become Saxmundham's most famous international fictional character, through the best-selling Sister Fidelma mysteries by Peter Tremayne (a pseudonym of the Celtic scholar and author Peter Berresford Ellis). Brother Eadulf, as companion and assistant to Sister Fidelma, often plays a crucial part in resolving the mystery. He is introduced as originally the hereditary gerefa (magistrate) of \\"Seaxmund's Ham in the land of the South Folk.\\" He attends the famous Synod of Whitby in AD 664 and joins Sister Fidelma in solving a murder of one of the delegates (Absolution by Murder, 1994). He has since appeared in most of the novels and some of the short stories, although the Saxmundham area has been used as a setting in only one of the novels: The Haunted Abbot (2002). Tremayne chose Saxmundham as Eadulf's place of origin because of local connections, the nearness of the town to an ancient royal burial site of the East Angles, and the historic East Anglian connections with Irish Christian missionaries. He appears in all but two of the Sister Fidelma series of mystery novels, set in 7th century Ireland. The series has now reached 31 published titles, appearing in a score of languages.

GEM is an ETSI standard (ETSI TS 102 819, ETSI TS 102 728) and an ITU \\"Recommendation” (ITU-T J.202). GEM defines a set of common functionalities which are independent from the signaling and protocols of a specific transmission network and enables to write interoperable Java applications for TV. GEM is not intended to be directly implemented, but rather forms the basis for broader specifications targeting a particular network infrastructure (e.g. US cable) or class of device (e.g. Blu-ray Disc players). GEM defines profiles for different device classes (targets) these define the set of available features of GEM for this device class. Currently GEM defines targets (API profiles) for broadcast, packaged media (Blu-Ray) and IPTV. Combinations of these targets can be combined into a hybrid GEM platform, which enables to build devices with multiple network interfaces, such as a combined broadcast/IPTV set-top box. ==History== A few years ago, the DVB project started the development of a Java-based application platform (a set of APIs), called MHP, intended to support software applications running on digital television platforms. Such applications could include Electronic Program Guides (EPG's), interactivity, Video on Demand (VOD), email through your television, etc. The MHP specification defines the download of MHP applications (\\"xlets\\") over transmission networks based on other DVB specifications (i.e. over-the-air or terrestrial networks using DVB-T, satellite networks using DVB-S, cable networks using DVB-C). As other specification bodies such as CableLabs and the Blu-ray Disc Association chose to base their own DTV software standards on MHP it became necessary to define a subset of MHP which removes the transmission-related elements of the MHP specification but retains the application API's, thus allowing broad content compatibility across a range of delivery platforms. In January 2010, the DVB project made GEM the primary middleware specification and released a self- contained version of GEM in ETSI TS 102 728, citing MHP only as one of many already-existing implementations. ==Platforms== At the time of writing, the following platforms are defined, which base on/extend GEM: * the Multimedia Home Platform (MHP), the open, multi-platform middleware specification developed by the DVB project, * the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP / tru2way), which is an Interactive television (iTV) middleware software layer for US cable, * the Advanced Common Application Platform (ACAP) from North America's ATSC, * GEM-IPTV, a version of GEM developed by DVB intended for telco-based networks, * the ARIB B.23 specification from Japan's ARIB, * the PAE specification in the Open IPTV Forum, * BD-J the Java-platform for the Blu-ray Disc. As all these platforms are based on the common GEM-core, making it possible to write Java applications that will run interoperably on all these systems. ==See also== * Digital Video Broadcasting * Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV * 10-foot user interface * Enhanced TV * Interactive television * Over-the-top content ==External links== * Official GEM and MHP website * Digital Video Broadcasting * European Telecommunications Standards Institute * The Online ITV Dictionary ==References== Category:Java platform Category:Digital television Category:Interactive television Category:Blu-ray Disc ","title":"Globally Executable MHP"},{"id":"2567828","text":"Thy Mighty Contract is the first full-length album by Greek extreme metal band Rotting Christ, released in late 1993 on Osmose Productions.

About.com featured the album as a Retro Recommendation and criticised the drums for being “too loud, and given the repetitive beats played, it becomes distracting at times.

The film revolves around two disabled young men who pursue physical and emotional independence in direct defiance of \\"protective\\" institutional living and their society's prevailing standards and attitudes, especially pity. Rory O'Shea is always mean towards Michael and later helps him get out of the nursing home The production was filmed in Dublin and Wicklow and involved production companies Working Title Films and StudioCanal with assistance from the Irish Film Board (Bord Scannán na hÉireann). The two lead actors in this film do not actually have physical disabilities, leading some to criticise it for casting non- disabled actors in to disability roles. This criticism is especially poignant given that the character of Michael is portrayed as having a rather pronounced version of athetoid cerebral palsy when in fact the actor who portrays him is entirely physically able. ==Plot== Michael Connolly is a 24-year-old with cerebral palsy who is a long-term resident of the Carrigmore Residential Home for the Disabled run by the formidable Eileen. His life, mundane and schedule- driven by the institution's authorities, is transformed when the maverick Rory O'Shea, who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, suddenly moves in. Michael is stunned to discover that fast talking Rory, prone to lewd and/or overt jokes at unpredictable intervals, and who can move only his right hand, can understand his almost unintelligible speech. Rory's dynamic and rebellious nature soon sparks a flame in Michael, introducing him to the wider world outside of Carrigmore. On a day out in Dublin led by Carrigmore collecting for \\"the needs of the disabled\\", Rory leads Michael astray, sneaking off to a local pub with their donation bucket, charming a group of girls at a corner table at which sits Siobhán; later they see Siobhán again while traversing a neighbouring nightclub, which they get into only by Michael citing Irish and EU Disability Discrimination Law text to the bouncer. Rory has meanwhile repeatedly failed in his application for the Independent Living Allowance; he is always denied that on the grounds of irresponsibility and poor judgement, but told to reapply in six months. Inspired by his example Michael applies for the allowance himself; with the help of Rory as his interpreter Michael gets the allowance but they struggle to find an apartment that is both wheelchair accessible and affordable. Rory convinces Michael to visit his estranged father who, out of guilt, gives them the money and property they need to set up on their own. They interview for a care-giver with little success, but later they meet Siobhán working in a local supermarket, and try to convince her to take on the job. Despite not having any professional experience she reluctantly accepts. Seeing that Michael and Siobhán are platonically friendly to each other, Rory becomes jealous – culminating in a joyride with local kids in a stolen car, crashing it, subsequently getting briefly detained by the police. Siobhán invites Rory and Michael along to a costume party; but after Siobhán rejects Michaels advances she decides to bring in Peter, a qualified Personal Assistant to replace herself. Michael is distraught over Siobhán's departure from their lives, and considering suicide; Rory finds him on the edge of the James Joyce Bridge. Michael jokingly complains the edge is too high for him to throw himself off, and Rory talks him out of it, reminding him he has a future and to enjoy it. Later, Michael finds Rory in his bed struggling to breathe, and calls for an ambulance. His disease having progressed, Rory is given only a few days to live. Michael visits Siobhán and with her help goes to the review board on behalf of Rory to argue his case, another chance having come up after six months. The board initially refuse, restating the same arguments, however Michael responds that \\"the right must exist independently of its exercising\\" and as a gesture the board approve Rory's independent living allowance in principle – but before they can get to the hospital to tell Rory the news, he has already died. Michael and Siobhan attend Rory's funeral. Michael hears in his mind Rory's words \\"Well, then, are we going out?\\" and after saying goodbye to Siobhan, Michael heads out on his own. ==Cast== * James McAvoy as Rory Gerard O'Shea, a rebellious young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy * Steven Robertson as Michael Connolly, a 24-year-old long-term resident with cerebral palsy * Romola Garai as Siobhán, a young woman they employ as a caregiver * Brenda Fricker as Eileen, a domineering care worker at Michael's care home * Gerard McSorley as Fergus Connolly, Michael's father who abandoned him at birth * Tom Hickey as Con O'Shea, Rory's father * Alan King as Tommy * Ruth McCabe as Annie * Anna Healy as Alice * Deirdre O'Kane (cameo) as a caregiver applicant == Production == Writer Christian O'Reilly came up with the story after working with Martin Naughton, and Dermot Walsh, on a campaign for the Centre for Independent Living in Dublin. ==Music== The film features Johnny Cash's cover version of \\"Hurt\\". Siobhan asks Rory \\"Were you born like this ... dodgy hair and shit taste in music?\\" and plays the Cash song for him. * \\"Beat for Two\\" – Elbow * \\"Frontier Psychiatrist\\" – The Avalanches * \\"Hurt\\" (Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails) – Johnny Cash * \\"Look of Love\\" – Dusty Springfield * \\"Easy\\" – Groove Armada ==Critical response== Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 49% based on 69 reviews, with a rating average of 5.8 out of 10. The site's general consensus is that \\"The dramatic aspects of Rory O'Shea Was Here veer into mawkish, formulaic sentiment, which undercuts the characters' individuality.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score gives the film 59% based on 23 reviews. Neil Smith, reviewing for the BBC, gave the film 4/5 stars but felt casting non-disabled actors undermined the film. Members of the worldwide disability rights and inclusion communities have mixed opinions on the film. It is not always cited, for example, as a top pick in film festival events led by and for disabled people. These critics sometimes imply that the film does not quite go far enough in lampooning and dismantling pity/heroism attitudes, and that some sectors of the film (mostly in relation to camera angles and music) actually play into those attitudes, possibly without realising it. Similarly to other critics, critics with disabilities also point out that there was no readily apparent reason to exclude actors with disabilities from consideration from the two lead roles. Neither of the two lead actors is actually physically disabled, when in fact at a minimum, it would have been a relatively easy exercise for the filmmakers to have at least located one young, skilled actor with actual cerebral palsy to play the role of Michael. ==References== ==External links== * official site, archived copy from 2006 provided by the Internet Archive * * Category:2004 films Category:2004 comedy-drama films Category:Irish films Category:Irish comedy-drama films Category:British films Category:British comedy-drama films Category:French films Category:French comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about people with cerebral palsy Category:Films set in Dublin (city) Category:Films shot in Ireland Category:Irish independent films Category:StudioCanal films Category:Working Title Films films Category:British independent films Category:French independent films Category:Films directed by Damien O'Donnell Category:Films scored by David Julyan Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Caine Category:2004 independent films ","title":"Inside I'm Dancing"},{"id":"2567848","text":"Passage to Arcturo is the first EP by Greek extreme metal band Rotting Christ, released in 1991.

Originally established in 1933 by the UK Government as the Road Research Laboratory (RRL), it was privatised in 1996. Its motto or tagline is 'The Future of Transport'. ==History== TRL was originally established in 1933 by the UK Government as the Road Research Laboratory (RRL) under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), and later became the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) in 1972. During the Second World War, the Laboratory contributed to the war effort. Among its contributions, under William Glanville, were research that aided the development of plastic armour, the bouncing bomb and the Disney bomb. During governmental reorganisation in the 1970s, the TRRL moved from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to the Department of the Environment (DoE). At the TRRL, Frank Blackmore developed the mini-roundabout and its associated 'priority rule', which was adopted in 1975. With the encouragement of the UK Department of Transport, TRRL was instrumental in promoting cooperation with other European laboratories. In 1989, TRRL's initiative to create a Forum of European National Highway Research Laboratories led to its hosting of the inaugural meeting. It became an executive agency of the UK Department for Transport (DfT) in 1992, and changed its name for the last time to the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). It was privatised in 1996, though earlier plans in 1994 for a proposed privatisation were criticised at the time, notably by former Transport Minister Barbara Castle. ==Operations== TRL is based in Crowthorne, Berkshire, with additional offices in Edinburgh and Birmingham. TRL's key areas of work include road, network and vehicle safety; traffic management; planning and control; investigations and risk management; transport infrastructure; and environmental assessment, including work on climate change, noise and air pollution. ===Software=== TRL has produced industry-standard software including Junctions, TRANSYT and SCOOT. ==Site redevelopment== The extensive Crowthorne site has been substantially scaled back, with many of the original buildings disused, creating an opportunity for redevelopment. In 2012, Bracknell Council identified the original site as a strategic area, suitable for a new mini-town of 1,000 homes. ==Corporate affairs== To maintain its commercial independence and impartiality, TRL is owned by the Transport Research Foundation (TRF), a non-profit distributing foundation, overseen by 80 sector members from the transport industry. The TRF is classed as a non-profit distributing organisation (NPDO), a form of business structure where all profits are reinvested in services or business growth, rather than being distributed to shareholders. TRL's profits are invested in its own research programmes, selected by the TRF to enhance knowledge in critical areas such as safety, environmental impact and sustainable development. ==See also== *Vehicle Certification Agency *Type approval *United Kingdom driving test *Zebra crossing *MIRA Ltd. *SHARP (helmet ratings) *Slough experiment ==References== ==External links== *https://TRL.co.uk — TRL Limited official website **TRL Software — official outlet of TRL Limited *Transport-Links.org — contains many developing country RRL/TRRL/TRL documents, manuals, for free download Category:1933 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Government agencies established in 1933 Category:Transport research organizations Category:Transport in the United Kingdom Category:Engineering research institutes Category:Laboratories in the United Kingdom Category:Privatised executive agencies of the United Kingdom government Category:Research institutes in Berkshire Category:Wokingham Category:Companies based in Berkshire Category:Private companies limited by guarantee of the United Kingdom ","title":"Transport Research Laboratory"},{"id":"2567872","text":"Nothobaccaurea is a genus of flowering plant belonging to the family Phyllanthaceae, first described as a genus in 2000.Haegens, Raoul Martin Anne Peter. 2000.

William Justin Kroll (born Guillaume Justin Kroll; November 24, 1889 - March 30, 1973) was a Luxembourgish metallurgist. He is best known for inventing the Kroll process in 1940, which is used commercially to extract metallic titanium from ore. ==Biography== In 1909, Wilhelm Kroll graduated from Luxembourg's Athenaeum High School, and in 1910, he registered at the faculty of metallurgy at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg in Berlin, graduating in 1914. He spent the next four years there to complete his doctoral thesis under the guidance of legendary professor K. A. Hofmann. Working in Germany, in 1918, Kroll invented a very efficient bearing alloy based on lead, commercialized under the name Lurgi metal and he was awarded various metallurgy related patents. In Austria in 1922, he developed alloys known as Alusil and Alsia used primarily for cast-aluminum pistons. In 1923, Kroll returned to Luxembourg and set up a private laboratory. Kroll invented precipitation hardening (PH) stainless steel in 1929, when he added a small amount of titanium to stainless steel and strengthened it by thermally precipitating TiC particles.H.M. Cobb, The History of Stainless Steel, ASM International, 2010, p 191, . In the 1930s he began focusing on the study of titanium and its alloys. Before Kroll, titanium as a metal was a laboratory curiosity. In 1938, titanium was machined for the first time at the Cerametal factory in Bereldange, Luxembourg. William Kroll visited the US, arriving in New York aboard the SS Queen Mary from Cherbourg, France on October 18, 1938. He called on various US non-ferrous industries, showing his titanium samples, but there was little to no interest in titanium at the time. Disappointed, he returned to Luxembourg. As the Nazi cloud began to spread over Germany in 1940 Wilhelm J. Kroll elected to emigrate to the United States. He arrived in New York on February 22, 1940, having sailed from Rotterdam, The Netherlands aboard the SS Volendam on February 10, 1940. On May 10, 1940, German troops invaded Luxembourg, occupying the country for the next four years. On June 25, 1940, the United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded patent 2,205,854 for Kroll's method of manufacturing titanium and alloys thereof, filed on July 6, 1938. On December 4, 1940, Kroll applied for US citizenship. He worked as a consulting engineer for Union Carbide Research Laboratories at Niagara Falls, New York. As the US declared war on the Axis nations in December 1941, Kroll's patent was forfeited by the US government as falling under the Alien Property Custodian act prompting a seven-year litigation, ending in favor of William Kroll, though litigation fees of over $1 million ate up the compensation awarded. Slowly the US government and the industry began to recognize the potential of titanium. The US government established a research center in Boulder, Colorado in 1944, and in late 1948, Dupont de Nemours began the commercial production of titanium using the Kroll process. Meanwhile, Kroll's focus had turned to zirconium. He became a consulting metallurgist to the United States, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines in 1945 at their research facility at Albany, Oregon. The first zirconium strip was rolled out there in August 1946. In 1951, William Kroll joined the Oregon State University, established a non-profit Metal Research Foundation awarding scholarships and grants in the USA and in Europe. Dr. William J. Kroll returned to Europe in 1961 where he died in Brussels on March 30, 1973. One of his lasting legacies in the United States is the Kroll Institute at the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, established in 1974: \\"The Kroll Institute for Extractive Metallurgy (KIEM) was established in 1974 in accordance with a bequest from William J. Kroll, world-renowned extractive metallurgist best known for his inventions of processes for the production of titanium and zirconium. The financial resources of Dr. Kroll's bequest were intended to provide for the establishment of a Center for Excellence in Extractive Metallurgy at the Colorado School of Mines. Since its inception, the Kroll Institute has provided financial support to both undergraduate and graduate students at CSM, many of whom, subsequently, have made important contributions, nationally and internationally, to the fields of mining, minerals, metals and advanced materials.\\" ==Honors and awards== Kroll was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2000. The Centre Drosbach in Luxembourg is located at the rue Guillaume Kroll Among his other awards were the Francis J. Clamer Medal in 1954, the Albert Sauveur Achievement Award from the American Society for Metals in 1955E.T. Hayes, \\"A Biographical Appreciation,\\" Metal Progress, Vol. 70 #2, Aug 1956, p 86-88. and the Perkin Medal in 1958. He was also awarded the Acheson Award by the Electrochemical Society in 1958. Kroll has a street named after him in Luxembourg City, in the business district of Gasperich, and in Esch-sur- Alzette. In September 2018, a vocational high school in Esch/Alzette in Luxembourg, Lycée technique d'Esch-sur-Alzette, changed its name to Lycée Guillaume-Kroll. ==References== ==External links== * Inventors Hall of Fame page Category:1889 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Luxembourgian inventors Category:Luxembourgian emigrants to the United States Category:Luxembourgian metallurgists Category:People from Esch-sur-Alzette Category:Alumni of the Athénée de Luxembourg Category:Oregon State University faculty Category:People from Albany, Oregon Category:20th-century inventors ","title":"William Justin Kroll"},{"id":"2567875","text":"Tristan Ann Prettyman (born May 23, 1982) is an American singer-songwriter and former Roxy model from San Diego, California.

He graduated from Islamia College, Lahore. == Cricket Career == Jahangir, who hailed from a Pashtun family, was a big man who stood six feet and bowled medium pace. He came from a famous cricketing family that produced Pakistan captains Baqa Jilani, Imran Khan (who would later become the Prime Minister of Pakistan), Javed Burki and Majid Khan, the last being his son. Majid's son Bazid Khan also represented Pakistan for the first time in 2005, making the family the second, after the Headleys to have three consecutive generations of Test cricketers. Baqa Jilani is brother in law of Dr. Mohammad Jahangir Khan also represented India in Test Cricket. Jahangir scored 108 on his first-class debut and took seven wickets in the second innings of the match. He represented India in her first ever Test against England at Lord's in 1932. After the tour, he stayed back in England and took a doctorate from Cambridge University. He passed the final Bar from Middle Temple. In that time he was Cambridge blue in cricket for four years. He also made two appearances in Gentlemen v Players matches. In 1935 playing for Indian Gymkhana, he also scored 1380 runs in two months, at an average of 70. When India toured England in 1936 he joined the team and appeared in all three Tests. His best bowling during his time at Cambridge was a 7 for 58 against the champion county Yorkshire. Back in India, he played in the Bombay Pentangular in 1939. While playing against Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1936, he bowled a ball to Tom Pearce that struck and killed an airborne sparrow. The bird was subsequently stuffed and mounted on the match ball which is currently exhibited in the MCC Museum at Lord's. Jahangir was to captain India in a tour of Ceylon in 1940–41 that was cancelled due to the war. == Selector == Jahangir was a selector between 1939–40 and 1941–42. After moving to Pakistan after 1947, he served a selector in Pakistan and managed the team that toured India in 1960–1961. He was a college principal and then served as the Director of Education in Pakistan before retiring. When Jalandhar hosted its first Test match in 1983, Jahangir was specially invited to attend the match. In his younger days, he was also a champion javelin thrower of India. He represented India in AAA in 1932 and British Empire Games 1934 in London. == Death == At the time of his death, he was the last survivor from the team that played for India in his first Test.

It is managed by Abellio Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains that call. Wickham Market was formerly a junction for the Framlingham branch line. The branch closed to passenger services in November 1952, and to freight in April 1963.http://www.suffolkcamra.co.uk/pubs/place/118 ==History== The railway line connecting the East Suffolk Railway (ESR) at to an extension of the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) at was built by the ESR, as was the Framlingham branch. The main line and the Framlingham branch both opened on 1 June 1859, and Wickham Market station opened at the same time. The ESR was absorbed by the ECR on opening day. On 1 July 1862, the ECR and other small railway companies were amalgamated to form the Great Eastern Railway (GER). Upon the 1923 Grouping, the GER was combined with other railways into the London and North Eastern Railway; this in turn was a constituent of British Railways at the start of 1948. The Framlingham branch closed to passenger trains in November 1952; it retained freight services until April 1965. In the meantime, the goods yard at Wickham Market closed in July 1964. With the privatisation of British Rail, ownership of the line and station passed to Railtrack on 1 April 1994. The franchise to operate the passenger services on this route was won by Anglia Railways in 1997; in 2004 National Express won the franchise and operated services using the brand name 'one', which was renamed National Express East Anglia in 2008. In February 2012, the operation of the train service was taken over by Abellio Greater Anglia, a company run by Abellio, the trading name of Dutch railways. ==Services== the typical Monday-Saturday off-peak service at Wickham Market is as follows: { class=\\" vatop\\" !

He was examiner on the subject in the University of London. ==Life== Pereira graduated as apothecary in 1823 after studying at the Aldersgate General Dispensary and St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1826 he became lecturer on chemistry at the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1832 he was an established physician in London, being appointed professor of materia medica and lecturer in chemistry at the Aldersgate Medical School. In 1839 he became professor and lecturer at the London Hospital, where he received the position of assistant physician in 1841. Jonathan Pereira delivered the introductory lectures on Materia Medica in 1842 at the Pharmaceutical Society and one year later he was appointed as Professor of Materia Medica by this institution, examining the subject in the School of Pharmacy of the University of London. His subject area was the forerunner of pharmacology and he published a series of research papers on plant drugs. Pereira later resigned in 1852, the result of a dispute between the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society following the illegal publications of his lecture material. After this incident another teacher in material medica was not appointed, instead Robert Bentley, who was professor of botany at the time, was asked to combine the lectures with his botany lectures. ==Pereira's Materia Medica== His interest in the area of crude drugs began when he realised that little was known about those imported into Britain. After years of research he acquired an extensive knowledge of the history of origin, morphology and histology of crude drugs where he was later appointed professor of material medica at the London Hospital. His book on Materia Medica was the first great English work on Pharmacology and he was foremost in putting the knowledge and use of drugs on a scientific footing. During one of his first lectures held at the School of Pharmacy he spoke about ‘material medica consisting of three parts: (1) pharmacognosy, pharmacology, pharmacopathia or the history of simple drugs; (2) pharmacy, and (3) pharmacodynamics. It was here that he referred to the study of crude drugs under the name pharmacognosy instead of materia medica in what appeared to be the first time in which it was used, when in fact it was introduced by Seydler in 1817. It took many years until the term was officially used as the name of the subject taught to pharmacy students. Students of Pharmacy studying for their major examinations were given the opportunity of examining the drugs further as well as being introduced to the microscope as another method for the examination of drugs in their powdered form such as starch, with the exception of vegetable drugs. Although where not being examined on authenticity and quality, Pereira encouraged his students to investigate authenticity and quality of drugs, something that he was carrying out a lot of research on at the time. This was considered an important part of the pharmacists role as Jacob Bell pointed out ‘the reputation of pharmacy depended upon pharmacists having this expertise. Pereira was named a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1838. Two years later he received the degree of M.D. \\"honoris causa\\" from Erlangen University. In his memory a marble bust was erected in the London Hospital and the Pharmaceutical Society founded the Pereira Medal and a scholarship fund with his name. ==Works== * 1838: Vorlesungen über Materia medica, oder über die Herkunft, die Qualität, die Zusammensetzung und die Wirksamkeit der Arzneistoffe, geh. 1835-1836 in der Aldergate's Schule zu London .

The approximately 65 species are found from the Mediterranean: Turkey (about 12 species) and Israel (12 species), to central Asia: Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan (two species). == Description == Bellevalia species are perennial herbaceous plants. As geophytes, they form bulbs with a membranous sheath (\\"tunic\\"). The simple, parallel-veined leaves are basal. Grape-like inflorescences grow terminally on smooth cylindrical flower stems. The numerous flowers are located in the axils of small, membranous bracts. The hermaphroditic flowers are triple. The six identically shaped bracts are one-third to one-half their length and deformed tubular, bell-shaped or funnel-shaped in form. The color of the bracts ranges from white to cream to brown or more rarely from blue to purple. The fruit capsule is triangular in cross section with winged edges. The seeds are more or less spherical, rarely elongated and glossy. == Taxonomy == The genus Bellevalia was first described in 1808 by Philippe-Isidore Picot de Lapeyrouse.Philippe-Isidore Picot de Lapeyrouse: Bellevalia.

The village is served by Wickham Market railway station on the Ipswich- Lowestoft East Suffolk Line. The modern village covers two medieval villages, Campesia and Esce. The former was the site of an Augustinian nunnery Campsey Priory, suppressed in 1536, of which only the Mill and Mill house still exist as Grade II* listed buildings. The Campsea church of St John the Baptist dates from the 14th century, and survives as the local parish church. It is a grade II* listed building. Campsea has an Auction Room, dating to the 1920s, with a weekly auction held on Mondays. ==The name== The name has long been recognized by toponymists as being of difficult etymology. Skeat, in his 1913 book on the Place-names of Suffolk, suggested that Campsey was \`Kampi's island', with a Norse personal name Kampi, and Old English ēg. This has not been accepted by any later scholar. Gelling, in her 1988 work Signposts to the past (pages 77–78), included Campsey in a group of names including the Old English word camp, meaning \`field' but of Latin derivation and so probably associated with earlier Roman settlement. This is the etymology in the current standard place- name dictionaries. But there is still doubt, because there is no obvious island for the ēg element to refer to. It is possible that the second element is not ēg at all, but that the name is camp-esce, where *esce is a collective noun for a group of ash trees. Historically, Campsey is the more correct spelling (despite the doubts over etymology) and was used on all Ordnance Survey maps up to the 1960s. The spelling Campsea perhaps originated in 1921 when James Lowther was created Viscount Ullswater of Campsea Ashe, where the spelling Campsea was felt to be more archaic and therefore appropriate to a heraldic name. ==Origins and medieval period== In the Domesday Survey of 1086, where the manor of Campesia was flourishing and covered some 200 acres, while Esca was smaller neighbouring settlement. Granted by William the Conqueror to his supporters, their holders included Alan Rufus, Lord of Richmond Robert Malet, Hervey de Berre and the Bigod family, the latter being relatives of the King. The possession and tenancy of the lands, including the small Manor of Ashe, underwent various permutations during the succeeding centuries, by death, reversion to the crown, inheritance and marriage. For example, the once powerful Bigod family died out in 1310. Passing through the hands of the Plantagenets, Segraves and de Mowbrays, it merged into the lands of the Fitzalan and Howard clan, to become Dukes of Norfolk. It was in their possession until about 1640. It is believed that the small parcel of land in the Manor of Ashe continued to be part of the estate. The Priory, founded in 1195, ended its days abruptly in 1536 with the Dissolution and much of its lands and other property was granted to Sir William Willoughby of Parham, who had gravitated to the honeypot represented by the household set up for Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, illegitimate son of Henry VIII, who died on him in July 1536. ==Elizabethan and later times== The Priory property was then subject after 1536 to sale through a string of owners, including the Lane family, the Scotts and the Loudhams. Other local lands were not part of the Priory estates, but some of these were purchased by Sir William Willoughby, later Lord Willoughby, before he sold it on the owners such as the Greshams, Wentworths, Stringers and Jenneys. John Glover, purchaser of the Manor of Campsea and other local lands, lived at Ash Moorhall, the manor house, around 1558 and built a distinguished Elizabethan house on his lands, the four-storeyed Ash High House, completed by his son William around 1600. The family sold out to John Sheppard of Mendlesham, Suffolk in 1652. The Manor of Ashe and Chantry Hall, (the manor house) were bought by the local John Brame, who also acquired the Manor of Valence, Blaxhall. The whole later passed by inheritance and sale to the Revetts. Ashe High House was the home from 1652 to 1882 of the Sheppard family, part of the house damaged by fire in 1865 being rebuilt in congruent style by the architect Anthony Salvin. In 1882 house and estate were sold to the diplomat William Lowther, for a time MP for Westmorland. At its next sale, in 1949, Ashe High House was described as having 31 bedrooms and dressing rooms, 6 bathrooms, 6 reception rooms and a library. The estate in 1882 amounted to 4,100 acres, 144 acres of deer and home parks and 240 acres of woods and plantations, with 13 farms. The new owners were residents of Campsea Ashe for the next 66 years. The property passed in 1912 to Lowther’s son, James, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1905 until 1921, created subsequently Viscount Ullswater of Campsea Ashe. He died at the High House in March 1949, aged 94. After repeated sales following the Second World War, Ashe High House fell into ruin and only the foundations now survive. ==Historical features== ===Parish church=== At the present parish church of St John the Baptist Norman stonework has been uncovered. In the 14th century came the addition of the tower, which is 76 feet (23m) high. The church probably dates largely from this period and the first known advowson was presented in 1312 and a rector was appointed at that time. Like many other village churches, this church was extensively restored in the 18th and 19th centuries: restored and frankly altered between 1789 and 1792 under the then incumbent, the Rev Kilderbee, and around 1869 further refurbished and modified under the Rev. Reginald Bridges Knatchbull-Hugessen, the son of Rt. Hon. Sir Edward Knatchbull, Bt. Bells were here to be rung from at least 1553 but by 20th century could no longer be safely used. Interventions took place in 1999 to permit them to ring in the new millennium, and then in 2010, a full restoration was cartried out, the bells being increased from 4 to 6 bells and the earlier gallery, removed in 1878, belatedly replaced to constitute a ringing gallery. The former Rectory, a handsome Georgian house, situated on the west-side of the churchyard, is first mentioned in 1765 but it is likely that the site was occupied by a parsonage prior to this. Refurbished in 1826, it was in bad repair by 1906, when the thatched roof was replaced by tiles. Having been used as a hostel by the Woman’s Land Army during the last War, it was sold into private hands shortly afterwards. === Former Campsey Priory === See Campsey Priory A prominent feature of local history was Campsey Priory, an Augustinian nunnery founded by a powerful local lord and landowner Theobald de Valoines in 1195 and endowed with extensive lands. The Priory housed as a nun for several years in the 14th century the redoubtable and well-connected Maud of Lancaster, Countess of Ulster but despite these auspicious times, like all other monasteries in England it was confiscated by the crown for financial gain under Henry VIII, the nunnery being in effect forced to close in 1536. As was the policy, the buildings were largely demolished and little survived. ==References== ==External links== *Village History Retrieved 10 October 2013 * History of Campsey Ash Retrieved 31 March 2014 Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk ","title":"Campsea Ashe"},{"id":"2567937","text":"Watch Brideless Groom Brideless Groom is a 1947 short subject directed by Edward Bernds starring American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Shemp Howard). It is the 101st entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. ==Plot== Shemp plays a voice instructor and the object of affection to tone-deaf vocal student Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), with Larry his musical accompanist. After an excruciating session, Moe enters his classroom to tell Shemp that his uncle had died and left him an inheritance of $500,000. However, Shemp cannot collect the money unless he is married (which horrifies Shemp) within 48 hours after the reading of the will, leaving him only a few hours. Shemp uses his filled-up black address book to propose to any and all women he has ever known, with unsuccessful results. With time running out, Moe and Larry lead Shemp through a series of disastrous situations including the destruction of a phone booth and Shemp being beaten silly by a woman named Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre), who had just moved into the building and mistook Shemp for her cousin Basil. Upon recovering from his bruising, Shemp unintentionally proposes to his unattractive and tone-deaf student Miss Dinkelmeyer. She happily accepts and the two of them, with Moe and Larry in tow, head over to the Justice of Peace (Emil Sitka) to get married. Shemp pulls out the wedding ring but accidentally loses it in the piano. Moe forces him to look, and in doing so Shemp wrecks the piano completely. Eventually he finds the ring, and he is hustled to get married right away. However, the Stooges' landlord calls Moe to tell him that news of Shemp's inheritance was printed in the newspaper and all of Shemp's ex- girlfriends that he called and proposed to found out about it and are out looking for him. They all arrive at the Justice of Peace's office looking to marry Shemp to get his money, whereupon chaos ensues. The women start fighting, taking out their aggressions not only on each other but upon the Stooges as well. Both Moe and Larry are repeatedly kicked in the shins while standing among the crowd of battling women, trying to break them up. In a later scene Moe sets a bear trap in a chair awaiting any of the women who are continually pushing one another into it, but the plan backfires as he tries to antagonize a combatant who grabs him by the hair, spins him around and shoves him backwards into the chair, causing the trap to painfully snap shut on Moe's rear end. Nonetheless, Shemp, in a dazed state, ends up marrying his student, just in time to collect the money. Shemp comes to, is told what happened, and is frightened beyond reproach. ==Cast== ===Credited=== * Moe Howard as Moe * Larry Fine as Larry * Shemp Howard as Professor Shemp Howard * Christine McIntyre as Lulu Hopkins * Dee Green as Fanny Dinkelmeyer * Doris Houck as Aggressive former girlfriend ===Uncredited=== * Emil Sitka as Justice of the Peace Benton * Johnny Kascier as Bellboy * Nancy Saunders as Shemp's former Girlfriend * Judy Malcolm as Shemp's former Girlfriend * Virginia Hunter as Shemp's former Girlfriend * Nancy Saunders as Shemp's former Girlfriend * Alyn Lockwood as Shemp's former Girlfriend ==Production notes== Brideless Groom was filmed from March 12–13, 1947. The plot theme of Brideless Groom is not unique, having been used in (among others) Buster Keaton's 1925 comedy Seven Chances (remade in 1999 as The Bachelor starring Chris O'Donnell). Writer Clyde Bruckman was also partially responsible for Seven Chances. The film features longtime Stooges supporting player Emil Sitka's best-remembered line \\"Hold hands, you lovebirds!\\" (the line is actually engraved on Sitka's headstone). The shot where Sitka has a birdcage smashed on his head was worked into the 1994 movie Pulp Fiction when Eric Stoltz is watching television. Brideless Groom would be recycled in the second half of 1956's Husbands Beware. The version of \\"Voices of Spring\\" during Shemp and Miss Dinkelmeyer's singing lesson was sung by frequent Stooge co-star Christine McIntyre, who appears in this short as \\"Miss Hopkins\\". This version of \\"Voices of Spring\\", along with McIntyre herself, were previously used in the Three Stooges short \\"Micro-Phonies\\". ===Shemp's injury=== Shemp Howard Brideless Groom features a sequence with Christine McIntyre who portrays Miss Hopkins, a woman whom Shemp actively pursues for his wife. Unfortunately, she mistakes him for her cousin Basil. After learning her mistake, she takes it out on poor Shemp by slapping him silly, then finally punching him through her door. During the filming of the scene, when Christine threw her punch, she leaned too far into it, and hit Shemp for real and broke his nose. This mistake was left in the film, and when watched in slow motion, Shemp can be seen falling down and opening his mouth like he was yelling in pain after the punch. Director Edward Bernds remembers getting McIntyre to give Shemp the blows: ==Copyright status== Brideless Groom is one of four Columbia Stooge shorts that fell into the public domain after their copyright expired in the 1960s, the other three being Malice in the Palace (1949), Sing a Song of Six Pants (1947), and Disorder in the Court (1936). As such, these four shorts frequently appear on budget VHS and DVD compilations. ==See also== * Public domain film * List of American films of 1947 * List of films in the public domain in the United States ==References* * Brideless Groom complete film on YouTube Category:1947 films Category:1947 comedy films Category:1947 short films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:English- language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:The Three Stooges films Category:Films directed by Edward Bernds Category:Columbia Pictures short films Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Brideless Groom"},{"id":"2567940","text":", the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepted about 1000 species, with a further 1200-odd synonyms.

The Forum 2000 Foundation was founded in 1996 as a joint initiative of the Czech President Václav Havel, Japanese philanthropist Yohei Sasakawa, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel. Mr. Havel based his idea for Forum 2000 on the principle that, “it would be good if intelligent people, not only from the various ends of the earth, different continents, different cultures, from civilization's religious circles, but also from different disciplines of human knowledge could come together somewhere in calm discussion.” The main objective of the Forum 2000 conferences is “to identify the key issues facing civilization and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components.”http://www.demas.cz/en/members-of-demas Forum 2000 aims to provide a platform to discuss these important topics openly and to enhance global dialogue. Through its activities, the Forum 2000 Foundation also intends to promote democracy in non-democratic countries and to support the civil society, respect for human rights and religious, cultural and ethnic tolerance in young democracies. http://www.forum2000.cz/ ==Forum 2000 Annual Conferences == Forum 2000 in Žofín Palace (2011) The annual Forum 2000 Conference, along with other events organized by the Forum 2000 Foundation, are held in Prague. The mission of these conferences is to “map the globalization process and to note its positive results as well as the perils encountered by an increasingly interconnected world.”http://www.forum2000.cz/en/projects/forum-2000-conferences/ Since 1997, the Forum 2000 Conferences have attracted a number of prominent thought leaders, Nobel laureates, former and acting politicians, business leaders and other individuals, whose common denominative is experience with bearing responsibility. Prince Hassan bin Talal, Frederik Willem de Klerk, Bill Clinton, Nicholas Winton, Oscar Arias Sánchez, Dalai Lama, Hans Küng, Shimon Peres, Madeleine Albright, Mário Soares, Hanna Suchocká, Sergey Kovalyov, Jorge Castaneda, Alyaksandar Milinkevich, and Wole Soyinka are just a few of those who have attended the Forum 2000 events. Video recordings of the conference discussions and Conference Reports are available on the Forum 2000 website (www.forum2000.cz), as well as photo-galleries, transcripts, summaries and other information from each of the annual conferences. The conferences generally open with a speech by former President Havel and then host a series of panels that discuss topics relating to the conference theme, business and the economy, interfaith dialogue, or specific regional issues. ===List of Previous Conferences=== *1997: \\"Concerns and Hopes on the Threshold of the New Millenium\\", September 4-6, Prague Castle *1998: \\"Globalization-Experiences, Instruments, Procedures\\", October 12-14, Prague Castle *1999: \\"Process of World Integration-Alternative Visions\\", October 11-13, Prague Castle *2000: \\"Education, Culture and Spiritual Values in the Age of Globalisation\\", October 15-18, Prague Castle *2001: \\"Human Rights-Search for Global Responsibility\\", October 14-17, Prague Castle *2002: \\"Searching for Global Consensus\\", October 18-20, Prague Castle *2003: \\"Bridging Global Gaps\\", October 15-17, Municipal House, Prague Castle *2004: \\"Civil Society in a Globalized World\\", October 17-19, Municipal House, Prague Castle *2005: \\"Our Global Co-Existence: Challenges and Hopes for the 21st Century\\", October 9-10, Žofín Palace *2006: \\"The Dilemmas of Global Coexistence\\", October 8-10, Žofín Palace *2007: \\"Freedom and Responsibility\\", October 7-9, Žofín Palace *2008: \\"Openness and Fundamentalism in the 21st Century\\", October 12-14, Žofín Palace *2009: \\"Democracy and Freedom in a Multipolar World\\", October 11-13, Žofín Palace *2010: \\"The World We Want to Live In\\", October 10-12, Žofín Palace *2011: \\"Democracy and the Rule of Law\\", October 9-11, Žofín Palace *2012: \\"Media and Democracy\\", October 21-23, Žofín Palace *2013: \\"Societies in Transitions\\", September 15-17, Žofín Palace *2014: \\"Democracy and its Discontents\\", September 12-15, Žofín Palace *2015: \\"Democracy and Education\\", September 13-16, Žofín Palace *2016: \\"The Courage to Take Responsibility\\", October 16-19, Žofín Palace *2017: \\"Strengthening Democracy in Uncertain Times\\", October 8-10, Žofín Palace *2018: \\"Democracy: In Need of a Critical Update?\\", October 7-9, Žofín Palace ==Projects== * Hiroshima-Nagasaki 1945-2010 – This exhibition commemorates the 65th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945.The exhibition, which recounts the story of the dropping of the bombs and the subsequent renewal of the two cities, was held both in Prague’s New Town Hall and the Moravian Museum in Brno from October 12 to November 14, 2010. *NGO Market – Held annually since 2000, this event is the biggest gathering of non-governmental organizations in the Czech Republic. NGOs active in education, volunteering, human rights, environmental and other issues are given an opportunity to present their activities to the broad public, establish new partnerships, address potential sponsors and volunteers, and gain valuable know-how needed for successful NGO-management. The 2010 NGO market took place on April 16, and was attended by nearly 150 NGOs from countries throughout Europe. *Shared Concern Initiative – The Shared Concern Initiative (SCI) was conceived in 2005 by the Dalai Lama in cooperation with Václav Havel, El Hassan bin Talal and Frederik W. de Klerk. The SCI is an open and informal group of recognized personalities representing various cultures, historical backgrounds, religions, and traditions. The SCI endeavors to “address the important challenges of today's world with the understanding that changes towards the better can be effectively promoted with a common voice.” It has recently issued joint statement appeals on human rights abuses in Burma, Russia and China. *Exploring Water Patterns in the Middle East – This project addresses a problem that is key to the Middle East's development—namely, water resources. Water has become a subject of international relations with significant security, economic, social and humanitarian implications. As a result, the project intends to help facilitate a peaceful and sustainable resolution of tensions over freshwater resources in the Middle East by collecting and exchanging know-how, experience and opinions among all stakeholders in order to create a situation of common understanding where a plan for concerted action becomes possible. *Interfaith Dialogue – The Interfaith Project is a platform where representatives of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions can discuss up-to-date issues regarding interreligious relations. Through frank dialogue at the Forum 2000 conferences, participants work towards a better collective understanding of global issues, explore the role of religion today and search for ways to increase mutual cooperation and understanding. *Educational Programs - The main aim of the long term educational programs is to strengthen democracy and civil society in the Balkans, Central Asia, Central & Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, which are still in the process of transforming into democracies. The program strives to aid them in stabilizing, diversifying, and professionalizing their political systems. Training courses for youths in these regions include Youth in Conflicts – Training on Conflict Management and Active Participation, Youth Leadership Training, and the Long Term Training Course. *Conferences and Roundtables - The Forum 2000 Foundation also holds various conferences and roundtables outside of the primary annual conference event. In April 2010, Forum 2000 held an international conference entitled “Forgotten Victims” in cooperation with the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation. This conference dealt with “the situation of victims of hate crime/hate violence and victim assistance in the Czech Republic.” The goal of the conference was to contribute to a useful exchange of experiences on how to effectively and consistently address the issue of the hate violence. Other recent conferences include a “Workshop on EU – Central America Relations” in February 2010 and a conference entitled “Freedom and its Adversaries” in November 2009. *Other Activities - On March 31, 2010, the Forum 2000 and many former delegates of its conferences demanded the release of Dr. Oswaldo Álvarez Paz in an open letter addressed to the Venezuelan government. Álvarez Paz, a former Forum 2000 participant himself, was arrested on March 22 by the Venezuelan government for comments he made on a television show. As a result of this letter and pressure by other human rights organizations, Álvarez Paz was released in May and all charges against him were dropped. ==External links== *Official site ==See also== *Jan Richter for Radio Praha *Sarah Borufka for the Prague Post *http://aktualne.centrum.cz/domaci/politika/clanek.phtml?id=679462 * *Leora Moreno for The New Presence ==Notes== Category:International organizations based in the Czech Republic Category:Organizations based in Prague Category:1996 establishments in the Czech Republic ","title":"Forum 2000"},{"id":"2567965","text":"Palmas is a municipality in the south of the Brazilian state of Paraná.

At the base of the hill is the Mumbai Circle office of the Archaeological Survey of India, and a garden – the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Udyan. Nearby forts include the Riwa Fort and Sewri Fort. The fort is dilapidated and a collection of broken stone steps, scattered walls and ruins, overrun by trees and ground cover. The fort wall has a small room on top. A series of pathways lead to it. The fort offers a panoramic view, overlooking the salt pans in the Thane Creek. However vandalism and apathy have taken toll on the structure.

In 1621, Charles had been created an Irish peer as Viscount Wilmot. Wilmot was born in 1612 as the third son of Charles, but he was the only one still alive on his father's death so he succeeded to the title. ==1630s and early 1640s== Wilmot had five years experience in the Dutch army, and was badly wounded at the siege of Breda. He joined Charles I for the Bishops' Wars (1639–1640) and served as an officer in the cavalry, sitting in the Royal Council of War and led a charge at Battle of Newburn and was captured by the Scots when it broke. In 1640, Wilmot was elected to the Long Parliament to represent Tamworth. It was during this period that he became involved as a member of a set of young MPs and officers around Queen Henrietta Maria, (a patron who would help him later in his life). As part of this set he took an active part in the Army Plot of 1641 against Parliament. He was committed to the Tower of London and expelled from the House of Commons. ==First Civil War== As soon as the First English Civil War started Wilmot joined King Charles I at York. By 5 August 1642 he raised a regiment of horse for the King's army and regaining the post of commissary-general of horse. He was wounded at Battle of Powick Bridge on 23 September, the first major skirmish of the Civil War, but was fit enough to lead the left wing of the royalist cavalry at the Battle of Edgehill a month later, routing most of the parliamentarians opposite to him. He also commanded the expeditionary force that stormed and captured Marlborough on 5 December. Reward for these exploits was lavishly given in April 1643 when he was appointed lieutenant-general of horse in the king's army directly under the command of Prince Rupert of the Rhine and on 29 June when he was created Baron Wilmot of Adderbury, Oxfordshire; these honours may well have been assisted by the restored influence of his old patroness, the queen. Later that year he commanded a large cavalry contingent that was sent to help the western royalist army, and on 13 July he defeated Sir William Waller at the Battle of Roundway Down opening the way for the royalists to solidify their position in the west. In 1644 when Rupert took over a regional command in the North, Wilmot stepped into his shoes as commander of all the Royalist cavalry and as the a dominant influence on military matters. On 29 June at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge he participated in defeating Waller for the second time, but not before he had had to lead a charge, in which he was wounded and briefly taken prisoner. When his father died (shortly before April 1644) Wilmot inherited the title of Viscount Wilmot of Athlone and much of his father's political standing in Ireland. In April he was, jointly with Thomas Dillon, 4th Viscount Dillon, made Lord President of Connaught, a post that his late father had held jointly with the late Viscount Ranelagh since 1630 ; this appointment laid the foundations for his becoming a major political figure in both England and Ireland. All recognised that Wilmot was popular with the soldiers he commanded, due to a \\"mixture of courage, enterprise, and boozy affability\\" Clarendon famously, if waspishly, noted \\"He was a man proud and ambitious, and incapable of being contented; an orderly officer in marches and governing his troops. He drank hard, and had a great power over all who did so, which was a great people\\". citing Clarendon, Hist. rebellion 3.388. This popularity and his central position in the army command, allowed him to start to exert political influence. In June Wilmot felt in a strong enough position to canvas support in the army to ask the king to dismiss his two principal civilian advisers, Lord Digby and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Culpeper, and to adopt the strategy of a march on London. Charles, who had no personal affection for Wilmot (because Wilmot had voted for the death of the Earl of Strafford), dismissed the strategy and kept Digby and Culpeper on as his advisers. With the failure of his first scheme, Wilmot made an unauthorized contact with the Earl of Essex who was the parliamentarian commander-in-chief, to see if a peace could be arranged. The king was easily persuaded by Digby and Culpeper that Wilmot's actions were treasonable. Wilmot was arrested on 8 August 1644, stripped of all his offices, and incarcerated in Exeter. His popularity within the army led many of its officers to petition on his behalf and eventually to placate them, all charges against Wilmot were dropped on the understanding that he would retire overseas. Wilmot went to France, to join the exiled court of his old patron Queen Henrietta Maria. Three years later, when Digby arrived in Paris, the dispute between the men was neither forgotten nor forgiven and they fought a duel. Wilmot was defeated with a stab through the hand. ==Third Civil War== After Charles I was executed in January 1649, Wilmot became a gentleman of the bedchamber of King Charles II. He was greatly trusted by Charles II, whose defeat at the Battle of Worcester and subsequent wanderings Wilmot shared. During these, whereas the king adopted a series of disguises (often as a servant), Wilmot disdained disguise and declined to travel on foot. He and the king ultimately escaped to France six weeks after the battle, having spent the intervening time in hiding in various places.; \\"as Charles recalled when he had his story ghostwritten by Samuel Pepys, 'I could never get [Wilmot] to put on any disguise, he saying he should look frightfully in it, and therefore did never put on any'\\". ==Interregnum== During this King's exile, he was one of his principal advisers, being created by him Earl of Rochester in 1652. In the interests of Charles, he visited the emperor Ferdinand III, Nicholas II, Duke of Lorraine, and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. In March 1655, he was in England, where he led an unsuccessful attempt at a rising on Marston Moor, near York as part of the Sealed Knot Penruddock uprising. The York uprising was put down by Colonel Robert Lilburne Governor of York and on its failure Wilmot fled the country. In April 1656 along with the Duke of Ormonde he signed the Treaty of Brussels, which secured an alliance between the exiled Royalists and the Spanish King.Aubrey p.108 In 1656, Wilmot obtained command of an English foot regiment in the royalist army in Bruges, thus becoming the first colonel of the Grenadier Guards. The unhealthy and overcrowded conditions of the regiment's quarters in the winter of 1657–58 caused many in it to fall sick, including its commander. Wilmot died at Sluys on 19 February and was buried at Bruges. After the Restoration, his body was transferred to the family vault at Spelsbury church, Oxfordshire. He was succeeded by son John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, a noted poet and libertine at the Restoration court. ==Family== On 21 August 1633, Wilmot married Frances Morton, daughter of Sir George Morton of Clenston. In 1644, some time after Frances had died, Wilmot married Anne Lee, daughter of Sir John St John, 1st Baronet St John of Lydiard Tregoze, and widow of Sir Francis Henry Lee, 2nd Baronet Lee of Quarendon. They had a son John, who was born on 10 April 1647. John inherited his father's title and went on to become a well known raconteur, wit and poet at the court of Charles II. ==Notes== ==References== * Aubrey, Philip.

Cork, by his first wife, a Miss Jones. His grandfather was David Quain of Carrigoon, co. Cork. He received the name of Jones from his mother's family. Richard Quain (1800–1887) was his full brother, and Sir John Richard Quain his half-brother. Sir Richard Quain was his first cousin. He began his education in Adair's school at Fermoy. He then entered Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a Scholar in 1814, then the highest classical distinction. He graduated in arts, and in 1820 he took the degree of bachelor of medicine, though he did not proceed M.D. until 1833. At the close of his college career he visited the continental schools and spent some time in Paris, translating and editing Martinet's Manual of Pathology. A Series of Anatomical Plates Bones Plate 24 Quain came to London in 1825 and joined, as one of its anatomical teachers, the Aldersgate Street school of medicine founded by Frederick Tyrrell. The other teacher of anatomy was William Lawrence. While engaged there he published Elements of Anatomy which became a standard text-book in English-speaking countries. An attack of hæmoptysis occurring while he suffered from a dissection wound compelled him to take a rest for two years. Quain accepted in 1831 the office of Professor of General Anatomy at University College, then vacant by the resignation of Granville Sharp Pattison; Richard Quain, his brother, acted as senior demonstrator and lecturer on descriptive anatomy, while Erasmus Wilson was his prosecutor. He was also invited to lecture upon physiology. He resigned his post at University College in 1835, and in the same year he was appointed a member of the senate of the University of London. He lived in retirement during the last twenty years of his life, and chiefly in Paris, devoting himself to literary and scientific pursuits. He died, unmarried, on 31 January 1865, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Quain was an elegant and accomplished scholar, and he was deeply interested in literature as well as science. ==Works== His medical writings were: #Elements of Descriptive and Practical Anatomy for the use of Students, London, 1828; 2nd edit.

Série 9100 diesel railcar of the Portuguese Railways at Amarante station on the Tâmega line, northern Portugal (1996) The company was founded by Antenor Nydqvist, Johan Magnus Lidström and Carl Olof Holm in 1847 as Trollhättans Mekaniska Verkstad as a manufacturer of turbines for hydraulic power plants. In 1865, the company made its first steam locomotive and in 1912 the 1,000th locomotive steamed out of the factory. In Nohab's anniversary book \\"The Thousand Locomotive\\" from 1912, it's mentioned that the company also manufactured davit's for Titanic's lifeboats. In 1916 the company was reconstituted as a limited company and became NOHAB. In 1920, NOHAB received an order of 1000 locomotives from Soviet Russia. Only 500 were delivered between 1921 and 1924. In 1924, Nohab built three steam locomotives, 4-6-0 ones for with the respective builder's plates #1727, #1728 and #1729 for Estrada de Ferro Rio d'Ouro in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). According to E.F. Rio d'Ouro's surviving records, they would not have arrived in Brazil before 1926. In 1930, NOHAB started manufacturing the Bristol Jupiter aircraft engine, under licence from the Bristol Aeroplane Company. A couple of years later the aircraft engine division of NOHAB and AB Svenska järnvägsverkstäderna (Swedish Railway Workshop Limited), in Linköping, formed the aircraft manufacturer SAAB. 1930-1936 they built the Ljungström steam turbine locomotives. In 1948 NOHAB supplied diesel railcars to the Portuguese Railways (CP), in both (the Série 0100) and versions (the Série 9100). In the 1950s, NOHAB started manufacturing diesel locomotives under licence from Electro-Motive Division of General Motors. The Danish State Railways were a major customer. 35 Di 3 were also delivered to the Norwegian State Railways. In addition to locomotives and aircraft NOHAB was a major manufacturer of turbines for power plants and well known for medium size ship engines. NOHAB also manufactured the hulls for the S-tank. In the 1970s, the diesel engine manufacturing facility was sold to Wärtsilä and became known as Wärtsilä Nohab. The company went bankrupt in 1979. === NOHAB in Hungary === In the early 1960s twenty NOHAB diesel engines were built for Hungarian State Railways (MÁV), but due to the Iron Curtain, further imports were stopped in favour of M62 locomotives made in Soviet Union. The Swedish locomotives were classified by MÁV as type M61 and proved versatile, highly reliable as well as economical to run. They were even used to haul non-stoppable radioactive waste transport trains from the Paks Nuclear Power Plant to Soviet reprocessing facilities, despite the availability of Soviet-made M62 engines. The M61 type has achieved a cult status in Hungary because they were used to haul most of express trains to holiday resorts around the Lake Balaton region. Their images became closely associated with teenage summer camps, exploration and family recreation during the Socialism era, when foreign travel was highly restricted for the average citizen. Today, the M61s are no longer in regular service with MÁV, most were scrapped but some were saved. One is still run on charter duties by a preservation group in Hungary and Romania and another one hauls track-laying machinery trains in the Budapest region.

It is endemic to the Seychelles Islands where it is the only breeding bird of prey. It is known in Seychellois Creole as the katiti after its loud, shrill call. ==Description== It is the smallest of the kestrels, 18–23 cm long with a wingspan of 40–45 cm. The wings are fairly short and rounded. The adult male's upperparts are reddish brown with black spots while the underparts are unspotted and buff. The head and rump are dark blue-grey. The tail is blue-grey with black bars. The bill is dark and the feet and cere are yellow. Females are similar to the males in appearance but are a little larger and paler. Immature birds have a brown, streaked head, spots on the breast and a buff tip to the tail. ==Ecology== It can be seen in forest, scrub and farmland and around rock faces and houses. It rarely hovers, instead feeding by sitting on an exposed perch and waiting for prey to pass, then swooping down to catch it. Lizards, particularly green day geckos (Phelsuma) and skinks (Mabuya), make up 92% of its diet and it will also take small birds, frogs, rats and insects. The breeding territory covers just 40 hectares, the smallest of any bird of prey. Breeding occurs from August to October. The nest site is on a cliff, tree or building. It is a simple scrape with no nest material used. Two or three eggs are laid; they are white with brown markings and are incubated for 28–31 days. The young birds fledge after 35–42 days and then remain with their parents for another 14 weeks. ==Conservation== The species has a population of about 800 birds and is classified as vulnerable. Lowland nests have a high failure rate of about 70-80%. It probably bred throughout the granitic central Seychelles in the past but is currently known to breed only on Mahé, Silhouette, North Island, Praslin and some small adjacent islands. It was reintroduced to Praslin in 1977. Threats are thought to include habitat loss due to logging, housing development and fires as well as predation and competition by introduced species. Rats, cats and barn owls have reduced the lizard population on which the kestrels depend and they may take eggs and chicks. Barn owls and common mynas have occupied many suitable nest sites. Persecution by humans is now rare. In the past, kestrels were killed because they were thought to take chickens and because they were considered to be an omen of death. ==References== *BirdLife International (2007) Species factsheet: Falco araea.

Only little is known about life of Radla and the available information is often contradictory. He could be the bastard son of Slavník, the founder of Slavník's dynasty and father of Adalbert. Radla was tutor and close friend of Adalbert (they both studied in Magdeburg) and accompanied him on his pilgrimage to Rome. After Slavník's were slaughtered (995) Radla left for Hungary where he stayed in the service of the wife of Duke Geza. Adalbert asked Radla to be his company on travel to Polish lands but Radla opted to stay in Hungary. Bruno of Querfurt, the creator of legend about St. Adalbert, met him there. Radla is sometimes identified with Anastasius, the first abbot of Břevnov Monastery (from 993) or with Astrik (Anastasius), bishop of the Hungarians in Esztergom.

It is found in arid, open country in the northern part of Sub-Saharan Africa. ==Description== It is a large, slender kestrel with long, narrow wings and tail. It is long with a wingspan of and a weight of . The female is 3% larger than the male. The plumage is dark rufous above and below with black streaks. The tail is narrowly barred with black while the flight feathers of the wing are dark and unbarred. The underwings are pale, contrasting with the darker body. The eye is yellow-brown unlike the similar greater kestrel which has whitish eyes as well as paler plumage, barred flight feathers and grey on the tail. Juvenile fox kestrels have heavier streaking than the adults and clearer barring on the tail. The species has a high, screeching call, but is usually silent outside the breeding season. ==Habitat and range== It breeds in the savanna region south of the Sahara from Mali eastwards as far as Ethiopia and north-west Kenya. It occasionally wanders west to Senegal, the Gambia and Guinea and south to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most birds are sedentary but there is some movement northward during the wet season and southward in the dry season. It is often found around cliffs and rocky hills. It occurs from near sea level to 2200 m, especially below 1000 m. It has a large range of about 4 million km2, but is usually uncommon. Its total population is probably fewer than 100,000 pairs. ==Behaviour== It rarely hovers, preferring to hunt from a perch in a tree or on a rock. It feeds on insects, lizards and small mammals. It generally catches food on the ground but also hunts for flying insects escaping from grass fires. Little is known about its breeding habits. The nest site is a hole or crevice in a cliff or on a ledge. No nesting material is used. The clutch is thought to consist of two or three eggs. The birds sometimes breed in loose colonies of up to 20 pairs. ==References== *Ferguson-Lees, James & Christie, David A.

Following the influential Video Show at the Serpentine Gallery in May 1975, which brought the work of international video artists to London and showcased British artists working in the medium, it became apparent that the increased activity in British video art required an organisation to provide support for the artists involved. The idea for London Video Arts (LVA) was initiated by David Hall and founded in summer 1976 by a group of video artists including Roger Barnard, David Critchley, Tamara Krikorian, Brian Hoey, Pete Livingstone, Stuart Marshall, Stephen Partridge, John Turpie and Hall. \\"A History of Video Art\\" Chris Meigh-Andrews (Berg 2006), p. 56. ==London Video Arts== LVA aimed to provide video artists with support promoting their work, beginning as Stuart Marshall later put it as \\"a pressure group\\" for the autonomy of video as an art practice, with its own systems of exhibition and distribution. This is apparent in the first LVA catalogue, produced in 1978, which places emphasis on \\"artists′ work on videotape, video performance and video installations…\\". LVA acted as a regular screening venue for video art with a distribution library that provided access to a selection of tapes by international as well as British artists working in the field. In the early days there were no production facilities, due in part to the unwieldy and expensive nature of the technology then available. It was not until the early 1980s that LVA managed to secure sufficient funding to set up a permanent office, employ staff and set up their first production facility, this was heralded in LVA's second 1984 catalogue by David Critchley. \\"We now have, in March 1984, an organisation which is ‘up and running’ in all of the areas it was intended to cover by its founder members back in 1976...LVA can now offer facilities for the production and post-production of video programmes, can exhibit those programmes through its own shows series, and can distribute them worldwide with the help of this catalogue.\\"Reaching Audiences Distribution and Promotion of Alternative Moving Image Julia Knight and Peter Thomas, Intellect (2012), pp. a 116; b 245. As video art became more established throughout the 1980s LVA changed to accommodate the different concerns which emerged across the decade. The phenomenon of Scratch video, for example, and the rise of the music video and cheaper and more available video \\"camcorder\\" technology produced a different aesthetic less connected to the modernist concern for medium specificity which first characterised video. In 1988, after some disagreements with John Cleese’s video production company (Video Arts) over company names, LVA became London Video Access, and indeed its production facilities were in great demand at the expense of its distribution library during this period, showing a shift towards broadcast and the independent video sector and away from the arts. By 1994 another change of title to London Electronic Arts reflected developments in video technology towards a more dispersed digital media and again reasserted the artist led nature of the organisation. A further move to Lottery funded premises at the Lux Centre in 1996 also provided a purpose built gallery space to accompany distribution and production facilities. Under the pressure of funding cuts, and perhaps also determined by the increasingly blurred distinctions which now existed between video and other moving image media, LEA merged with the London Film-Makers' Co-op with whom it shared a venue under the collective name of the Lux Centre, continuing until the eventual demise of the Centre in 2001. Its extensive library of video tapes, attesting to the rich history of British and international video art which LVA first helped to promote, continues to find distribution through LUX, as do many of the artists originally involved. ==See also== *LUX (UK film company) ==References== ==External links== * Film & Video Distribution Database, database of material and information about the organisations distributing experimental film and video art in the UK, including London Video Access/Electronic Arts, London Film-makers' Co-op, Lux, Circles/Cinenova, and Film and Video Umbrella.

Controlling Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel, the player must escape an island as quickly as possible after they are kidnapped by series antagonist Doctor Eggman. The game is presented from an isometric perspective and players use a trackball to move the characters while dodging obstacles and collecting rings. The game was developed by Sega's arcade division, Sega AM3; it is one of four Sonic games to bear the SegaSonic name and was inspired by the 1984 game Marble Madness. The game was released in Japanese arcades in late 1993. It has never been rereleased; plans to port the game to Sega's 32X platform never materialized and the game was cut from Sonic compilation release Sonic Gems Collection (2005) due to problems with replicating the game's trackball control system on a standard controller. At the time of release, SegaSonic the Hedgehog received highly positive reviews from Electronic Gaming Monthly and Computer and Video Games for its graphics and gameplay. Journalists writing in retrospect have been more divided. The game marked the debuts of Sonic characters Mighty and Ray; both have reappeared sparingly in the franchise. ==Gameplay== (From left to right) Sonic, Mighty, and Ray skate across an ice-themed level. SegaSonic the Hedgehog is a platformer action game that has been likened in gameplay to Marble Madness (1984). Players control three characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo, and Ray the Flying Squirrel, who can be controlled by a single player or simultaneously with two others. The story follows the three characters after series antagonist Doctor Eggman traps them on his island. They team up to escape, and must dodge various hazards and dangers to reach Eggman in his base, the Eggman Tower. The game takes place over seven levels, which must be completed in the fastest time possible. Players use a trackball to control a characters' speed and direction from an isometric perspective, and a button to make a character jump into a Spin Attack. Each character has a health bar, which is depleted when the player falls into traps; players lose a life if the bar empties. Health can be recovered by collecting rings that are littered around the course or hidden inside obstacles or enemies. Players receive bonus rings for use in later levels they collect over a certain percentage of rings within a level. Upon reaching Eggman at the end of the game, he pushes a button that causes the island to self-destruct. The three heroes manage to escape unharmed, while Eggman is left stranded at sea. ==Development and release== Before SegaSonic the Hedgehog, Sega had attempted to create two Sonic the Hedgehog-based arcade games, but these were never released because \\"they were not the specialness that Sonic was.\\" By May 1993, a new Sonic arcade project was in development. SegaSonic the Hedgehog was developed by Sega AM3, an internal Sega division that created games for arcade cabinets, with assistance from Sonic Team. The game is one of four arcade games in the Sonic the Hedgehog series to feature the SegaSonic name. According to designer Manabu Kusunoki, the idea for trackball controls was conceived after an unspecified member of the development team—who was a fan of Marble Madness—suggested that it would work well with Sonics style of gameplay. The game uses a Sega System 32 motherboard, which enables the multiplayer option, and a unique isometric graphics system. It features two new characters, Ray the Flying Squirrel and Mighty the Armadillo. Both were designed by Kusunoki, who chose their species since he thought they would control similarly to how Sonic did and that they, like hedgehogs, were obscure. Mighty was likely based on an early prototype of Sonic. The game also features voice acting, with Takeshi Kusao, Hinako Kanamaru, Yusuke Numata, and Masaharu Satō voicing Sonic, Ray, Mighty, and Eggman, respectively. The game's title in development was simply Sonic the Hedgehog, but was changed to SegaSonic because Sega lost the trademark to the Sonic name during production. Kusunoki could not recall why it was disputed, but according to video game journalist John Szczepaniak, Sega of America failed to turn in its paperwork for the trademark on July 13, 1993. SegaSonic the Hedgehog was featured at the Summer International Consumer Electronics Show 1993 and the Amusement Machine Show 1993. It was released in Japanese arcades later that year. It is unclear if the game was released outside Japan. Hackers discovered English-translated dialogue and sprites based on Eggman's appearance in the American Sonic the Hedgehog animated series hidden within the ROM image, suggesting that there were plans to release it in American arcades to promote the series. SegaSonic the Hedgehog has never been rereleased. A port for the 32X, an add-on for the Sega Genesis, was reported to be in development in late 1994. Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka said the game was considered for inclusion in the 2005 rarities compilation Sonic Gems Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, but was excluded due to difficulties with emulating the trackball controls on a gamepad. In 2011, Sega's brand manager Ken Balough said there is not much demand for a rerelease; he believes this is because it was not released outside Japan. ==Reception and legacy== In Japan, Game Machine listed SegaSonic the Hedgehog on their November 15, 1993 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave SegaSonic the Hedgehog a perfect score of 10 out of 10. The magazine stated that the game \\"shatters your perception of what a good game should be\\", reserving high praise for its graphics and music, and the variety of levels. It also praised the \\"hilarious\\" character animations and cinematics, and encouraged readers to play the game. Computer and Video Games offered similar acclaim and praised the game's attention to detail, \\"highly recommend[ing]\\" it. The French magazine Mega Force compared the isometric graphics to Sega's Zaxxon (1982) and SNK's Viewpoint (1992). In the midst of a review for Sonic Gems Collection in 2005, GameSpy expressed disappointment that SegaSonic the Hedgehog was not one of the games in the compilation, voicing hope it would someday be rereleased. In 2014, GamesRadar+ called the game's graphics impressive for 1993, but that its lack of a rerelease was \\"no great loss\\". John Szczepaniak offered a negative stance in 2018, due to what he called bland level design and imprecise controls that had \\"an irritating fuzziness\\". He compared turning characters with the trackball to feeling intoxicated, and claimed to have watched several individuals try to play but give up. Hardcore Gaming 101 Kurt Kalata similarly criticized the controls and high difficulty level, but nonetheless praised its break-neck pace and level design, which he wrote were aspects the Genesis Sonic games could not achieve. He ultimately summarized the game as \\"a fun experiment\\". Mighty appeared as a playable character in the 32X game Knuckles' Chaotix (1995). For many years, Ray did not appear in another game, but he and Mighty were featured in the Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series published by Archie Comics. Ray became a member of the Chaotix along with Mighty, who is depicted in the series as his honorary brother. The game is referenced in the anniversary game Sonic Generations (2011), where a \\"missing persons\\" poster of Ray and Mighty appears in City Escape. Mighty and Ray are playable in Sonic Mania Plus (2018), an expanded version of the 2017 game Sonic Mania. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *SegaSonic the Hedgehog on Sonic Retro Category:1993 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games Category:Sega System 32 games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Hiroshi Kawaguchi Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Cooperative video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games ","title":"SegaSonic the Hedgehog"},{"id":"2568031","text":"Benjamin Marshall (8 November 1768 – 29 January 1835)Noakes, Aubrey. 1978.

He was a follower of George Stubbs and studied under Lemuel Abbott for three years. ==Life== He was born in Seagrave, Leicestershire to Charles and Elizabeth Marshall. He initially focused on portrait painting, until at the age of 26 he began to concentrate on horses. He exhibited thirteen pictures, chiefly portraits of racehorses and their owners, at the Royal Academy, 1801–12 and 1818–19. His portraits of sporting characters included those of J. G. Shaddick, 1806, and Daniel Lambert, 1807. Two pictures of fighting cocks, exhibited in 1812, were engraved in mezzotint by Charles Turner in the same year with the titles of The Cock in Feather and The Trimm'd Cock. Other engraved pictures are Hap-hazard and Muly Moloch, racehorses belonging to the Earl of Darlington, engraved as a pair by W. and G. Cooke, 1805, from pictures at Raby Castle; The Earl of Darlington and his Foxhounds, by T. Dean, 1805, and the companion subject, Francis Dukinfield Astley and his Harriers, by R.

Barnard in 1811. Sixty paintings of sportsmen, horses, and dogs by Marshall were engraved by John Scott for Wheble's Sporting Magazine, vols. vii-lxxxi., and eight types of horses by Marshall, also engraved by Scott, appeared in The Sportsman's Repository, 1820. Marshall's exhibited and engraved works represent but a small proportion of the commissions which he carried out for patrons of the turf and masters of hounds throughout the country. A number of his pictures of horses are in the collection of Sir Walter Gilbey. About 1800–10, Marshall was living at 23 Beaumont Street, Marylebone. In 1812 he relocated to Newmarket, and was often described as \\"Marshall of Newmarket\\". He was seriously injured in a coach crash in 1819 which prevented him from painting for a year, and left him with permanent disability. He became a regular contributor of letters about horse racing in The Sporting Magazine from 1821 until 1833, writing under the pseudonym 'The Observator'. He died on 29 January 1835.

White was credited with revitalizing the waterfront, downtown and financial districts of Boston, and transforming Quincy Market into a metropolitan and tourist destination. In his first term he implemented local neighborhood \\"Little City Halls\\" but ended them after narrowly winning the 1975 election during the Boston school desegregation busing crisis, and subsequently constructed a classic and centralized city political machine. He was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain higher office (Governor of Massachusetts and Vice President of the United States). His mayoral administration was subject to decades-long federal investigations into corruption, which led to the conviction of more than 20 city hall employees and nearly as many businessmen; the investigations were influential in leading White to decline to seek reelection in 1983, allowing him to avoid public debate and criticism by other mayoral candidates on the topic. He himself was never indicted for wrongdoing. ==Family and education== Kevin H. White was born in Jamaica Plain, Boston, on September 25, 1929 to Joseph and Patricia Hagan White.http://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Guide%20to%20the%20Mayor%20Kevin%20H.%20White%20records_tcm3-50275.pdf White's father, Joseph C. White, and maternal grandfather, Henry E. Hagan, both served as Boston City Council presidents; Joseph White had also been a state legislator. Kevin White married Kathryn Galvin in 1956, the daughter of William J. Galvin, another Boston City Council president. White was educated at Tabor Academy, Williams College (A.B., 1952), Boston College Law School (LL.B., 1955) and the Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration (now known as the John F. Kennedy School of Government). ==Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts== White was first elected to the open statewide office of Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth in 1960 at the age of 31. The incumbent secretary, Joseph D. Ward, decided to run for governor that year (and lost to John A. Volpe in the general election). White won the Democratic Party nomination at the state convention with the crucial assistance of his father and father in law, who called in political debts in order to obtain enough votes to win the nomination. He was nominated on the third ballot of the convention, thus becoming the Democratic candidate in the general election in November, in which he defeated a rising Republican, Edward W. Brooke (who in later years was elected U.S. Senator). In 1962, White was reelected to a second two-year term, and in 1966 reelected to a four-year term. He served in office through 1967, resigning on December 20, 1967, after winning the Boston mayoral election that November. == Mayor of Boston == White successfully ran for the open mayoral office in 1967, winning his first election with a coalition of Italian, liberal and black voters. He campaigned for rent control; one of his slogans was \\"When landlords raise rents, Kevin White raises hell.\\" This was implemented in Boston in 1970, after a Massachusetts enabling law for municipalities was enacted in 1970. White succeeded mayor John F. Collins, who stepped down after eight years that included urban renewal projects including the planning and building of Boston City Hall, thus paving the way for the future rebuilding and rehabilitation of the waterfront, financial and business districts of the city center that White later undertook. ===Elections for Mayor=== The Boston mayoral election of 1967 had a primary and a general election. In a ten-candidate non-party primary election for the open office on September 26, 1967, White was second, drawing 19.83% of the vote with 30,789 votes, and Boston School Board member Louise Day Hicks was first, with 28.16% of the vote and 43,722 votes. For the general election on November 7, 1967, only White and Hicks were on the ballot in a runoff contest. White narrowly defeated Hicks, who had taken a staunchly anti- busing (de facto anti-desegregation) position as a member of the Boston School Committee. Her slogan was the coded \\"You know where I stand.\\" Hicks's campaign against more progressive fellow Democrat Kevin White was so acrimonious that the Boston Globe, under the editorship of Thomas Winship, broke a 75-year tradition of political neutrality to endorse White.Farrell, John A., Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century (Boston: Little, Brown, 2001), p. 522 White won the general election with 53.25 percent of the vote, (102,706, only 12,552 more than Hicks' 90,154). Two years later, in 1969, Hicks was elected to the Boston City Council by large majorities, and then in 1970 to Congress, winning the open district formerly held by retiring U.S. House Speaker John W. McCormack after defeating Joseph Moakley by 10% in the multi-candidate Democratic primary. In the 1971 mayoral election White won a second term, again defeating Hicks, this time by 40,000 votes. Hicks in 1972 would lose her congressional seat by two percentage points and 3,428 votes in a post-census revised district and a four-candidate general election that included a rematch with Moakley running as an Independent. Hicks was re-elected to the Boston City Council in 1973, remaining there until she retired from public office in 1981. In the 1975 mayoral election, White barely defeated State Senator Joe Timilty, the year after the start of court-ordered school desegregation and busing. The 1979 mayoral election was also close, against the same opponent. White did not run again in the 1983 mayoral election, which was won by then- city councilor Raymond Flynn.https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1975bost#page/76/mode/2up === Administration === Mayor White’s early administrations were noteworthy for the racial and ethnic diversity of the senior aides and staff to the Mayor, with many staffers subsequently going on to influential positions and elected office. White decentralized municipal government by establishing in the early years of his tenure in office a number of “Little City Halls” in local neighborhoods, giving more influence to local leadership and ethnic and racial minorities to access city hall bureaucracy, but following the narrowly won election in 1975 against Joseph Timilty during the Boston school busing crisis, closed them, re-centralizing power in Boston City Hall and creating a political machine intentionally modeled on the one headed by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, with ward lieutenants empowered to reward White supporters with city jobs and city contracts. ===Peaceful city after death of Martin Luther King Jr.=== In the fourth month of White's first term, on April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, touching off disturbances in the African-American Roxbury section of Boston that same evening which did not spread to other parts of the city. On April 5, 5,000 people marched from Boston Common to Post Office Square in King's memory. James Brown had a previously scheduled concert set for that same evening in Boston Garden. White's chief of police was concerned about allowing 15,000 people to attend the concert so close to downtown, saying he didn't think he could keep the city safe. White originally intended to cancel the concert entirely. However, Tom Atkins, a local NAACP leader who had been elected to the City Council from Roxbury in the same election as White 1967 warned of potential rioting if concertgoers arriving at the arena found it canceled. Atkins and members of White's staff persuaded White to allow the show to go on. Mel King is quoted in the article: \\"Very frankly, the problem [the issue of government discrimination and segregation in schools] didn’t get solved until the courts made it happen.\\" On such short notice, Atkins and White administrators persuaded Brown and Boston's public television station, WGBH-TV, to broadcast the concert. The White administration also appealed to community leaders to help keep the peace, and also encouraged people to stay home and watch the concert on television. White appeared on stage with James Brown to appeal to the audience, and to the entire city via television, to remember and maintain King's peaceful vision. (With a link to video of Kevin White's statement on stage, and James Brown's introductory number of the performance.) WGBH immediately rebroadcast the concert twice more that night, and people apparently stayed inside to continue watching it. While many cities, including Washington DC, New York, Chicago, Detroit and Oakland, were beset with civil disturbances, rioting and fires after King's death, the city of Boston was spared from widespread disturbances. White secured $60,000 from the Boston City Council to make up for the loss of ticket revenue to the performers resulting from his efforts to discourage attendance at the close-to-downtown arena at this volatile moment. Only 2,000 had attended the sold-out show, in a venue that had a capacity of 15,000. Individuals with Brown's entourage state that only $10,000 made it to Brown's production company. Interview of David Leaf and review of the documentary The Night James Brown Saved Boston by David Leaf_ Article contains links to the video \\"The Night James Brown Saved Boston, by David Leaf === History of non-leadership by city elites on civil rights === Barney Frank, who worked as White's chief of staff in City Hall during his first mayoral term, has described White's being dubbed \\"Mayor Black\\", because he was the first Boston mayor to admit there was a racial-discrimination problem. White administration staff member, and subsequent Boston City Council President, Bruce Bolling, describes a leadership vacuum on the issue of race, and that for many years \\"the established institutions — the City Council, the School Committee, the mayor, the business community, the philanthropic community, the religious community — no one weighed in in any responsible way to address this issue of school desegregation.\\" This elite leadership vacuum would leave Mayor White without the public community leadership and visible alliances and collaboration desirable to peacefully implement new policies necessary to comply with a later court order to desegregate the schools. The Boston School Committee was independently elected, and not under the control of Mayor White, and had put into place de jure segregation and discrimination policies in the operation and funding of schools in Boston, and this was a source of great frustration to Mayor White. Interview with Micho Spring, appointed deputy mayor under White; and Peter Meade, who held several positions under White, including director of public safety during court- ordered busing. The city administration did not move on the issue of unfair treatment of minorities in the school system, and compliance with anti- segregation laws and decisions, until the a federal court required the city to do so, via a court order. === School desegregation crisis === The state of Massachusetts had enacted in 1965 the \\"Racial Imbalance Act\\", the first of its kind in the United States. The law required school districts to desegregate, otherwise state funding for education would be withheld from the school district. The law was opposed by many in Boston, including the Boston School Committee, as well as many especially in working-class districts in Irish- American-majority South Boston. On June 21, 1974, Judge W. Arthur Garrity issued a decision in Morgan v. Hennigan that found that the Boston School Committee had followed an intentional policy of segregating the city's public schools by race, including building new schools and school annexes in overcrowded white-majority districts, instead of making use of empty seats and classrooms in districts with large minority populations. As a remedy, Garrity ordered the city's schools desegregated, leading to a system of desegregation busing. In Phase I of the plan, Judge Garrity followed a busing plan previously drawn up by Charles Glenn, the director of the Bureau of Equal Educational Opportunity within the Massachusetts Board of Education, that required schools with a population greater than 50% white to be balanced by other races; the initial Phase I plan included only 80 schools, amounting to 40 percent of the Boston Public School system. (Page 3 and following web pages) The Glenn plan had been originally constructed in response to an earlier Massachusetts state lawsuit between the Massachusetts Board of Education and the Boston School Committee. In that earlier lawsuit, the Boston School Committee had sued the Massachusetts Board of Education for the Board's withholding state funds for the Committee's refusal to conform to the requirements of the Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act. Ultimately, among the Boston districts most affected were West Roxbury, Roslindale, Hyde Park, the North End, Charlestown, South Boston and Dorchester. The desegregation plan in general, and busing in particular, was met with an onslaught of protest. The integration plan provoked fierce criticism and led to months of racially motivated violence, with attacks at City Hall and South Boston and other city high schools, with dozens injured. In some white neighborhoods, protesters threw stones at arriving school buses arriving with black children from other parts of the city. White directed that police escort buses, and also coordinated with state officials to bring in several hundred state police to keep order. On October 15, 1974, the Massachusetts National Guard was deployed by Republican Governor Frank Sargent to Boston to keep order in schools. One famous incident in 1976 was documented in a news photograph entitled The Soiling of Old Glory. During one demonstration outside Boston City Hall, black lawyer and businessman Ted Landsmark was attacked with an American flag by a white teenager. Interview with Bruce Bolling, former White staffer and subsequently Boston City Council President. === Rolling Stones === In 1972, White made news when the Rhode Island State Police arrested members of The Rolling Stones immediately prior to a concert appearance in the Boston Garden. That evening, a riot was underway in the South End and White needed to move police officers from the Garden to address the disturbance. Fearing unrest among the 15,000 concertgoers if the Stones were not permitted to perform, White persuaded the Rhode Island authorities to release the band members into his personal custody, enabling them to make their scheduled concert appearance in Boston. He then appeared on stage before the waiting fans to urge them to keep the peace. White's actions won him favor among young first-time voters and parents of teens in his re-election. statue outside Boston's Faneuil Hall honors four-term Boston mayor Kevin White. === Boston downtown revitalization === White worked for the revitalization of Boston's downtown districts, opening the waterfront to public access, and presiding over a downtown financial district building boom. His administration was instrumental in the renovation and renewal of Quincy Market which reopened in 1976, transforming an eyesore and run-down series of warehouses and open stalls into a \\"festival marketplace\\" that was subsequently copied by other cities. Chris Lovett is News Director of Neighborhood Network News in Boston === Corruption investigations === Prior to White's final term in office, Suffolk County and federal prosecutors were investigating a few mid-level city officials. It became known in March 1981 that city employees had been asked to donate to a birthday celebration in honor of the mayor’s wife; the requested donations were not political, but personal gifts, and had amounted to $122,000 by the time White cancelled the event after public outrage official inquiries were conducted. In July 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed William F. Weld as US District Attorney for Massachusetts. Weld expanded the previously ongoing investigative probes, further examining the White administration and the Whites' personal finances. The resulting indictments, guilty pleas, and convictions were subsequently one of Weld’s credentials when campaigning for governor in 1990. Weld's office issued charges of fraudulent disability pensions, bribery, extortion, and perjury that were the downfall of more than 20 city employees, including a number of key individuals in White’s political machine, and nearly as many businessmen. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1982 also released a report stating that the city had misappropriated $1.9 million worth of community grants. Federal auditors accused the White administration of improperly using the funds to pay the salaries of city employees that were not working on federally funded projects. ==Other political campaigns== In his 1970 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, White won a hard-fought multi-candidate Democratic primary election on September 15, 1970, with only 34.33 percent of the vote and by fewer than a two percentage points more than his nearest opponent, Massachusetts Senate President, Maurice A. Donahue. White lost the November 3, general election against Republican Frank Sargent. White's running mate was Michael Dukakis, who challenged and defeated Sargent for the governor's office four years later in 1974. White failed to win more votes than Sargent in the city of Boston in the 1970 general election. White's campaign for governor was interrupted for several days when he underwent emergency stomach surgery for an ulcer. In 1972, during the Democratic National Convention, White was on the verge of becoming the Democratic Party's vice-presidential nominee. After a number of better-known politicians, including Senators Ted Kennedy and Gaylord Nelson, and Governor Reubin Askew, turned down the position, White briefly became the front-runner for the post. Ted Kennedy, economist John Kenneth Galbraith and others in the Massachusetts delegation opposed White's potential nomination, because White had supported Maine Senator Edmund Muskie during the presidential primaries. (alternative article link: via Highbeam: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-33795406.html) Presidential nominee Senator George McGovern decided to turn elsewhere and selected Senator Thomas Eagleton, who was later embroiled in a controversy over his failure to disclose having received electric shock therapy for depression. Ultimately, the vice presidential nominee was former Peace Corps head, Chicago School Board President, and later Ambassador Sargent Shriver, who had married into the Kennedy family. McGovern commented ten years later, in 1982: \\"Choosing White would have been much better than what happened [with Eagleton]. We probably should have overruled\\" Kennedy and the others. ==Later life== After departing from the mayor's office in 1984, White served as director of the Institute for Political Communication at Boston University from 1984 to 2002, and as a professor of communications and public management. Questions about White’s political finances continued to plague him. In 1993, without admitting guilt, White agreed to return to the state nearly $25,000 in surplus campaign funds that he had used for personal expenses. On November 1, 2006, a statue of White was unveiled at Boston's Faneuil Hall. The bronze statue, created by sculptor Pablo Eduardo, portrays White walking down the sidewalk. Behind the statue are several metal footprints along the sidewalk. With these are several quotes from White which were made during his mayoral inauguration speeches. ==Health== In 1970, during his campaign for governor, White underwent surgery that removed two-thirds of his stomach. In 2001, the since-retired White suffered a heart attack that left him with a pacemaker. In his advanced age, he lost hearing in his right ear and suffered from Alzheimer's disease. ==See also== * Timeline of Boston, 1960s-1980s ==References== ==Further reading== * Harvard Center for Law and Education - A Study of the Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act\\" (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1972) * School Desegregation in Boston.

It is about 6 miles (10 km) east-northeast of La Huacana. Its current elevation is . El Jorullo has four smaller cinder cones which have grown from its flanks. The vents of El Jorullo are aligned in a northeast to southwest direction. Lava from these vents cover nine square km around the volcano. Later eruptions produced lavas that had higher silica contents making them thicker than the earlier basalts and basaltic andesite lavas. El Jorullo's crater is about 1,300 by 1,640 feet (400 by 500 m) wide and 490 feet (150 m) deep. El Jorullo is one of two known volcanoes to have developed in Mexico in recent history. The second, born about 183 years later, was named Parícutin after a nearby village that it eventually destroyed. Parícutin is about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of El Jorullo. El Jorullo was first erupted on 29 September 1759. Earthquakes occurred prior to this first day of eruption. Once the volcano started erupting, it continued for 15 years, eventually ending in 1774. Alexander von Humboldt climbed El Jorullo during the Mexican portion of his scientific expedition to Spanish America. When he visited on 19 September 1803, its multiple cones were still smoldering and the air was extremely hot and filled with volcanic gases. He wrote a detailed description of the climb, noting that his face and those of his travel companions were burned. The volcano enriched the local soil and there was considerable vegetation.Myron Echenberg, Humboldt's Mexico: In the Footsteps of the Illustrious German Scientific Traveller. Montreal and Kingston: McGill- Queen's University Press 2017, pp.136-37. Humboldt sketched the volcano in the distance, showing multiple smoking cones.reproduced in Echenberg, Humboldt's Mexico, p. 138 from Herman Klencke's Alexander von Humboldt's leben und wirken, reisen und wissen. Leipzig: Verlag von Otto Spamer 1870. Humboldt undertook the climb with his scientific travel partner Aimé Bonpland, as well as a local Basque settler Ramón Epelde, and two local indigenous servants, whose names have not been recorded. Humboldt noted their assistance on site. Humboldt also notes that he consulted a 1782 publication Rusticatio Mexicana, by Rafael Landívar, who calculated the height of the volcano and the temperature of the thermal waters.Echenberg, Humboldt's Mexico, p. 137. El Jorullo did not develop on a corn field like Parícutin did, but it did destroy what had been a rich agricultural area. It grew approximately 820 feet (250 meters) from the ground in the first six weeks. The eruptions from El Jorullo were primarily phreatic and phreatomagmatic. They covered the area with sticky mud flows, water flows and ash falls. All but the youngest lava flows were covered by this ash fall. Later eruptions from El Jorullo were magmatic with neither mud nor water flows. This 15 year eruption was the longest one El Jorullo has had, and was the longest cinder cone eruption known. Lava flows can still be seen to the north and west of the volcano. The eruption had a VEI of 4. Parícutin and El Jorullo both rose in an area known for its volcanoes. Called the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, the region stretches about 700 miles (1,120 km) from east to west across southern Mexico. The eruptive activity deposited a layer of volcanic rock some 6,000 feet thick, creating a high and fertile plateau. During summer months, the heights snag moisture-laden breezes from the Pacific Ocean; rich farmland, in turn, has made this belt the most populous region in Mexico. Though the region already boasted three of the country's four largest cities: Mexico City, Puebla, and Guadalajara (the area around Parícutin, some 200 miles west of the capital), it was still a peaceful backwater inhabited by Purépecha in the early 1940s. The crater and lake can now be reached by car.Echenberg, Humboldt's Mexico, p. 144. ==See also== *List of volcanoes in Mexico ==References== * \\"El Jorullo: Credits\\". Volcano World.

It is occasionally called a \\"side about the right angle\\". The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. In the context of the hypotenuse, the catheti are sometimes referred to simply as \\"the other two sides\\". If the catheti of a right triangle have equal lengths, the triangle is isosceles. If they have different lengths, a distinction can be made between the minor (shorter) and major (longer) cathetus. The ratio of the lengths of the catheti defines the trigonometric functions tangent and cotangent of the acute angles in the triangle: the ratio c_1/c_2 is the tangent of the acute angle adjacent to c_2 and is also the cotangent of the acute angle adjacent to c_1. In a right triangle, the length of a cathetus is the geometric mean of the length of the adjacent segment cut by the altitude to the hypotenuse and the length of the whole hypotenuse. By the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the catheti is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

In some cases they nest in iron pipes (e.g. the ones used for orchard fencing), and in artificial nest-boxes. The clutch usually consists on 4 to 9 eggs, having two clutches per year. The species appear to be resident in the country with slight local movements. They breed on mountain slopes and in open deciduous forest; lower down on in trees and bushes in rocky terrain, as well as in fruit orchards. The breeding season lasts from early April till end of July - beginning of August. The food mainly consists on insects.

Eilers, Queen Victoria's Descendants (Baltimore, Maryland: Genealogical Publishing Co., 1987), page 165. (; 4 May 1913 – 2 October 2007), styled in the UK as Lady Katherine Brandram from 1947 till her death, was the third daughter and youngest child of King Constantine I of Greece and Sophia of Prussia. ==Early life== Katherine was born in the Royal Palace in Athens, a few weeks after her paternal grandfather, King George I of Greece, was assassinated in that country's second-largest city (in the English-speaking world until the late 20th century known as Salonika, namely Thessaloniki). She was baptised on 14 June 1913. Her godparents were Dowager Queen of Greece (her paternal grandmother), Dowager Queen of the United Kingdom (her paternal grandfather's sister and her maternal grandmother's sister-in-law), George V of the United Kingdom (her paternal grandfather's nephew and her maternal grandmother's nephew), Wilhelm II, German Emperor (her maternal uncle), The Greek Navy (represented by the Minister of Marine) and The Greek Army (represented by the Minister of War). She had five siblings – three brothers (George, Alexander and Paul, each of whom would become King of the Hellenes) and two sisters (Princess Helen, who married Crown Prince Carol of Romania, and Princess Irene who married Prince Aimone of Savoy, Duke of Spoleto). When she was christened, the members of the whole Greek Army and Greek Navy became her godparents. At three years of age, she and her mother were trapped in Tatoi Palace, outside Athens, when a fire broke out. The Queen, carrying Katherine, managed to escape in time.\\"Lady Katherine Brandram,\\" The Daily Telegraph, 4 October 2007. Retrieved 8 March 2013. ==Life in exile== Her father abdicated in 1917, replaced as king by her brother Alexander. She and her parents were exiled to Switzerland. They were re-instated following Alexander's death in 1920, but Constantine abdicated again in 1922. Exiled again, this time to Sicily, her father died in Palermo in 1923. The family moved to in Florence, where Katherine took up painting. Her second brother George became King George II in 1922, but was deposed in 1924. Katherine was educated in England, at a boarding school at Broadstairs and then North Foreland Lodge. Her mother died in January 1932, after which she continued to live at the Villa Sparta with her sister, Helen. She and the future Elizabeth II were bridesmaids at the wedding of her first cousin, Princess Marina, to Prince George in 1934. ==Return to Greece and marriage== Her brother George was reinstated as king in 1935, and Katherine returned to Greece with her sister, Irene. She joined the Greek Red Cross when the Second World War broke out in 1939. In 1941, after Greece had been overrun by Axis forces, she fled to South Africa with her third brother, Paul, in a Sunderland flying boat, where she worked as a nurse at a hospital in Cape Town. She heard no news of her sister Helen for four years. She returned to England in 1946, sailing the last leg from Egypt to England on the Cunard liner RMS Ascania. On board, she met Major Richard Campbell Brandram MC (5 August 1911 – 5 April 1994), an officer in the British Royal Artillery. They were engaged three weeks after they arrived in England, but their engagement was announced only in February 1947. On 1 April at the Royal Palace, three weeks prior to the wedding, her brother King George had a stroke and died shortly after in Katherine's presence.Van der Kiste, p.175 George was succeeded on the Greek throne by Katherine's third brother Paul, who acted as best man at the wedding, which took place according to schedule on 21 April 1947. She then accompanied her husband to his new army posting in Baghdad, and they later settled in England.Van der Kiste, p.177 On 25 August 1947, King George VI granted her the rank and title of a duke's daughter and she became known as Lady Katherine Brandram. She and her husband lived in Eaton Square in Belgravia, and later moved to Marlow, Buckinghamshire. According to her obituary in The Daily Telegraph, \\"Lady Katherine lived quietly but remained in close touch with her own and the British royal families. She attended the Queen's wedding to Prince Philip (her first cousin), and was a guest at the service to mark Prince Philip's 80th birthday at St George's Chapel, Windsor, in 2001.\\" After the death of Infanta Beatriz of Spain in 2002, Katherine was the last surviving great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, as well the last surviving grandchild of Frederick III, German Emperor and Victoria, Princess Royal. She lived for almost 87 years after the death of her brother, King Alexander, and her death left Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Sweden (31 October 1916 – 5 May 2012) as Queen Victoria's last living great-grandchild. From the time of the death of her eldest sister Queen Helen, Queen Mother of Romania in 1982, to the time of her own death, she was Queen Victoria's most senior female line descendant. Her death marked the end of all female-line direct descendants of Frederick III, German Emperor and Victoria, Princess Royal. ==Issue== Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark and Major Richard Campbell Andrew Brandram had one child, a son: * Richard Paul George Andrew Brandram (1 April 1948 – 9 May 2020)Romania Regala he married Jennifer Diane Steele on 12 February 1975 and they were divorced in 1993.

Howsam later became further well known in baseball as the highly successful general manager first with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964 and then GM and club president of the Cincinnati Reds during the \\"Big Red Machine\\" dynasty of the 1970s. Born in Denver, Howsam attended the University of Colorado and served as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II. He was the son-in-law of Edwin C. Johnson, a three-term United States Senator and two- term governor of Colorado.The Denver Post Johnson also was involved with professional baseball as founder and first president of the postwar Class A Western League, an upper-level minor league that played from 1947 to 1958. ==Efforts to bring Major League Baseball to Denver== Howsam first made a name for himself as a highly successful baseball executive. He led the family-owned Denver Bears of the Western League and Triple-A American Association from 1947 to 1962. He built one of the most successful minor league franchises of the 1950s and was twice (1951 and 1956) named Minor League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News. Howsam, his brother Earl and his father Lee also built Bears Stadium, a minor league baseball park which, after renovation and expanded capacity, became famous as Mile High Stadium, the Denver Broncos' noisy, raucous and perpetually sold-out home from 1960 to 2001. While the Bears achieved great success as a Triple-A farm team of the New York Yankees in the late 1950s, their earlier tie-up with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1952–54) served to introduce Howsam to Pirates' general manager Branch Rickey, the Baseball Hall of Fame executive, who had revolutionized baseball in his earlier career with the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey would play an influential role later in Howsam's career. In an attempt to bring Major League Baseball to Denver, Howsam was one of the founders of the Continental League, which in 1959 planned to become the \\"third Major League\\" following the epidemic of franchise shifts during the 1950s. MLB magnates, nervous about the possible rescinding of baseball's antitrust exemption by the U.S. Congress after the National League abandoned New York City in 1958, agreed to study (and perhaps support) the formation of the new loop. Howsam was slated to become owner of the Denver franchise, one of the league's eight charter members. Howsam even went as far as to expand Bears Stadium to over 34,000. Rickey, meanwhile, was elected president of the new circuit. As events unfolded, the new league never got off the drawing board; it was doomed once three of its key cities gained Major League franchises in 1961 and 1962: New York and Houston were awarded expansion National League franchises in 1962, while the Washington Senators of the American League moved to Minneapolis-St. Paul as part of the Junior Circuit's 1961 expansion. ==Founder of AFL and Denver Broncos== Howsam was now in a bind. He had taken on a large amount of debt in hopes of bringing the majors to Denver. However, there was little prospect of retiring it in the foreseeable future, as he was now saddled with a stadium far too big for a Triple-A team. He concluded the only way to get additional revenue was to extend his stadium's season by bringing in a football team. Howsam first sought an expansion NFL team for Denver. When that bid was turned down, Bob Howsam met with Lamar Hunt in the lobby of The Brown Palace HotelThe Denver Postand founded the Denver Broncos—one of the eight charter members of the American Football League. (The Howsams and the seven other original owners called themselves the \\"Foolish Club\\" for daring to take on the established NFL.) The Broncos played in the AFL from 1960 to 1969 and then joined the NFL with completion of the NFL/AFL merger in 1970. After a disastrous 4–9–1 season in 1960, the Howsam family sold controlling interest in the Broncos and Bears to Gerald and Alan Phipps in May 1961. The team would only get as high as .500 only three times its first 17 years, including when it joined the NFL in 1970. But it was developing a loyal fan base, and since its first Super Bowl appearance in 1977, the Broncos have become one of the most successful operations in the NFL. ==In St. Louis: A World Series champ in first year== After selling the Broncos, Howsam returned to baseball. In the wake of the Continental League's demise, Rickey, then 80, rejoined the Cardinals in as a part-time but influential advisor to the Redbirds' owner, Gussie Busch. In mid-August , with the Cardinals seemingly about to finish well behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies, Busch fired general manager Bing Devine and replaced him with HowsamMarkusen, Bruce. Cooperstown Confidential: Why Bob Howsam isn’t in the Hall of Fame. Hardball Times, 2012-01-13.—reputedly at Rickey's urging. On August 17, the day of Howsam's hiring, St. Louis was in fifth place at 63–55, nine games behind Philadelphia. However, the team Howsam inherited ended up winning 30 of its last 44 games—including eight in a row from September 24–30—and captured the NL pennant on the last day of the season, as the Phils collapsed. Then, behind Bob Gibson, they defeated the Yankees in the World Series. During the victory celebration after the clinching seventh game, Howsam was given credit for the St. Louis turnaround. This rankled several of the players, most of whom felt Devine's acquisition of Lou Brock in June provided the final piece of the puzzle. Furthermore, Howsam did not have an opportunity to make major changes to the roster in his six weeks as general manager, which began two months after the June 15 trade deadline then in effect as the Cardinals' 25-man roster remained virtually the same from August 17 through the World Series. Howsam's two full years as Cardinals' general manager (1965–66) failed to deliver a pennant, with St. Louis winning 80 and 83 games, respectively.Retrosheet: St. Louis Cardinals yearly record, 1882– Howsam installed popular Red Schoendienst as manager and he rebuilt the Redbirds infield, trading away veterans Ken Boyer,https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/b/boyerke01.shtml Bill White and Dick Groat in a bid for more pitching help. In 1966, Howsam acquired future Hall of Fame first baseman Orlando Cepeda from the San Francisco Giants in midseason and right fielder Roger Marishttps://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/marisro01.shtml from the Yankees (in exchange for third baseman Charley Smith, acquired as part of the Boyer trade) during the winter interleague trading period. Howsam resisted making a big trade to replace Boyer, instead staying in house and moving long- time outfielder Mike Shannon to third base to replace Boyer. With Howsam's contributions, the Cardinals were poised to win back-to-back pennants in 1967–68. But in December of 1966, a 13-member Cincinnati-based ownership syndicate led by Francis L. Dale purchased the Reds; one month later, in January 1967, Howsam accepted its offer to become the club's new general manager. So Howsam probably got too much credit for the Cardinals' winning it all on his watch in 1964 and not enough credit for the Cardinals' World Series appearances of 1967 and 1968. Credit would not be an issue in his next stop as head of the Cincinnati Reds. ==In Cincinnati: Engineering the 'Big Red Machine'== In Cincinnati, Howsam flourished. During his 11 years (1967–77) as general manager, he was one of the key figures (along with his predecessor, Bill DeWitt, and his manager, Sparky Anderson) behind \\"The Big Red Machine\\", which captured six division titles from 1970 to 1979, four NLCS titles, and two World Series championships in 1975 and 1976. Although many key parts of the dynasty—such as Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, Lee May and Tommy Helms—were already in place or in the organization in 1966, Howsam boldly promoted young pitchers such as Gary Nolan, Don Gullett and Wayne Simpson to the Major Leagues. He replaced a popular incumbent manager, Dave Bristol, with a then-unproven but a future Hall-of-Fame skipper in Anderson, whom Howsam had earlier hired as a manager in the Cardinals' and Reds' farm systems. He ensured that the fruitful Cincinnati system continued to churn out young position players, such as Dave Concepción, Ken Griffey, Ray Knight and Bernie Carbo. He also acquired record-setting reliever Wayne Granger and two talented young outfielders, Bobby Tolan and Alex Johnson, from the Cardinals. It was the second time that Howsam had traded for Johnson (the first was in 1965 while Johnson was a member of the Philadelphia Phillies), and he would ultimately trade Johnson away for pitchers Pedro Borbon and Jim McGlothlin (who would go on to win 14 games for the 1970 Reds).https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/j/johnsal01.shtml Then, in two masterful 1971 trades, Howsam acquired second baseman Joe Morgan (in a deal that included May and Helms) from the Houston Astros and outfielder George Foster from the Giants (for utility infielder Frank Duffy). In Cincinnati, Morgan would win consecutive NL Most Valuable Player awards in 1975–76 and earn credentials as a member of the Hall of Fame. Foster would hit 52 home runs for the Reds in 1977—the only player to crack the half-century HR mark in the 1970s or 1980s. The 1976 Cincinnati club, which won 102 regular season games, then swept both the Phillies in the 1976 National League Championship Series and the Yankees in the 1976 World Series, is considered one of the strongest in baseball history. The Sporting News named Howsam Major League Executive of the Year for 1973—ironically, a season in which the powerhouse Reds dropped the NLCS to the underdog New York Mets. Howsam reportedly had considerably more authority than most general managers of the time. The team's owners during his tenure (first Dale, then Louis Nippert) largely left the team's day-to-day operations in his hands, and he added the title of team president in 1973. He even represented the Reds at owners' meetings. Under his watch, the Reds were known for their strict policies on player appearance. Reds players were not allowed to have facial hair (a policy that continued long after Howsam left the team) and were required to wear their uniform pants and socks in a specific fashion. However, Howsam was especially known for his conservatism regarding labor relations; under him, the Reds were among the hardliners during the 1972 strike. ==After the dynasty== While accepting the 1976 World Series trophy after the Reds' sweep of the Yankees, and with free agency arising in MLB, Howsam prophetically stated that there may never again be a collection of players like this on a single MLB team. Howsam traded Tony Pérez to the Montreal Expos in the months following the 1976 title. Don Gullett left the Reds after the 1976 season and signed with the Yankees. The Reds finished second in the NL West to the Los Angeles Dodgers, despite Howsam engineering a big mid-season trade for future Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver. Approaching his 60th birthday at the close of the 1977 season, Howsam turned over his general manager responsibilities to a longtime assistant, Dick Wagner. The Reds finished second to the Dodgers again in 1978 and Rose left via free agency in the winter of 1978. Wagner fired Sparky Anderson after the 1978 season after Anderson refused to fire key members of his coaching staff. Howsam returned to the club presidency in 1983 replacing a fired Wagner. By then, the Reds were in last place of the NL West. Howsam traded for an aging Pete Rose in 1984 and installed him as a player-manager. Rose would become the all-time hits leader the next year, collecting hit No. 4,192 on Sept. 11, 1985, eclipsing a record set by the immortal Ty Cobb. Howsam was elected to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2004. In retirement, Howsam served on the Colorado Baseball Commission, which succeeded in bringing the Colorado Rockies to Denver as an MLB expansion team in 1993—thus fulfilling his dream of bringing MLB to his hometown three decades after the death of the Continental League. He had been elected to his home state's Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. He died from complications of heart disease on February 19, 2008, at his Sun City, Arizona, home. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American Football League owners Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Businesspeople from Denver Category:Cincinnati Reds executives Category:Continental League contributors Category:Denver Broncos owners Category:Major League Baseball general managers Category:Major League Baseball team presidents Category:Minor league baseball executives Category:St. Louis Cardinals executives ","title":"Bob Howsam"},{"id":"2568132","text":"FMX may stand for: *FMX (broadcasting), a system employing audio noise reduction *FMX (Conference), an annual conference on visual effects in Stuttgart, taking place in February *Famoxadone, a pesticide abbreviated as FMX *FireMonkey, a visual software development framework abbreviated as FMX *Ford FMX Transmission, an automatic transmission *Freestyle Motocross, a variation on the sport of motocross in which motorcycle riders attempt to impress judges with jumps and stunts *Full Mouth X-ray ","title":"FMX"},{"id":"2568149","text":":For the plant of the family Phyllanthaceae, see Phyllanthus.

Mulberry ran for two series: the first series of six episodes ran from 24 February to 30 March 1992, and the second series of seven episodes ran from 8 April to 25 May 1993. A third series was planned, but was cancelled before production began. As a result, the story never reached a conclusion. ==Plot== The programme stars Karl Howman as the mysterious Mulberry, a man who appears at the household of a cantankerous spinster, Rose Farnaby, and applies for a position as her manservant. Miss Farnaby's other staff, Bert and Alice Finch, are immediately suspicious, as the position for which Mulberry applies had not yet been advertised. Their suspicions are well placed. Mulberry is not all he seems; in fact, he is an apprentice Grim Reaper who has been dispatched to the house to escort Miss Farnaby to the next world. Surprisingly for a Grim Reaper, Mulberry has a sentimental, even comical, side with a love of life and laughter that moves him to dedicate himself to ensuring that the sullen Miss Farnaby's last days on Earth are happy, using his role as servant to put his plans into motion. Mulberry's sensitivity and interest in Miss Farnaby's well-being do not sit well with Mulberry's father, a fully fledged Grim Reaper with no interest in human emotions. He appears in most episodes as a mysterious figure (billed as \\"The Stranger\\") in a black hat and dark clothes, urging Mulberry to get on with the job. This is Mulberry's first assignment as a Grim Reaper, a task which he was told he could ease into. His father is annoyed with his dawdling. Mulberry refuses at first to do the job putting it off constantly much to his father's annoyance, and eventually, we learn the source of Mulberry's love of life: his mother, is actually Springtime. Mulberry's mother is one of the few things able to move his father as he grudgingly lets Miss Farnaby have three extra months of life and allows Mulberry to stay for that time after his mother visits. Mulberry also meets his mother for the first time who says she \\"does have some influence\\" on his father. The device of Mulberry's father being Death and mother being Springtime is loosely borrowed from Greek mythology. Hades, lord of the underworld married a young maiden goddess named Persephone. Demeter was her mother and was heartbroken at the fate of Persephone having to live forever in hell. As the goddess of fertility and agriculture, her grief caused winter to come. As a compromise it was arranged for Persephone to only spend half the year with her husband. Thus we have winter and summer annually.

It is estimated to contain about of water, with a total recharge rate of about 166 km³/year from precipitation. It is said that this vast underground reservoir could supply fresh drinking water to the world for 200 years. However, at closer inspection, if the world population were to stay at an equilibrium of about 6.96 billion, not even taking into account that babies need less water than grown adults, this figure reaches 1600 years, allowing about 9 liters per day per person. Due to an expected shortage of fresh water on a global scale, which environmentalists suggest will become critical in under 20 years, this important natural resource is rapidly becoming politicised, and its control becomes ever more controversial. == Geology of the aquifer == The Guarani Aquifer consists primarily of fluvial sandstones of the Piramboia Formation and aeolian sandstones of the Botucatu Formation, which were deposited during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. Over 90% of the total area is overlain by early Cretaceous basalts of the Serra Geral Formation. The basalt's low permeability allows it to act as an aquitard, providing a high degree of containment. This greatly reduces the rate of infiltration and subsequent recharge, but also isolates the aquifer from the vadose zone, subsequent surface-associated losses due to evaporation and evapotranspiration, and potential contamination. The erosion exposes pieces of sandstone on aquifer’s banks, which are called outcrops. This is where the rain comes in and also where the contamination might happen.Carlos Eduardo Andrade Gomes Barreto. \\"BALANÇO HÍDRICO EM ZONA DE AFLORAMENTO DO SISTEMA AQUÍFERO GUARANI A PARTIR DE MONITORAMENTO HIDROGEOLÓGICO EM BACIA REPRESENTATIVA.\\" N.p., 2006. Web. In general, the aquifer comprises a variety of quartz sand, well-rounded format, and has low clay content. Granulometric data indicate that over 50% of the grains have a diameter between . Research and monitoring of the aquifer in order to better manage it as a resource is considered important, as the population growth rate within its area is relatively high — resulting in higher consumption and pollution risks. The countries over the aquifer are also the original four Mercosur countries. == Recharge of the Aquifer == The Recharge distribution is related to precipitation rate. Its complexity is due to the indirect relation between them. The infiltration rate depends on parameters that are variables in time and space. Another important factor that contributes to the aquifer’s recharge is the importance of evapotranspiration. The soil, plants and atmosphere could be considered as components of a system physically related and dynamic. In some regions, the quantity of water that evaporates is larger than the runoff flow. A study by Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) in Ribeirão Preto - Brazil, from 1994 to 2001 indicates that agricultural activity using chemical products offers risk of contamination for the groundwater.Revista Do Departamento De Geografia, 18 (2006) 67-74., Marco Antônio Ferreira Gomes1, Heloisa Ferreira Filizola2, and Cláudio A.

It was an important source of law of the Holy Roman Empire, and was counted among its constitutional documents by the editors of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. In this law Frederick II relinquished a number of important Royal rights (Regalia) to the spiritual princes. Among other things, the bishops received the rights to mint coins and levy tolls in the German part of the Holy Roman Empire and to build fortifications. Moreover, they gained the right to hold courts in their lordships and to receive the assistance of the King or the Emperor in carrying out the sentences passed there. Acceptance of the sentences by the King or Emperor was guaranteed: condemnation by the ecclesiastical courts automatically meant condemnation and punishment by the Royal or Imperial courts as well. Therefore, the pronouncement of excommunication by an ecclesiastical court was invariably followed by the sentence of outlawry from the King or the Emperor. The decreeing of this law, taken in conjunction with the later Statutum in favorem principum, which granted similar concessions to the secular or lay princes, made the power and influence of the spiritual territorial princes in relation to the Empire and the towns extraordinarily great. Frederick's aim was to leave the Empire north of the Alps secure under the direct rule of the princes, allowing him to concentrate his efforts on the southern part of the Empire. This rule of the land by the princes was nevertheless secured at the expense of the centralised power of the monarchy. ==Sources== *Zippelius, Reinhold. Kleine deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte, 7th ed.

Currently director of the Conservatoire Darius Milhaud of the City of Antony (Île-de-France). He is associated with an original movement in Postmodernism, cited in the ‘‘Larousse de la musique’’.see Histoire de la musique published by Larousse, 2000, p. 1137 His compositional style is situated between the formal conception of a theorised musical heritage and the research of new freely referenced musical climates. He is very sensitive to the sound qualities of contemporary music as well as the human role in the context of musical interpretation. As a cellist, he studied with Robert Cordier, Maurice Gendron and Claude Burgos. He studied orchestral conducting with J.C. Hartmann. As a composer, he was principally the disciple of Claude Ballif. He has written several books which deal with musical phenomenology, especially on the symbolic forms of music (1984), on the great musical topics (1994), on musical aesthetics (2000), as well as on musical theory, among them the first French reissue of Rameau’s Traité d'harmonie of 1722, a project supported by the Fondation Singer-Polignac in 1986, and in 1996 Rameau's Nouveau système de musique théorique of 1726. He has also written several works of comparative aesthetics.see Bibliography From 1987 to 1994, he directed the Contemporary Music Ensemble Intervalles and performed premières, as a conductor, of works by J.Y. Bosseur, C. Ballif, M. Mathias, E. Gismonti, as well as his own works in international festivals : in Czech Republic, Germany, France, with retransmissions on Radio-France and the Radio-Suisse- Romande. He directed the conservatory of the city of Sevran from 1985 to 1996, where he invited Claude Ballif to take a composition class in 1990 as well as Marcel Bitsch, for teaching a theory course open to composers. Kremer is president of several musical organizations : including Musiques à vivario from 2002 to 2005 for the promotion of classical music in Corsica as well as the Association of the Vocal ensemble les Oréades, creating a repertory of baroque and contemporary music. Joseph-François Kremer was Professor of Philosophy of Music and Aesthetics at the Schola Cantorum in Paris ; he is regularly invited in France and in other countries as a guest professor (towns of Caracas, Baku, Imatra). He currently works with the Fesnojiv Foundation of Venezuela, after having published a book on the musical and social educational system (2003). He is co-author with F. B. Mâche of the Chart of the compositional and musicological teaching at the University of Caracas, where he teaches as Professor of Aesthetic since 2001.

The ZSR results only from the external inputs or driving functions of the circuit and not from the initial state. The total response of the circuit is the superposition of the ZSR and the ZIR, or Zero Input Response. The ZIR results only from the initial state of the circuit and not from any external drive. The ZIR is also called the natural response, and the resonant frequencies of the ZIR are called the natural frequencies. Given a description of a system in the s-domain, the zero-state response can be described as Y(s)=Init(s)/a(s) where a(s) and Init(s) are system-specific. ==Zero state response and zero input response in integrator and differentiator circuits== One example of zero state response being used is in integrator and differentiator circuits. By examining a simple integrator circuit it can be demonstrated that when a function is put into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, an output can be characterized by a superposition or sum of the Zero Input Response and the zero state response. A system can be represented as f(t)\\\\, Image:System Input Output.JPG y(t) = y(t_0) + \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau with the input f(t).\\\\ on the left and the output y(t).\\\\ on the right. The output y(t).\\\\ can be separated into a zero input and a zero state solution with y(t) = \\\\underbrace{y(t_0)}_{Zero- input\\\\ response} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\int_{t_0}^{t} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau}_{Zero-state\\\\ response}. The contributions of y(t_0)\\\\, and f(t)\\\\, to output y(t)\\\\, are additive and each contribution y(t_0)\\\\, and \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau vanishes with vanishing y(t_0)\\\\, and f(t).\\\\, This behavior constitutes a linear system. A linear system has an output that is a sum of distinct zero- input and zero-state components, each varying linearly, with the initial state of the system and the input of the system respectively. The zero input response and zero state response are independent of each other and therefore each component can be computed independently of the other. ===Zero state response in integrator and differentiator circuits=== The Zero State Response \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau represents the system output y(t)\\\\, when y(t_0) = 0.\\\\, When there is no influence from internal voltages or currents due to previously charged components y(t) = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau.\\\\, Zero state response varies with the system input and under zero-state conditions we could say that two independent inputs results in two independent outputs: f_1(t)\\\\,Image:System Input Output.JPGy_1(t)\\\\, and f_2(t)\\\\,Image:System Input Output.JPGy_2(t).\\\\, Because of linearity we can then apply the principles of superposition to achieve Kf_1(t)+Kf_2(t)\\\\,Image:System Input Output.JPGKy_1(t)+Ky_2(t).\\\\, ====Verifications of zero state response in integrator and differentiator circuits==== To arrive at general equation Simple Integrator Circuit The circuit to the right acts as a simple integrator circuit and will be used to verify the equation y(t) = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\, as the zero state response of an integrator circuit. Capacitors have the current-voltage relation i(t)=C\\\\frac{dv} {dt} where C is the capacitance, measured in farads, of the capacitor. By manipulating the above equation the capacitor can be shown to effectively integrate the current through it. The resulting equation also demonstrates the zero state and zero input responses to the integrator circuit. First, by integrating both sides of the above equation \\\\int_{a}^{b}i(t)dt=\\\\int_{a}^{b}C\\\\frac{dv} {dt}dt. Second, by integrating the right side \\\\int_{a}^{b}i(t)dt=C[v(b)-v(a)]. Third, distribute and subtract Cv(a)\\\\, to get Cv(b)=Cv(a)+\\\\int_{a}^{b}i(t)dt. Fourth, divide by C\\\\, to achieve v(b)=v(a)+\\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int_{a}^{b}i(t)dt. By substituting t\\\\, for b\\\\, and t_o\\\\, for a\\\\, and by using the dummy variable \\\\tau\\\\, as the variable of integration the general equation v(t)=v(t_0)+\\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int_{t_0}^{t}i(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau is found. To arrive at circuit specific example The general equation can then be used to further demonstrate this verification by using the conditions of the simple integrator circuit above. By using the capacitance of 1 farad as shown in the integrator circuit above v(t)=v(t_0)+\\\\int_{t_0}^{t}i(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau, which is the equation containing the zero input and zero state response seen at the top of the page. To verify zero state linearity To verify its zero state linearity set the voltage around the capacitor at time 0 equal to 0, or v(t_0)=0\\\\,, meaning that there is no initial voltage. This eliminates the first term forming the equation v(t) = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} i(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau.\\\\,. In accordance with the methods of linear time-invariant systems, by putting two different inputs into the integrator circuit, i_1(t)\\\\, and i_2(t)\\\\,, the two different outputs v_1(t) = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} i_1(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\, and v_2(t) = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} i_2(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\, are found respectively. By using the superposition principle the inputs i_1(t)\\\\, and i_2(t)\\\\, can be combined to get a new input i_3(t)=K_1i_1(t)+K_2i_2(t)\\\\, and a new output v_3(t) = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t} (K_1i_1(\\\\tau)+K_2i_2(\\\\tau)) d\\\\tau. By integrating the right side of v_3(t) = K_1\\\\int_{t_0}^{t}i_1(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau+K_2\\\\int_{t_0}^{t}i_2(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau, v_3(t) = K_1v_1(t)+K_2v_2(t)\\\\, is found, which implies the system is linear at zero state, v(t_0)=0\\\\,. This entire verification example could also have been done with a voltage source in place of the current source and an inductor in place of the capacitor. We would have then been solving for a current instead of a voltage. ==Zero state response industry uses== The circuit analysis method of breaking a system output down into a zero state and zero input response is used industry wide including circuits, control systems, signal processing, and electromagnetics. Also most circuit simulation software, such as SPICE, support the method in one form or another. ==References== ==External links== Category:Electrical engineering ","title":"Zero state response"},{"id":"2568214","text":"The Sewri Fort (also spelled Sewree Fort) (Marathi: ) is a fort in Mumbai built by the British at Sewri. Built in 1680, fort served as a watch tower, atop a quarried hill overlooking the Mumbai harbour. ==History== Up to the eighteenth century, Mumbai consisted of several small islands. In 1661, seven of these islands were ceded by the Portuguese to the British as part of the dowry of Charles II of England. The harbour proved eminently opposite, and the British planned to shift base from Surat to Mumbai. The Siddis, who were of African descent and noted for their navies, had allied themselves with the Mughals. The British, under the East India Company and the Mughals were constantly waged war on each other. As allies of the Mughals, the Siddis also declared the British as enemies. Faced with relentless attacks by the Siddis in 1672, several fortifications were constructed in Mumbai, and in 1680 the Sewri fort was complete. It stood on the island of Parel, on a hill overlooking the eastern seaboard and Indian mainland. It had a garrison of 50 sepoys and was managed by a subedar. It was also armed with eight to ten cannons. In 1689, the Siddi general, Yadi Sakat, with an army of 20,000 men, invaded Mumbai. The fleet first captured the Sewri fort, then the Mazagon Fort, before sacking the town of Mahim. The fort was also later involved in a battle that repelled a Portuguese attack in 1772. After the decline of the regional powers, the fort was subsequently used to house prisoners. It was later converted as a Bombay Port Trust godown. ==Architecture== The fort was built primarily for defence, and embellishments are absent. It is bordered by high stone walls, including an inner ring for added protection. It is landlocked on three sides, and sits atop of sheer cliff of about . The entrance is a stone doorway that leads into a courtyard. To prevent a frontal assault from the main entrance, the inner entrances were placed perpendicular to the main entrances. Architectural highlights include pentagonal room along with a long domed corridor, and linear vaulted structures. ==Conservation== The fort is currently owned by Maharashtra state's Department of Archaeology and Museums. It is classified as a Grade I heritage structure, and efforts are underway under Phase I of Mumbai Fort Circuit Project to restore it. The restoration involves the creation of two zones. Zone I includes the immediate fort area. The crumbling walls are to be repaired, debris cleared off, roofs rebuilt, steps fixed and a garden created in the complex. A museum is also to be constructed. Zone II renovation consists of the surrounding areas that belong to the Mumbai Port Trust. In this, a sea-facing promenade is to be created that links the fort to the waterfront, along with the creation of a landscaped garden, food court, and amphitheatre. The total cost for this project in 2008 is estimated to be . The strategic location of the fort would also promote ornithology as the area overlooks the Sewree mudflats, that are frequented by migratory birds, particularly the lesser flamingoes. ==Gallery== File:Flamingoes Sewri.jpg File:Sewri fort wall.jpg File:Sewri fort roof.jpg File:Sewri fort stairs.jpg File:Sewri for inside.jpg File:Sewri fort courtyard.jpg File:Sewri fort 3.jpg File:Sewri fort 2.jpg File:Sewri Fort ruins.jpg File:Sewri fort bay view.jpg File:Sewree fort exterior.jpg File:Sewree fort passage.jpg ==See also== * Old map of the region (post 1805). * History of Mumbai * List of forts in Maharashtra ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Maharashtra Category:History of Mumbai ","title":"Sewri Fort"},{"id":"2568229","text":"Ma'barotIsrael Exploration Journal, Volumes 47-48, Israel Exploration Society, 1997The New encyclopedia of archaeological excavations in the Holy Land, Volume 4, Israel Exploration Society & Carta, 1993The red tower (al-Burj al- Ahmar): settlement in the plain of Sharon at the time of the crusaders and Mamluks A.D.1099-1516, British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, 1986, often called Ma'abarot, is a kibbutz in Emek Hefer in central Israel.

It was founded by members of the left-wing Hashomer Hatzair Zionist youth movement in Romania who organized themselves as a settlement group, and immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1924. Upon their arrival in Palestine, the group waited several years until land for settlement was available. They worked as hired laborers in the meanwhile. In 1932, a large stretch of land in the Wadi Hawarith/Hefer Valley area was acquired by the Jewish National Fund of which a small part was given to the settlement group. Ten members established an initial presence on the land, constructing housing and farm buildings, and making a start in land amelioration, while the rest of the group continued its communal life in Hadera. In September 1933, they too moved to the site of Ma'barot, which was located in a swampy area near Nahal Alexander. Over the following years, the kibbutz membership was augmented by additional Hashomer Hatzair groups, from Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany (of which most members were Russian), and Chile.

There are no differential wages, with all members living off a budget that does not include any special compensation for work, the communal dining hall still operates, and over thirty committees regulate almost every aspect of life on the kibbutz. Ma'barot farms approximately 3,000 dunams (3 km²) of land. Cotton is the major cash crop, and other branches include subtropical orchard, fish-breeding ponds and a dairy barn.

Foremost among these is Materna, a leading brand of infant formula.Materna factory In 2017, the kibbutz sold its remaining 49% share in Materna to Osem- Nestle for $156 million. ==Culture== In 1944, Nissim Nissimov, a composer with ties to the Labor movement organized a musical show inspired by the Song of Songs. In 1955, the French cellist Paul Tortelier, impressed by the ideals of the kibbutzim, spent a year at Ma'barot with his family.

The park opened in 1931, four years before the Florida state park system was created. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==Ecology== ===Flora=== Elevated boardwalks meander through an old-growth bald cypress swamp with cabbage palmettos, ferns, bromeliads, orchids and other epiphytes. Some trees are believed to be over a thousand years old, and one is possibly the largest oak in Florida, with a girth of over . ===Fauna=== White-tailed deer, American alligators, gopher tortoises, frogs, otters, golden silk spiders, pileated woodpeckers, red- shouldered hawks, barred owls and Florida scrub jays are common in the park. Florida black bears, bald eagles, white ibis, gray squirrels, bobcats and the rare Florida panther are seen on occasion. ==History== Local citizens, concerned about plans to turn the hammock into farmland, acquired the property in 1931 and promoted it as a candidate for national park status, an early example of grass-roots public support for environmental preservation. One of the prime movers behind the effort was Mrs. Margaret Roebling, daughter-in-law of Washington Augustus Roebling. Though it never reached national park status, it became one of the four original Florida State Parks when the state park system was created in 1935. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established during the Great Depression, built a camp at Highlands Hammock as a headquarters, and developed additional park facilities and the beginnings of a botanical garden. == Florida Civilian Conservation Corps Museum == The park features the Florida Civilian Conservation Corps Museum with interactive exhibits about the 1930-1940s period of the park's construction, and the history of the CCC in Florida and the United States. The museum is located in a building constructed by the CCC. ==Recreational activities== The park includes a scenic three-mile (5 km) loop drive that gives access to the park's nine trails, and can be used for inline skating. An eleven-mile (18 km) trail can be traversed by bicyclists, horseback riders or wildlife viewers. Birding may also be done, since the park is part of the Great Florida Birding Trail. Ranger-guided tours are scheduled frequently. There is a campground with full hookups, and areas for full, primitive, and youth camping. A picnicking area is available with an adjacent playground, as well as a restaurant, called \\"The Hammock Inn\\".

CASS certification is offered to all mailers, service bureaus, and software vendors that would like the USPS to evaluate the quality of their address-matching software and improve the accuracy of their ZIP+4, carrier route, and five-digit coding. For software vendors and service bureaus, CASS Certification must be renewed annually with the USPS to meet current CASS Certification cycle requirements. CASS Certified products are listed in USPS literature and on its web site. CASS software will correct and standardize addresses. It will also add missing address information, such as ZIP codes, cities, and states to ensure the address is complete. Starting with 2007 Cycle L, CASS software will also perform delivery point validation to verify whether or not an address is a deliverable address and check against the USPS Locatable Address Conversion System to update addresses that have been renamed or renumbered. A correct address saves the Postal Service time, money and manpower by reducing the volume of 1) non-deliverable mail; 2) unsorted mail; 3) mail that is deliverable, but requires extra effort to determine the proper location to which it should be delivered. Mailers who use CASS software to check the addresses of their mailing may be able to qualify for discounted postage rates from the USPS. An example of what CASS software will correct in an address: The input of: > 1 MICROWSOFT > REDMUND WA > Produces the output of: > 1 MICROSOFT WAY > REDMOND WA 98052-8300 > Here the street and city name misspellings have been corrected; street suffix, ZIP code and ZIP+4 add-on have been added; and, in this case, the address was determined to be the location of a business. In addition to an updated address, CASS software can also return descriptive information about the address.

He was named Israel Goldener but later changed his name to Irving Gordon. As a child, he studied violin. After attending public schools in New York City, Gordon worked in the Catskill Mountains at some of the resort hotels in the area. While working there, he took to writing parody lyrics to some of the popular songs of the day. In the 1930s, he took a job with the music publishing firm headed by talent agent Irving Mills, at first writing only lyrics, but subsequently writing music as well. After Gordon was introduced to Duke Ellington in 1937, Ellington sometimes invited him to put words to his compositions. However working with Ellington was probably one of the most difficult commissions there was, since most of the Ellington songs were really instrumental pieces whose singable potential only emerged after they had been played and recorded by one or another of the soloists in the Ellington orchestra.Benny Green. Obituary: Irving Gordon: Simply Unforgettable. The Guardian (London), December 4, 1996 Features page; Pg. 16 While working as Ellington's lyricist, Gordon wrote the words to Billy Strayhorn's piece \\"Prelude to a Kiss.\\" For years he like many other composers worked out of the Brill Building in Manhattan. After writing \\"Mister and Mississippi\\", Gordon decided he enjoyed puns on state names and later wrote \\"Delaware,\\" which was a hit for Perry Como. His 1956 hit for Patti Page, \\"Mama from the Train\\" was written to describe the love of a mother who had been born in the old country, but although the lyrics identify her as \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\", the shifts into and out of a minor key mark the melody as Eastern European, and it was widely perceived as a tribute to a Yiddish- speaking mother. Irving Gordon is perhaps best known for his song, \\"Unforgettable.\\" He also wrote \\"Allentown Jail\\", which was played by numerous musicians and told the story of a man who stole a diamond for his girlfriend and ended up in the Allentown jail, unable to make bail and was recorded by the French singer, Edith Piaf among others. Late in his life, Gordon won a Grammy for Song of the Year when Natalie Cole re-recorded her father Nat \\"King\\" Cole's earlier hit of \\"Unforgettable.\\" Gordon wrote both the words and music for \\"Unforgettable.\\" Gordon did not care for rock music, which he said was composed not of \\"melodies but maladies.\\"Irv Lichtman. 10th Yr. For Writers' Haven; Irving Gordon Rages Again. Billboard June 13, 1992, Artists & Music; Words & Music; Pg. 18 Gordon told the Los Angeles Times that by 1960 the vogue for rhymed words and hummable melodies had passed, \\"So I became a tennis pro. I have many lives.\\"Myrna Oliver. Obituary; Irving Gordon; Composer of 'Unforgettable.' Los Angeles Times, December 3, 1996 Page: 26, Section: A; Metro Desk Gordon's obituary claimed that he wrote the Abbott and Costello baseball comedy routine, \\"Who's on First?.\\" This claim was never made by Gordon when he was alive, and others have also claimed authorship. The team perfected the routine after they formally teamed in 1936. Gordon is noted for his contribution to music and lyrics of the Americana genre. For examples it was commonly thought that his song Two Brothers was a folk song about the civil war. For several years before his death he was writing a musical about Sigmund Freud. Irving Gordon died of multiple myeloma cancer in Malibu, California. He was survived by two sons. ==Partial selection of his published songs== *\\"Allentown Jail\\" *\\"Be Anything, But Darling Be Mine\\" *\\"Blue Prelude\\" (lyrics by Gordon Jenkins; music by Joe Bishop) *\\"Delaware\\" (Perry Como hit vocal) *\\"Mama From The Train\\" (Patti Page hit vocal) *\\"Me, Myself and I\\" (Billie Holiday hit vocal, co-written with Allen Roberts and Alvin S.

The regiment in its current composition was formed in 1948 when the Citizens Military Force (CMF) was re-raised after the completion of the demobilisation process following the end of the Second World War and it was formed through the amalgamation of three previously existing regiments. Through these predecessor units, 4/19 PWLH can trace its lineage back to the 19th century and today it is the custodian of the battle honours earned by these units. The regiment had a Regular squadron, 1 Troop 4th/19th Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment, which was posted to South Vietnam in 1965 where it was attached to 1 RAR operating out of Bien Hoa Province. It returned to Australia on 28 May 1966 and became part of the Regular cavalry units that continue to exist in the Australian Army today. These units subsequently served during the Vietnam War and many of their personnel continued to wear regimental accoutrements while in South Vietnam. Today 4/19 Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment is an Australian Army Reserve regiment and forms part of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Division based in Victoria. As part of the restructure of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) units of the Australian Army Reserve it is now equipped with Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles. ==History== The regiment was formed in 1948 as the 4th/19th Armoured Regiment (Prince of Wales's Light Horse) as a unit of the Citizens Military Force through the amalgamation of three other regiments: the 4th (Corangamite) Light Horse, the 17th (Prince of Wales's) Light Horse, and the 19th Light Horse (Yarrowee Light Horse).Festberg 1972, p. 16. Through these, the regiment can trace its lineage through many units, including: the Kyneton District Mounted Rifle Corps, the Royal Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, the 17th Light Horse, the 17th Prince of Wales Light Horse, the 19th Yarrowee Light Horse, the 20th Corangamite Light Horse, the 4th Corangamite Light Horse, the 4th Light Horse AIF,Festberg 1972, pp. 16, 41, 51-52. and the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Unit Guidon showing the battle honours of the 4th Light Horse Regiment The record of the 4th Light Horse in the 1914–18 war is without equal in the Australian Imperial Force. It was the only Australian unit to see service on all three fronts, Western Front (France), Gallipoli and Palestine and was granted a total of 24 Battle Honours of which 10 are carried on the guidon. Probably the most notable action of the 4th Light Horse was as part of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, the charge at the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917, where 800 Australian Lighthorsemen took the town and crucial wells of Beersheba. This action is commemorated each year by the serving soldiers of the Regiment. The regiment assumed its present name in 1949. In 1960, a regular squadron, A Squadron, was added to the regiment. In 1965, this was removed from the regiment's order of battle—Number 1 Troop was used as the nucleus in the formation of 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Troop during its deployment to Vietnam,Moodystack 2003, p. 1. while the rest of the squadron was used to form 2nd Cavalry Regiment.Hopkins 1978, pp. 237–238. Later, 1 APC Sqn would be used to form the 3rd Cavalry Regiment.Festberg 1972, p. 12. In 1992, 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse Regiment underwent another major restructure when it was linked with Victoria's second Armoured Reserve Unit, the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles (8th/13th VMR). Before this restructure, 8th/13th VMR had its HQ and 1 Troop based in Albury, 2 Troop based in Wangaratta and 3 Troop based in Benalla. After the linking, 8/13th VMR became 'A' Squadron, 4/19th PWLH. Mercedes Benz G-Wagon SRV on exercise with the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse Today, the regiment maintains two Sabre squadrons: 'A' Squadron, which is based in Sale and Bandiana, and 'B' Squadron, which is located in Melbourne. On 28 April 2008, a Lance Guard consisting of members of 4/19 PWLH and 12/16 HRL was involved in the dedication of the Park of the Australian Soldier in Beersheba, Israel. The park includes a bronze statue of a lighthorseman involved in the Charge of Beersheba on 31 October 1917. This event was the first time the Regiment's Guidon has travelled overseas. The regiment has been granted the Freedom of Entry to five cities: Melbourne, Kyneton, Beechworth, Traralgon and Sale. The unit operated M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers until 2007, after which its role was changed to a light cavalry unit. It then operated modified Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon 6x6 Surveillance Reconnaissance Vehicles and Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles (PMVs). G-wagons are no longer used, and the Regiment only operates PMVs as well as training cavalry scouts for the Regular Army battlegroups. ==Alliances== * – The Royal Dragoon Guards * – The Queen's Royal Hussars (Queen's Own and Royal Irish) * – The King's Royal Hussars ==See also== * Military history of Australia ==Notes== ==References== * * Holloway, David.

Among his achievements were winning an Olympic gold and silver in tennis at the 1920 Summer Olympics, winning the doubles at Wimbledon, compiling a 147 break in Snooker, making a century at Lord's Cricket Ground, captaining the British Davis Cup team, captaining Manchester City F.C. finishing ultimately runners-up for the Football League Championship in 1920–21, and captaining the England national football team. ==Background== Max Woosnam was born at Liverpool, the son of Maxwell Woosnam, a clergyman who served as canon of Chester and Archdeacon of Macclesfield, and his wife Mary Seeley, daughter of Hilton Philipson. The Woosnam family were landed gentry, of Cefnllysgwynne, Brecknockshire, Wales, originally of Montgomeryshire.Burke's Landed Gentry 17th edition, ed. L. G. Pine, 1952, p. 2790 Woosnam spent most of his childhood in Aberhafesp, Mid Wales. He attended Winchester College, where he captained the golf and cricket teams, and also represented the school at football and squash. As a schoolboy, he made scores of 144 and 33 not out for a Public Schools XI while playing against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. In 1911, Woosnam went up to Cambridge University. A member of Trinity College, he represented the university at football, cricket, lawn tennis, real tennis and golf (being a scratch golfer), becoming a quadruple Blue. After Cambridge, Woosnam played amateur football for the then highly successful teams Corinthians and Chelsea. In the First World War, he fought alongside Siegfried Sassoon on the western front and in the Gallipoli Campaign. Woosnam took part in a number of wartime sporting events, including football matches between a team of enlisted Corinthians players and Aldershot Command, and a Military vs Queen's Club tennis match. ==Corinthian FC== Straight from his University years, Max was chosen to travel on the Corinthians tour of Brazil in the summer of 1913. Managing the tour's first goal, against Rio de Janeiro, he also scored against Paulistano and made quite a name for himself. In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was cancelled when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that there was more to life than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC. ==Post-war== After the war, Woosnam continued his amateur sporting career, taking part in several sporting events. Woosnam was a finalist in the 1919 All England Plate tournament, a tennis competition held at the Wimbledon Championships, consisting of players who were defeated in the first or second rounds of the singles competition. Following a defeat of Woosnam while representing Cambridge University in a tennis match against Queen's Club in April 1919, the Times remarked that \\"Woosnam is a player of many games, and he could excel at tennis if he could devote enough time to the game... ...tennis is a mistress who must be constantly wooed.\\" However, Woosnam continued to divide his attention; he played football for Chelsea either side of the Queen's Club match, captaining the team. His performance for Chelsea led to selection for a North versus South international trial match. Once the football season finished, Woosnam took part in several tennis tournaments. He won both the singles and doubles titles in the Cambridge University tournament, and entered Wimbledon for the first time. His tennis form in 1919 led The Times correspondent to describe his partnership with Noel Turnbull as a \\"doubles team of promise\\". Woosnam declined the opportunity to become a professional sportsman, finding the idea 'vulgar'. ==Manchester City== Upon moving to Manchester, he signed for Manchester City on amateur terms. He made his debut on 1 January 1920 against Bradford City, a match that also saw the debut of Sam Cookson. Initially he played only home matches due to other commitments. However, when Manchester City, without Woosnam, suffered a shock 3–0 FA Cup defeat to Leicester City at the end of the month, some supporters blamed Woosnam's employers, Crossley Brothers. As a result, the engineering firm ordered Woosnam not to miss another game. Playing at centre half, Woosnam eventually became Manchester City captain at the recommendation of his teammates. This was highly unusual for an amateur among professionals. Eventually his success allowed him to play for England (both for the amateur team and as a full international as captain). Woosnam was also selected to captain the British football team at the Olympics, but refused, having already committed himself to the tennis team. He continued other sporting endeavours outside of football however, winning doubles titles at Wimbledon and the Olympics, and captaining the Great Britain Davis Cup team.Max Woosnam. sports-reference.com ==Northwich Victoria== Woosnam had been working for chemical company ICI in Winnington, Northwich, and, while still being on Manchester City's books, he played for Winnington Park and then for Northwich Victoria in the Cheshire County League. He made his debut for Northwich on Christmas Day, 1924, in a derby match against Witton Albion, resulting in a 3–0 victory for Northwich. He sometimes captained the side, before ending his football career in February 1926 due to injuries and other commitments. ==Death and legacy== He was appointed to the board of ICI, and died in 1965 of respiratory failure, having been a heavy smoker all his life. His life is chronicled in the book All Round Genius – The Unknown Story of Britain's Greatest Sportsman, by Mick Collins. Woosnam's uncle, Hylton Philipson, was a cricketer and played five Test matches for England. He once defeated actor and film director Charlie Chaplin at table tennis, playing with a butter knife instead of a bat.

Although a single championship game between conference winners was the current format for the league, a tie in the Western Conference standings between the Green Bay Packers and Baltimore Colts necessitated an unscheduled tiebreaker playoff, the first in the league in seven years and the first in the Western conference since 1957. A coin flip decided the home team. The teams had played twice during the regular season and Green Bay had won both: 20–17 in Milwaukee on September 26, and 42–27 in Baltimore on December 12. Both teams were hampered on offense without their starting quarterbacks. Colts Johnny Unitas and Gary Cuozzo were both sidelined with injuries, and newly-signed replacements Ed Brown and George Haffner were ruled ineligible by the league owners, so fifth- year running back Tom Matte, a quarterback in college at Ohio State, led the Baltimore attack, backed up by defensive back Bobby Boyd. Packer QB Bart Starr was injured (ribs) on the first play, so veteran Zeke Bratkowski played the rest of the game, backed up by halfback Paul Hornung and safety Willie Wood. Tied at ten points at the end of regulation, the game went into overtime for over thirteen minutes; at the time, it was the longest game in NFL history. Green Bay kicker Don Chandler made a controversial field goal late in regulation (22 yards), and then the winning FG in overtime (25 yards). Although the championship game was played in 1966 on January 2, it is recognized as part of the 1965 NFL season. It was the latest date for an NFL Championship Game to that point, and the first time in league history that the game was held after all of the college bowl games. The Playoff Bowl (a consolation game between the conference runners-up) for the 1965 season took place in Miami on January 9, 1966, the Sunday following the NFL championship game. With Matte at quarterback, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 35–3; the rusty Cowboys' previous game was three weeks earlier, on December 19\\\\. This capped a season where the Western Conference won 15 out of 16 interconference games against the Eastern Conference, including the championship game and Playoff Bowl. The tiebreaker playoff between Green Bay and Baltimore was the last for the NFL; the league expanded to sixteen teams in four divisions in and a point differential was introduced to break ties. It was used that year in the Coastal Division, where Baltimore (11–1–2) tied with Los Angeles for the best overall record in the league, but was left out of the postseason, which consisted of the four division winners only; the wild card team was introduced in 1970 with the realignment of the AFL–NFL merger. The American Football League (AFL) had two tiebreaker playoff games, the last in 1968. ==Tournament bracket== :Both games were at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin ==Western Conference playoff== : ==NFL Championship Game== : ==References== Playoffs 1965 ","title":"1965 NFL playoffs"},{"id":"2568300","text":"Bankhead may refer to: ==People== * Bankhead (surname), a surname (including a list of people with the name) ==Places== ===Canada=== * Bankhead, Alberta, a former coal mining village, now in Banff National Park ===Scotland=== * Bankhead, Edinburgh *Bankhead, a neighbourhood of Rutherglen ===United States=== *Bankhead, Atlanta, a neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia **Bankhead station, a train station in Atlanta on the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) system *William B.

Its origins date from the 12th century, based on a former Cluniac monastery. Following the Reformation in the 16th century, it became a Church of Scotland parish kirk. ==History== It is believed that Saint Mirin (or Saint Mirren) founded a community on this site in 7th century. Some time after his death a shrine to the Saint was established, becoming a popular site of pilgrimage and veneration. The name Paisley may derive from the Brythonic (Cumbric) Passeleg, 'basilica' (derived from the Greek), i.e. 'major church', recalling an early, though undocumented, ecclesiastical importance. In 1163, Walter fitz Alan, the first High Steward of Scotland issued a charter for a priory to be set up on land owned by him in Paisley. It was dedicated to SS. Mary, James, Mirin and Milburga. Around 13 monks came from the Cluniac priory at Much Wenlock in Shropshire to found the community. Paisley grew so rapidly that it was raised to the status of abbey in 1245. Monks from Paisley founded Crossraguel Abbey in Carrick, Ayrshire, in 1244. In 1307, Edward I of England had the abbey burned down. It was rebuilt later in the 14th century. William Wallace, born in nearby Elderslie, is believed to have been educated in the abbey for some time when he was a boy. In 1316, Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Robert I of Scotland and wife of Walter Stewart, the sixth High Steward of Scotland, was out riding near the abbey. During the ride, she fell from her horse and as she was heavily pregnant at the time, she was taken to Paisley Abbey for medical care. There, King Robert II was born by caesarean section, in a time when anaesthesia would not have been available. She was later buried at the abbey. A cairn, at the junction of Dundonald Road and Renfrew Road, approximately to the north of the Abbey, marks the spot where she reputedly fell from her horse. In 1491, absolution was granted by Abbot George Shaw, representing the Pope and in the presence of the relics, to James IV of Scotland and others implicated in the death of James III at the Battle of Sauchieburn. By 1499 Shaw had had built a new, larger pilgrims' chapel and added the sculptured stone frieze which can still be seen today, showing scenes from the life of St Miren. It was originally brightly painted and may have been part of a rear panel of an altar before being put up as a frieze on the wall.\\"Pilgrimage in Medieval Scotland\\" by Peter Yeoman, Historic Scotland 1999 Paisley Abbey from the south west A succession of fires and the collapse of the tower in the 15th and 16th centuries left the building in a partially ruined state. Although the western section was still used for worship, the eastern section was widely plundered for its stone. From 1858 to 1928 the north porch and the eastern choir were reconstructed on the remains of the ruined walls by the architect Macgregor Chalmers. After his death, work on the choir was completed by Sir Robert Lorimer. ==Points of interest== Paisley Abbey is the burial place of all six High Stewards of Scotland, Marjorie Bruce who was the mother of Robert II, and the wives of Robert II and King Robert III. The Celtic Barochan Cross, once sited near the village of Houston, Renfrewshire, is now inside the abbey itself. The cross is thought to date from the 10th century. In the abbey's nave, the Wallace Memorial Window, which depicts the image of Samson, was donated in 1873. === Paisley Abbey Drain === In the early 1990s an ancient vaulted drain of extremely fine construction, probably 13th century in date, was rediscovered running from the abbey to the White Cart. Archaeological investigations and excavations took place in 1996, 3–16 September 2009, 2–12 September 2011 and 4 September 2013 and many items discovered.Malden, John (2000).

The drain contains stonemasons marks on the walls, and marks where gates used to be. A virtual tour of the drain is available on YouTube. Robert III, Paisley Abbey Events to involve the public in the archaeological investigation of the drain have been held, with the Renfrewshire Local History Forum. Paisley Abbey Drain is designated by Historic Environment Scotland as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and has similarities to other monastery drains, such as Fountains Abbey, Dundrennan Abbey and Melrose Abbey. === Tombs === The main east window of Paisley Abbey by Douglas Strachan (detail) A tomb in the choir incorporating a much-restored female effigy is widely believed to be that of Marjorie Bruce. Although there is no evidence that she is buried at exactly that location, her remains are thought to be within the abbey. The tomb is reconstructed from fragments of different origin - the base, is likely to have originally formed part of the pulpitum of the Abbey (a stone screen separating nave and choir), such as survives at Glasgow Cathedral. Opposite Marjorie Bruce lie the tombs of Robert III of Scotland and Simon fitz Alan. ===Stained glass=== Stained glass (removed in the Reformation) began to be replaced in the 1870s. Major works include a window by Edward Burne-Jones and the huge east window by Douglas Strachan.https://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/history/explore-the-abbey/burne- jones-stained-glass-window/ The dramatic memorial window to James D. D. Shaw dates from 1989 and is by John Clark.https://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/history/explore-the-abbey/shaw-memorial- window/ === Abbey organ === The choir, organ, and great East Window The Abbey organ is reputedly one of the finest in Scotland, and was originally built by the most distinguished of all 19th-century organ builders, Cavaillé-Coll of Paris in 1872. This is one of only six in the UK.On the website Organlive.com, which has almost 1800 albums of organ music (as of late 2018) only four organs are listed outside France: in Argentina, Denmark, the Netherlands and Paisley Since 1872 it has been rebuilt and extended four times. The organ as rebuilt by Walkers in 1968 has 4 manuals, 65 stops and 5448 pipes.(National Pipe Organ Register; \\"The Organ at Paisley Abbey\\", booklet pub. Paisley Abbey) In 2009 the instrument underwent a major restoration by Harrison and Harrison of Durham. The work included major cleaning and servicing, the provision of a new wind system and the addition of a 32 ft contre bombarde. The latter was part of the 1968 scheme by Ralph Downes but not included in the work actually undertaken. === Internal architectural details === The twelve angel corbels and stone communion table are by Pilkington Jackson, sculptor of the iconic Robert the Bruce statue at Bannockburn. The ceiling bosses are designed by Sir Robert Lorimer and carved by James A Young. The choir stalls, with their wealth of carved animals are by William and Alexander Clow.Paisley's Public Sculpture === External architectural details === xenomorph creature from the film Alien. Erected in the 1990s. Paisley Abbey has been rebuilt and its original design modified as a result of the building being destroyed in 1307, its tower's collapse in the 16th century, and general disrepair that occurred as the result of time and weather. Notably, during a restoration project that took place in the 1990s, a stonemason from Edinburgh hired to replace twelve crumbling stone gargoyles erected one bearing a strong resemblance to the space creature from the 1979 science fiction film Alien, starring Sigourney Weaver.BBC News Scotland 'Alien' gargoyle on ancient abbey, 23 August 2013 A picture of the gargoyle went viral in 2013, though a photograph of the statue first surfaced on the internet in 1997.

It premiered as a special on August 19, 1972, then began its run as a regular series on February 2, 1973; its last episode was on May 1, 1981.Promotional site for the DVD re-issue The 90-minute program followed the Friday night edition of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Like its syndicated late- night cousin Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, the show typically featured guest hosts, except for a period from July 1975 through March 1976 when singer Helen Reddy served as the regular host. Wolfman Jack served as the announcer and frequent guest host. The program's theme song, a traditional folk song called \\"Midnight Special\\", was performed by Johnny Rivers. The Midnight Special was noted for featuring musical acts performing live, which was unusual since most television appearances during the era showed performers lip-synching to prerecorded music. The series also occasionally aired vintage footage of older acts, such as Bill Haley & His Comets. The program also featured occasional performances of comedians such as Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman, and George Carlin. ==History== In 1972, producer Burt Sugarman pitched the program as a means for NBC to capitalize on The Tonight Shows large audience. At the time, none of the Big Three television networks had programming on after 1:00 am local time, as common practice by most stations was to sign-off after the final program. Despite this lack of competition in the time-slot, NBC initially rejected the idea. The rejection led Sugarman to buy the air time for the premiere on his own as a brokered show, convincing Chevrolet to become the show's first sponsor. It premiered with ratings high enough for NBC to reconsider its decision, and the network subsequently bought the program. NBC reasoned that the additional weekly hour of programming would allow NBC to recoup revenue lost as a result of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned the advertising of tobacco on television.Tom Snyder on Later, 1994 The program remained a part of NBC's late night lineup until 1981. The pilot for the series aired on August 19, 1972. It was presented as a 90-minute special encouraging young people to vote in the upcoming Presidential election. Several months later, on February 2, 1973, it premiered as a weekly series. Within eight months of its premiere, The Midnight Special had proven that programming in the later time period was viable, and NBC would expand its programming in the time slot to five days a week with the addition of the talk show Tomorrow the other four nights. The Midnight Specials original time slot was from 1:00-2:30 am in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (Midnight to 1:30 am Central and Mountain). When The Tonight Show's run time was shortened from ninety to sixty minutes in September, 1980 The Midnight Special was moved to 12:30 am (ET/PT)/11:30 pm (CT/MT), maintaining its ninety minute run time. In 1978, at the height of the disco craze, the set was changed to resemble a disco nightclub complete with a platform dance floor. Wolfman Jack stood behind an elevated DJ booth. By fall 1979, as the genre's popularity waned, the disco set was gone. ==Guest stars== Some notable guest stars and hosts included: *ABBA *AC/DC *Aerosmith *America *Aretha Franklin *New Birth *The Bay City Rollers *The Beach Boys *The Bee Gees *Chuck Berry *Blondie *David Bowie *Dr. Hook *Bread *Brooklyn Dreams *James Brown *The Cars *The Chambers Brothers *Jerry Bell *Ray Charles *Cheap Trick *Lou Christie *Petula Clark *Jim Croce *Billy Crystal *Bo Diddley *The Doobie Brothers *Earth, Wind & Fire *Electric Light Orchestra *Mama Cass Elliot *Fleetwood Mac *Peter Frampton *Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons *Aretha Franklin *Marvin Gaye *Genesis *Andy Gibb *Gladys Knight & The Pips *Golden Earring *Goldstar *Al Green *The Guess Who *Heart *Janis Ian *Wolfman Jack *The Jackson 5 *Rick James *Billy Joel *Elton John *Journey *KC and the Sunshine Band *Andy Kaufman *B.B.

It continues through Sweden as the Norway/Vänern Line. The northern half is double track and the entire line is electrified. It serves a combination of commuter, regional and freight trains and is the main rail corridor in the south of Norway. The Eastern Østfold Line branches off at Ski Station and runs before rejoining at Sarpsborg Station. The line opened as the Smaalenene Line () on 2 January 1879. Stations were designed by Peter Andreas Blix. It was the first railway in Norway to predominantly build bridges and viaducts with iron. The line underwent upgrades from 1910 through 1940 in which the section from Oslo to Ski received double track, the permitted weight and speeds were increased and the line was electrified. From 1989 to 1996 the section from Ski to Sandbukta received double track and the maximum permitted speed increased to . Work since 2015 been under way to upgrade most of the line to high-speed. This includes the Follo Line which should offer a direct route from Oslo to Ski by 2021, and new tracks at least as far as Halden by 2030. ==Route== Map of the Smaalenene Line in 1884; the line still follows the same route. The Østfold Line runs from Oslo Central Station through the counties of Oslo, Akershus and Østfold to the Norway–Sweden border at Kornsjø, covering a distance of . The line generally follows the west shore of the Oslofjord until Halden, where it passes through major towns of Ski, Ås, Vestby, Moss, Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg. The line is standard gauge and electrified at . It is double track from Oslo to Sandbukta north of Moss, a distance of , as well as past Rygge Station. There are three railway stations and three freight terminals along the line. At Kornsjø the line continues through Sweden as the Norway/Vänern Line. The term Østfold Line is most commonly used to describe the section from Oslo via Moss to Kornsjø. This is sometimes also referred to as the Western Line. Both uses exclude the section from Ski via Askim to Sarpsborg, known as the Eastern Line. At other times Østfold Line is used to refer to the entire network, both via Moss and Askim. Sometimes Western Line is used to only describe the section from Ski via Moss to Sarpsborg. Although the eastern and western branches were initially planned as equals, the western has become dominant due to it always having had a higher standard and serving all through trains.Langård & Ruud: 151 At Loenga in Oslo the line branches, the main part heading to the Central Station and the Loenga–Alnabru Line branching off to Alnabru Freight Terminal. This section is only used by freight trains.Bjerke & Holom: 60 The Eastern Østfold Line is and runs from Ski to Sarpsborg via the municipalities of Tomter, Hobøl, Eidsberg, Mysen and Rakkestad. Normally only serving commuter trains, it can be used as a bypass when needed. ==History== ===Planning=== The lack of early interest in a railway in Østfold was caused by the ice-free Oslofjord and the perceived non-necessity of build a line where a suitable waterway already existed.Langård & Ruud: 17 Proposals for a railway through the county then known as Smaalenene were first launched with two independent letters to the editor in 1866. They exemplified the debate which would follow, with one proposing a route along the coast through the larger coastal towns, while the other proposed an inner route via Askim and Rakkestad. Preliminary surveys were carried out the following year, which also investigated two routes to the Swedish border, one via Tistedalen and one along Iddefjord. The government was at first less enthusiastic, in part because they were concerned that no line would be built on the Swedish side.Langård & Ruud: 19 The original Ljan Station By 1872 the disagreement over an interior or coastal route was raging and a compromise was proposed in which the line would be built with two branches.Langård & Ruud: 20 The government recommended a twin-armed line on 5 April 1873 and was approved in Parliament on 5 June. Detailed surveying was led by Carl Abraham Pihl and concluded on 31 March 1874. The route was still controversial, especially relating to how Fredrikstad should be served. The main line could be shortened by if the town was served with a branch line.Langård & Ruud: 22 With increasing cost estimates, Parliament decided to reduce the standard on the Eastern Line. There was also a controversy if that line should bypass Mysen.Langård & Ruud: 23 In Halden there was a significant opposition to the line, as there was worry that it would capture lumber traffic which would otherwise run to Halden. Traders and politicians there were more concerned with being connected with the Swedish province of Dalsland, from which a large part of the town's lumber export originated. To secure the Swedish part of the link, the Dalsland Line was built as a private railway with eighty percent Norwegian capital and its head office in Halden.Langård & Ruud: 25 ===Construction=== The Ljan Viaduct was perhaps the most spectacular steel bridge along the line. It was ultimately demolished in 1929. Construction commenced in 1874, initially only on the section from Oslo to Halden. Work was subdivided into eleven sections on the Western Line and four on the Eastern Line. The former received a rail weight of 30 kilograms per meter (60 lb/ft).Langård & Ruud: 24 Work on the Eastern Line did not start until 1877. It received a track weight of only 25 kilograms per meter (50 lb/ft). A recession hit in 1877 and the government stopped all construction for a period, initially only continuing it on the Western Line.Langård & Ruud: 26 Most of the workforce were Swedish immigrants. Groundwork was conducted directly by the railway based on accords, with the track was laid by contractors. The Østfold Line was the first railway in Norway were all bridges were built with iron. This allowed for the construction of viaducts at some places, which changed the mass balance allowing the line to follow a better gradient. Two of the most prominent were the Ljan Viaduct and the Hølen Viaduct. The latter was the first in the world to use the pendulum pillar principal. The bridges and viaducts were all designed by Axel Jacob Petersson.Langård & Ruud: 30 The original Sarp Bridge was modified with an upper level to carry the railway. It was demolished after a new railway bridge was completed in 1931. The Western Line from Oslo to Halden was taken into revenue service on 2 January 1879.Langård & Ruud: 50 However, the official opening did not take place until 18 July. By then the rail connection onward to Gothenburg had been completed.Langård & Ruud: 54 Construction of the Eastern Line was delayed and was opened in stages between 18 July and 24 November 1882.Langård & Ruud: 58 ===Early operations=== The first rolling stock consisted of eight NSB Class 9 steam locomotives for passenger train, three NSB Class 10 units for freight trainsLangård & Ruud: 44 and two NSB Class 14 locos.Langård & Ruud: 46 Passenger cars were at first 60-compartment coaches.Langård & Ruud: 47 A commuter train service was introduced from Oslo to Ljan Station from 1883, allowing the areas of Nordstrand to open up to large-scale housing.Langård & Ruud: 56 The railway allowed for faster postal services and the trains carried markers with the weather forecast, which was announced at the stations.Langård & Ruud: 59 A direct international train service was not introduced until 1 July 1886, when a direct service to Gothenburg and Hamburg was introduced. Travel time to Copenhagen was at that time twenty and a half hours. The following year sleeper cares were introduced.Langård & Ruud: 62 Stream train waiting for departure from Fredrikstad Station sometime during the 1920s The commuter traffic increased and in 1893 a new commuter station was opened at Kolbotn.Langård & Ruud: 78 Two branch lines were built from Sarpsborg. A branch to Borregaard opened in 1891 and the Hafslund Line opened eight years later.Langård & Ruud: 80 To avail the problem in Oslo with human manure, depots were built at Drømtorp, Ås and Vestby to give farmers access to the resource. Manure trains ran until 1929.Langård & Ruud: 82 Construction of interlocking systems started on some of the busiest stations in 1897, although fail-safe functionality was not available until the 1920s.Langård & Ruud: 89 A faster inter-Scandinavian service was introduced in 1900, cutting travel time to Copenhagen to 16 hours and 20 minutes.Langård & Ruud: 92 The higher demands caused the railway to order nine new NSB Class 27 locomotives, delivered between 1910 and 1916, which allowed the maximum speed on the line to increase from .Langård & Ruud: 98 NSB introduced Ea 1, an accumulator electric locomotive, on local services between Fredrikstand and Skjeberg in 1916, where it remained in use until 1920.Langård & Ruud: 108 ===Line upgrades=== As the main international railway out of Norway, the Østfold Line had some of the highest demands for speed and axle loads. In an effort to increase train weights and speeds, the Norwegian State Railways approved an upgrade plan in 1910 which was initially to be completed by 1919. All bridges and track was to be upgraded to tolerate a higher train weight.Langård & Ruud: 93 The break-out of the First World War led to material and funding shortages,Langård & Ruud: 94 and the upgrades were not completed until a new Sarp Bridge was finished in 1930.Langård & Ruud: 120 The line was originally named the Smaalenene Line (), with the spelling changing to Smålenene () in 1921. During this period it was also commonly known as the South Line (), although this was never official. As the line was named for the county, it changed its name after the county changed its name from Smålenene to Østfold. CargoNet freight train hauled by an El 14 at Kornsjø Station Parliament approved double track from Oslo to Ljan in 1916. Construction took its time and opened in two stages, from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924 and from Oslo Ø to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929.Langård & Ruud: 113 South of Ljan the line crossed the Ljan Viaduct, which could not be upgraded to the new standards. A new double-tracked line had to be built around,Langård & Ruud: 117 which opened on 15 February 1925.Bjerke & Holom: 41 By the 1930s the railway was meeting increased competition from buses and trucks. Although slower, they offered more pick-up locations than the train. NSB therefore decided that the Østfold Line, and especially the section closest to Oslo, needed to receive increased capacity, electric traction and more stations.Langård & Ruud: 121 Double tracking continued southwards, opening to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and to Ski on 14 May 1939.Bjerke & Holom: 37 Meanwhile, NSB introduced gasoline railcars which stopped at the new flag stops.Langård & Ruud: 127 Electrification was carried out in several smaller steps, with the first part from Oslo Ø to Ljan completed on 9 December 1936 and the last section from Sarpsborg to Halden, on 11 November 1940. NSB Class 66 was introduced as an express service on the Østfold Line, running a round trip from Oslo to Halden each day, bringing travel time down to two hours.Langård & Ruud: 140 This lasted until 1956, when they were replaced with the slower NSB Class 65.Langård & Ruud: 141 The international trains were from 1948 served with the Swedish State Railways' SJ X5 units, able to run from Oslo to Copenhagen in less than ten hours. The fast service was named Skandiapilen.Langård & Ruud: 147 A landslide in 1953 washed away part of the track past Bekkelaget, resulting in the Bekkelaget Tunnel opening there five years later.Langård & Ruud: 160 The regional traffic received the new NSB Class 68 multiple units from the mid 1950s.Langård & Ruud: 163 A regular train with pyrite started running in 1966, hauling up to 600,000 tonnes per year from Hjerkinn on the Dovre Line to Borregaard. They remained until the 1990s.Langård & Ruud: 168 ===Double track almost to Moss=== Class 72 near Ås Station on the upgraded double track section By the 1960s it was becoming evident that the infrastructure was outdated.Langård & Ruud: 161 A particular problem were the many level crossings which were a safety hazard,Langård & Ruud: 162 causing reduced speed, especially between Ski and Moss. Capacity was also used up and the section was the busiest section of single track in the country.Langård & Ruud: 172 Already during the 1950s NSB proposed building double track, but this was dismissed by Parliament. To avail the situation NSB introduced its InterCity Express services in 1983. This involved limiting stops to Rygge, Råde, Fredrikstad, Saprsborg and Halden south of Moss, causing a large number of stations to be closed. Upgrade plans between Ski and Moss were revitalized during the 1980s. Especially at Vestby Station had reliability issues and there was a need for new passing loop at Tveter Station and Kjenn Station. However, this would not be sufficient to meet future needs, and in 1985 Parliament passed the construction of a double track from Tveter via Vestby to Kjenn. These plans were initially proposed as merely doubling the track to increase capacity, but NSB soon started looking at also raising the speed and standard. From Rustad to Smørbekk the route was planned and placed parallel to European route E6. As the planning progressed, NSB gradually increased the dimensioning, so that the last planned section was capable of .Langård & Ruud: 185 Hølendalen Bridges carry both the Østfold Line and E6 past Hølen The first part of the double track, from Tveter to Vestby, was opened on 30 November 1989. The whole section cost 1.6 billion kroner and was opened for service on 22 October 1996. It was the first railway line to permit such high speeds in Norway. Due to disagreements with the Moss City Council on the route through the city, the double track stopped short at Sandbukta, north of Moss. NSB Class 70 trains were introduced on the InterCity Express services in 1994, replaced by NSB Class 73 from 2003.Langård & Ruud: 177 On 28 June 2000, a new section of double track was opened past Rygge Station. Including a full upgrade of the station, 21 road crossings were removed. The 500-million-kroner project reduced travel time between Moss and Fredrikstad by seven minutes. Since 2007, Rygge Station has also served as an airport rail link via a shuttle bus to the nearby Moss Airport, Rygge. ==Services== NSB Class 69 multiple unit at Hauketo Station Passenger train services are provided by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The L2 service calls at all stations between Oslo S and Ski. The L21 and L22 services make one stop between Oslo and Ski, then L21 continues onward on the Western Line calling at Ås, Vestby, Sonsveien and Kambo before terminating at Moss. L22 runs along the Eastern Line, calling at six stations before Mysen. R20 only stops at Ski before Moss, then serves Rygge, Råde, Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. In regular hours L2 operates with two hourly services, while the others operate with one hourly services. There are additional rush-hour trains. Three R20-services continue onward to Gothenburg Central Station each day. ==Architecture== Halden Station Peter Andreas Blix was hired as the national railway architect in 1873 and awarded the task of designing the stations on the Østfold Line. His designs drew inspiration from Medieval architecture, Gothic architecture and contemporary English villa styles. He let the interior plans dominate the outer shape and avoided symmetry. Most of the station buildings were in wood and standardized designs. Stations which were expected to have larger traffic received a separate goods sheds. The four main towns received brick stations. Halden Station was the most prominent, with an exterior which drew elements from a Medieval fortresses inspired from Fredriksten Fortress and the town's role as a border town. Moss, Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg received the same design with three gables on each facade.Langård & Ruud: 36 ==Future== The Østfold Line is part of the InterCity Triangle and one of four prioritized lines in Norway being upgraded to high- speed rail. The entire section from Oslo to Halden is scheduled to be upgraded by 2030. The first step is construction of the Follo Line, a new line which will run in a tunnel almost the entire length from Oslo to Ski. It will allow all passenger trains heading south of Ski to save 11 minutes, and free up capacity on the old double track for more commuter and freight trains. Construction started in 2015 and the Follo Line is scheduled for completion in 2021. It may also include a new connection to Kråkstad. Once completed, the old double track from Oslo to Ski will receive an overhaul. NSB Class 73 train at Moss Station, which is scheduled to be moved to allow for a new high-speed track Upgrades southwards are split into four phases. By 2020 the missing double-track link from Sandbukta via a new Moss Station to Haug is scheduled for completion. The line from Haug to Seut north of Fredrikstad is planned to be finished by 2024, two years before the double track to Sarpsborg. The final stage to Halden is scheduled for completion in 2030. The National Rail Administration is working on possibilities of expanding the double track further south and in conjunction with Swedish authorities complete a high- speed link between Oslo and Gothenburg. On the Swedish side the final to Öxnered is already finished. The Østfold Line has the largest potential for an increase in freight traffic, with an estimated eleven trains per direction per day. These include freight trains to Götaland in Sweden, including a shuttle service to the Port of Gothenburg. Services could also run to Denmark and further south. Norway imports a lot of food and other goods, but most of enters Norway on the road. Østfold Line has 11 % market share of the freight between the Oslo area and Swedish west coast.Norway proposes longer freight trains to compete with road Two steep hills, Brynsbakken on the Loenga–Alnabru Line and Tistedalsbakken southeast of Halden are currently major hindrances, which limits train size and sets the locomotive requirement. Proposals have been made to build new lines to bypass these hills. One alternative to the south is to build a new railway from around Berg to Skee on the Bohus Line in Sweden. The capacity through the Western Line will be so large, especially during rush hour north of Moss, that it is possible that all freight trains may be routed via the Eastern Line. This will probably also mean that the existing railway between Sarpsborg and Halden will be kept, although it will probably be demolished north of Sarpsborg. The signaling system is scheduled to be renewed and replaced with the European Train Control System, with planned competition in 2030. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * == External links == *Østfold Line at the Norwegian State Railways Category:Railway lines in Oslo Category:Railway lines in Viken Category:Railway lines opened in 1879 Category:1879 establishments in Norway Category:Electric railways in Norway ","title":"Østfold Line"},{"id":"2568342","text":"__NOTOC__ The New Brunswick Railway Museum, owned and operated by the Canadian Railroad Historical Association, New Brunswick Division, is a Canadian tourism museum located in Hillsborough, New Brunswick. It was formerly known as the Salem and Hillsborough Railroad (S&H;). The Salem and Hillsborough Railroad was formed in 1982 by a group of volunteer railroad enthusiasts and retired railroad employees. They took possession of a section of former CN Rail branch line trackage which ran from CN's Moncton-Saint John mainline at Salisbury east to just beyond the village of Hillsborough, approximately away. CN had operated this subdivision to service a gypsum quarry until the late 1970s when the quarry was closed, resulting in the company applying for abandonment. The S&H; initially operated several historic CN and CPR steam locomotives which had been used in New Brunswick until the early 1960s when both railways completely dieselized. The S&H; operated regular coach and dinner tourist trains between Hillsborough and a location halfway between Hillsborough and Salisbury, named Salem, from 1982 until 2004. In 1994, a disastrous fire occurred as a result of an arson attack on the railway's engine shop in Hillsborough, destroying or damaging several locomotives and historic freight and passenger cars. The rebuilding effort took many years, during which time the volunteer base began to dwindle. Since 2005 the site became a static museum as the New Brunswick Railway Museum, using the former excursion train, historical specialized maintenance equipment and several exhibit buildings with numerous railway artifacts. The New Brunswick Railway Museum is open during the summer season and other times by request. The museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada. ==See also== *List of heritage railways in Canada * List of museums in Canada ==References== == External links == *New Brunswick Railway Museum Category:Heritage railways in New Brunswick Category:Railway museums in New Brunswick Category:Transport in Albert County, New Brunswick Category:History museums in New Brunswick Category:Tourist attractions in Albert County, New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Albert County, New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Canada destroyed by arson ","title":"New Brunswick Railway Museum"},{"id":"2568343","text":"The Cathedral of Santa Maria of Palma (Cathedral of St. Mary of Palma), more commonly referred to as La Seu (a title also used by many other churches), is a Gothic Roman Catholic cathedral located in Palma, Mallorca, Spain. ==Description== Built by the Crown of Aragón on the site of a Moorish-era mosque, the cathedral is 121 metres long, 40 metres wide and its nave is 44 metres tall. By way of comparison, the height of the central nave reaches 33m in Notre Dame de Paris, 38m in Reims, 42m in Notre-Dame d'Amiens and 48m in Saint-Pierre de Beauvais, the highest of all Gothic cathedrals. Designed in the Catalan Gothic style but with Northern European influences, it was begun by King James I of Aragon in 1229 but only finished in 1601. It sits within the old city of Palma atop the former citadel of the Roman city, between the Royal Palace of La Almudaina and the episcopal palace. It also overlooks the Parc de la Mar and the Mediterranean Sea. In 1901, fifty years after a restoration of the cathedral had started, Antoni Gaudí was invited to take over the project. While some of his ideas were adopted – moving the choir stalls from the middle nave to be closer to the altar, as well as a large canopy – Gaudí abandoned his work in 1914 after an argument with the contractor. The planned changes were essentially cosmetic rather than structural, and the project was cancelled soon after. ==See also== * Catholic Church in Spain * List of highest church naves ==References== ==External links== * \\"Cathedral of Palma: La Seu\\", Video in english, 3:33 min., Mallorca TV Teleweb+ * Virtual 3D-tour inside a Palma Cathedral * Photos & history of Cathedral of Palma Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Balearic Islands Category:Buildings and structures in Palma de Mallorca Category:Churches converted from mosques Category:Basilica churches in Spain Category:Gothic architecture in the Balearic Islands Category:Former mosques in Spain Category:Churches in the Balearic Islands Category:Tourist attractions in Mallorca Category:13th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1601 Category:Bien de Interés Cultural landmarks in the Balearic Islands ","title":"Palma Cathedral"},{"id":"2568357","text":"TR3A may refer to: * Triumph TR3A, automobile from the United Kingdom * TR-3A Black Manta, speculated USAF spyplane ","title":"TR3A"},{"id":"2568359","text":"Ashmedi Melechesh is an ethnically Assyrian and Aramaic black metal and Mizrahi metal band that originated in Jerusalem, Israel and is currently based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Ashmedi started the band as a solo project in 1993. In the following year, guitarist Moloch and drummer Lord Curse were added to the line-up. The band's goal was to create a type of black metal incorporating extensive Middle Eastern influences mainly based on Assyrian (Mesopotamian) and occult themes (both musically and lyrically); the band invented the title \\"Mesopotamian metal\\" or \\"Sumerian Black Thrashing Metal\\" to best describe their type of metal. They are sometimes referred to as oriental metal. ==Name etymology and pronunciation== The name Melechesh consists of two words of Hebrew and Aramaic origins: melech (meaning king; מֶלֶךְ, ܡܲܠܟܵܐ) and esh (meaning fire; אֵשׁ); hence, king of fire or fiery king. The portmanteau was originated by the band. The digraph ch is pronounced similarly to the Scottish ch, as in the word loch, or the Greek letter Χ. The Modern Hebrew realization of it is the voiceless uvular fricative (/χ/). See Modern Hebrew phonology and Aramaic phonology. In English, an accepted and common pronunciation is me-lek-ESH (). ==Geographical origins== The band started their career in Jerusalem (and Bethlehem), where most Israeli Assyrians and many Israeli Armenians live today, and operated from there between 1993–1998; however, they have resided mainly in Amsterdam since 1998 for several personal, professional and demographic reasons. ==History== The band's release in 1995 of the official demo As Jerusalem Burns... and 7\\" EP The Siege of Lachish attracted attention from both underground metal fans and local authorities. Melechesh were accused of \\"Dark Cult activities\\" by the law enforcement authorities of the city of Jerusalem, especially by a frontpage newspaper article which twisted some facts. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1996, The band released their debut album As Jerusalem Burns...Al'Intisar on an American black metal record label; then newly recruited bassist Al'Hazred completed the line-up. This marked the band as the first signed non-Israeli band from the Middle East and also the first international signed metal band from Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Due to various personal, professional, and demographic reasons, the band members had to relocate. In 1998, armed with a new promo CD \\"Mesopotamian Metal\\" and after a farewell gig in Jerusalem, Israel, Melechesh relocated to France and the Netherlands. Lord Curse remained in Jerusalem and later moved to the USA to continue with his Art studies (and now works for George Lucas' ILM company), hence, the band had to recruit a new drummer. Absu mainman and drummer Proscriptor soon filled the vacant position. From that point on, Melechesh have released two full-length albums: Djinn (2001), dealing with Mesopotamian mythology, and Sphynx (2003), dealing with Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology while always keeping the dark and Near Eastern occult themes close to their hearts. The band recorded their fourth and highly acclaimed album Emissaries which is available in Europe (Osmose Productions) and by The End Records in the United States and Canada . Meanwhile, Xul has replaced Proscriptor as the band's full-time drummer. A documentary was begun filming the founder, about his plight to create the band. Despite the first director leaving the film after losing all footage he did in Jerusalem another director took over and the project is still on track. Ashmedi's biographical articles can be found on several reputable websites and printed magazines around the world, such as the magazines Decibel and Legacy. Meanwhile, since the release of the highly acclaimed The Epigenesis, Melechesh have been continuously touring around the world to further promote the album. On 13 August 2013, Melechesh announced via their Facebook page that both Moloch and Ashmedi amicabliy decided that the former should leave the band, due to academic commitments. It was also revealed that drummer Xul was dismissed in July on good terms. Sirius has been drafted, after one gig the collaboration ended and the position is open for a guitar player. A new drummer will be announced in the future. It is also understood that Scorpios' position in the band is that of a full-time member. ==Band members== ===Current members=== *Ashmedi - Lead Vocals, Guitars, Sitar, Keyboards, Piano (1995–present) ===Former members=== *Uusur - bass guitar (1995-1996) *Thamuz - bass guitar (1995) *Cimeries - keyboards (1995) *Al Hazred - bass guitar, vocals (1996-2008) *Proscriptor McGovern - drums, percussion, vocals (1999-2005) *Xul - drums (2005-2013) *Rahm - bass guitar (2010-2011) *Scorpios - Bass, Vocals (backing) (2013-2016) ===Current live members=== *Nomadic Soul - guitars (2012–present) *Simon Škrlec (BOBNAR) - Drums (2016–present) ===Session live musicians=== *Simon Škrlec (BOBNAR) - Drums (2016–present) *Kevin Paradis - Drums (2014, 2015) *Geert Devenster - guitars *Kawn - bass guitar, vocals (2007-2008) *Malak Al'Maut - guitars (2008-2009) *Rahm - bass guitar (2009-2010) *Aethyris MacKay - guitars (2011) *Scorpios - bass guitar, backing vocals (2012-2013) *Max Power - guitars (2013) *Ralph Santolla - guitars (2013) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * As Jerusalem Burns...Al'Intisar (1996) * Djinn (2001) * Sphynx (2003, 2004 in North America) * Emissaries (2006, 2007 in North America) * The Epigenesis (2010) * Enki (2015) ===EPs=== * The Siege of Lachish (1996) * The Ziggurat Scrolls (2004) * Mystics of the Pillar II (2012) ===Demo=== * As Jerusalem Burns...

The justification for a blackout as a form of protest was a rejection of the proposed increase of fees of electricity and other basic services. == Argentina == During the 1990s, under the Menem administration, the Convertibility Law guaranteed a fixed exchange rate of 1 U. S. dollar per Argentine peso, and the private companies that supplied electric power, telephone service, natural gas and drinking water, among others, earned consistently high profits, which could be turned into dollars and sent abroad with no loss. A number of these service providers had also secured dollarized fees, contracts that entitled them to ask for increases in their fees subject to the inflation of the United States, and other provisions of the kind. After the uncontrolled devaluation of the peso in 2002, the profit measured in dollars was diminished proportionally, and their local operating costs in pesos skyrocketed. The service companies asked the national government of Argentina to authorize considerable fee increases (in some cases over 100%). The Duhalde administration rejected the possibility for a while, but finally called for consultation meetings to discuss the matter. The public reacted angrily to this, accusing the private companies of being greedy and oblivious to the dangerously unstable social environment: half of the population was under the poverty line, unemployment was over 20%, and inflation continued rising. On September 19, 2002, political activists and organizations (Elisa Carrió's ARI, other left-wing parties, piqueteros, the Central de Trabajadores Argentinos, neighbourhood assemblies, etc.) gathered in Plaza de Mayo and called for a widespread intentional \\"blackout\\". On September 24, between 8 and 8.15 p.m., in Buenos Aires and some other large cities, people turned off the lights in their houses and apartments. Many businesses closed their doors and also diminished the lights. In the streets, drivers honked their horns, and there were isolated cacerolazos. The Legislative building of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires turned off the illumination of its facade. The actual strength of the blackout was relatively minor, and even then it was mostly concentrated in Buenos Aires, but the combination of the protests was marked by the media. The government postponed the renegotiation of public service fees indefinitely. == Spain == In Spain, since November 2011 there is also a campaign named A-pagón: No pagues centrales nucleares y de carbón (A-pagón: Don't pay for nuclear and coal-fired power stations) related to the avoiding of the augmentative term \\"pagón\\" which could be translated as \\"big payer\\". The campaign's idea is \\"Don't pay for electricity until it is produced by 100%-renewable-and-clean methods\\". The activists of this campaign argue that \\"If you don't pay electricity until it would be clean, all the electricity company can do is to disconnect you for a minute, which is the time you need to reconnect it\\", and also states that \\"You must maintain always the meter count: in this way the dirty company knows the money it has not incoming, due to using dirty means to produce the electricity\\". == References == Category:Protests Category:Economic history of Argentina ","title":"Apagón"},{"id":"2568407","text":"The City of Falling Angels (2005) is a non-fiction work by John Berendt.

A polymatroid on the ground set E is a nonempty compact subset P in \\\\mathbb{R}^E_+, the set of independent vectors, such that: # We have that if \\\\textbf{v} \\\\in P, then \\\\textbf{u} \\\\in P for every \\\\textbf{u}\\\\leq \\\\textbf{v}: # If \\\\textbf{u},\\\\textbf{v} \\\\in P with \\\\textbf{v}> \\\\textbf{u}, then there is a vector w\\\\in P such that \\\\textbf{u}<\\\\textbf{w}\\\\leq (\\\\max\\\\\\\\{u_1,v_1\\\\\\\\},\\\\dots,\\\\max\\\\\\\\{u_{E},v_{E}\\\\\\\\}) . This definition is equivalent to the one described before, where f is the function defined by f(A) = \\\\max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum_{i\\\\in A} \\\\textbf{v}(i)~~ \\\\textbf{v} \\\\in P\\\\right\\\\\\\\} for every A\\\\subset E. ==Relation to matroids== To every matroid M on the ground set E we can associate the set P_M= \\\\\\\\{\\\\textbf{w}_F~~ F\\\\in M\\\\\\\\}, where for every i\\\\in E we have that \\\\textbf{w}_F(i)=\\\\begin{cases} 1, & i\\\\in F;\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & i ot \\\\in F.\\\\end{cases} By taking the convex hull of P_M we get a polymatroid, in the sense of the second definition, associated to the rank function of M. ==Relation to generalized permutahedra== Because generalized permutahedra can be constructed from submodular functions, and every generalized permutahedron has an associated submodular function, we have that there should be a correspondence between generalized permutahedra and polymatroids. In fact every polymatroid is a generalized permutahedron that has been translated to have a vertex in the origin. This result suggests that the combinatorial information of polymatroids is shared with generalized permutahedra. ==Properties== P_f is nonempty if and only if f\\\\geq 0 and that EP_f is nonempty if and only if f(\\\\emptyset)\\\\geq 0. Given any extended polymatroid EP there is a unique submodular function f such that f(\\\\emptyset)=0 and EP_f=EP. ==Contrapolymatroids== For a supermodular f one analogously may define the contrapolymatroid :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{w \\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}_+^E: \\\\forall S \\\\subseteq E, \\\\sum_{e\\\\in S}w(e)\\\\ge f(S)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} This analogously generalizes the dominant of the spanning set polytope of matroids. ==Discrete polymatroids == When we only focus on the lattice points of our polymatroids we get what is called, discrete polymatroids. Formally speaking, the definition of a discrete polymatroid goes exactly as the one for polymatroids except for where the vectors will live in, instead of \\\\mathbb{R}^E_+ they will live in \\\\mathbb{Z}^E_+. This combinatorial object is of great interest because of their relationship to monomial ideals. ==References== ;Footnotes ;Additional reading * * * Category:Matroid theory ","title":"Polymatroid"},{"id":"2568412","text":"This design for an amulet comes from the Black Pullet grimoire. Embroider it upon black satin, and say \\"Nades, Suradis, Maniner\\", and a djinn is supposed to appear; tell the djinn \\"Sader, Prostas, Solaster\\", and the djinn will bring you your true love. Say \\"Mammes, Laher\\" when you tire of her. The Black Pullet (original French: La poule noire) also known in French as “la poule aux œufs d’or” (the hen that lays golden eggs) is a grimoire that proposes to teach the \\"science of magical talismans and rings\\", including the art of necromancy and Kabbalah. It is believed to have been written in the 18th century by an anonymous French officer who served in Napoleon's army. The text takes the form of a narrative centering on the French officer during the Egyptian expedition led by Napoleon (referred to here as the \\"genius\\") when his unit is suddenly attacked by Arab soldiers (Bedouins). The French officer manages to escape the attack, but is the only survivor. An old Turkish man appears suddenly from the pyramids and takes the French officer into a secret apartment within one of the pyramids. He nurses him back to health whilst sharing with him the magical teachings from ancient manuscripts that escaped the \\"burning of Ptolemy's library\\". The book itself contains information regarding the creation of certain magical properties, such as talismanic rings, amulets and the Black Pullet itself. The book also teaches the reader how to master the extraordinary powers from these magical properties. Perhaps the most interesting magical property claimed in the book is the power to produce the Black Pullet, otherwise known as the Hen that lays Golden Eggs. The grimoire claims that the person who understands and attains the power to instruct the Black Pullet will gain unlimited wealth. The notion of such a lucrative possession has been reflected throughout history in fables, fairy tales and folklore. This text has often been associated to two other texts, known as the Red Dragon (or The Grand Grimoire) and the Black Screech Owl. The latter is also confusingly known as The Black Pullet or Treasure of the Old Man of the Pyramids, and is in fact an alternate printing of the original Black Pullet with only slight changes. All three grimoires claim to possess the science of ancient magic. ==See also== *The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage *The Sworn Book of Honorius *The Greater Key of Solomon *The Grand Grimoire *Kabbalism == References == ==External links== *PaganPath.com - another definition *Grimoire: the magician's handbook *Grimoires & Spellbooks - more information regarding associated grimoires *Online book locations Download: The Black Pullet Category:Grimoires Category:18th-century books ","title":"Black Pullet"},{"id":"2568413","text":"Hernando Urriago Benítez is a poet and essay writer who was born in Cali, Colombia in 1974.

His first major success was the \\"Minnezika\\" a 38 ft. scow design which won the championship on White Bear Lake in 1900. This sailboat was the beginning of the A-Class. As more classes were founded, Johnson moved on to B's, C's, D's, and E's. Johnson was commissioned to build the 16 ft. X-Boat for youth in the 1930s. Johnson designed the J-Scow in the mid-1950s which was converted to the MC. Through the years, the boat builder built Optis and 420s. In 1994, the builder brought out the Johnson 18. In 1998, two years after JBW turned 100 years old, the family sold the company. The scow molds were sold to their competitor Melges Boat Works (now called Melges Performance Sailboats) in Wisconsin.

The fort was razed by the Muslim Koli general, Yakut Khan in June 1690. The fort was located at the present-day Joseph Baptista Gardens, atop Bhandarwada Hill outside the Dockyard Road railway station. ==History== Up to the eighteenth century, Bombay consisted of several small islands. In 1661, seven of these islands were ceded by the Portuguese to the British as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married Charles II of England. The harbour proved eminently apposite, and the British planned to shift their base from Surat. The Siddis, who were of African descent and noted for their navies, had allied themselves with the Mughals. The British, through the East India Company, and the Mughals were constantly waging war on each other. As allies of the Mughals, the Siddis also viewed the British as enemies. Faced with relentless attacks by the Siddis in 1672, The British constructed several fortifications in the area, and in 1680 the Sewri fort was complete. It stood on the island of Mazagaon, on a hill overlooking the eastern seaboard. In 1689, the Siddi general, Yakut Khan, with an army of 20,000 men, invaded Bombay. The fleet first captured the Sewri Fort, then the Mazagon Fort, before sacking the town of Mahim. In April 1689, the Siddis laid siege to the British fortification to the south. The British governor Sir John Child appealed to the Mughal Aurangzeb to reign in Sakat for a price. In February 1690, the Mughal emperor agreed, on the conditions that rupees 1.5 lakhs (150,000) (over one billion USD at 2008 conversion rates) be paid, and Child be sacked. Child's untimely death in 1690, however, resulted in his escaping the ignominy of being sacked. Enraged at barter, Sakat withdrew his forces on 8 June 1690, after razing the Mazagaon Fort. In 1884, the British developed Bhandarwada Hill as a major water reservoir. It supplies water to South and Central Mumbai. A popular recreation ground, the ground is named after Joseph Baptista, a freedom fighter and close aide of the Indian freedom movement activist, Bal Gangadhar Tilak. ==See also== Old map of the region (post 1805) * Mazagaon * Mazagaon Gardens * Sewri Fort ==References== ==See also== *List of forts in Maharashtra Category:Archaeological sites in Maharashtra Category:History of Mumbai Category:1680 establishments in the British Empire Category:Demolished buildings and structures in India Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 1690s ","title":"Mazagon Fort"},{"id":"2568483","text":"250px Hannoversches Straßenbahn-Museum66 or Hanover Tramway Museum comprises a collection of tramcars from all over Germany, and is located on the site of a former potash mine in Sehnde, southeast of the city of Hanover. ==References== == External links == * *Tram Travels: Hannoversches Straßenbahn-Museum (HSM) Category:Railway museums in Germany Category:Transport in Lower Saxony Category:Museums in Hanover Category:Tram museums ","title":"Hannoversches Straßenbahn Museum"},{"id":"2568484","text":"In theoretical general relativity, a geon is a nonsingular electromagnetic or gravitational wave which is held together in a confined region by the gravitational attraction of its own field energy. They were first investigated theoretically in 1955 by J. A. Wheeler, who coined the term as a contraction of \\"gravitational electromagnetic entity\\". ==Overview== Since general relativity is a classical field theory, Wheeler's concept of a geon does not treat them as quantum-mechanical entities, and this generally remains true today. Nonetheless, Wheeler speculated that there might be a relationship between geons and elementary particles. This idea continues to attract some attention among physicists, but in the absence of a viable theory of quantum gravity, the accuracy of this speculative idea cannot be tested. Wheeler did not present explicit geon solutions to the vacuum Einstein field equation, a gap which was partially filled by Brill and Hartle in 1964 by the Brill–Hartle geon. In 1997, Anderson and Brill gave a rigorous proof that geon solutions of the vacuum Einstein equation exist, though they are not given in a simple closed form.. A major outstanding question regarding geons is whether they are stable, or must decay over time as the energy of the wave gradually \\"leaks\\" away. This question has not yet been definitively answered, but the consensus seems to be that they probably cannot be stable.. This would lay to rest Wheeler's initial hope that a geon might serve as a classical model for stable elementary particles. However, this would not rule out the possibility that geons are stabilized by quantum effects. ==See also== *Black hole electron *Edwin Power *Geometrodynamics *Kugelblitz *Quantum foam ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:General relativity Category:Quantum gravity ","title":"Geon (physics)"},{"id":"2568485","text":":For the rotating electrical machine, see Rotary converter Topology of blocking mode cycloconverter A cycloconverter (CCV) or a cycloinverter converts a constant voltage, constant frequency AC waveform to another AC waveform of a lower frequency by synthesizing the output waveform from segments of the AC supply without an intermediate DC link ( and ). There are two main types of CCVs, circulating current type or blocking mode type, most commercial high power products being of the blocking mode type. ==Characteristics== Whereas phase-controlled SCR switching devices can be used throughout the range of CCVs, low cost, low-power TRIAC-based CCVs are inherently reserved for resistive load applications. The amplitude and frequency of converters' output voltage are both variable. The output to input frequency ratio of a three-phase CCV must be less than about one-third for circulating current mode CCVs or one-half for blocking mode CCVs.Bose (2006), p. 153 Output waveform quality improves as the pulse number of switching- device bridges in phase-shifted configuration increases in CCV's input. In general, CCVs can be with 1-phase/1-phase, 3-phase/1-phase and 3-phase/3-phase input/output configurations, most applications however being 3-phase/3-phase. ==Applications== The competitive power rating span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts. CCVs are used for driving mine hoists, rolling mill main motors, ball mills for ore processing, cement kilns, ship propulsion systems, slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400 Hz power generation.Bose (2006), p. 119 The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, ball mills, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded \\"hard start\\" for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as hot-rolling steel mills. Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in electric traction applications to for example produce 25 Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3 Hz power in Europe. Whereas phase-controlled converters including CCVs are gradually being replaced by faster PWM self- controlled converters based on IGBT, GTO, IGCT and other switching devices, these older classical converters are still used at the higher end of the power rating range of these applications. ==Harmonics== CCV operation creates current and voltage harmonics on the CCV's input and output.

Jubelirer (born February 9, 1937, Altoona, Pennsylvania) is a Republican Pennsylvania political leader. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1975 to 2006. He served as President pro tempore of the Pennsylvania State Senate for all but two years from 1984 to 2006, and served as the 29th Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania between 2001 and 2003. Jubelirer was defeated for re-election in the 2006 Republican party primary election and left office on November 30, 2006. ==Early life== The son of a prominent county judge, Jubelirer attended Pennsylvania State University and the Dickinson School of Law. He was admitted to the bar in Blair County, Pennsylvania and practiced law for several years before entering politics. He was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1974 to represent the Altoona area. He was elected Majority Leader in 1981. Jubelirer served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate from 1985 to 1992. After serving briefly as Minority Leader from 1992 to 1994, he again became President Pro Tempore. In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the \\"Hardest Working.\\" ==Lieutenant governor== When Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge resigned on October 5, 2001 to become President Bush's Homeland Security Advisor, Lt. Governor Mark Schweiker ascended to the governorship. By provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1968, Jubelirer as President Pro Tempore was automatically elevated to Lt. Governor and sworn in the same day. Jubelirer's elevation to the office was not without controversy, as he retained his position in the Pennsylvania State Senate. Critics and political foes argued that this violated the separation of powers principle and threatened the checks and balances guaranteed in the state constitution. A lawsuit was filed by State Rep. John Lawless, Joseph Wiedemer and Leechburg Area School Board member Charles A. Pascal, Jr. to block Jubelirer's simultaneous service in the Senate and the executive branch, but the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court rejected the argument and issued a per curiam decisionLawless v. Jubelirer, 811 A.2d 974 (Pa. 2002) allowing Jubelirer to hold both offices simultaneously. Jubelirer continued in both offices until January 21, 2003 when Schweiker's term expired. He declined to accept the Lt. Governor's salary during his term. As Lt. Governor, Jubelirer served as President of the Senate, Chairman of the Board of Pardons, and Chairman of the Emergency Management Agency. In addition, he served as acting governor when Schweiker left the state. After his term as Lt. Governor expired, Jubelirer cosponsored a bipartisan bill in the state senate that would amend the state constitution and allow the Governor to choose a candidate to fill a mid-term vacancy in the Lt. Governor's office upon approval of the senate. The bill was not passed. ==2006 primary election defeat== In May 2006, Jubelirer was defeated in the Republican primary by Blair County Commissioner John Eichelberger. He, along with Chip Brightbill, the Senate majority leader, were the first top-ranking Pennsylvania legislative leaders to lose a primary election since 1964. The defeat was attributed primarily to his role in drafting a legislative pay raise bill in July 2005. Jubelirer initially defended the raise. However, after internal polling showed his support falling, he opened discussion of a repeal of the unvouchered expense provision. However, newspapers reported that he tried to block efforts to repeal the entire raise. In the wake of the controversy, the Senator issued a statement in which he called the pay raise a \\"mistake\\" ... I apologized for it in my district. I now think it was the wrong thing to do. Hindsight is 20-20. I'm not shifting the blame to anybody. I accept the responsibility.\\" He pledged to return the money he had received from the unvouchered expense account. During the campaign, Jubelirer's more conservative challengers attacked him on abortion. Despite statements during the 2006 campaign that he was anti-abortion, Jubelirer's opposition to the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act and a \\"pro-choice\\" rating by both the National Abortion Rights Action League and Planned Parenthood were used by opponents to counter his arguments. He told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that he was \\"a pro-choice Republican\\" and that he did not support the Republican platform on abortion.Hostein, Lisa GOP Jews aim to show they're not an oxymoron, Jewishsf.com, August 4, 2000. Jubelirer's initial annual pension was $90,934. ==2013 Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees election== Jubelirer attempted a comeback of sorts, seeking a seat on the Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees. Despite an endorsement from former Gov. Tom Ridge, Jubelirer finished a distant sixth place, failing to earn one of the three seats. He was elected to The Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees in 2014. ==See also== *2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy *Drew Crompton ==References== ==External links== *Jubelirer's Lobbyist Registration Statement, palobbyingservices.state.pa.us; accessed June 30, 2017. * Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Lieutenant Governors of Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania state senators Category:Presidents pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate Category:Pennsylvania lawyers Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Jewish American state legislators in Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:Politicians from Altoona, Pennsylvania ","title":"Robert Jubelirer"},{"id":"2568492","text":"The Harriet L.

Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gaspé (30 October 1786 – 29 January 1871) was a French Canadian writer and seigneur. ==Biography== He was born in Quebec City in 1786, the son of seigneur Pierre-Ignace Aubert de Gaspé and Catherine Tarieu de Lanaudière, the daughter of seigneur Charles-François Tarieu de La Naudière. The Aubert de Gaspé family was distinguished, ennobled by Louis XIV in 1693. Philippe-Joseph's grandfather, Ignace-Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, fought under Louis-Joseph de Montcalm at Carillon (Ticonderoga). Philippe- Joseph studied at the Séminaire de Québec. He studied law with Jonathan Sewell and then with Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Perrault and was called to the bar in 1811. Aubert de Gaspé served in the local militia, becoming captain. After practising law until 1816, he was appointed sheriff for Quebec district. He became involved in debt, for which he was imprisoned four years, and when released he retired to his ancestral home at Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence. Aubert de Gaspé spent thirty years in study there. At the age of seventy-five, he completed a novel, Les Anciens Canadiens (\\"Old-Time Canadians\\", Quebec, 1863). Almost entirely based on fact, the story illustrates Canadian national tradition, character, and manners. The author interwove events of his own chequered life with the tragic tale of the struggles and the fall of New France and the change of regime, the eyewitnesses of which he had known personally. At that time, it was perhaps the most popular book ever published in Quebec. In 1866, Aubert de Gaspé published his Mémoires, which continue and amplify the precious historical notes contained in his other works. Less brilliant and attractive than his novel, the Mémoires are an excellent specimen of anecdotal history.

It operates its own tram line south of Wuppertal on original rails with original cars. Therefore, it's one of the smallest running tram systems in the world. Wuppertal operates still the \\"Schwebebahn\\", a unique overhead railway. == Museum line == Petrikshammer halt The museum line begins about 50 m east of the Kohlfurth bridge, where the depot may be found with its exhibition of vehicles and a bookshop. A track coming from the bridge is currently out of use. East of the depot the line winds its way south and then swings around in a 180° curve in order to follow the Kaltenbach valley north. The end of the line is currently at Greuel halt, although it has long been planned to work the section beyond that to Möschenborn. Near Möschenborn halt the old line turns south again in order to reach Cronenberg. The route has a height difference of about 150 metres, which means that it has an average incline of 5%. The largest part of the route cuts through a wood and is therefore typical of the former overground tramway network. On the other hand the route does not really have any town sections. There are seven stops. == Vehicles == Wagon 66, formerly at Remscheid and Darmstadt The following vehicles, amongst others, are used for services: * Tw 105, Talbot, built 1927, formerly used in: Wuppertal * Tw 107, DÜWAG, built 1936, formerly used in: Düsseldorf * Tw 275, DÜWAG, built 1957, formerly used in: Bochum * Tw 337, DÜWAG, built 1957, formerly used in: Hagen The following vehicles are also used for maintenance: * Grinding wagon 610 (Seidlitz & Kuschmierz, built 1950, formerly used in: Bochum) * Tower railcar 628 (Eigenbau, built 1950, formerly used in: Wuppertal) * Departmental wagon 406 (Rastatt, built 1951, formerly used in: Freiburg) * Works wagon 683 (Credé, built 1952, formerly used in: Bochum) Other vehicles are in working order, but stored and can be visited, e. g. * Tw 106, Westwaggon, built 1960, formerly used in: Remscheid, from 1969 Darmstadt (where it was No. 66) == Opening times and museum services == The museum is open all year round on Saturdays from 11 am to 5 pm, and from May to October also on Sundays from 11 am to 5 pm.

These names are all registered trademarks of Macrovision, whose corporate predecessor, Gemstar, developed these algorithms for use in integrated endecs. ==History== A full view of a typical vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) used in a videocassette recorder Before the advent of on-screen displays, the only interface available for programming a home video recorder was a small VFD, LED or LCD panel and a small number of buttons. Correctly setting up a recording for a specific program was therefore a somewhat complex operation for many people. G-Code, VideoPlus+ and ShowView were introduced in the late 1980s to remove this difficulty. ==Concept== The central concept of the system is a unique number, a PlusCode, assigned to each program, and published in television listings in newspapers and magazines (such as TV Guide). To record a program, the code number is taken from the newspaper and input into the video recorder, which would then record on the correct channel at the correct time. The number is generated by an algorithm from the date, time and channel of the program; as a result, it does not rely on an over-the-air channel to serve as a conduit to ensure the recording is properly timed. This means it will not compensate for a disrupted schedule due to live sporting events or bulletins for breaking news events, however many video recorders with these systems also incorporate Programme Delivery Control (PDC) and use that to alter times if possible. ==Branding== A Panasonic late-model VCR Omnivision Stereo 4-Head which supports VCRPlus+ The system has been licensed to television and VCR manufacturers in about 40 countries, but is branded under different names depending on the country. It is known as VCR Plus+, VCR Plus+ Silver and VCR Plus+ Gold in the United States and Canada; G-Code in Japan, China, New Zealand and Australia; VideoPlus+ in Ireland the United Kingdom and Japan; and ShowView in the rest of Europe as well as in South Africa. The system is branded as VideoPlus+/ShowView in Europe due to an existing trademark registration for \\"VCR\\" by Philips in that continent, and as G-Code (the \\"G\\" standing for the system's developer Gemstar) in Japan because VCR is not a common abbreviation there (\\"VTR,\\" for videotape recorder, is used instead). Japan initially used the name Video Plus+ and later changed to G-Code, an example of this is the Victor (JVC) HR-880. Because television programming schedules are different, the coding has to be adjusted in each of the regions and recording equipment is not interchangeable. ==Algorithms== The actual algorithms used to encode and decode the television guide values from and to their time representations were published in 1992, but only for six- digit codes or less.http://www.righto.com/papers/vcr.htmlK.

Brannock for measuring a person's shoe size. The son of a shoe industry entrepreneur, Brannock attended Syracuse University, New York, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Brannock spent two years developing a simple means of measuring the length, width, and arch length of the human foot. He eventually improved on the wooden RITZ Stick, the industry standard of the day, patenting his first prototype in 1925 and an improved version in 1927. The device has both left and right heel cups and is rotated through 180 degrees to measure the second foot. Brannock later formed the Brannock Device Company to manufacture and sell the product, and headed the company until 1993 when he died at age 89. Today, the Brannock Device is an international standard of the footwear industry, and the Smithsonian Institution houses samples of some of the first Brannock Devices. The Brannock Device Company was headquartered in Syracuse, New York, until shortly after Charles Brannock's death. Salvatore Leonardi purchased the company from the Brannock Estate in 1993, and moved manufacturing to a small factory in Liverpool, New York. The company continues to manufacture several models of the device for determining the shoe sizes of men, women, and children; they also produce specialized models for fitting other types of footwear. On May 31, 2018 the Syracuse minor league baseball team had a one-night promotion and rebranded as the Syracuse Devices in honor of the Brannock Device.Hill, Benjamin. \\"Chiefs give Brannock Devices their due\\", MiLB.com, New York, 4 June 2018.

Actin filaments are associated with adherens junctions in addition to several other actin-binding proteins such as vinculin. The head domain of vinculin associates to E-cadherin via α-, β - and γ -catenins. The tail domain of vinculin binds to membrane lipids and to actin filaments. Adherens junctions (or zonula adherens, intermediate junction, or \\"belt desmosome\\") are protein complexes that occur at cell–cell junctions in epithelial and endothelial tissues, usually more basal than tight junctions. An adherens junction is defined as a cell junction whose cytoplasmic face is linked to the actin cytoskeleton. They can appear as bands encircling the cell (zonula adherens) or as spots of attachment to the extracellular matrix (adhesion plaques). Adherens junctions uniquely disassemble in uterine epithelial cells to allow the blastocyst to penetrate between epithelial cells. A similar cell junction in non-epithelial, non-endothelial cells is the fascia adherens. It is structurally the same, but appears in ribbonlike patterns that do not completely encircle the cells. One example is in cardiomyocytes. ==Proteins== Adherens junctions are composed of the following proteins: * cadherins. The cadherins are a family of transmembrane proteins that form homodimers in a calcium-dependent manner with other cadherin molecules on adjacent cells. * p120 (sometimes called delta catenin) binds the juxtamembrane region of the cadherin. * γ-catenin or gamma-catenin (plakoglobin) binds the catenin-binding region of the cadherin. * α-catenin or alpha-catenin binds the cadherin indirectly via β-catenin or plakoglobin and links the actin cytoskeleton with cadherin. ==Models== Adherens junctions were, for many years, thought to share the characteristic of anchor cells through their cytoplasmic actin filaments.

The name also commonly refers to the heritage streetcar line which OPT began operating in 1993, on which service is currently indefinitely suspended. OPT consists of three divisions that each fill a specific role in preserving the state's mass transit history. The divisions are the Street Railway Division, Motor Bus Division and the Museum Division (Southern Arizona Transportation Museum). Old Pueblo Trolley's streetcar line opened in 1993. The trolley last ran on October 31, 2011, when service was suspended for construction of the Sun Link modern-streetcar system. Operating on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Old Pueblo Trolley ran on just over a mile of single-track line recovered from Tucson's original street railway. From its south terminus at 5th Avenue and Broadway Boulevard the trolley ran north on 4th Avenue before heading east on University Boulevard to its terminus at Tyndall Street, just west of the University of Arizona Main Gate. ==History== ===Tucson's original streetcar system=== Electric streetcars began operating in Tucson on June 1, 1906, and replaced the horse- and mule- drawn cars as a mark of Tucson's \\"modernity\\". The event drew quite a crowd including the mayor, L.H. Manning and C.K. Durbin, owner of the new line. The Tucson Citizen ran an article \\"Electric Cars Running in Old Pueblo\\" in its Friday, June 1, 1906 edition. It reported that two new electric cars left the corner of Stone Avenue and Congress Street at 2:00 p.m. for the University of Arizona filled with dignitaries and invited guests while an orchestra played a few tunes at the corner. The return trip was to Elysian Grove via Seventeenth where Emanual Drachman provided seats and refreshments for the banquet that followed. One car wore the banner, \\"The Goods Are Delivered L. H. M.\\", demonstrating that Mayor Manning had come through on his campaign platform to \\"promote and establish an electric streetcar system.\\" Hence, Tucson was brought up to date, into the electric transportation era. Streetcars ran for the last time on December 31, 1930,Young, Andrew D. (1994). \\"Heritage Trolleys: A Year of More Ups than Downs\\". 1994 Light Rail Annual & User's Guide, pp. 57–61. Pentrex. ISSN 0160-6913. and were replaced by buses. ===The heritage streetcar line=== OPT's first streetcar was this Birney-type car, on loan from a California museum until 1995. Revival of the line began as the dream of Ruth Cross, director for the University of Arizona's Centennial Celebration in 1983, to see the historic streetcars returned to the Old Pueblo for the University's centennial. A 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Old Pueblo Trolley (OPT), was formed to raise funds and coordinate planning with the city and business community, and volunteers also donated time to move the idea forward. The Old Pueblo Trolley heritage streetcar line was inaugurated on April 17, 1993.Herlihy, Barry H. (June 1993). \\"Tucson Welcomes Historic Trolley\\". Passenger Train Journal, pp. 14–15. Interurban Press.Light Rail and Modern Tramway, July 1993, p. 194. UK: Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association. Two trolley cars were available for service when the line opened, and were operated in the inaugural runs: Car 10, a 1918-built Birney-type car that was ex-Pacific Electric Railway 332 and was under lease to OPT from the Orange Empire Railway Museum since 1985, and car 255, ex-Osaka, Japan (Hankai Electric Tramway), which was built in 1953. Car 255 had been in service in Osaka until June 1992. The Birney car used a trolley pole, while the Japanese car used a pantograph, as it had on its home system. Before entering service, Birney car 10 was repainted from PE colors into the old livery of the former Tucson streetcar system, whose fleet had included an ex-Douglas, Arizona, Birney car of the same type, which was in service until the abandonment of the old Tucson system in 1930. Car 10's lease had started in 1985, but restoring it to operating condition took time and money, and only in 1991 did the car operate in Tucson for the first time under its own power. Before the start of public service in 1993, the Birney car operated occasionally for special events, for members of the OPT group. Japanese car and Belgian car on the heritage line in 2003 The line that opened as a heritage streetcar in 1993 used a combination of old, abandoned, paved-over track along University Avenue that was uncovered and rehabilitated, and new track along 8th Avenue and along 4th Avenue. Most of the line is two-way single-track, but it includes some double-track. Workers from Tucson Electric Power installed the overhead trolley wire, in some cases as volunteers. === Fleet === ; Tucson Old Pueblo Trolley №1 : Former Lisbon car 524, built in Philadelphia by Brill in 1924, brought from Aspen, where it had been since 1973.

Union №1. #524 Lisbon Tramrestoration ==== Fleet changes ==== Car 10's lease from the Orange Empire Railway Museum expired in March 1995, and the museum was not willing to extend it, so car 10 ran in Tucson for the last time on June 4, 1995, and was moved back to OERM on June 9. The previous month, the 1953 ex-Osaka car returned to service after a 9-month overhaul that included restoring its original identity as Kyoto 869.Light Rail and Modern Tramway, Sep. 1995, p. 309. UK: Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association. Meanwhile, additional historic trolleys were being acquired, to replace the Birney car and expand the fleet. Ex-Brussels, Belgium, car 1511, a two-axle car built in 1936, arrived in April 1995, having been stored for several years in Phoenix, where plans to use it in a restaurant did not come to fruition. Toronto car 4608, a 1951 PCC streetcar, arrived in June 1996.\\"Canadian trolley to run in Tucson\\" (June 21, 1996). Arizona Daily Star. ===2009 extension=== At 4:00 PM on August 20, 2009 the new 4th Avenue Underpass and 5th Avenue Loop were opened for traffic. The new 5th Avenue Loop runs west along Congress Street to Fifth Avenue, south on Fifth Avenue to Broadway Boulevard and west on Broadway Boulevard to the intersection of Congress Street and Fourth Avenue. New car stops on the Fifth Avenue Loop are at Ninth Street, Fifth Avenue and Congress Street. ==Impact of modern-streetcar project== In May 2006, the Regional Transportation Plan was adopted by a vote of almost 60% in favor. This election also passed a 20-year, 1/2-cent sales tax to finance the transportation improvements. Among the items in the plan was $75 million for the Sun Link modern streetcar system which follows the alignment of the Old Pueblo Line with extensions west through downtown to the Mercado District and north-east through the University of Arizona campus to the Arizona Health Sciences Center. The approved funds were a match to an equal amount of Federal Transit Administration funding. The new system is double-tracked, replacing the original OPT single track. A maintenance facility has been constructed just west of the present OPT car barn and yard on 9th Street west of 4th Avenue. Old Pueblo Trolley suspended operations in October 2011. Construction of the new system began in April 2012, and the line – named Sun Link – opened in July 2014. OPT hopes to be able to resume historic trolley operation on weekends and for special events. ==Motor bus collection== The Motor Bus Division collects, restores and operates historic motor buses that are either representative of transit buses that were operated by carriers or public transit agencies in Arizona or are documented to have been owned and operated by carriers or public transit agencies in Arizona. The collection includes more than 20 coaches to date, most of which are stored at Old Pueblo Trolley's 36th Street facility. , one bus has been completely restored (Warren Bisbee Lines No. 8, a 1938 Yellow Coach) and one bus has received necessary maintenance and been repainted, but requires replacement of its external advertising sign panels and minor interior work (Old Pueblo Transit Co. No. 135, a 1960 GMC TGH-3102). Buses currently under restoration include Warren Bisbee Lines No. 1 (1928 Twin Coach) and a Tucson Rapid Transit No. 50 (1946 Ford Transit Bus). ==New shop facility== In late 2014, a Property Acquisition Committee was formed to identify available properties that would be suitable for a new shop and museum center. The Motor Bus Division had previously moved restoration activities from the 18th Street Yard to a leased shop located at North Park Avenue and East Broadway Boulevard (Park Avenue Shop). That shop provided interior working space for two vehicles and exterior storage for approximately fifteen vehicles plus materials and several rail vehicles. At the time that the lease was executed with the City of Tucson, it was known that the shop would only be temporary as that property was subject to condemnation for the planned widening of Broadway Boulevard. Thus it was recognized that it was extremely important for OPT to acquire a permanent shop and museum site that would permit housing the entire collection of buses, archives, museum offices, shops and a display area. During 2015, the Property Acquisition Committee identified potential sites and provided reports to the Board of Directors. Late in the year, a former cabinet shop located at South Fourth Avenue and East 36th Street in the City of South Tucson, Arizona was identified as being the most suitable property. The building was a large, open structure and had a large fenced outside yard as well as administrative offices and a reception area inside. The building had been acquired by a local bank under foreclosure and was available for a reasonable price. Negotiations were held with the bank and lending company and funding secured by donors to permit the acquisition of the facility (36th Street Shop). The deal closed in late December and renovations were begun shortly thereafter. ==Current activities== Presently, much of OPT's activities are related to relocating vehicles to the new 36th Street Shop located in South Tucson at 250 E. 36th St. In October 2016, the facility was formally dedicated and the shop named the \\"Jones-Brogan Building\\" in recognition of the founders of the 20th Century Electric Railway Foundation, their financial support being critical in our acquisition of the new facility. Staff are in the process of establishing a vocational training program that will provide local high school auto shop students experience in working on large commercial vehicles and diesel engines. Current fundraising activities include a tax-deductible vehicle donation program and consignment antique automobile sales. All funds go to Old Pueblo Trolley's restoration and educational programs. In 2017, the facility gained the services of a qualified electrician / machinist volunteer who set up a combined machine and fabricating area using donated machine tools. Along with supplying valuable service to museum's restoration needs, the machine shop does outside work with all of the proceeds going to support museum operations.

Joshi was born in Baroda, Gujarat, India in 1926. He first gained attention as a cricket player when he scored 100 notout for Central Province Governor's XI against the touring Commonwealth XI in addition to dismissing six batsmen.Central Province Governor's XI v Commonwealth XI, Nagpur, 1949-50 This earned him a place in two unofficial Tests against the same team. Joshi played cricket at a time when India had three or four wicket keepers of the same class. In a career that lasted for nearly ten years, Joshi played only twelve Test matches. He made his Test debut against England in the first Test at Delhi in 1951-52. In the first innings, he caught two and brilliantly stumped two others, but his errors in the second helped England to save the match. Joshi was replaced by Madhav Mantri for the second Test, who in turn gave way to Probir Sen in the third. Joshi was picked for the fourth and discarded in favour of Sen for the final Test. Here Sen stumped five batsmen and Joshi found himself out of the team to tour England in 1952. Writing in 1985, N. S. RamaswamiN.S. Ramaswami, Talent thwarted by time, Special Portrait, Indian Cricket 1985 remembered that Joshi \\"impressed as a dapper and neat performer. Between the overs he walked from wicket to wicket with a certain jauntiness. He seemed to wear the gloves as a lady might at a fashionable ball.\\" Yet in his opinion, Joshi came lower down in the hierarchy of contemporary wicket keepers. Sen and Mantri occupied the top rung, Naren Tamhane came next, followed by Joshi. Joshi played in four Tests in the West Indies tour of 1952-53 and three Tests in England in 1959. In a match in the Pune summer league in 1957-58, he had a hand in all ten dismissals in addition to scoring 68 out of 117 all out.Obituary in Indian Cricket 1987.

It was designed by architect Raymond Moriyama during the development of Scarborough City Centre and initially opened as the city hall of the former borough of Scarborough by then mayor Albert Campbell and Queen Elizabeth II in 1973. The building served as the municipal office and office for the Scarborough Board of Education. Following the amalgamation of Toronto, Scarborough lost its city status and the civic centre became a secondary hub for the City of Toronto government. It is also home to the Scarborough Community Council and offices of the Toronto District School Board. The civic centre is adjacent to Albert Campbell Square. It is south of Scarborough Centre station and the Scarborough Town Centre shopping mall. ==Structure and surroundings== The building is unique for the juxtaposition of two triangular shaped, multiple split level towers, which surround an open central area in the interior. Outside the Civic Centre on the north side is Albert Campbell Square, named after Albert Campbell, Scarborough's first mayor, with a waterfall and reflecting pool, used as a skating rink in winter. Sculptures are found on the southwest side of the building. The Hand of God, dedicated to Albert Campbell, depicts a man held up by a hand and is mounted on a mast; it is located south across Borough Drive. Gord Smith (sculptor)'s Icarus portrays bronze folds assembled together to represent a pair of outstretched wings. Frank Faubert Forest, a wooded area south of the Civic Centre is named for Scarborough's last mayor, Frank Faubert. Inside the main hall is a rising series of polished metal unfolding tetrahedrons resembling birds rising toward the ceiling from the main-floor- level pond, designed by Toronto artist James Sutherland in 1972. In 2015, the Toronto Public Library opened the Scarborough Civic Centre branch, its 100th library branch.

Most of his books were novels set at sea, or sea stories. For one of those, Sea Change, he won the 1948 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. He is also known for a biography of Grace Darling in which he challenges the conventional story: Grace Darling: Maid and Myth (1965). He is often described on the cover of his books as \\"author and mariner\\". ==Biography== Ralph Richard Armstrong was born in Walbottle, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland on 18 June 1903. He was a blacksmith's son who left school at thirteen to work in a Tyneside steelworks. He spent three years there, starting as an errand boy and progressing to greaser, labourer and crane driver. His book Sabotage at the Forge (1946), set in a steelworks, is highly regarded for its accurate and effective description of a boy's experience in such an environment. Similarly, The Whinstone Drift (1951) is convincingly set against a Northumberland coal-mining background. After the First World War he went to sea in the Merchant Service and for seventeen years sailed in many types of vessel, gaining the experience which he later put to use in his books about seafaring. In 1937 he left the Merchant Service and pursued various occupations before concentrating on writing. His first published book was The Mystery of Obadiah (1943), an adventure novel set in Tynedale and featuring Thias Stringer, a 13-year-old boy. Sabotage at the Forge was its sequel, featuring Stringer at the steelworks. Later he drew on his wide-ranging experiences at sea, writing about, for example, cargo steamers (Passage Home), oil tankers (No Time for Tankers), and whalers (The Secret Sea). Armstrong had a son, John, to whom he dedicated his book Sailor's Luck.Dedication of Sailor's Luck, 1959.

The railway is a federally designated National Historic Landmark and is also designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The route was originally opened in 1882 by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG;) to transport silver and gold ore mined from the San Juan Mountains. The line was an extension of the D&RG; narrow-gauge line from Antonito, Colorado to Durango. The last train to operate into Durango from the east was on December 6, 1968. The states of New Mexico and Colorado purchased 64 miles between Antonito and Chama, New Mexico in 1970 and operates today as the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad. Trackage between Chama and Durango was removed by 1971. The line from Durango to Silverton has run continuously since 1881, although it is now a tourist and heritage line hauling passengers, and is one of the few places in the US which has seen continuous use of steam locomotives. In March 1981, the Denver & Rio Grande Western sold the line and the D&SNG; was formed. Some rolling stock dates back to the 1880s. Trains operate from Durango to the Cascade Wye in the winter months and Durango–Silverton during the summer months. Durango depot was built in January 1882 and has been preserved in its original form. ==History== Train entering Silverton Photo of the first trip of the \\"Painted Train\\". The D&RG; Silverton arrives pulling the glass-topped \\"Silver Vista\\" observation car in 1947. William Jackson Palmer (1836–1908) was a former Union General (serving in the American Civil War) who came to Colorado after managing the construction of the Kansas Pacific Railroad into Denver in 1870. Prior to the war, he had risen within the ranks of the Pennsylvania Railroad serving as secretary to the president. After arriving in Denver, he formulated a plan to build a narrow-gauge railroad southward from Denver to El Paso, TexasAthearn, Robert G. \\"Rebel of the Rockies\\" Yale University Press 1962 pp. 10,15. (see Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad). In 1871, the Denver & Rio Grande Railway began to lay rails south from Denver. Palmer and his associates had agreed that the choice of narrow gauge would be well suited to the mountainous country, and relatively less expensive construction costs would enhance the viability of the new railroad. The original north–south plans of the D&RG; eventually expanded to include extensions throughout the booming mining country of central and southwestern Colorado. On August 5, 1881 the Denver & Rio Grande Railway arrived in Durango, Colorado. The new town was founded by the D&RG; in 1880, chiefly through the talents and organization of General Palmer's business partner, Dr. William Bell. Construction to Silverton, Colorado began that fall. Only 11 months later, the D&RG; reached Silverton on July 10, 1882. Trains hauling passengers and freight began immediately. The Denver & Rio Grande Railway soon re-emerged as the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (1886) and ultimately began operating as the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;) on July 31, 1921 after re-organization of the Colorado lines and Rio Grande Western of Utah.Athearn, Robert G. \\"Rebel of the Rockies\\" Yale University Press 1962. pp. 241–243 Eventually, the railroad became widely known as the \\"Rio Grande\\". The Silverton branch, as it became known, struggled under D&RG; ownership following the Panic of 1893 and the end of free coinage of silver. Typical of many portions of the surviving narrow- gauge branches into the middle of the twentieth century, the line faced sagging revenue due to ever-declining mining ventures, highway trucking competition, and insignificant passenger revenue. Annual snowslides and several major floods on the branch would only continue to challenge the railroad's ability to survive. === The Silverton === After World War II, domestic tourism began to grow across the country and the Silverton branch of the railroad would benefit. Bolstered by national exposure via Hollywood movies being filmed along the line in the late 1940s, the railroad created The Silverton, a summer-only train service on June 24, 1947. A short time later, the railroad adorned a locomotive and four coaches with a colorful yellow paint scheme and launched modest public promotion. With this effort, \\"The Painted Train\\" officially started a new era of tourism that continues to this day. Freight traffic, however, continued to decline and during the 1950s, The Silverton operated as a mixed train. By the 1960s, a modernized D&RGW; did not see the Silverton Branch as worthy to maintain and a petition was filed with governmental agencies to abandon the route. The Interstate Commerce Commission declined to grant the request due to the continued increase in tourist patronage. Following the ICC's ruling, the railroad reluctantly responded by investing in additional rolling stock, track maintenance, and improvements to the Durango depot. The railroad purchased some of the property around the depot, cleaned up the block extending north to Sixth Street, and facilitated the opening of gift shops and other tourist-friendly businesses. As ridership continued to grow, the D&RGW; operated a second train to Silverton on certain days. === The 1970s === Since 1971, the Silverton branch and nearby Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad were the only remnants of the Rio Grande's once extensive narrow-gauge system. During the late 1970s, the D&RGW; was actively trying to sell the Silverton branch, and in 1979, Charles Bradshaw, a Florida citrus grower, offered the railroad a legitimate opportunity to divest itself of the now isolated route. On October 5, 1980, The Silverton made its last run under D&RGW; ownership and after operating a work train the following day, the railroad finally concluded its narrow-gauge train operations, bringing to a close an era that began 110 years earlier with its narrow-gauge railroad from Denver to Colorado Springs. === Present day === In June 2018, the railroad shut down for several weeks due to a wildfire, named the \\"416 Fire\\", which was fought by two air tankers, six helicopters and some 400 firefighters on the ground. An estimated of the San Juan National Forest were burned, with losses estimated at more than $31 million. Given the fire risk from coal cinder- sparked wildfires, the railroad's owner plans to invest several million dollars to replace coal-power with oil-power for their steam locomotives and acquire two new diesel powered locomotives. The railroad was suspected of sparking the blaze and some area businesses and residents filed a civil lawsuit against the railroad and its owner in mid-September 2018. The railroad is currently aiming to have at least half of their operational steam locomotives converted to oil-power. In March 2020, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the country severely affected the US. For the safety and protection of guests and employees, D&SNG; suspended operations until June 23, 2020. ==New ownership== The D&SNG; was founded by Charles Bradshaw Jr., of Florida, with the intent of purchasing the right-of-way and equipment while expanding the infrastructure and passenger revenue. His plans were fulfilled with the March 25, 1981, acquisition of the D&RGW;'s Silverton branch and all of its structures and rolling stock. The improvements to the railroad in the 1980s would prove to be the most dramatic growth on the Silverton Branch since the earlier part of the century. Bolstered by the assistance of former Rio Grande operating managers and a relatively sizeable staff of new employees, Bradshaw's plans were set in motion immediately. Included in the sale were former D&RGW; locomotives and rolling stock that had not seen service in Durango for many years. \\"K-36\\" and \\"K-37\\" class locomotives were eventually restored to operating condition and these larger class of engines operated to Silverton for the first time ever following bridge and right-of-way improvements to the line. 1880s vintage coaches were exquisitely restored and new coaches were added to the roster of rolling stock. For the first time in many years, doubleheaded trains (trains with two locomotives) and additional scheduled trains were employed to handle the continually growing passenger trade. The Durango yard facilities also saw dramatic improvements. An extension was added to the old roundhouse, a new car shop was built on the site of the original \\"car barn\\", and the depot saw extensive repair and internal modifications. The workforce grew with the railroad, and Durango's tourist image expanded as new businesses and revamping of the old railroad town continued to take shape. The original 1881 Durango roundhouse was completely destroyed by fire in the winter of 1989. All six operable locomotives had been inside at the time and were damaged, but not beyond repair. All locomotives were eventually restored to operating condition. A new roundhouse was constructed on the same site, opening in early 1990, and its facade made use of bricks salvaged from the original building. In March 1997 Bradshaw sold the D&SNG; to First American Railways, Inc., located in Hollywood, Florida. Then in July 1998 the railroad was sold again to American Heritage Railways. At the time, American Heritage Railways was headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida. Since then their headquarters have been moved to Durango, Colorado. The D&SNGRR; has two museums, one each in Durango and Silverton. ===Management=== *Allen C.

There are three classes, K-28, K-36 and K-37, which are all based on wheel arrangement and pulling power of the locomotive. The K represents the nickname \\"Mikado\\" that describes a locomotive with two non- powered, pivoting wheels in front of eight driving wheels, which are connected to driving rods powered by the engine's pistons, and finally two non-powered trailer wheels located under the cab. The name comes from the fact that the first significant use of the type was a series built by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Japanese Railways in 1887. The numbers 28 and 36 designate the tractive effort (pulling force) of the locomotives in thousands of pounds. The tractive effort of K-28s is rated at , and the tractive effort of a K-36 is a . The weight of a K-28 with a full tender is , and a K-36 weighs with a full tender. ====470 series==== D&S; 2-8-2 K-28 steam locomotive #473 on arrival at Silverton with a train from Durango in June 1990. K-28 steam locomotive #476 in operation, 1999. The 470 series or K-28 class locomotives were ten engines designed for freight service along the D&RG.; They were built by the Schenectady Locomotive Works of the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in Schenectady, New York in 1923. The K-28s have . of tractive effort, superheated, and the boilers are fed by two non-lifting injectors. Air brakes are 6-ET automatic and also feature a straight air secondary braking system for daily passenger trains. Due to their smaller size these engines are often used on the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule and often for helper service or sectioned trains. Despite being smaller than the K-36 class locomotives, older, and less powerful, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing. Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard, as the clam shell-style firedoors tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft, and if any flues in the boiler are leaking, the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives. Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large \\"heel\\" pattern, generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible, and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors. This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet, which usually is hindered by the lack of draft between the grates and the arch brick. New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this, because the art of \\"reading\\" a fire takes time to learn, and the amount of time working on the K-28 class locomotives is far reduced compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses, which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving in technique. K-28 steam locomotives #473 and #478 at Hermosa on a D&RGW; excursion in 1963. Out of the original ten only three 470s remain, and all are owned by the D&SNG.; The other seven were requisitioned by the United States Army in 1942 to be used on the White Pass & Yukon Route in Alaska during World War II. They were later dismantled for scrap in 1946. Locomotives 473, 476 and 478 operated on many parts of the D&RGW.; Engine 473 served frequently on the Chili Line that operated between Antonito, Colorado and Santa Fe, New Mexico. 473 served on the Chili Line until it was abandoned in 1941. 476 and 478 saw an extensive service on the San Juan passenger train, which ran between Durango, Colorado and Alamosa, Colorado until 1951. 473, 476 and 478 operated on the Silverton Branch from the 1950s through 1980 and are still in service today. In July 2015, the D&SNG; and C&TS; had announced that a trade that proposed that the 478 should go to Chama, New Mexico and in exchange the D&SNG; would get K-36 class No. 483, which had not seen operation in several years. Since the swap failed to go through, the D&SNG; announced in June 2016 that they were going to restore 476 to operating condition and place 478 in the museum. #473 is undergoing a firebox rebuild and conversion to oil as of February 2020. However, due to COVID-19, it is currently expected to return to service in 2021. #476 is operational. #478 is on display in the D&SNG; Museum awaiting an overhaul in the distant future.K-28 steam locomotive #473 awaits departure from Cascade Canyon in May 2016. ====480 series==== K-36 steam locomotives #482 and #480 in Silverton. K-36 steam locomotive #481 getting ready for departure from Silverton. K-36 steam locomotive #486 getting ready for departure from Silverton on October 25, 2012. The 480 series or K-36 class locomotives were ten engines designed for the D&RGW.; They were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925. The 480s were the last ten narrow-gauge locomotives constructed for the D&RGW.; The 480s were used for freight-hauling throughout the D&RGW; narrow-gauge network. The \\"36\\" stands for . of tractive effort. These engines are outside frame Mikados, and all drive wheels have counterbalancing outside of the frame, resulting in the utilitarian look the engines are known for. The engines currently use 6-ET automatic air and the secondary straight air used on regular service equipment. The railroad runs 12-car passenger trains behind these engines; however more cars require the train to be doubleheaded. Despite popular belief that the railroad does not doublehead trains out of Durango because of smoke, the real reason is the weight restriction on the bridge at 15th Street, not allowing more than one K-36 at a time (K-28 class engines however are still doubleheaded from Durango). The engines were delivered with Master Mechanics design smokeboxes for draft, however at some point the D&RGW; converted them to Andersson (cyclone) front ends. Water is fed to the boiler by two non-lifting injectors. The grate surface in the firebox is among the largest built for a narrow-gauge locomotive, and is fed by hand firing. Firing is simpler on these engines compared to the K-28s, however the larger surface area requires more fuel. A typical trip uses around on the way up to Silverton, and another on the return to Durango. Ergonomically, the engines are less comfortable than the others as well, with the crew seats being further back from the backhead and the engineer having to lean forward constantly to adjust the throttle and use the sanders. The running gear on the locomotives also tend to wear out faster than the ALCO designed K-28s, and the resulting pounding rough ride can take a toll on the engine crew. D&SNG; owns four K-36s: Nos. 480, 481, 482 and 486, all of which are operational. The Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad owns engines 483, 484, 487, 488 and 489. Locomotive No. 485, unfortunately, fell into the turntable pit in Salida, Colorado in 1955. It was scrapped for parts thereafter, however, some accessories, running and valve gear was salvaged and used on other locomotives. ====490 series==== K-37 steam locomotive #493 in Silverton Yard. The 490 series or K-37 class locomotives were part of a class of thirty standard gauge class 190 (later, class C-41) 2-8-0 engines built in 1902 for the D&RG; by Baldwin Locomotive Works. In 1928 and 1930 ten of the C-41s were rebuilt at the Rio Grande's Burnham Shops in Denver into narrow- gauge s. The D&SNG; operated only one K-37. #497 was rebuilt in 1984 and operated for seven years. At the time #497 operated on the D&SNG;, it was the only K-37 to go to Silverton under its own power. It was later determined that the trailing truck was having trouble negotiating the curves in the Animas Canyon. For this reason, the D&SNG; traded #497 to the C&TS; for K-36 class #482. This trade was mutually beneficial for both railroads as it gave the C&TS; a fully operational locomotive, giving in exchange a locomotive that had never run and likely would never operate under C&TS; ownership. Numbers 493 and 498 are owned by the D&SNG;, but as of 2020, #498 is not operational. On May 4, 2016, K-37 #493 was hauled to Durango from Silverton by K-36 #481 to be transported to the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado, on a 10-year lease, where they would restore it to operational condition and run it for those 10 years and then return it to the D&SNGRR.; However, plans were cancelled and #493 sat outside the Durango roundhouse with an uncertain future for sometime, until 2018 when she was put in the roundhouse for restoration. It is estimated it could take up to two years to finish the restoration. #493 is being restored to use oil vs. coal. This will allow it to operate when the coal fired engines cannot, since oil fired engines do not emit cinders. #493 ran under its own power for the first time on January 24, 2020. K-37 #498 rests in the Durango yard near the turntable without a tender and with no plans to restore it, given its deteriorated condition. #499 was included in the 1981 purchase from the D&RGW; as well, and was stored in Durango until 1999 when it was cosmetically restored and traded for K-36 class #486, which had been on display and out of operation at Royal Gorge since the early 1960s. K-37 steam locomotive #493 in Durango after the May 4, 2016 move from Silverton to Durango. ===Diesel engines=== Diesels were first introduced to the Durango Yard in the 1960s with Diesel locomotive #50. Today, #50 is now at the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado. The United States Transportation Corps. also had a six-axle narrow-gauge Diesel locomotive (#3000) for trial use in Durango in the 1950s which saw limited use. Diesel engine #9 was first acquired in March 2006 and is a 92-ton center cab Diesel. #9 was later traded to the Georgetown Loop Railroad in March 2017 for Diesel engine #1203. It is currently in service on the GLRX. The D&SNG; currently operates four Diesel engines. Narrow-gauge Diesel engines are just as rare as any other narrow-gauge equipment. All of the Diesel engines of the D&SNG;, except for #1203, are of the center cab style, where the cab straddles the center of the locomotive. Below are the Diesel engines currently used by the D&SNG;: # Diesel engine #1, nicknamed the \\"Hotshot\\", is a 50-ton center cab engine built in 1957, was acquired from Arkansas Limestone Railroad. During the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, the D&SNG; voluntarily shut down steam service. To help continue service, Hotshot pulled coaches out along the highline from Rockwood. Currently in service. # Diesel engine #7, nicknamed the \\"Big Al\\", is an 87-ton center cab engine built in 1975 and was originally Algoma Steel #7, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Big Al is named after the owner of the D&S;, Allen C. Harper. Currently in service. # Diesel engine #11 was built by U.S. Steel with General Electric parts. It was acquired in March 2006 and is a 98-ton center cab Diesel. Currently in service. # Diesel engine #1203 was built by H.K. Porter in January 1946. It was acquired in March 2017 from the Georgetown Loop Railroad in trade for Diesel engine #9. Currently in service. *RB-1 (railbus) was built in the winter of 1987–1988. It was originally numbered 1001 and was named Tamarron. It could seat 32 people, had its own baggage compartment and restroom, and had a six-cylinder Caterpillar Diesel engine. This unit was intended for use on the Animas River Railway, and when that operation was shut down, it was found being used as a switcher in the Durango yard. Years later, it was put into revenue service during the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, but it is currently not being operated. * In April 2020, it was announced that four ALCO Diesels have been purchased from the White Pass & Yukon Route in Skagway, Alaska. The first two Diesels (Nos. 101 and 107) were recently delivered between late August and September 2020 while the other two Diesels (numbers to be announced later) are currently expected to be delivered in 2021.

Once trains reach Silverton and unload passengers, the train is turned on the wye, backs uptown to pick up returning passengers, and makes the trip back to Durango. One way scheduled trains take 3½ hours to run the each way, with a 2¼ hour layover in Silverton. A train departing Durango generally takes about one hour between the crew arriving and the train departing. Brakemen inspect the train for cleanliness and required tools for the day, including a flagging kit and marker lamps for the rear of the train. The conductor will sign in his crew and obtain passenger lists and track reports to deliver to his crew. The engineer and fireman will inspect the locomotive and prepare it for the day's trip, making sure all machinery is lubricated and in proper condition, and no last-minute repairs are needed. The fireman will ensure proper coal and water is in the tender, and make sure lubricating oil is on supply and that automatic lubrication is working properly; he will also clean the cab and hose off the engine and tender of ash and dust. Once the engine is ready, the locomotive will be pulled onto the mainline, and backed up, working the engine against the brakes to check braking capability, and also to clean the smokebox and cylinders of condensation, and work the cylinders to warm them up for lubrication. The head brakeman will hook the locomotive up to the train, and the car shop will then assist the crew by performing brake tests with the engineer. Scheduled trains on the Durango & Silverton operate on authority by timetable, though on occasion may be annulled for special trains or other circumstances. A train leaving Durango will depart at until the train is off the platform, then advance to until leaving yard limits, where track speed is . The 15th Street bridge is just east of the Durango yard limits, and maintenance-of-way crews also have a storage area here, where track patrolmen will inspect the train rolling by. The grade is fairly flat until 32nd Street, where a small hill will have the engine work a little until 36th Street. The train will then roll downgrade about and use that to accelerate to , which is the track speed between 36th St. and Hermosa. Home Ranch is the first siding past Durango. A new wye has recently been built just east of here to turn trains for the Polar Express and other event trains. As the train runs through the valley, it is traveling on the longest tangent on the railroad, since most of the railroad meanders through the canyon following the river. Motorists can drive alongside the train through here and watch the engine work harder and harder as it starts to climb towards Hermosa. Passing Trimble Lane, the engine will start to pick up some work as the grade stiffens. A scheduled train takes 40 minutes to reach Hermosa from Durango. Hermosa has a small maintenance-of- way yard and siding, as well as the first water tank to fill the engine's tender. Doubleheaded trains will often be put together here, with the helper running light to Hermosa ahead of the train, take on water, and then await the arrival of the train with the road engine spotting itself at the tank and taking on water. After a brake test, the train will then take on the 30 minute, 2.5% climb between Hermosa and Rockwood. As the train climbs away from the valley, passengers will notice the locomotives working hard to pull the train through the many curves that now define the railroad. An hour after leaving Durango the train passes under US Highway 550 and slows to to traverse the \\"mini-highline\\", a rock shelf where the track follows the edge of a small cliff, and then picks up speed again through the meadow at Shalona. This is the last grade crossing the railroad encounters until Silverton. Slowing again after the crossing, the train winds around another rock face above Shalona Lake, with Rockwood being just around the next curve. Rockwood has a short wye and siding, and is also the first flagstop on the line. Being an hour and ten minutes by rail from Durango, some passengers lodging nearby opt to board the train here instead of driving all the way to town. The grade tops off for a while and the helper engine on doubleheaded trains will be cut off here and run ahead light to Tank Creek. As the train enters the narrow rock cut, it becomes the only ground transportation into the Animas Canyon. Passengers immediately notice the slow pace of the train as it winds onto the \\"highline\\", a famous section of the railroad where the train crawls along the face of high cliffs. The engine crew will usually blow down the engine on the bridge at MP 471.2 to clean sediment from the boiler and the fireman will look back on his side of the train for a highball from the rear brakeman, indicating the rear of the train has cleared the bridge and the engineer can pick up speed to , the track speed the rest of the way to Silverton. The roadbed closely follows the Animas River from now on, and the grade fluctuates quite a bit between here and Cascade Canyon. Tacoma is the next flagstop and the railroad has another siding here. At MP 474.5 is the Tank Creek water tank, and engines will stop here for water. The fireman will top off the tender, taking about , while the engineer oils around the engine and inspects machinery and bearings. On doubleheaded trains, the helper locomotive will then rejoin the train and perform another brake test. From Tank Creek, trains only travel about before reaching Tall Timber Resort. Another mile and the train is traveling on a very narrow rock wall before rounding the curve and climbing into Cascade. Cascade is two hours and by rail from Durango, and in the winter trains are turned here on the wye due to avalanche chutes further up the railroad. After crossing the Animas a third time, the railroad curves to the east and heads towards Needleton. The grade through here tends to stairstep between short steep 3% grades and longer gradual 2-2.5% while winding through many reverse curves. Unlike the mainline that was constructed by the D&RG; before arriving in Durango, the Silverton branch was laid without compensated curves, and the trains can really drag into some of the reverse curves against the engine. A speed restriction covers a sharp curve above a rock face at MP 481.5. Needleton flag stop is roughly from the Needleton siding, and another beyond that to the Needleton water tank. Trains stopping at Needleton flag stop are for backpackers usually hiking up to the Chicago Basin, as well as occasional homesteaders who have cabins in the forest. Locomotives have a hard time starting the trains from a stop here as well as leaving from the tank stop, indicated by the layer of sand on the tracks and the frequency of the valves centering up, forcing the engineer to back the locomotive up a foot or so before trying to start forward again. On the westbound trains, the tender only needs about to be topped off before proceeding to Silverton, however, the steepest grade lies ahead. The track out of Needleton is around 2.5%, with a little ease around MP 486, but then quickly steepens again, topping off 4% at MP 488. From MP 488 to Elk Park the fireman finally gets a break on the wider, sweeping curves and flatter grade. Elk Park is the last siding, wye, and flagstop before Silverton. Not as popular as Needleton for hikers, Elk Park is where the railroad crosses the Colorado Trail and it often serves as a hunting camp in season. Also past Elk Park, the railroad is among some of the highest concentration of avalanche chutes in the state. The Snowshed Slide once had a snowshed, until burning and leaving behind remnants of what once gave the slide its name. The grade has one decent pull approaching Snowshed, but afterwards is pretty easy the rest of the way to Silverton, and also has longer, sweeping, slightly elevated curves which allow for smooth running. The engineer will blow a warning whistle approaching the sharp curve at Cataract, the narrowest section of the entire canyon, before opening up to the valley that holds Silverton. The railroad crosses the Animas one last time before entering yard limits. The train slows to and blows a long station call on the whistle before passing the depot. After the train arrives, passengers deboard the train and the crew backs the train down to the wye for servicing. An ashpit was recently constructed for use and to aid in heavier repairs if needed, which do happen on occasion. After shoving the train uptown for boarding passengers, the engineer will oil and inspect the engine once again and the crew will perform another brake test for the return trip to Durango. Trains will almost always use straight air unless conditions or equipment don't allow. The engineer won't need to use steam for power to move the train until just east of Tacoma, and after climbing to Rockwood, can drift again all the way to Trimble Lane in the valley near Durango. Trains coming from Silverton will top off with water again at Needleton on the return, and Cascade trains won't need water for the return. After arrival in Durango, steam locomotives are cut from the trains for immediate servicing, which can make the shop crew pretty busy in the summer with four or five locomotives being tended. Servicing includes coaling up the tender, adding wood pellets for fuel for overnight stoking, refilling the sand supply, cleaning or dropping the fire depending on the schedule for the locomotive, and then spotting the engine in the roundhouse to apply grease, shoot bearings, refill oilers, and replenish water. Running trips each day in the summer with the heavy trains will also cause damage to the running gear and require heavier repairs at times, which the roundhouse crew is capable of performing. The railroad uses a couple of small Diesel switching locomotives for work trains and everyday yard switching to allow the steam locomotives to enter the shop areas sooner. The use of wood pellets for overnight fuel, as well as Diesel switchers are a result of constant complaints from local citizens regarding the fly ash from the coal-fired engines. Though the railroad has been present in the town since its founding, the D&SNG; has tried its best to appease the locals.

Some of the cars are the oldest passenger cars in existence. ===Concession cars=== Concession car #126 in Silverton, October 2012 Like most of the coaches on the D&SNG;, the concession cars are good examples of how coaches were renumbered and rebuilt several times by the D&RGW.; *Concession car 64 was originally mail-baggage 64 built in 1889. In 1983 it was purchased from the Black Hills Central Railroad. 64 returned to service in 1984 as a concession car. *Concession car 126 was originally baggage car 27. It was renumbered 126 in 1886. It was converted to a coach- snack bar by the D&RGW; in 1963 then reconverted in 1979 to a coach. It was reconverted to a full concession car by the D&SNG; in 1982. *Concession car 212 was originally coach 20 built in 1879. In 1887 it was rebuilt into a combination coach-baggage car and numbered 215. In 1942, 215 had been sold to a Mexican railway. Then the D&RGW; realized that it was larger than another combination car 212. The numbers of the car were switched and the smaller car was sent to Mexico. In 1964 converted to a coach-snack bar by the D&RGW;, then to a 48-passenger coach in 1979. In 1982 it was converted to a snack bar car by the D&SNG.; Then, in 1986, it was converted to a full concession car. *Concession car 566 was originally mail car 14 built in 1882. Around 1888 it was rebuilt into excursion car 566. In July 1904 it was renumbered 0566. Then it was switched to work service in 1914. It was rebuilt to its original appearance as a postal car by the D&SNG.; It was then given its old excursion car number of 566 and is now used as a concession car. ===Coaches=== Bitter Root Mine 213 in Silverton, October 2012 The D&SNG; operates one combination car 213 named Bitter Root Mine, it was previously named Home Ranch and was built in 1983 by the D&SNG.; It has a hydraulic lift for passengers in wheelchairs. The D&SNG; operates several other coaches: #257 Shenandoah, built in 1880 #270 Pinkerton, built in 1880 #291 King Mine, built in 1881 #311 McPhee, built in 1881 #319 Needleton, built in 1882 #323 Animas City, built in 1887 #327 Durango, built in 1887 #330 Cascade, built in 1963 #331 Trimble, built in 1963 #332 La Plata, built in 1964 #333 Tacoma, built in 1964 #334 Hermosa, built in 1964 #335 Elk Park, built in 1964 #336 Rockwood, built in 1964 #337 Fort Lewis, built in 1964 #503 Crazy Woman Creek, acquired in 2019. 503 was originally a flat car built in the 1940s, then converted for use as a coach in 1982 by the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad.

Immigrant sleepers had very few amenities and had little consideration for passenger comfort. The original Cinco Animas could seat up to thirty passengers. It was turned into a business car in 1913. In 1963 it was purchased by the Cinco Animas Corporation, where it received its present name. Then, in 1982, the Cinco Animas was sold to the D&S.; It runs daily throughout the summer. ====Nomad B-3==== Built in 1878, the Nomad was originally named Fairplay. In 1886, it was rebuilt as Business Car N. It is reportedly the favorite car of D&RG; president William Jackson Palmer. The Fairplay has hosted Presidents William H Taft, Ulysses S Grant and Theodore Roosevelt. While being owned by several parties between 1951 and 1982 the Fairplay was renamed the Nomad. It was acquired by the D&S; in 1982. Today it is the oldest private railroad coach still in service in the United States. It runs daily throughout the summer. ====General Palmer B-7==== The General Palmer was built in 1880 as a business car for the D&RG.; In later years it fell into disrepair. It was restored in 2001 at a cost of $250,000 by the D&S.; Its modern amenities include internet service and a twenty-inch flat paneled television. The General Palmer is exclusively used by owner Allen Harper, his family and guests. ====San Juan 312==== Built by the D&RG; in 1887, it had clerestory roof and bullnose ends. It was finished in ash and seated forty-six. It was rebuilt in 1937 at the Alamosa shops. Vestuable ends, train-line steam heat, electric lights, and deluxe Heywood-Wakefield reclining coach seats for 24 passenger were installed. The D&S; named coach 312 the Silverton. In the winter of 2007–2008 it was rebuilt with overstuffed seating for in a wide three across arrangement and had its name changed to San Juan. It runs during the summer time. ====Alamosa 350==== Alamosa 350 in Silverton, October 2012 Built in 1880, it was originally named the Hildago as Horton chair car number 25. It was changed to car 403 in 1885. It was then rebuilt into an office living car for members of the Valuation Survey in 1919. Valuation Survey was inventorying the entire railroad property after it was returned to the D&RGW; after World War 1. In 1924 it was converted into a parlor-smoker car. After a rebuild in 1937 it became a parlor-buffet car named Alamosa. The car had a closed vestibule, with steam heat, electric lights and seats for fourteen passengers. In 1957 it was converted for coach service. It was renumbered 350 in 1959. In 1981 it was purchased by the D&S; and converted to a parlor car and seats twenty-five people. There was another car with the same name that was destroyed in a derailment on the Rio Grande Southern Railroad. It runs daily throughout the summer. ====Prospector 630==== Was built in 1984 as a coach and was named Hunt. In 2009 it became a family upscale coach. The Prospector features comfortable table and chair style seating. The ceiling of the Prospector features an enlarged route map, making it easy for passengers to follow the train's progress along the route. ====Tall Timber Legend 631 & Tall Timber Legacy 632==== 631 was built in 1985 and named the North Star. 632 was built in 1986 and named Teft. Both cars were built as general passenger cars to help with the increase in passengers. In 2009 the cars were converted with overstuffed seats. They are used mainly to take passengers to Tall Timber to go zip lining. ===Open observation gondolas=== Open observation car #415 in Silverton, October 2012 Open observation gondolas 400–402 were built in 1963, equipped with passenger car trucks, steel roofs, tile floors and tramway seats. Gondolas 403–405 were built for the 1967 season on The Silverton. Between 1982 and 1985 the D&SNG; built Open Observation cars 411 and 412. Open Observation cars 406–409 and 413–416 were built between 1982 and 1986 * Cars 400–405 and 411–412 are former standard gauge boxcars, built in 1916 * Cars 406–409 and 413–416 are former standard gauge stock cars, built in 1937 ====Silver Vista 313==== The original Silver Vista was built in 1947 by the D&RGW.; It was a popular glass-topped observation car and the only one of its kind. The original Silver Vista was destroyed by a fire in Alamosa in 1953. Because of its popularity, there has been speculation that the D&RGW; destroyed it on purpose to drive revenue down so they could abandon the line from Silverton to Antonito. The recreation of the Silver Vista was built in 2006. It runs daily throughout the summer.

It was used with the Animas Canyon Railway Diesel-powered rail-bus. It was stored from 1992 to 1997, until it was rebuilt as an open observation car 313. It was given number 313, because it resembled the Silver Vista. After the Silver Vista was built in 2006, it became open observation car 410. In the winter of 2006–2007 it was again rebuilt into an open air observation car with comfortable and large overstuffed seats for a more expansive view. It runs daily during the summer. ===Cabooses=== Caboose #0540 in Silverton Yard Caboose #0505 was built in 1886 and is stocked with provisions to provide shelter and food. Caboose #0540 was built in 1881 and is a mini-warehouse, carrying the most common tools and supplies. It is used by Maintenance of Way. ====Caboose 0500==== Is long, and was built in 1886. It was originally known as D&RG; #1. In 1950 it was sold to Bob Richardson, then again in 1987 to a business in Cripple Creek. In 1993 it was acquired by the D&S; and was restored to its original condition. It is available for charter and can hold up to eight people. ===Rail camp car 3681=== Rail camp car 3681 is an ex-D&RGW; boxcar. It was rebuilt by the D&S; in 1984 with a kitchen, a bathroom and beds. It is pulled to Cascade Canyon Wye for elegant camping. It can hold a group of up to eight people. === Coaches not in service === *Mail baggage car 66 was built in 1887. For some years it was the base of operations for the Animas River Railway in Rockwood, Colorado. Car 66 served as the office, ticket window, and waiting room for the railway. It was then moved to Hermosa, Colorado as the maintenance of way office. *Mail baggage car 119 was built in 1882 and is currently not in service. *Coach #460 is the only narrow-gauge tourist sleeper remaining from a group built in 1886 for the D&RG.; In the early 1900s it was assigned to work service and was used on a D&RGW; wrecking train as late as 1957. Then it was sold to the Black Hills Central Railroad in South Dakota. Then in 1983 the D&SNG; purchased coach 460. It has yet to be restored.

They both feature historic locomotives and railway equipment used on the D&RGW; line. ===D&SNG; Museum=== Opened in 1998, the D&SNG; Museum is a tribute to railroading nationally and southwest Colorado. The museum is located in the Durango roundhouse. Half the roundhouse is used for the steam engines and the other half is for the museum. The museum features memorabilia from the D&RGW; and other railroads. It also features many artifacts from the Durango and Silverton areas. There is an HO train layout in the museum. It depicts a narrow-gauge railroad similar to the D&RGW.; There is also a movie coach that was used in the filming of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, where the railroad's informational and educational films are featured. ====Class 70 engine no. 42==== On display in the Durango and Silverton RR Museum, engine 42 was one of 6 class-70 2-8-0 locomotives built by Baldwin in 1887 for the D&RG.; The engine weighs 35 tons and pulls with 17,100 lbs of tractive effort. It was originally numbered 420. In November 1916 the engine was sold to the Rio Grande Southern and was used till the RGS was dismantled in 1952. Engine 42 and a caboose running from Grady, located east of Mancos, Colorado to Durango was the last train movement on the RGS. In 1953 the engine was sold to the Narrow Gauge Motel in Alamosa. In 1958 the 42 was sold to Magic Mountain Amusement Park in Golden, Colorado, where it was converted to burn fuel oil and operated for a short time. In 1969 it was put on display in Monument, Colorado in front of a bank. In 1971 engine 42 returned to Golden as a restaurant display at Heritage Square. Finally, in 1983 it was purchased and brought to Durango. It has never been restored to operating condition. It is on display in the museum. ====Baggage car no. 127==== Originally flat car 6630, it was rebuilt in 1968 as a baggage car for the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

The new company Animas River Railway was incorporated by the D&SNG;, in order to preserve the integrity of its own claim of \\"100% coal-fired steam locomotives\\". The railbus hauled hikers and fishermen into the canyon from Rockwood. Operations for the Animas River Railway were run out of Rockwood. Former mail baggage car 66 was used as the ticket window, office and waiting room for the railway. Built in 1987–88 winter, motorcar 1001 was named Tamarron. It could seat 32 people and had a 300-horsepower six-cylinder Caterpillar engine. It also had a baggage compartment and restroom. The trailer 1002 could seat 48 in longitudinal seats. ;1988 schedule The first railbus trip left at 7:30 a.m. on May 7 for Elk Park. There were 12:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. trips to Cascade Canyon. The season for the Animas River Railway was supposed to last from May 7 through October 30, but lasted until September 4 due to mechanical problems. ;1989 schedule The railbus was repaired and began operations on May 6, 1989. A 12:01 p.m. trip for Cascade Canyon ran until October 29. From May 27 through September 15 Elk Park trips ran at 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. ;1990 schedule The schedule for the Animas River Railway remained the same. The last excursion of the Animas River Railway was on September 23 from Rockwood to Cascade. Patronage never met expectations and has not operated since. ;2002 schedule During the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, the D&SNG; voluntarily shut down steam service. To help continue service, motorcar 1001 now RB-1 and trailer 1002 now 313 took people out to Elk Park from Silverton. ==Visiting equipment== Just as narrow-gauge equipment and parts are rare, narrow-gauge railroads are rare these days too. When narrow-gauge pieces of equipment come back to life there are very few places in the United States where they can run. Many of these pieces run during the railroad's annual Railfest held every August. Below are some pieces of narrow-gauge equipment that visit the D&SNG; railroad. ===D&RGW; No. 315=== D&RGW; No. 315 is a C-18 locomotive, built in 1895 by Baldwin Locomotive Works. It originally was owned by the Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad as No. 3. It was then bought by D&RG; and became No. 425 and after the railroad was reorganized into D&RGW; in 1924 it became No. 315. Around 1941, 315 made its way to Durango and became a yard switcher. It worked around Durango until 1949. To save it from being scrapped, it was leased by the City of Durango as a display. When the D&RGW; abandoned the line to Durango, 315 was donated to the Chamber of Commerce in 1968. In 1986 it was put on display at Santa Rita Park. Ownership of 315 was changed from the Chamber of Commerce to the City of Durango. It was restored to operating condition in 2007 by the Durango Railroad Historical Society, which operates the locomotive occasionally on both the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad. ===E&P; No. 4=== Eureka and Palisade No. 4 is a Class 8/18 C 4-4-0 locomotive, built in 1875 by Baldwin Locomotive Works. It originally was owned by the Eureka and Palisade Railroad, and was later sold to the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company. In 1938, it was sold to Warner Bros. and was used in many films. Eventually, the engine went to the Old Vegas amusement park in Henderson, Nevada, where it became badly damaged by a fire. Finally, it was bought by Dan Markoff and restored to operating condition. Dan privately owns the engine, and on occasion brings it to various railroads to operate, including the D&SNG.; ===Casey Jones=== The Casey Jones railbus was built in 1915 out of a Model T and is a predecessor of the Galloping Goose. It was originally designed to be an ambulance servicing the Sunnyside Mine in Eureka, Colorado. It was often used by mine officials to commute to Silverton. It has room for 11 passengers. The Casey Jones is owned by the San Juan Historical Society. In the summer months it is on a siding near the Silverton Depot and in the winter it is on display at the D&SNG; Museum in Durango. ===Galloping Goose No. 5=== Galloping Goose No. 5 went into service on June 8, 1933 and was built by the Rio Grande Southern railroad. It was built with a 1928 Pierce-Arrow limousine body and running gear. It was rebuilt in 1946/47, using a World War II surplus GMC gasoline truck engine and a Wayne Corporation school bus body. In 1950, the freight/mail compartment was converted to carry 20 additional passengers for sightseeing trips. After RGS was scrapped in 1953, Galloping Goose No. 5 came to rest in Dolores, Colorado. Galloping Goose No. 5 was completely restored to operating condition in 1998 by the Galloping Goose Historical Society in Dolores, Colorado. It visits both the D&SNG; and Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. ===Southern Pacific No. 18=== SP No. 18 is a narrow-gauge 4-6-0 \\"Ten Wheeler\\" type locomotive built in 1911 by Baldwin Locomotive Works. It arrived to Durango on lease from the Eastern California Museum in November 2018 and it stayed until October 2019. It was used for oil-fired testing in preparation for the D&SNG;'s conversion of some of their steam locomotives from coal to oil for fuel. ==In popular media== The train is the subject of the song The Silverton, by C.

It is one of 32 high schools in the York Region District School Board. Ontario Ministry of Education. . Retrieved on December 14, 2012. Until the 2016–17 academic year, it was the only publicly funded school within York Region which had a non-semestered system. In the 2016–17 academic year the school switched to a semestered system. ==History== Markham District High School was the first school in Markham. Secondary school education officially began in Markham, in January, 1858, which was then called Markham Village Grammar School. Prior to 1858, higher education was found in Toronto (Home District Grammar School). Since there was not a school building, quarters were rented in Temperance Hall at Franklin and George Streets, on the site now occupied by the Markham Lawn Bowling Club.school-profile Markham District High School. Retrieved on September 11, 2011. After the passage of the Act to Improve the Common and Grammar Schools of the Province of Ontario in 1871 a permanent home was opened at the southeast corner of Joseph Street and Albert Street (today's 55 Albert Street) as the Markham Village High School in 1879.https://www3.markham.ca/Markham/aspc/heritage/photo/details.aspx?FOLDERRSN=306460 Additions were added in 1892 to provide more space. Markham High School also took students who attended Agincourt Continuation School and wanted to complete their matriculation (grades 11 to 13) from 1915 until 1930, when Agincourt High School was formed. The year 1952 marked the establishment of the present Markham High School District, which comprises approximately the south-east half of Markham. In April 1953, the then York County School Board began construction of the school building on the southside of Church Street east of Mount Joy Creek began. In September 1954, a modern, three hundred pupil Secondary School was opened. The old site on Albert Street became the new home of the Markham Union Masonic Lodge and converted to commercial space in 2009.https://www3.markham.ca/Markham/aspc/heritage/photo/details.aspx?FOLDERRSN=306460 In July, 1964, construction was started on a vocational addition, which would make the Markham District High School a fully composite school. This was occupied in September 1965. Two years later more accommodation was needed, and the latest addition was opened in January 1970. This building was used until the end of the 2009–10 school year, after which it was torn down. The enrollment for 1971–72 in this large, well-equipped composite school is approximately eighteen hundred students. In 1971 the school transferred to the York Region Board of Education and York Region District School Board in 1998. In 2006, the York Region District School Board identified Markham DHS as a candidate replacement school based on building and program renewal requirements. Board staff met with school staff in September 2006 to describe the process to replace Markham DHS. Board staff met with interested members of the community in April 2007 to describe the phasing plan and preliminary Site Plan and the process to replace Markham DHS. The Board decided to replace Markham DHS with a new school that accommodates 1,400 students. The opening of Bur Oak Secondary School in 2007 was to reduce the number of students served by Markham DHS. The construction of the new school would allow students within the permanent boundary and the existing gifted program continued attendance into the future. The phasing of construction activities for the new school (on the site of the former sports field) also allowed occupancy of the existing building until the new school building was completed. The site plan was approved in the Spring of 2008, and construction began shortly after. In the year 2010, the new school and present building was completed and the old one was torn down and re-purposed as greenspace. ==Athletics== The Markham Marauders are the official sports team, best known for football and basketball.

Upon Kurszán's death in a raid in approximately 904 CE, the office was taken up by the gyula Árpád, creating a single-head monarchy for Hungary. Though there are some scholars (for example Gyula Kristó) who believe that Árpád was the kende, who later took up the functions of the gyula. Some scholars have speculated that the early Magyar dual kingship derived from their time as vassals of the Khazars. Indeed, the Khazars were described by Ahmad ibn Fadlan as having an officer titled Kündür which may have been either identical to, model for or the forerunner of the office of kende. == House of Kende == Kende also refers to the noble Hungarian House of Kende settled in the eastern region of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy of Kölcse.

The area is southwest of Charing Cross. The suburb's population was 16,031 at the time of the 2001 census. The suburb comprises the Worcester Park ward, an electoral area of the London Borough of Sutton with a population in of , as well as the Cuddington ward, an electoral area of Epsom and Ewell, which had a population of 5,791 at the time of the 2001 census. The Worcester Park post town, which is coterminous with the KT4 postcode district, covers all of the suburb and also extends into the southeastern periphery of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, covering most of the areas of Old Malden and Malden Green. Beverley Brook runs through Worcester Park, alongside Green Lane and past Green Lane Primary School, traversing up to Cuddington Recreation Ground. Green Lane appears in the Domesday Book. The Huntsmans Hall (now The Brook.) was situated on what was the far boundary of a hunting ground for Henry VIII. == Demographics == In 2011, around 78% of residents of Worcester Park ward were White, with 3.6% mixed race, 4.8% Asian or British Asian, 2.0% Black and 3.3% Chinese or of another ethnic group. ==History== St. Mary the Virgin, The Avenue, Worcester Park Worcester Park takes its name from the 4th Earl of Worcester, who was appointed Keeper of the Great Park in 1606. The area was once part of the Great Park which covered around 1100 acres and was adjacent to the Little Park which contained Nonsuch Palace of Henry VIII. Both parks were originally used as deer parks. Henry VIII had obtained the land from Sir Richard de Codington. During the ownership by Sir Richard de Codington, there was a manor house on a site which was later replaced by Worcester House and is now the site of Worcester Close. There was also a church of St. Mary on roughly the same site where the church of St Mary the Virgin, Cuddington, now stands. In 1809 Worcester Park was acquired by William Taylor. He used a mill on the banks of the Hogsmill River to continue the manufacture of gunpowder which had been carried out on and off in the area for several centuries. Manufacturing continued until the 1850s when the mill blew up. In 1890 Worcester Park Baptist Church was formed in Longfellow Road. It moved to its present location on The Avenue in the 1950s. ===Cheam Common Infants and Junior schools=== Cheam Common Infants and Junior schools are pre- World War II school buildings. Air raid shelters were found underground during an extension to the main building of the junior school. The school is located at the top of the high street. ===Parker's Field=== Possibly belonging to T Parker & Sons, Landscapers, who were based at what is now a housing estate at beside Worcester Park Station, Parker's Field was a popular toboggan run until a housing estate was built on a large part of it in the 1970s (despite being Green Belt). ===Rowe Hall=== The Scout HQ next door to Cuddington Primary School in Salisbury Road at was built in 1958 and named Rowe Hall in honour of a long serving scout leader, \\"Miss Ivy Rowe\\". This headquarters was erected after the previous building was destroyed by arsonists and still serves the 2nd Cuddington (Rowe) Scout Group. Miss Rowe was the third-form teacher at Blakesley School, a private primary school owned by Mr and Mrs Eric Dudley, and highly esteemed Akela of the 2nd Cuddington (Blakesley) Cub pack from its founding in the early 1940s to the 1960s. ===Worcester (Park) House=== In the 1950s, the ruins of an ornamental lake with a multi-arched bridge and balustrade were still visible in the woodland at the foot of a hill in Parker's Field. The house itself was not visible, nor were there any ruins apart from the lake and some mounds of bricks. The lake itself had drained into the Hogsmill River, but no source of incoming water was visible. The lake dried up in the late 1940s following the rechannelling of the river. Close to the bridge remnant to the south-west of the bridge was a ruined domed structure, all that remains of an ice house. However, it was filled with soil and other debris which prevented any investigation. Locals presumed the house to be named \\"Worcester Park House\\", and have suggested that Blakesley School was the original house, while historical sources suggest \\"Worcester House\\". However, the map of 1871 shows a building labelled \\"Worcester Park House\\" to be alongside the lake, to the west of it, on land that was, in the 1950s, overgrown with trees. Documents from HM Land Registry show that the name of the building for Blakesley School was Worcester Court. ==In literature== Worcester Park is the site of the enormous launch structure built to pioneer manned flight in the short story \\"The Argonauts of the Air\\" by H.

It hosts a number of shops, banks, estate agents, building societies, solicitors, restaurants, pubs and coffee bars including Caffè Nero, Pizza Express and Costa Coffee, with a Nando's in the making. In their sum, these include both multiples and independents. The largest store is a branch of the supermarket, Waitrose. Along with neighbouring North Cheam, Worcester Park is a beneficiary of the Mayor of London's \\"Outer London Fund\\". See section below. ==Outer London Fund== During 2011/12 Worcester Park and neighbouring North Cheam won nearly £2m from the Mayor of London's Outer London Fund for improvements to the local area. Sutton Council has begun a collaborative project, steered by Councillors and community stakeholders, to spend the money on making improvements to the public realm and supporting the development and growth of businesses in the town centres. Sutton Council's bid for the money stated that: \\"In The London Plan, London's Mayor recognises the strategic importance of supporting town centres as key locations for a diverse range of activities. Town centres are key nodes for effective land use and transport integration, a focus for local communities, enhance quality of life, and are key focal points for regeneration initiatives. Both Worcester Park and North Cheam are recognised as part of a network of District Centres in London by the Mayor. In this way, they play an important role in the Borough [of Sutton]. Their development is also strategic: the long term growth strategy for Sutton identified in Sutton's Core Strategy, identifies both as ‘Centres for Intensification’ where renewal will largely be achieved through residential and mixed use development.\\" It also notes that: \\"Network Rail are willing to build on plans to make enhancements to Worcester Park Station, working with the Council to make a welcoming and distinctive arrival to Worcester Park.\\" ==The Hamptons and Mayflower Park== The Hamptons, view from part of main parkland belt Archetypal colonial revival architecture of The Hamptons. The Hamptons is an early 21st-century St James Homes estate of mainly New England (Colonial Revival) style housing in the northeast of Worcester Park. It lies within the London Borough of Sutton. It was constructed in of parkland on the former site of sewage works and its formerly bracken buffer, by the sports field buffers of Motspur Park and existing residential streets of Worcester Park. The site has with appropriate civic engineering been converted to a conservation wetland, amphitheatre, community centre and gym, tennis courts (for residents) and a viewing platform with views to the City of London and c. 1000 homes: apartments to large detached houses. Dutch style/Dutch Colonial Revival houses were added towards the end of re-engineering, landscaping and construction in the ten years to 2013.

Worcester Park station is a Category C station (provides important rail feeder services on a busy trunk route with between £2m and £20m in ticket revenues per annum). The railway line runs from London Waterloo, via Wimbledon and Worcester Park to Epsom, Dorking and Guildford. Worcester Park is approximately a 25-minute journey to London Waterloo by train with trains typically running every 15 minutes during the day, with additional services during morning and evening peak periods. There were plans to improve station facilities and rail services at Worcester Park during 2012–13. Network Rail notified Kingston council of its intention to extend the length of platforms at Worcester Park Station. This will allow extra passenger capacity as trains can be increased from 8 carriages to 10 in length. There was a petition in early 2014 to get Crossrail 2 to stop at Worcester Park railway station. Also, under the Department for Transport's Access for All scheme – a disabled access fund to create obstacle- free routes to, from and between trains – Worcester Park station was made accessible to wheelchair users and those with pushchairs etc. on both platforms, with the construction of a new footbridge containing a two lifts, one at each end. { class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible\\" +Table of Public Transport Services in Worcester Park !Route Number !Start of Route !End of Route !Accepts Oyster card? !Operator !Frequency !Transport Type !Oyster Zone - N/A London Waterloo Dorking Up to Epsom station South Western Railway 30 Mins Off Peak Heavy Rail/Railway 4 - N/A London Waterloo Epsom Yes South Western Railway Rush Hour Only Service Heavy Rail/Railway 4 - N/A London Waterloo Guildford Up to Epsom station South Western Railway 30 Mins Off Peak Heavy Rail/Railway 4 - 151 Worcester Park Wallington Yes London General 10 Mins Bus N/A - 213 Kingston Sutton Yes London General 10 Mins 24/7 Bus N/A - S3 Malden Manor station Belmont Yes Quality Line Every 20 mins Bus N/A - X26 Heathrow Airport West Croydon bus station Yes Metrobus Every Half Hour Bus N/A - 613 Tolworth Glenthorne High School Yes London United School Bus Service; operates only during term times Bus N/A - 627 Worcester Park Woodcote Green Yes Arriva London School Bus Service; operates only during term times Bus N/A - 868 Worcester Park St Joseph's School Rosebank No?

Greensted means green place, sted being in the Anglo-Saxon language, the old word for place (and is still used in modern English words e.g. 'instead', 'steadfast'). Greensted is also both a current English and, as Grønstad, Danish surname. The area of England where Greensted is located is at the edge of the area once known as the Danelaw. Greensted is situated in a large natural clearing, and would have been a logical place to build a settlement in the dense surrounding Epping Forest especially as it was near an existing route, the Ongar road, later part of the Canterbury pilgrimage mentioned in The Canterbury Tales. Greensted, near Ongar, is sometimes confused with Greenstead, in Colchester. Both places are located in the county of Essex, but they are over 30 miles apart. Use, where appropriate, of postcodes can reduce the risk of confusion. Postcodes for addresses in Greensted, near Ongar, commence with the letters 'CM', postcodes for Greenstead, near Colchester, commence with 'CO'. ==History== Greensted is important because of its longevity: the parish has existed since Saxon times, and little has changed. It is also a place that has strong ties with St Edmund, King of East Anglia. King Edmund's body stayed in the church, following his death in 1013, before being moved onwards to Bury St- Edmunds.Hadfield, J. (1970). The Shell Guide to England.

It is one of the oldest heritage railroad operations in the United States. It is a narrow gauge line that operates excursion trains for tourists, built by the late Ellis D. Atwood (initials E.D.A., for which Edaville is named) on his sprawling cranberry plantation in Southeastern Massachusetts.Moody, Linwood W. The Maine Two- Footers Howell-North (1959) ==History== ===Conception and opening=== Former Bridgton locomotive operating at Edaville in 1959. A former Sandy River railbus and Bridgton tank car may be seen in the background in front of the locomotive. A 1914 Walker Electric Truck displayed at Edaville Railroad in South Carver, MA, USA circa 1966 Atwood purchased two locomotives and most of the passenger and freight cars when the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad was dismantled in 1941. After World War II he acquired two former Monson Railroad locomotives and some surviving cars from the defunct Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad in Maine. This equipment ran on narrow gauge tracks, as opposed to the more common narrow gauge in the western United States. Atwood purchased the equipment for use on his cranberry plantation in South Carver. After the 1945 cranberry harvest, Atwood's employees built of track atop the levees around the cranberry bogs. Sand and supplies were hauled in to the bogs, and cranberries were transported to a \\"screen house\\" where they were dried and then sent to market. Atwood's neighbors were enchanted with the diminutive railroad. At first, Atwood offered rides for free. When the demand for rides soared, he charged a nickel a ride. Eventually the line became less of a working railroad and more of a tourist attraction. Atwood died in 1950, the result of injuries he received when the oil burner in the screen house exploded. His widow Elthea and nephew Dave Eldridge carried on operations at Edaville until the railroad was purchased in 1957 by F. Nelson Blount, a railroad enthusiast who had made a fortune in the seafood processing business. The Atwood Estate retained ownership of the land over which the railroad operated, a key point in later years. Blount operated Edaville for the next decade, hauling tourists behind his favorite engine #8 and displaying his ever-growing collection of locomotives. Among these was the Boston and Maine Railroad's Flying Yankee. This helped form the basis for his Steamtown, USA collection, first operating at Keene, New Hampshire before moving to Bellows Falls, Vermont. (It would later move and be reconstituted as the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania.) Blount also leased some of the 2 ft equipment from Edaville to operate at two theme parks in the Northeast: C. V. Wood's Freedomland U.S.A. in the Bronx, New York, and Pleasure Island in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The trains leased to Freedomland were operated under the Santa Fe Rail Road attraction. The company that operated the actual Santa Fe Rail Road sponsored the train rides. The trains consisted of steam engines Monson #3 and Monson #4, passenger cars and caboose cars. They trains were delivered to Freedomland each spring and returned to Edaville when the park closed for the season in September or October. The engines now can be found in separate museums in Maine. ===1967–91=== Nelson Blount died in the crash of his light airplane over Labor Day weekend in 1967. Blount's friend and right-hand man Fred Richardson continued on as general manager until the railroad was sold to George E. Bartholomew, a former Edaville employee, in 1970. Edaville continued operations for another two decades with Bartholomew at the helm. The railroad operated tourist trains from Memorial Day thru Labor Day plus a brief, but spectacular, Festival of Lights in December. In the 1980s, Bartholomew's attention was divided between the narrow gauge Edaville, and the Bay Colony Railroad he was then forming, running over disused Conrail branch lines. To some observers and former employees, Edaville began to stagnate around this time, although the annual Christmas Festival of Lights continued to draw huge crowds. In the late 1980s, after Mrs. Atwood passed and the Atwood Estate evicted Edaville, Bartholomew was forced to cease operations. He eventually put the railroad up for sale in 1991. ===1992–2005=== Edaville ceased operations in January 1992 and much of the equipment was sold to a group in Portland, Maine led by businessman Phineas T. Sprague. The equipment was to be the basis of the newly formed Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad Museum along the shores of Casco Bay. The sale generated great rancor. Many of the railroad's employees were not ready to give up on South Carver. Much of the contents of the museum, housed in the former screen house, had been auctioned off the previous fall. But the sale was closed (although the Portland museum took on a debt that would prove all but crushing in subsequent years) and locomotives 3,4 and 8 were trucked to Portland aboard antique trucks loaned for the occasion. Locomotive #7, which was owned by Louis Edmonds, left for Maine at a later date. Two attempts to revive Edaville during the 1990s foundered. The Edaville Entertainment Group formed an ambitious business plan to revive the park, but their relationship with the Atwood Estate (upon which the tracks were laid) turned sour. The group briefly considered moving the park to a parcel in Freetown, Massachusetts, but eventually they abandoned their effort. South Carver Rail, led by former Edaville employees (and engineers) Paul Hallet and Rick Knight, operated the hastily refurbished #7 for Fred Richardson's 80th birthday at Edaville, and ran trains during the Cranberry Festival over a Columbus Day Weekend in the mid-1990s, even managing to borrow Monson #3 from Maine. Ultimately their efforts to reopen the park failed, and it was the last time that the \\"original\\" Edaville locomotives ran over the line. In 1999, the new Edaville Railroad opened for operation. Owned and operated by construction company owner Jack Flagg, developer John Delli Priscoli and cranberry grower Douglas Beaton, the railroad acquired a 'new' steam locomotive, #21 \\"Anne Elizabeth\\", built by the English firm of Hudswell Clarke and a veteran of the Fiji sugar industry. Several of the original Edaville buildings, including the station and the engine house, were demolished with new buildings taking their place. Plans called for the construction of a roundhouse, served by the original turntable, with an enlarged collection of locomotives and rolling stock. ===2005–present=== By 2005, Edaville Railroad and the land upon which it ran was now owned by a single man: Jon Delli Priscoli. He bought up the Atwood property, bought out partner Jack Flagg, and became the sole owner. Although this removed the railroad/landlord conflict that had plagued Edaville for decades, it proved to be the end of the \\"old\\" Edaville. Delli Priscoli turned the land near the milepost known as \\"Mt. Urann\\" into a housing subdivision, and pulled up the tracks that ran through the new lots. Late 2005 saw the very last run over the \\"original line\\" (pulled by oil-burner #21, which had been cosmetically modified to more closely resemble a Maine prototype). When the rails were removed over Mt. Urann, the mainline became a loop, including about half of the line around the old reservoir. In late 2010, the Edaville operators announced that they would not seek to renew their operating lease with Delli Priscoli. Delli Priscoli then put the railroad up for sale for $10 million, and eventually found a potential buyer. However, Priscolli found that the buyer did not intend to continue operating the park, and declined the offer, opting instead to rebuild the park. The restored railroad reopened in September 2011. The following year, the park began a three-year reconstruction project, which includes the installation of additional attractions, refurbishing and repainting existing rides, adding additional parking, and building a new main street entrance and guest services area. ==Edaville Family Theme Park== By 2017, the Edaville Family Theme Park opened with cranberry harvesting and railroading as its two main themes. It features 32 amusement rides including a Ferris Wheel, Tilt-a-Whirl and the only Thomas Land in the United States. ==Thomas Land USA== The Tidmouth Sheds attraction at Thomas Land Thomas operating on the Edaville Railroad The \\"Thomas Land USA\\" park was built and opened at Edaville on August 15, 2015. The park is based on the British children's television series Thomas & Friends, especially the Island of Sodor. Thomas Land has 11 rides featuring characters including Harold the Helicopter, Cranky the Crane, Toby and the Troublesome Trucks. The park includes audio-animatronic trains, a stage show and dining locations. ==See also== * List of amusement parks in New England * List of heritage railroads in the United States * Rail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts == References Reinhard's Edaville Website Category:2 ft gauge railways in the United States Category:Amusement parks in Massachusetts Category:Heritage railroads in Massachusetts Category:Narrow gauge railroads in Massachusetts Category:Railroads of amusement parks in the United States Category:Street railway museums in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in Plymouth County, Massachusetts Category:Transportation in Plymouth County, Massachusetts ","title":"Edaville Railroad"},{"id":"2568737","text":"30-Second Bunnies Theatre is a Flash cartoon parody series featuring films re- enacted by anthropomorphic animated bunnies in 30 seconds. The series is produced by Angry Alien Productions, the one-woman company of creator Jennifer Shiman. The series debuted in 2004 when Shiman sought to create a humorous web series. She unveiled a version of The Exorcist, re-enacted by animated bunnies in 30 seconds. It received an overwhelmingly positive response online from a global audience, prompting Shiman to create more re-enactments. In 2005, the \\"bunny troupe\\" was commissioned by Starz! to make new shorts. Each Starz- commissioned re-enactment premiered on Starz on Demand before moving online. The series' take on Star Wars was featured on CNN on April 16, 2006. Angry Alien Productions released a selection of the shorts on DVD on October 20, 2009. Previously, the Titanic short was included on that film's 4-Disc Special Collector's Edition DVD, released in 2005. In 2007, Crackle became a distributing partner. In 2008, Shiman won two Webby Awards for Online Film and Video/Animation, as well as the People's Voice award in that category. On June 13, 2010, Shiman announced on the 30-Second Bunnies Theatre Website that, after six years and 68 shorts, she was placing the series on hiatus to move on to other pursuits. The final short at the time was a re-enactment of the film Evil Dead II. As of October 2011, Shiman completed three more re-enactments: Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, Freaks (1932) and Michael Dougherty's Trick 'r Treat. Shiman teamed up with FEARnet from 2012-2013 to make 2 additional seasons of horror movie shorts. In Spring 2015 Shiman informed that she would indefinitely stop making re-enactments after Blade Runner. In January 2018, Shiman launched a Patreon page to crowdfund a season of new bunny re- enactments. In February 2018, Shiman released the first re-enactment of the new season, When Harry Meets Sally, for Valentine's Day. In 2019, Shiman teamed up with TV news/gossip site PrimeTimer.com to create a unique bunny season in which the troupe re-enacts breakout episodes from popular TV series. In March 2020, the last reenactment was from The Twilight Zone episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\". ==List of films== *30 Days of Night (2007) *Alien (1979) *Back to the Future (1985) *Batman (1989) *The Big Chill (1983) *The Birds (1963) *Black Christmas (1974) *Blade Runner (1982) *Borat (2006) *Brokeback Mountain (2005) *The Cabin in the Woods (2012) *Caddyshack (1980) *Cannibal Holocaust (1980) *Casablanca (1942) *A Christmas Carol (1951) *A Christmas Story (1983) *Christmas Vacation (1989) *A Clockwork Orange (1971) *Die Hard (1988) *Evil Dead II (1987) *The Exorcist (1973) *Fight Club (1999) *The Fly (1986) *Freaks (1932) *Freddy vs. Jason (2003) *Godzilla (1954) *Gone With the Wind (1939) *Goodfellas (1990) *Grindhouse (2007) *The Grudge (2004) *Two-part Harry Potter Montage (2001–2007) * Halloween (1978) *Hellraiser (1987) *Highlander (1986) *House at the End of the Street (2012) *Insidious (2011) *It (2017) *It's a Wonderful Life (1946) *James Bond Montage (1962–2006) *Jaws (1975) *Jurassic Park (1993) *Kill Bill (Both volumes) (2003–2004) *King Kong (1933) *The Last Exorcism (2010) *March of the Penguins (2005) *The Monster Squad (1987) *My Dinner With Andre (1981) *Napoleon Dynamite (2004) *Night of the Living Dead (1968) *No Country For Old Men (2007) *Office Space (1999) *Paranormal Activity (2007) *Pirates of the Caribbean, 2 and 3 (2003, 2006, 2007 respectively) *Poltergeist (1982) *The Princess Bride (1987) *Pulp Fiction (1994) *Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) *Reservoir Dogs (censored and uncensored versions) (1992) *The Ring (2002) *Rocky (1976) *The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) *Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 1964 *Saw (2004) *Scrooge (1951) *Scream (1996) *The Shining (1980) *The Silence of the Lambs (1991) *Sixteen Candles (1984) *Snakes on a Plane (2006) *Spider-Man, 2 and 3 (2002, 2004, 2007 respectively) *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) *Star Wars (1977) *Superbad (2007) *Superman (1978) *Suspiria (1977) *Teeth (2007) *The Terminator (1984) *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) *Titanic (1997) *Top Gun (1986) *Trick 'r Treat (2007) *Tucker & Dale vs Evil (2010) *Twilight (2008) *The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) *The War of the Worlds (1953) *When Harry Met Sally...

He was sentenced to a month in prison in November 1835 after clashing with Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, who questioned his integrity. In February of the following year, he unleashed a stink bomb of asafoetida at the National Assembly of Quebec. While lying-low at his father's house he began writing his novel L'influence d'un livre. The story is made up of various fictionalized historical events, legends and folksongs which show the influence of father's recollections.

He briefly retired in 2006 but restarted in mid-2007. He claims to be the only performing farter in the world. He worked on the railways before focusing on his flatulence performances. ==Background== According to When Will I Be Famous? (2003), a BBC book on British variety acts, Oldfield discovered his ability to fart at the age of fifteen when practicing yoga. The next day he performed twenty rapid-fire farts in under a minute for a group of his friends. In the late 1980s, Oldfield turned professional, performing as an opening act for the Macclesfield-based bands the Screaming Beavers and the Macc Lads. The latter wrote a song about him on their album The Beer Necessities. Oldfield subsequently travelled to New York City in the U.S., where he appeared as a guest on The Howard Stern Show as the \\"British Blaster\\". While in New York, Mr. Methane also performed a series of fart acts on Broadway. In his autobiography, English comic Frank Skinner talks about the time that Phil Spector, while receiving a lifetime music award, went into a rant live on Australian TV about a duet of \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\" that Skinner had sung with Mr Methane on his BBC1 chat chow. Spector said that Methane and Skinner had taken his work of art and desecrated it.Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner (October 2001). Century. / . Page 312. In the 1990s Mr Methane produced a parody of the Phil Collins song \\"In the Air Tonight\\" titled \\"Curry In the Air Tonight.\\" Tony Smith, Collins' business manager, refused to let Mr Methane release his parody version, stating that, \\"This is a very serious song and we cannot see any reason for it to be taken so lightly.\\" Letters between the two parties were reproduced on The Smoking Gun website. In July 2004, Q magazine voted Mr Methane's album mr methane.com the second most bizarre album ever released in a Q special edition titled \\"The 150 Greatest Rock Lists Ever\\". In 2009 Oldfield auditioned for Britain's Got Talent, where he announced his intention to \\"put the art into fart\\", but failed to make it through to the live finals. He gave a flatulist performance of the \\"Blue Danube\\" waltz, and was \\"buzzed\\" out by all three judges — despite two of them, Piers Morgan and Amanda Holden, laughing uncontrollably, while Simon Cowell called him \\"a disgusting creature\\". He received negative reactions from some audience members, while others were seen to be in hysterics. That same year, Mr Methane also auditioned for Das Supertalent in Germany, but was eliminated in the semi- finals. In 2013 Mr Methane performed in The World Farting Championships at Utajärvi, Finland, though he didn’t participate in the contest itself. July 2014 saw Mr Methane release a fart app for Android devices. The app had originally been developed in 2010, for the iPhone, but was rejected by Apple.

He is recognized as one of the most popular songwriters of his era. His work was widely appreciated not only in Mexico but also in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Spain. After his death, he has also been recognized in the United States, Italy and Japan. Notable performers of his work include Pedro Vargas who was a friend, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres, Pedro Infante, Javier Solis, Julio Iglesias, Manuel Mijares, Vicente Fernandez, Luis Miguel, Perez Prado, Chavela Vargas, and Natalia Lafourcade among others. Outside the Spanish speaking world, his most famous songs are Granada, Solamente Una Vez (You Belong to My Heart) and Piensa en mí, which have both been recorded by numerous international singers, including Enrico Caruso, Mario Lanza and Jose Carreras. ==Biography== Lara was born in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz. Later, the Lara family had to move to Mexico City, establishing their house in the borough of Coyoacán. After their mother died, Agustín and his siblings lived in a hospice run by their aunt. It was there that he had his first contact with music. Lara's first musical composition was Marucha, written in honor of one of his first loves. In 1927 he already was working in cabarets. It was around this time that he was involved in an argument with a showgirl named Estrella, who slashed him in the face with a broken bottle, leaving a distinct scar (a Glasgow smile) on his cheek. He subsequently moved to Puebla, but returned to Mexico City in 1928. That same year he started working for the tenor Juan Arvizu as composer and accompanist. In September 1930, Lara began a successful radio career. At the same time he acted and composed songs for such films as Santa. The Eng. Guillermo González Camarena, with Agustín Lara. Lara's first tour, to Cuba in 1933, was a failure because of political turmoil on the island. Later, more successful tours in South America, as well as such new compositions as Solamente Una Vez (composed in Buenos Aires and dedicated to José Mojica), Veracruz, Tropicana, and Pecadora increased his fame. By the beginning of the 1940s, Lara was well known in Spain. In 1965, the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, gave him a house in Granada to show his appreciation of Lara's songs with Spanish themes, such as Toledo, Cuerdas de mi Guitarra, Granada, Seville and Madrid. He received additional honors and decorations from around the world. His career was portrayed in the 1959 Mexican film The Life of Agustín Lara. In 1968, Lara's health began to decline rapidly; an accident that fractured his pelvis further aggravated his condition. On November 6, 1970, Lara died. He was buried in Mexico City. By the time of his death, Lara had written more than 700 songs. A biography of him, \\"Agustín Lara: Vida y Pasiones\\", was written by his friend Javier Ruiz Rueda. == Family == Grave of Agustín Lara Agustín was a son of Joaquín Lara and his wife María Aguirre y Pino. He had an aunt named Refugio Aguirre del Pino and younger sister, María Teresa Lara. He married María Félix and Rocío Durán (whom he adopted) and was a stepfather to the actor Enrique Álvarez Félix, who died in 1996. Sons of Lara are Gerardo Agustín Lara Santacruz, with sixth wife Yolanda Santacruz Gasca) and Agustín Lara Lárraga (biological son of actress Vianey Lárraga, one of Lara's wives).

In 1179 the cathedral chapters of Saint-Imier and Moutier-Grandval are listed as major land owners in Cortébert. The Seignory of Erguel held the village as a fief for the Diocese of Basel. In 1530 Biel introduced the Protestant Reformation into the parish of Corgémont which included the village of Cortébert. During the Early Modern era the village had a successful agricultural and small scale handicraft economy. A number of houses and workshops were built during the 16th through 19th century, many of which still exist in the center of the village. In 1865, the watch manufacturer Raiguel Juillard et Cie opened a factory in the village. It was later renamed Cortébert Watch & Co. The watch factory changed the entire socio-economic structure of the village. A village school opened in 1872, though it and the municipal archives were both destroyed in a fire in 1959. A train station opened in 1874, followed by a Reformed chapel in 1902. In 1938 a pumping station was built in the municipality which provided water to the villages in the Franches-Montagnes plateau. However, in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, demand for watches plummeted which devastated the municipal economy. Cortébert Watch struggled to remain in operation until 1962 when it finally closed.

It was first called by the current name in 1727. A glass-hut or glassworks was mentioned in the area as part of a fief of the d'Orsans family in 1370. While a village was not mentioned then, by 1393 a village had grown around the glassworks. It was part of the seigniory of Erguel in the Diocese of Basel. It was part of the parish of Péry. So La Heutte adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1530, when Biel converted the entire parish of Péry to the new faith. During the 18th century, Biel attempted to expand its power, which caused frequent conflicts with the neighboring villages, including La Heutte. The first glass factory, at Le Van north of the village, dates from before 1370. Another glass factory opened in the valley at the end of the 15th century and remained in operation until the early 17th century. Between 1650 and 1750 the village expanded toward the Suze river as the population grew. A thriving pottery industry and a large mill developed along the river. The first school was built in the 1839. In 1876 a train station was built in the village, which encouraged the growth of the watch industry. Two years later, the Ammann watch factory opened in the old Bendit mill. In 1895 the Urania Watch Company replaced Ammann in the mill. It was, in turn, replaced by the Weber wire drawing factory in 1938. During a watchmaking boom between 1950 and 1974, numerous small watch and watch part workshops opened in the village.

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). While the majority of the population speaks German, the German form of the municipality name, Tramlingen-Berg, is no longer used. Even though it is in the French-speaking part of the canton of Bern, there is a German public school. ==History== Around 1570 the Prince- Bishop of Basel allowed Anabaptist refugees from the Emmental to settle in the seigniory of Erguel, including in the area that would become Mont-Tramelan. The farms in the area were part of the parish of Tramelan, which adopted the Reformed faith in 1530. At the beginning of the 17th Century, a family from Neuchâtel founded the community which was known as Montagnes de la paroisse de Tramelan. The earliest record of the community is from 1647 when it was known simply as la Montagne. In 1685 it was acknowledged by the Bishop. Following the 1798 French invasion, Mont-Tramelan became a commune under French rule. It remained under French authority until 1814 and in following year became part of the Canton of Bern. During the 19th century, the watch making industry flourished in the French-speaking Jura region. The majority of the francophone families of Mont-Tramelan abandoned their farms and moved to the nearby watch making towns, leaving a German-speaking majority in the villages. In 1897, the formerly private Baptist school in the village became a German-speaking public school for the municipality. A new German speaking school was built in 1953. In 1942, German became the official municipal language. This decision created a German-speaking enclave in a French-speaking district at a time when the Jurassic separatism movement was beginning to grow. In 1938 Mont-Tramelan joined the Syndicat des eaux Franches-Montagnes which built a pump station at Cortébert to supply water to the municipalities and farms of the region. Agriculture is still the main source of income of the population. ==Geography== Farm and countryside in Mont-Tramelan Mont-Tramelan has an area of .

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). Above it, there is a small year round resort, called les \\"Prés-d'Orvin\\". ==History== La Bragarde house in Les Prés-d'Orvin Orvin is first mentioned in 866 as Ulvinc. In 999 King Rudolph III of Burgundy gave Moutier-Grandval Abbey and its lands, including Orvin, to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The village remained under the Bishop's direct control until 1295, when the Lords of Orvin received the village as a fief. They held the village until the end of the 14th century, after which it passed to the d'Orsans family and then the Lords of Rondchâtel. After the Rondchâtel line died out, the village returned to the Bishop's control who placed it under the ecclesiastical vogt of Biel. The first town charter of 1352 was expanded and revised in 1643 and confirmed by the Bishop in 1668. It remained in effect until the end of the Ancien Régime. Starting in the 14th century, the feudal levies of Orvin were part of a company from Erguel and under the control of Biel. However, between 1649 and 1852, they formed a separate company with its own banner. The military company became a major local corporation, which became quite wealthy through offering loans. The old village church of St. Peter was part of the diocese of Lausanne, while the town was owned by the Bishop of Basel. St. Peter's was eventually demolished and a late-Gothic church was built in another location. That church was demolished in 1722 and replaced by the current Baroque church, which was decorated in 1916 by Paul Robert. The village accepted the Protestant Reformation in 1530. In the 17th Century, the population was afflicted by several witch trials. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Orvin became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Orvin was assigned to the Canton of Bern. During the late 19th century, the municipality remained isolated from the growing Swiss railroad network. It remained generally agrarian and in 1930 had 95 farms. However, in the 1950s the population began to grow as good roads were built into the village. In the following twenty years the population increased by nearly one-third. As the population grew, several factories opened in Orvin. In 1954 the first factory, the Schäublin factory, opened in the municipality. It was followed by a Bulova factory in 1964, the Léchot company in 1961, LNS company in 1973 and Precimed in 1988. By 2005 only 10% of the working population worked in agriculture, while almost two-thirds worked in industry. The resort village of Les Prés-d'Orvin grew rapidly as residents of Biel and Solothurn bought chalets. In 1951 there were 181 houses in Les Prés-d'Orvin, while in 1975 it had increased to 332. ==Geography== Painting of the Orvin valley, 1911 Orvin has an area of .

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== The first mention of Péry is in 884 where it is called villam Bedericam. In 1148 it was known as Peril, though that name comes from a 12th-century forgery. The municipality was formerly known by its German name Büderich, however, that name is no longer used. In 884, Charles the Fat granted Péry to Moutier-Grandval Abbey. The Abbey owned the village and surrounding lands until 999 when the Prince- Bishop of Basel acquired the village. He incorporated it into the seigniory of Erguel and gave the village to the Lords of Péry who ruled from Châtillon Castle, now a ruin, on a nearby hill. Beginning in the 14th century the feudal levies from Péry were part of the Erguel army under the command of Biel. In 1530, Biel encouraged the village to accept the Protestant Reformation. The village of Rondchâtel was independent of Péry until 1766. Based on the name, it is likely that a castle existed on the hill, but little is known about it. During the mid 14th century, the Prince-Bishop of Basel Johann II von Munsingen, granted Rondchâtel to his brother Conrad, who was an ecclesiastical bailiff of Biel in 1340-65. Starting at the end of the 14th century, Rondchâtel fief was owned by the de Nans and d'Orsans families out of Franche- Comté. They held the village until 1766, when the last heir of the families died out and the fief reverted to the Prince-Bishop. The Prince-Bishop then leased Rondchâtel to the community of Péry. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Péry became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. A few years later, it became part of the Département of Haut- Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Péry was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village church of St. James was first mentioned in 884. After the village converted to the new Reformed faith in 1530, it became a Reformed church. The current church was built in 1706 around a core of an older, Gothic building. At some point it became the parish church for the parish of Péry. From 1798 until 1840, Vauffelin was part of the parish. A Roman Catholic chapel was built in the village in 1906. Rondchâtel cement factory and quarry The Prince-Bishop of Basel, Johann Franz von Schönau-Zell (Bishop 1651-1656), had a blast furnace built at La Reuchenette in 1654. In 1693 he gave the furnace as a fief to Chemilleret family, who held it until the death of their last heir in 1756. By 1782 the site included an ironworks, a house, an inn. After the French invasion, it was declared a national treasure and the feudal ownership was abolished. The Société des forges d'Undervelier took over operation of the site until 1867, when it closed. The Biel-Les Convers railway opened in 1874 and encouraged industrial and population growth. The lime and cement factory in Rondchâtel (1874), the wood pulp plant at Biberist (1882) and a branch of the Rondchâtel cement factory in La Reuchenette (today Ciments Vigier SA) all contributed to the prosperity of the municipality. The watch manufacturer Dreyfus Frères SA of Biel opened a branch company in 1903 in Péry. This company, called Péry Watch, did not survive the financial crisis of the 1930s. The building was converted in 1934 into a typewriter ribbon, stencils and carbon paper factory under the name Carfa SA. Carfa remained in operation until 2003. In 2005, just over half of all jobs in the municipality were in manufacturing.

Founded as Farum Boldklub from the merger of the town's two football clubs Farum IK and Stavnsholt BK in 1991, the club changed its name to FC Nordsjælland in 2003. FCN plays in the Danish Superliga, winning its first medal in the 2002–03 season, taking third place. Since then, the Wild Tigers have made four appearances in Europe under both the old UEFA Cup format in 2003–04, 2008–09 and in the UEFA Europa League during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons. In 2010, the club won its first Danish Cup and successfully defended it the following year in 2011, beating Midtjylland in both finals. FCN won the 2011–12 Danish Superliga in May 2012 which qualified the team to participate in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League. Nordsjælland plays its home matches at Right to Dream Park, which has a capacity of 10,100 of which 9,800 seating and 300 standing spectators. ==History== ===Farum BK (1991–2003)=== alt=refer to captionEstablished on 1 January 1991, from the merger of two football clubs, Farum Idræts Klub (formed in 1910) and Stavnsholt Boldklub af 1974, both from the then Farum municipality (now consolidated with Værløse as the Furesø municipality), Farum BK would become one of the few merger success stories in Danish football, but not without controversy. The club was an initiative local Farum residence and of then local mayor Peter Brixtofte, whom took a personal interest in the club, as well as garnered sponsorship for the team. The club kit colours became a combination of the two merged clubs, the red and white of Stavnsholt with the yellow and blue of F.I.K. combined into a kit with yellow and red striped shirts and dark blue shorts and socks, which is still used in some form to this day. Colours were not the only thing the newly formed club inherited, as Thomas Andreasen who had been with Stavnsholt BK was carried over into the new Farum squad, Andreasen would go on to make a record 295 appearances, playing from the Denmark Series all the way to the Danish Superliga, until his departure from the club in 2007. Farum BK was placed in the second group of the Denmark Series, the fourth tier in the Danish football pyramid, though it gained promotion to the first group after the club's maiden season. Jørgen Andersen, a former goalkeeper for Hvidovre, took over as the club's first head coach in 1992; the club stayed in the Denmark Series first group for six years. Under the guidance of manager Jørgen Tideman, who took over in 1994, Farum qualified for promotion into the 2nd Division in the 1997–98 season and subsequently turned professional for the first time in club history. Farum's first full season as a professional club was a fruitful one, edging out Aalborg Chang and Skive to fifth place by one point, gaining promotion for the second time in two years into the 1st Division. The club's meteoric rise was slowed at first with the new challenge of playing in the Danish second tier, though it was not stopped however, ending the 1999–2000 campaign with a respectable eighth-place finish, winning the same number of games as it lost. Farum, however, remained unable to make any sort of impact in the Danish Cup, having lost in the first round for the last three years since making its debut in the tournament in the 1997–98 season. The following year saw some progression in both the league and cup, improving on the previous year's finish by finishing fifth, three spots and nine points behind second-placed promotion winners Vejle, as well as breaking out of the first round of the Danish Cup to eventually fall to Fremad Amager in the third round following a 2–1 loss. With the 2001–02 season, unconventional coach Christian Andersen was brought in to manage the team, building on the gradual footholds the club had been making in the 1st Division. Jeppe Tengbjerg played a pivotal role, brought in from B.93 the previous year; he scored 16 goals, becoming Farum's top goalscorer of the season and third overall in the league. The team went on to earn promotion into the Superliga after finishing in second place, 11 points clear of third-placed Sønderjylland, one point behind first-place winners Køge, scoring a team total of 69 goals, the highest that season and losing only four games. Farum's 2002–03 appearance in the top flight of Danish football would be its first and last under the Farum BK name. it ended the season in third place, thus qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time in its history. The club's achievement, however, was overshadowed by the controversy involving Peter Brixtofte, who had helped form and fund the club, with deals involving his municipality deliberately overpaying for welfare services bought from private companies who in return would sponsor the Farum football team. Brixtofte was forced to step down as chairman and the club became close to bankruptcy. ===FC Nordsjælland (2003–present)=== alt=refer to caption In March 2003, Farum BK was bought by AKP Holding, the holdings company of local businessman Allan K. Pedersen, and in an effort to distance the club from the Brixtofte scandal, Farum BK was re-branded as FC Nordsjælland, named after the North Zealand (Danish: Nordsjælland) region to clarify the club was to represent both the region as well as the town in which the club is based. To reinforce the status as a regional team, a network of local football clubs from the surrounding area was created, consisting of around 66 teams, with the aim to highlight young talent in the region and bring it to national attention via FC Nordsjælland. The network is known as Fodbold Samarbejde Nordsjælland (FSN). The club's second year in the Superliga, first as Nordsjælland, struggled to improve on the previous year's outing. With its worst goal difference since turning professional, not one FCN player ended in the top ten goal scorers, fighting to avoid relegation for most of the season, ending the campaign in ninth place. The Wild Tiger fans, however, were rewarded with European football with the club's first appearance in the UEFA Cup; it beat Armenian team Shirak 6–0 on aggregate in the qualifying round, but were eliminated in the first round by Greek team Panionios. Christian Andersen was sacked at the end of the 2003–04 season, replaced by Johnny Petersen as head coach. The following two years under Johnny Petersen were spent avoiding relegation, with no success to speak of in either the Superliga or Danish Cup. Petersen's reign was not completely amiss, as he was noted for creating a good young team and the emergence of players Mads Junker and Anders Due. For the 2006–07 season, Morten Wieghorst was promoted from assistant to head coach, a position the former Celtic player would retain for five years. Wieghorst's first dilemma in charge of FCN was to fill the gap left by top scorer Mads Junker, sale to Dutch side Vitesse the previous winter. Morten Nordstrand came in on a free from nearby Lyngby after scoring 29 goals in the 1st Division that previous season. Nordstrand would go on to make an instant impact, topping the goal scorers charts for the first half of the 2006–07 season and earning himself a call up to the Denmark national team. Helping the club to a fifth-place finish, Nordstrand ended the season with 18 goals after appearing in every league match that season. Danish champions Copenhagen purchased the player at the end of the season for a then record 15 million Danish kroner, becoming the largest transfer fee ever paid for a player between two Danish clubs. With lower-than-average attendance and issues still arising from the Brixtofte scandal, chairman Allan Kim Pedersen confirmed there had been discussions to move the club north to Hillerød, where it would be able expand to other sports such as ice hockey and basketball. The move, however, never materialized. Nordsjælland would find itself in a similar position the following season, again having sold its star striker Martin Bernburg to Copenhagen. The team only managed a ninth-place finish, yet qualified for the UEFA Cup for the second time via the UEFA Respect Fair Play rankings. 2008–09 would become a good year for the Wild Tigers in terms of cup competitions, making it to the quarter-finals in the Danish Cup for the second time in its history, and improving on its previous European outing with wins over TVMK Tallinn and Queen of the South, though later being knocked out by Greek side Olympiacos 0–7 aggregate. In October 2008, Allan K. Pedersen sold FC Nordsjælland from AKP Holding to himself for a reported 500,000 Danish kroner, shortly before his holding company went bankrupt, a price Pedersen, however, denies. Following an investigation from his creditors, it was found that the sale was forced through without the bank's consent, and that the value for which the club was sold was too low, which ultimate reduced the finances the creators received for the sale. FCN was reevaluated to be worth 35 million kroner at the time of sale. The case has gone to the Supreme Court and is yet to be resolved; it speculated that it could take one-to-four years. The 2009–10 season saw Nordsjælland lift its first trophy, the Danish Cup. FCN was not drawn against another Superliga team until the quarter-final meeting with Silkeborg, where it won 3–1 in extra time. The team would go on to face Midtjylland in Nordsjælland's first cup final, winning in extra time 2–0 with goals from new signing Nicolai Stokholm and Bajram Fetai, and qualifying for European competition in the newly remodeled UEFA Europa League. The team would repeat this feat the following season, facing Midtjylland once again in the finals of the Danish Cup and winning the trophy for the second time with a 3–2 win. This would be Morten Wieghorst's last trophy with the Wild Tigers, however; he moved to manage the Denmark under-21 national team at the end of the 2010–11 campaign. Kasper Hjulmand was named Wieghorst's successor in June 2011, promoted from the coaching staff. In preparation for the 2011–12 season, the former Lyngby head coach brought in two Danish internationals in Mikkel Beckmann (from relegated Randers) and Patrick Mtiliga (on a free from Málaga). FCN sought to improve on the previous season's sixth-place finish and to defend its Danish Cup title for the second year running. It would go on to play in the Europa League for second year in a row, exiting the competition in the third qualifying round after losing to Sporting CP 2–1 aggregate, which had also eliminated Nordsjælland from Europe the previous season. left FCN started the new season in good form, peaking as high as second in the Superliga, and an undefeated run at home in all competitions until the 30 October, including an impressive 0–0 draw with Portuguese side Sporting CP, making the start of the 2011–12 campaign one of its best starts in recent years. For the first time in club history, a total of five players were called up to the Denmark national team to face Sweden and Finland in November: Mikkel Beckmann, Andreas Bjelland and debutantes Tobias Mikkelsen, Jesper Hansen and Jores Okore. FCN ended the season as Superliga champions for the first time in its history. right In 2012–13, for the first time FCN participated in the UEFA Champions League, where it was drawn into a difficult group alongside defending champions Chelsea, Serie A champions Juventus and Ukrainian Premier League champions Shakhtar Donetsk. FCN played all its home matches at the Danish national stadium, Parken. It gained one point from the group stage – playing 1–1 against Juventus at home thanks to a direct free-kick goal from Mikkel Beckmann.

The kempul is a set of pitched, hanging, knobbed gongs, often made of bronze, wood, and cords. Ranging from 19 cm to 25,4 cm (7 to 10 inches) in diameter, the kempul gong has a flat surface with a protruding knob at the center and is played by hitting the knob with the \\"soft end of a mallet.\\" \\"The wooden mallet used has a ball shape head with heavy padding on a short wooden handle. The number of kempul gongs present in a gamelan ensemble varies but, \\"although there can be two to ten kempul on one separate rack, it is common to have five kempul hanging on the same rack as the Gong ageng and gong siyem\\" (two larger gongs). ==Kempul in music== \\"Generally, the instruments in a gamelan orchestra may fall into the following three functional categories: # Instruments that delineate the structure of the piece; # Instruments that guide temporal flow of the music; # Instruments that carry melodies in both simple and elaborate forms\\" \\"Instruments in the first category include large and medium hanging gongs (Gong ageng and gong suwukan), small hanging gongs (kempul), large standing gongs (kenong), and a pair of small standing gongs (kethuk- kempyang).\\" \\"The role of the kempul is to divide the nongans, which are the contents of each part between strikes of a kenong.\\" \\"In the middle of the gamelan, the 'skeletal' melody called the balungan is played on bronze metallophones. The balungan is puntuated by the larger gongs (gong and kempul) and horizontally-mounted gongs (kenong, kethuk, and kempyang) at the back of the gamelan.\\" \\"The kempul, a middle voice gong, punctuates half way to the mid-points of the metric cycle, which is played by the kenong (the kettle gongs).\\" In all the central Javanese traditions, the pieces known as Ayak- ayakan, Srepegan, and Sampak are united by a single relationship between kempul and kenong: one kempul beat coinciding with every second kenong beat.\\" ==Tuning== \\"There are two racks of gongs in a gamelan orchestra because of the two gamelan scales or laras.\\" \\"These two tuning systems are called slendro and pelog, thus the full gamelan is actually a double set. Usually the slendro set faces the front and the pelog set the side.\\" The two sets are never played simultaneously. \\"The slendro tuning consists of five notes per octave and the five intervals consist of small and medium steps. The pelog has seven pitches per octave\\" \\"In the older ensembles of east Java, one usually finds only one kempul, tuned to a pitch 6 or pitch 5, and one Gong ageng, with no siyem or gong suwukan.

Born in Rożyszki (modern Rozsishky) near Uman' in Bracław Voivodship, Gonta served as a sotnik (captain) of Cossack household militia of Franciszek Salezy Potocki, the Voivode of Kiev, and commanded a small unit in the garrison of Uman since 1757. During the Koliivshchyna he was ordered to fight the approaching haidamaka forces of Maksym Zalizniak. Instead, he and his militia joined the rebels, and the joint forces captured and ravaged the town of Uman on June 21, 1768. In what became known as the Massacre of Uman, thousands of local Polish szlachta, Jews, Uniates and other people were slaughtered. After that, Gonta was proclaimed colonel and commanded the garrison of Uman. When the rebellion spread into the Ottoman Empire, robbed by detachment, sent by Gonta, Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia, dispatched a regiment of Don Cossacks fighting against Bar confederation to help Poland suppress the rebellion to prevent Ottomans from waging a war against Russia. The commander of the Russian unit, a certain Guriev, made the rebels believe he was siding with them for the joint trip against Bar confederation and managed to capture approximately 900 of them without a single shot. After that, Ivan Gonta was handed over to the Poles and was tried for high treason. Sentenced to death by grand Crown Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, he was then executed in the village of Serby (modern Gontivka) in the Podolian Voivodship. As an added measure, his body was partitioned and nailed to gallows in 14 towns of Podolia. Although largely non-notable during his life, after his death he became a hero of countless folk songs and legends that portrayed him as a hero and a martyr. He was immortalized in Taras Shevchenko's controversial epic poem Haidamaky though Gonta had never killed his Roman Catholic sons, because his wife and children were of Orthodox faith and in fact he had never initiated the massacre of Uman himself. == In popular culture == * Taras Shevchenko's epic poem «Haidamaky» dedicated to kolii including Gonta. ==External links== * Ivan Gonta at Encyclopedia of Ukraine == References == * Category:Cossack rebels Category:Zaporozhian Cossacks Category:18th-century Ukrainian people Category:1768 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Khrystynivka Raion Category:People from Bracław Voivodeship Category:Koliyivshchyna ","title":"Ivan Gonta"},{"id":"2568825","text":"Prof Moslem Bahadori Moslem Bahadori () (born 1927 in Mazandaran, Tonekabon, Iran) is a contemporary Iranian medical scientist, distinguished pathologist and a university lecturer.The Academy of Medical Sciences-Islamic Republic of Iran In 1973, Bahadori along with Averill Abraham Liebow, reported the first case of plasma cell granuloma, a benign tumor of the lung. ==Education and career== He studied medicine at medical school, Tehran University (1954), and specialized in pathology at the Department of Pathology, Tehran University (1957).

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Aerial view (1955) Founded in 1590 as les Hautes Montagnes d'Erguël by settlers from Valangin. In 1749 it was known as La Ferriere or Communauté des Montagnes de Saint-Imier. The village was owned by the Prince-Bishop of Basel and was part of the seigniory of Erguel. The municipal charter was created in the early 17th century and confirmed in 1623 and again in 1672. During the Thirty Years War the village was attacked and burned. Originally there was little land and no forests attached to the village. The lack of arable land and the resulting revenue made it very difficult for the village to meet their obligations. In 1767, the Prince- Bishop granted Erguel Castle and the surrounding lands to La Ferrière to hold as a fief. In 1806, the political municipality of La Ferrière inherited the castle and lands and in 1828 sold them to Sonvilier. After the 1797 French invasion the village became part of the parish of Renan in the French Department of Mont-Terrible. The parish was later transferred to the Department of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the region became part of the Canton of Bern, though La Ferrière remained part of the Renan parish until 1861. The village church was consecrated in 1864. During the 19th century the population grew rapidly due to watch and watch parts factories that opened in the village. Throughout the 20th century, the population has slowly declined. ==Geography== La Ferrière has an area of . Of this area, or 62.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 33.8% is forested.

Its ingredients typically include tomatoes, olive oil, olives, capers, and garlic, in addition to pasta. ==Origin== Various recipes in Italian cookbooks dating back to the 19th century describe pasta sauces very similar to a modern puttanesca sauce under different names. Among the earliest dates from 1844, when Ippolito Cavalcanti, in his Cucina teorico-pratica, included a recipe from popular Neapolitan cuisine, calling it Vermicelli all'oglio con olive capperi ed alici salse. After some sporadic appearances in other Neapolitan cookbooks, in 1931 the Touring Club Italiano's Guida gastronomica d'Italia lists it among the gastronomic specialties of Campania, calling it \\"Maccheroni alla marinara\\", although the proposed recipe is close to that of a modern puttanesca sauce. In Naples, this type of pasta sauce commonly goes under the name aulive e chiapparielle (olives and capers). The dish under its current name first appears in gastronomic literature in the 1960s. The earliest known mention of pasta alla puttanesca is in Raffaele La Capria’s Ferito a Morte (Mortal Wound), a 1961 Italian novel which mentions \\"spaghetti alla puttanesca come li fanno a Siracusa (spaghetti alla puttanesca as they make it in Syracuse)\\".The dictionary entry is cited in Jeremy Parzen, ‘The origins of Sugo alla puttanesca?’, Do Bianchi, 13 January 2008, an article which supplied a number of the sources used here. The sauce became popular in the 1960s, according to the Professional Union of Italian Pasta Makers.‘Sughi d’Italia: 1000 anni di pasta, 1000 anni di condimenti’ , Unione Industriali Pastai Italiani Nonetheless, the 1971 edition of the Cucchiaio d’argento (The Silver Spoon), one of Italy's most prominent cookbooks, has no recipe with the name puttanesca, but two recipes that are similar: The Neapolitan spaghetti alla partenopea, is made with anchovies and generous quantities of oregano; while spaghetti alla siciliana is distinguished by the addition of green peppers. Still again there is a Sicilian style popular around Palermo that includes olives, anchovies and raisins.Il nuovissimo cucchiaio d'argento, ed. by Antonia Monti Tedeschi, 6th edn (Editoriale Domus, 1971), pp. 220–221 In a 2005 article from Il Golfo—a daily newspaper serving the Italian islands of Ischia and Procida—Annarita Cuomo asserted that sugo alla puttanesca was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of Rancio Fellone, a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.Annarita Cuomo (17 February 2005). ‘Il sugo “alla puttanesca” nacque per caso ad Ischia, dall'estro culinario di Sandro Petti’. Il Golfo. Archived from the original on 13 August 2014 According to Cuomo, Petti's moment of inspiration came when—near closing one evening—Petti found a group of customers sitting at one of his tables. He was low on ingredients and told them he did not have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry, saying \\"Facci una puttanata qualsiasi,\\" meaning \\"throw together whatever.\\" Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some capers—the basic ingredients for the sugo, \\"So I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,\\" Petti told Cuomo. Later, Petti included this dish on his menu as spaghetti alla puttanesca. However, due to \\"puttana\\" meaning \\"whore\\" or \\"prostitute,\\" it has generated the theory that the dish was invented in one of many bordellos in Quartieri Spagnoli. ==Basic recipe== The sauce alone is called sugo alla puttanesca in Italian. Recipes may differ according to preferences; for instance, the Neapolitan version is prepared without anchovies, unlike the version popular in Lazio. Spices are sometimes added. In most cases, however, the sugo is a little salty (from the capers, olives, and anchovies) and quite fragrant (from the garlic). Traditionally, the sauce is served with spaghetti, although it is also paired with penne, bucatini, linguine, and vermicelli. Garlic and anchovies (omitted in the Neapolitan version) are sautéed in olive oil. Chopped chili peppers, olives, capers, diced tomatoes, and oregano are added along with salt and black pepper to taste. The cook then reduces this mixture by simmering and pours it over spaghetti cooked al dente. The final touch is a topping of parsley.Recipe on the site for the Accademia Italiana della Cucina ==In popular culture== The dish is featured in The Bad Beginning from the novel series Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events as the dish the Baudelaire children prepare at Count Olaf's house. The dish also features prominently in the movie based on the novels, as well as the Netflix original series. Count Olaf is very upset that they had not prepared roast beef for him instead. == See also == * Spaghetti dishes * Pasta dishes ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Italian cuisine Category:Neapolitan cuisine Category:Spaghetti dishes Category:Anchovy dishes Category:Olive dishes ","title":"Spaghetti alla puttanesca"},{"id":"2568872","text":"The Southern Daily Echo, more commonly known as the Daily Echo or simply The Echo, is a regional tabloid newspaper based in Southampton, covering the county of Hampshire in the United Kingdom.

In addition to his field investigations, he carried out experimental work in the laboratory and greenhouse, both at the Pikes Peak station and at Santa Barbara. ==Theory of vegetation change to climax community== From his observations of the vegetation of Nebraska and the western United States, Clements developed one of the most influential theories of vegetation development. Vegetation composition does not represent a permanent condition but gradually changes with time. Clements suggested that the development of vegetation can be understood as a unidirectional sequence of stages resembling the development of an individual organism. After a complete or partial disturbance, vegetation grows back (under ideal conditions) towards a stable\\" climax state,\\" which describes the vegetation best suited to the local conditions. Though any actual instance of vegetation might follow the ideal sequence towards stability, it can be interpreted in relation to that sequence, as a deviation from it due to non-ideal conditions. In these studies, he and R. Pound developed the widely-used method of sampling using quadrats around 1898. Clements's climax theory of vegetation dominated plant ecology during the first decades of the twentieth century, though it was criticized significantly by ecologists Henry Gleason and Arthur Tansley early on, and by Robert Whittaker mid-century, and largely fell out of favor. However, significant Clementsian trends in ecology re-emerged towards the end of the twentieth century. ==Community-unit view of vegetation types or plant communities== In his 1916 publication, Plant Succession, and his 1920 Plant Indicators, Clements metaphorically equated units of vegetation, (now called vegetation types or plant communities) with individual organisms. His observations were that some groups of species were repeatedly associated together (Association (ecology)). He is frequently said to have believed that some species were dependent on the group, and the group on that species (obligatory relationship), metaphorically as organs and the animal containing them mutually depend on each other. However, this interpretation has been challenged by the argument that Clements did not assume mutual dependence as an organizing principle of formations or plant communities.Kirchhoff, T. (2020). The myth of Frederic Clements’s mutualistic organicism, or: on the necessity to distinguish different concepts of organicism. History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences, 42(2), article 24. Clements observed little overlap in kinds of species from type to type, with many species confined to just a single type. Some plants were widespread over vegetation types, but the areas of geographical overlap (ecotones) was narrow. His view of a community as a distinct unit was challenged in 1926 by Henry Gleason, who viewed vegetation as a continuum, not a unit, with associations being merely coincidental, and that any support by observations or data of clusters of species as predicted by Clements' view was either an artifact of the observer's perception or a result of defective data analysis. ==Lamarckism== Clements was an advocate of neo-Lamarckian evolution. Ecologist Arthur Tansley wrote that because of his support for Lamarckism, Clements \\"never seemed to give proper weight to the results of modern genetical research.\\"Tansley, A. G. (1947). Obituary Notice: Frederic Edward Clements, 1874--1945. Journal of Ecology 34 (1): 194-196. Science historian Ronald C.

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Aerial view from 100 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) Renan is first mentioned in 1372 as Renens. The municipality was formerly known by its German name Rennen, however, that name is no longer used. The village was owned by the collegiate church of Saint-Imier which was part of the seigniory of Erguel under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Renan became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. A few years later, it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Renan was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Following an unsuccessful revolt in Neuchâtel in 1831, a number of the insurgents took refuge in Renan. Following the French Revolution of 1848, the people of the neighboring canton of Neuchâtel made preparations for a republican coup. A republican leader Ami Girard raised a body two hundred volunteers and on 1 March 1848 set out from Renan to join the Neuchâtel Revolution. By 8pm that evening, Neuchâtel Castle fell to the volunteers and on 5 March, ambassadors from Switzerland had recognized the new government and the Republic of Neuchatel was formed. The village was part of the parish of Erguel and converted to the Reformed faith along with the rest of the Erguel. In 1627 the Prince-Bishop approved the construction of a village church in Renan. It was completed in 1631 and was renovated in 1976-77. During the late 17th century the village economy was booming as the watch industry spread in the Saint-Imier valley. In 1874, the Biel-Les Convers railway connected the village to the national railway network. The Great Depression in the 1930s devastated the Swiss watch industry and the economy of Renan. However, the watch industry held on and grew once again after World War II. In the 1970s the watch industry was once again devastated and this time the local industry did not survive. At the beginning of the 21st century Renan's economy was dominated by agriculture. In 2005, the agricultural sector provided over one-third of all jobs in the municipality. ==Geography== Renan has an area of .

Of the agricultural land, 7.7% is used for growing crops and 37.0% is pastures and 14.8% is used for alpine pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. The municipality is located in the upper Saint-Imier valley. The high valley of Les Convers, in which marshlands the Suze takes its source is located on its territory. On 31 December 2009 District de Courtelary, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.

Uman was a well-fortified town that held a large garrison of Bar confederation troops under the command of Rafał Mładanowicz, the governor of Uman who joined Bar Confederation. This fact made Uman one of the primary targets of Koliyivschyna movement, and it is likely that the siege of Uman was planned well in advance probably even by Russian officers. Ivan Gonta, an officer in the private militia of the owner of Uman Count Franciszek Salezy Potocki (made up of Household Cossacks) was accused of connections with haidamaka by some people from the local Jewish community three months before the siege and long before the uprising. However, due to the lack of hard evidence and the sudden death of a star witness, no formal charges were made. Although Ivan Gonta was de facto the commander of all Uman cossacks not only of his unit of about 100 and he was not the most senior in their ranks but just he was the representative of the owner of Uman who had not supported the Bar Confederation. His participation was needed to justify the orders of Mladanovich and others who had betrayed the owner by joining Bar confederation and giving up the city to it. The noblemen learnt from letters of the owner to Gonta captured by them that Gonta would become a Polish nobleman and the owner of villages if Gonta makes some important mission according to the order of the owner during the siege of Uman. In early June 1768 the Ukrainian rebels under the command of Maksym Zalizniak marched on Uman after capturing Cherkasy, Korsun and Kaniv. As Zalizniak openly encouraged the slaughter of various national minorities irrespective of their faith for exception of Poles, Jews, Romanians to be used for mixed marriages with Russians (as Ukrainians called themselves that time) after the conversion of Jews and Poles into the Orthodox faith and in fact Poles and Jews were killed as well, the town was filled with refugees. A large camp filled with Polish nobility and their private militia, regular soldiers and Jewish refugees was positioned outside the city walls. Bar Confederation troops outnumbered the forces of adult rebels, and therefore it was decided that some of the forces should guard the ramparts while Gonta and his cossack unit and all other Uman household Cossacks would meet the Haidamakas in an open battle. However, when Gonta met Zalizniak's units Gonta openly declared that he was going to join Koliyivschyna. Some sources claim that the formal commanders of two household Cossack regiments were sent by Gonta back to Uman, although the authenticity of the story is highly disputed. The united troops razed the encampment on June 14 and tried to penetrate the ramparts by concealing the rebels behind the backs of Gonta's household Cossacks. However, the attempt failed, and so the siege started on June 17. The very first day the large number of Ukrainians deserted the ranks of Polish forces and joined the rebels when the city was surrounded. But the majority of Ukrainians including the students of local Eastern Catholic seminary remained loyal to Mladanovich and participated in the defense of the city. After three days of the siege the city fell to Zalizniak in spite of a courageous defense in which the Jews also played an active role. Though the city had been prepared for battles on the streets Mladanovich and other local Bar Confederation leaders opened the gates to Zalizniak after the penetration of some Gonta Cossacks into the city thinking that Gonta represents the owner of Uman, the king of Poland and official authorities and it is the will of the owner that he executes. In reality not Zaliznyak but a Russian officer was to be the leader, but this officer died just before the rebellion and gave all ducats and military plans to Zaliznyak as a honest Orthdox monk and the former Zaporozhian Cossack who was present during the death of this Russian officer. After the city had been taken, all inhabitants had been disarmed and Uman wine belonging to the owner of Uman had been consumed by rebels a violent and bloody massacre (where many noblemen including Mładanowicz were killed but his daughter and son were saved by Gonta being their godfather) took place. The previously disarmed by rebels Jews then gathered in the synagogues, where they were led by Leib Shargorodski and Moses Menaker in an attempt to defend themselves, but they were destroyed by cannon fire and knives. Most of the remaining Jews in the city were subsequently killed. Gonta saved Jewish and Pole children and those who survived then after the three days of massacre. Gonta declared that 33,000 people had been killed and he could not save them and it was his guilt. According to earlier estimates the number of Poles and Jews massacred was 20,000.Jewish Encyclopedia The estimate given by Gonta for self-embellishment during his trial was 33,000. 13,000 could be Ukrainians and together with children old-believers, Greeks, Moslems, Armenians etc. These numbers are considered exaggerated by the modern historiography, with numbers of Poles and Jews who were killed in the “massacre of Uman” estimated at ca. 2,000 only, other victims representing Ukrainians and minorities.Paul Robert Magocsi \\"A History of Ukraine\\", Univ. of Washington Press 1996, p.300 ==See also== *List of massacres in Poland *List of massacres in Ukraine ==References== ==Further reading== *Simon Dubnow, Israel Friedlaender, History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Avotaynu Inc, 2000, , Print, p.88+ Category:Koliyivshchyna Category:Conflicts in 1768 Category:Cossack uprisings Category:1768 in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1760s in Ukraine Category:Poland–Ukraine military relations Category:Jewish Polish history Category:Rebellions in Ukraine Category:Massacres in Ukraine Category:18th century in the Zaporozhian Host ","title":"Massacre of Uman"},{"id":"2568917","text":"Romont is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). The Observatoire Astronomique de Mont-Soleil is located above the village. ==History== Saint-Imier is first mentioned in 884 as cella de sancti Himerii. The municipality was formerly known by its German name St. Immer, however, that name is no longer used. Its name refers to Imerius of Immertal, a 7th-century saint. According to the legend of St. Imerius, he settled in the valley as a hermit in the late 6th or early 7th century on a piece of land that bishop Marius of Lausanne gave him as a present. In 884 a cella (probably a church, farm and monastery) was mentioned on the site. Archeological excavations around the former Church of St. Martin indicate that a village grew up around the cella around the same time. Two of the 142 graves from the church have been dated to the Early Middle Ages and the church was rebuilt at least three times before the 14th or early 15th century. In 884 the cella with its outbuildings belonged to Moutier-Grandval Abbey. In 999, the Abbey donated Saint-Imier and a number of surrounding villages to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. In 1264, the Bishop appointed Otto of Arguel (or Erguel) as the vogt over the Saint-Imier valley fief. Otto raised the valley to become a seigniory and parish of the Diocese of Basel. By the end of the 15th century, Saint-Imier included the villages of Villeret, Sonvilier, Renan and La Ferriere. Even though the physical valley was owned by the Bishop of Basel, religiously it was part of the Diocese of Lausanne. The Saint-Imier parish was probably founded in the 9th or 10th century. A village chapel was first mentioned in 968, with the parish church of St. Martin first appearing in the records in 1228. The church of St. Martin was later rebuilt in the gothic style. Another church, the collegiate church was built in the 11th century, probably under the direction of the Bishop of Basel. In 1530, Biel encouraged Saint-Imier to embrace the Protestant Reformation and convert to the new religion. The collegiate church before the parish church for the new Reformed parish. Over the following centuries, the Church of St. Martin was used less and less until it was demolished in 1828. In 1814 the town and the surrounding valley transferred from Lausanne to the Diocese of Basel. Catholic church services resumed in Saint-Imier in 1857 and in 1866 the neo- gothic Church of St. Martin was built. In 1912 a Christian Catholic church was built in the town. The Hôtel de la maison de Ville in Saint Imier. The Anti- authoritarian International was founded there on a congress taking place on September 15/16, 1872. In 1792 Théodore Frédéric Louis Liomin, the vogt or bailiff of Saint-Imier, threw his support behind the revolutionary movement that was sweeping the region. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Saint-Imier became part of the French Département of Mont- Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Saint-Imier was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. During the 19th century the anti- authoritarian or anarchist movement gained a foothold in the region. In 1872, the Jura Federation, which had strong support in Saint-Imier, organized a congress in Saint-Imier at which the Anti-authoritarian International Workingmen's Association or Anti-authoritarian International was founded. During the 18th century the inhabitants of the valley gradually gave up agriculture in favor of more lucrative jobs in the watch and lace-making industries. The first watch parts workshop opened in the 1720s and the industry continued to expand throughout the 19th century. By 1817 there were about 200 workers employed in either watchmaking workshops or small shops at home. The small scale workshops were replaced by large factory work, when Longines opened a factory in the town in 1867. By the end of the year, 1,600 people were employed in 47 watchmaking companies. Because the town's economy was so dependent on watchmaking, the economic crisis of the 1930s and the 1970s hit Saint-Imier hard. By the beginning of the 21st century, there were about ten watchmaking companies and the economy had diversified to include dental and medical technology and meteorology. View of Saint Imier and of Mont Soleil Portions of the town were destroyed by fire in 1839, 1843 and 1856. A hospital opened in Saint-Imier in 1856. In 1874 the town was connected to the Swiss rail network. The town's infrastructure was modernized early, before 1900 it had municipal water, gas and electricity. Saint-Imier has grown into a regional education center. The town's secondary school opened in 1860, followed by a watchmaker's school in 1866. The watch-maker's school was expanded into a machinist's school in 1896 and a technical vocational school in 1961. In 1976 it became a school of engineering and in 2005 it was integrated into the Haute école Arc/Hochschule Arc. A number of other schools opened in the town including the Bernese Jura Music School (1981), a vocational and technical school (1997), and a training center for health professionals (1993).

It is located in the French- speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Sonceboz-Sombeval is first mentioned in 866 as Summavallis. In 1179 it was mentioned as Sommeval and in 1303 it was Suntzelbo. Its location at the foot of the historic Pierre Pertuis pass (in operation since the Roman era) made the villages an important stopping point and transportation hub. The Petinesca Roman road ran to the east of Sonceboz before it crossed the Jura mountains. The ruins of a 4th- century Roman settlement have been discovered at the Le Châtillon ridge. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, a medieval settlement developed over the Roman settlement. In 999 Moutier-Grandval Abbey gave the local farms and the Summavallis chapel to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The Prince-Bishop assigned Moutier-Grandval Abbey to administer the village as the bailiff and the parish priest (placing the Abbey over the secular and spiritual needs of the village). This organization continued until Sonceboz and Sombeval accepted the Protestant Reformation in 1530. After the Reformation, the villages were under the secular administration of Erguel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Sonceboz-Sombeval became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Sonceboz-Sombeval was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The Chapel of St. Agatha in Sombeval became the parish church for the Sombeval parish in the 13th century. It was rebuilt in 1737 and again in 1866. Decades after the villagers accepted the new Reformed faith, in 1590 they became part of the Corgémont parish. They remained part of that parish until 1931. Throughout the Early Modern period Sonceboz remained a small hamlet with only a few houses dependent on the larger village of Sombeval. However, in the early 18th century Sonceboz became an important staging post for trade over the pass. Beginning in 1849 the growth of the watch parts industry brought workers to the villages and forcing them to expand. In 1874 the Biel-Les Convers and Sonceboz-Tavannes railway lines opened and forever changed the character of the village. While Sombeval retained much of its rural character, the population and industry in Sonceboz exploded. With the population growing the two formerly independent villages merged as they physically grew together. In 1936 the watch parts manufacturer Société industrielle de Sonceboz built a factory in the village. In 1978, the flooring manufacturer Bienna SA built a factory in the municipality, which strengthened the industrial sector. By 2005, over two-thirds of the jobs in the municipality are manufacturing. ==Geography== Sonceboz-Sombeval Aerial view (1950) Sonceboz-Sombeval has an area of .

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Ruins of Erguel Castle Aerial view (1950) Sonvilier is first mentioned in 1298 as Sunuilier. In 1307 it was mentioned as Sonvelier. Erguel Castle, now in ruins, was built south-east of the village in the 11th century. The castle was the center of government for the lands that the Lords of Arguel (or Erguel) ruled. In 1264 Otto von Erguel, who at the time lived in Basel, ceded the lands to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. In return the bishop granted him lands in Alsace. Under the Prince-Bishop the Erguel lands, including Sonvilier, became part of the seigniory of Erguel. During the 13th and 14th century a local noble family was mentioned in Sonvilier. During the 16th century the municipality was the largest in the Erguel and was home to a half dozen mills that were held in fief to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Sonvilier became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Sonvilier was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Hôtel de la Balance in Sonvilier, a section of the Jura Federation was founded here on November 12, 1871. Two social movements of the 19th century originated in Sonvilier. In 1843 Fritz Marchand founded the philanthropist L'Union Society. Nearly three decades later, in 1871, a chapter of the Fédération jurassienne (Jura Federation), a federalist and anarchist section of the International Workingmen's Association, was formed in the village. The Jura Federation leader, Mikhail Bakunin, held three conferences in the village during 1871. Religiously it was part of the parish of Saint-Imier. A Reformed parish church was built in the village in 1832. A Mennonite chapel was built in La Chaux-d'Abel in 1905. During the 18th and 19th centuries the local economy grew with small scale home work watchmaking and lace making. A number of small workshops provided watch parts for final assembly in other towns in the region. The financial crises of the 1930s and 1970s hit the watch making industry hard and many workshops went out of business. In 2005, only 9% of the jobs in the municipality are in manufacturing, while almost half are in agriculture. In 1874 the completion of the Biel-Les Convers railroad connected Sonvilier into the national rail network. In 1895, the canton acquired the Le Pré aux Boeuf farm and converted it into a boys boarding school. In 1931 they converted the school into a home for people in need. ==Geography== Cattle bridge over a local road in La Chaux-d'Abel Sonvilier has an area of .

Olsen for Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. The series is a parody of buddy cop films and television series such as Starsky & Hutch, and stars the voices of Jon Glaser as Stroker and Timothy \\"Speed\\" Levitch as Hoop. It contains the talking car element of the 1982 series Knight Rider, in \\"C.A.R.R.\\", voiced by Paul Christie. The names of the lead characters may be based on two Burt Reynolds characters, from Stroker Ace and Hooper. Stroker and Hoop premiered on August 1, 2004, and ended on December 25, 2005, with 13 episodes. ==Plot== Stroker and Hoop are a pair of private investigators from Los Angeles, who act and dress as if it is still the 1970s. In spite of each man's high opinion of himself, they're both completely inept losers: Stroker fancies himself a suave ladies man, but is generally unpopular and perceived by virtually every woman he meets as a repulsive chauvinist; and Hoop considers himself a crime-solving ace and master of disguise, when in fact he's a gullible nerd and all of his disguises are failures. Their only \\"advantage\\" over their competition is C.A.R.R., a talking AMC Pacer with its own neurotic personality. Because of their abysmal track record and less-than-stellar capabilities, the two men eke out livings solving crimes for people who can't afford to hire more competent detectives. Invariably, their attempts to solve a crime result in bloodshed, violence, and thousands of dollars worth of property damage. A recurring plot point of the series was to take myths and fantasies (such as mind control and Santa Claus) and make them real in an otherwise ordinary setting. Stroker often doubts the existence of these occurrences. ==Characters== * John Strockmeyer, aka Stroker (Jon Glaser) - An ex-mattress salesman turned private investigator, Stroker is largely apathetic to his job; he only enjoys it because it allows him to shoot people, and because it brings him into contact with dozens of promiscuous women on a daily basis (Although those women usually want nothing to do with him). Although he considers himself an excellent detective and suave ladies' man, Stroker is actually a failure and a deadbeat; his wife left him and gained sole custody of their son, Keith, and Stroker's own incompetence and negligence resulted in his former partner, Jermaine, is murdered while working a case (Stroker borrowed the magazine from Jermaine's gun and forgot to tell him). Once in a while, Stroker will have a moment of being a genuine detective (such as successfully deducing the plot behind the lottery ring run by the ghosts of Christmas past (Jermaine), present and future), although these moments are incredibly rare. An incompetent detective, Stroker often meets with opportunities while on a case that would provide a more lucrative career. An advertising campaign pitched for a fabric softener was chosen over others to be shown during the Super Bowl. In another instance, despite being brainwashed, Stroker and Hoop were part of an insanely popular pornographic video series. * Hoop Schwartz (Speed Levitch) - Stroker's ever-optimistic and nerdy partner. Although he considers himself brilliant and a master of disguise, Hoop is bare of average intelligence (though Stroker is no genius himself), and his disguises are poorly conceived and do nothing to hide his face. Unlike Stroker, Hoop is a detective because he loves the line of work. However, Hoop eventually reveals that he has never fired a gun with the intent to actually hit his target, that he always aimed and fired above the target's head. In a bit of dramatic irony, Stroker, who spends most of his time trying to bed women, fails miserably at it, while Hoop, who most often comes across as asexual, often finds himself having sex with gorgeous women who throw themselves at him (usually for their own selfish needs). At one point he gains ninja skills, but as revealed in a later episode, they 'rusted' from disuse. When he isn't solving crimes, Hoop lives with his elderly mother and participates in dinner theatre. * C.A.R.R. (Paul Christie) - Stroker and Hoop's primary mode of transportation, C.A.R.R. is a talking car that was state-of-the-art twenty years ago. He enjoys talk radio and car washes, perhaps a little too much. He is also vengeful, paranoid, a bit racist, and often demonstrates effeminate behavior and, in spite of his otherwise masculine personality. He is a parody of Michael Knight's car KITT from Knight Rider and the name \\"C.A.R.R.\\" is a parody of \\"K.A.R.R.\\", KITT's \\"evil\\" prototype. C.A.R.R. is painted to somewhat resemble the Ford Torino from Starsky & Hutch. * Double Wide (Curtis Armstrong) - Ostensibly C.A.R.R.'s creator. A mechanic who spends his copious free time inventing bizarre things. He is a pornography connoisseur and can speak Spanish. Despite the fact that Stroker owes him countless thousands of dollars, Double Wide remains loyal to Stroker and Hoop out of a sense of duty (Stroker used to sell mattresses with Double Wide's brother). * Coroner Rick (Gary Anthony Williams) - The county coroner on the show, who often serves as a source of information for the main characters. Coroner Rick is a good friend of Stroker and Hoop, and even willing to hide evidence that would get them tried for murder. He has a knack for making crude jokes from an otherwise unfortunate and tragic event, sometimes with the victim still conscious. Rick occasionally solves the actual crime in the episode but is generally fine with Stroker and Hoop taking the credit. * Keith (Mary Birdsong) - Stroker's 10-year-old son. Lives with his mother, Angel Jimenez and has a strained relationship with Stroker who mixes attention with sheer neglect, resulting in moments where Keith genuinely loathes him. Keith has demonstrated bravery, such as standing up to a murderous ninja. ==Episodes== ===Planned conclusion=== Following the show's cancellation, creators Casper and Jeff made a posting to the Adult Swim blog outlining what would have happened in the second-season premiere. The episode would have opened with the revelation that Stroker and Hoop died in the crash and were sent to the afterlife; Hoop, specifically, was sent to a section of Hell reserved for lettuce, on a technicality. C.A.R.R.'s brain and one hubcap survived the crash. Double Wide also survived the crash but ended up in the burn ward of the hospital, where he received visions of Stroker and Hoop in the afterlife. Trying to save them, Double Wide with Keith's help puts himself on ice to temporarily \\"kill\\" himself, but is stopped by doctors at the last minute. To save Stroker and Hoop, Double Wide shoots himself and Coroner Rick. The two men then travel to the afterlife where they meet Stroker's father, a janitor in limbo, and Suko from episode six. A series of events leads to the death of God. God's temporary absence from Heaven – a technicality stipulates that it takes 20 minutes for God's soul to return to Heaven – allows all the main characters, including Stroker's father, to return to Earth along with a large number of others who were also in Heaven. ==Cancellation== In February 2006, Les Harper, head animator on the show, announced via AdultSwim.com that the show has not been greenlit for a second season and will therefore not continue, leaving the show on a cliffhanger ending. It was stated by the creators both on the Adult Swim message board and the employee blog. The blog entry was on February 10.http://fc.adultswim.com/Community/EmployeeBlog?userId=&year;=2006&month;=2&day;=10 The creators will continue to work with Williams Street regardless of the cancellation.

The station is owned by the Riverside Local Board of Education in Logan County. ==History== WDEQ-FM signed on the air on June 4, 1969, three days after the first FM radio station in Logan County, WPKO-FM which was then known as WOGM-FM, a sister station to the former WOHP (AM), subsequently WTOO (AM) and currently WBLL (AM). The station broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 100 watts according to FCC records and the Radio-Locator website (see below). The original WDEQ first took to the air at 91.1 MHz as a ten watt operation before moving to its current frequency. For most of its history, WDEQ has operated only throughout the curricular school year during normal class times with the exception of Riverside High School sports coverage and some occasional specialty programs in the evening, as is the case with many high school-owned stations with a student air staff. Prior to WDEQ's move to its current frequency, WDEQ operated briefly at 103.1 MHz to avoid interference to and/or from the audio signal of WSYX-TV (formerly WTVN-TV) in Columbus (see reference below) and its proximity to neighboring WYSO 91.3 in Yellow Springs. WUHS at Urbana High School in Urbana, Ohio (defunct since 1989) operated with ten watts at 91.7 FM. After WUHS went dark, the 91.7 frequency was applied for by the local school district. As all analog television station transmitters left the air in June 2009 in favor of digital channels (including WSYX) interference from Channel 6 is no longer an issue. After a few weeks hiatus of being off the air, WDEQ-FM returned to the air on Tuesday October 28, 2008 at first with a big band format and then beginning in 2009 with an oldies format, operating with extended hours during the curricular school year. WDEQ was also operating with reduced power using its secondary transmitter, while its main transmitter was awaiting repairs. Its studio and transmitter are still located at Riverside High School. For a brief time, WDEQ operated at 103.1 in the early 1990s when the former WUHS frequency became available. The Riverside Board of Education continues to own the station, but is currently off the air since March 2010 for unknown reasons. From October 2008 until March 2010, WDEQ was programmed and managed by Gene Kirby on behalf of its owner. He also programs WRPO-LP, 93.5 MHz in Russells Point on behalf of its owner, the Village of Russells Point which formerly aired a format of big band and adult standards before it switched to smooth jazz in March 2008. In May 2009, WRPO announced a change to an oldies format. WDEQ under the branding \\"Q-91,7 FM\\" likewise aired a similar continuous oldies format during school times from October 2009 until March 2010 but aired no announcements or other programs. WDEQ remains a non-commercial and educational radio station, so no commercial announcements are aired. However donations by listeners and underwriting by local businesses are encouraged. To this day, WDEQ remains off the air and is not known at this time when it will return to the air. WVXU 91.7 in Cincinnati can be received in some areas outside of WDEQ's 100 watt signal on some high quality car radios. ==External links== * WDEQ information from REC Networks site * Official Website * Riverside High School website DEQ Category:Logan County, Ohio Category:Radio stations established in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in Ohio ","title":"WDEQ-FM"},{"id":"2568963","text":"The Hamiltonian cycle in the Cayley graph of the symmetric group generated by the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm inversion sets (sets of pairs of elements out of their natural order), inversion vectors, and inversion numbers The inversion sets form a gray code, thus also the inversion vectors (sums of the triangles' ascending diagonals) and inversion numbers. The numbers on the left are the permutations' reverse colexicographic indices (compare list in natural order) and form row 4 of triangle The inversion sets of permutations 12 places apart from each other are complements. Wheel diagram of all permutations of length n=4 generated by the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm, where each permutation is color-coded (1=blue, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=red). The Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm or Johnson-Trotter algorithm, also called plain changes, is an algorithm named after Hugo Steinhaus, Selmer M. Johnson and Hale F. Trotter that generates all of the permutations of n elements. Each permutation in the sequence that it generates differs from the previous permutation by swapping two adjacent elements of the sequence. Equivalently, this algorithm finds a Hamiltonian cycle in the permutohedron. This method was known already to 17th-century English change ringers, and calls it \\"perhaps the most prominent permutation enumeration algorithm\\". As well as being simple and computationally efficient, it has the advantage that subsequent computations on the permutations that it generates may be sped up because these permutations are so similar to each other.. ==Recursive structure== The sequence of permutations for a given number n can be formed from the sequence of permutations for n − 1 by placing the number n into each possible position in each of the shorter permutations. When the permutation on n − 1 items is an even permutation (as is true for the first, third, etc., permutations in the sequence) then the number n is placed in all possible positions in descending order, from n down to 1; when the permutation on n − 1 items is odd, the number n is placed in all the possible positions in ascending order., section 3. Thus, from the single permutation on one element, :1 one may place the number 2 in each possible position in descending order to form a list of two permutations on two elements, :1 2 :2 1 Then, one may place the number 3 in each of three different positions for these two permutations, in descending order for the first permutation 1 2, and then in ascending order for the permutation 2 1: :1 2 3 :1 3 2 :3 1 2 :3 2 1 :2 3 1 :2 1 3 At the next level of recursion, the number 4 would be placed in descending order into , in ascending order into , in descending order into , etc. The same placement pattern, alternating between descending and ascending placements of n, applies for any larger value of n. In this way, each permutation differs from the previous one either by the single-position-at-a- time motion of n, or by a change of two smaller numbers inherited from the previous sequence of shorter permutations. In either case this difference is just the transposition of two adjacent elements. When the first and final elements of the sequence, also, differ in only two adjacent elements (the positions of the numbers 1 and 2), as may be shown by induction. Although this sequence may be generated by a recursive algorithm that constructs the sequence of smaller permutations and then performs all possible insertions of the largest number into the recursively-generated sequence, the actual Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm avoids recursion, instead computing the same sequence of permutations by an iterative method. There is an equivalent and conceptually somewhat simpler definition of the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter ordering of permutations via the following greedy algorithm: We start with the identity permutation 1\\\\;2\\\\;\\\\ldots\\\\;n. Now we repeatedly transpose the largest possible entry with the entry to its left or right, such that in each step, a new permutation is created that has not been encountered in the list of permutations before. For example, in the case n=3 we start with 123, then we flip 3 with its left neighbor and get 132. We then flip 3 with its left neighbor 1, as flipping 3 with its right neighbor 2 would yield again 123, which we have seen before, so we arrive at 312, etc. The direction of the transposition (left or right) is always uniquely determined in this algorithm. ==Algorithm== As described by , the algorithm for generating the next permutation from a given permutation π performs the following steps *For each i from 1 to n, let xi be the position where the value i is placed in permutation π. If the order of the numbers from 1 to i − 1 in permutation π defines an even permutation, let yi = xi − 1; otherwise, let yi = xi + 1\\\\. *Find the largest number i for which yi defines a valid position in permutation π that contains a number smaller than i. Swap the values in positions xi and yi. When no number i can be found meeting the conditions of the second step of the algorithm, the algorithm has reached the final permutation of the sequence and terminates. This procedure may be implemented in O(n) time per permutation. gives an alternative implementation of an iterative algorithm for the same sequence, in lightly commented ALGOL 60 notation. Because this method generates permutations that alternate between being even and odd, it may easily be modified to generate only the even permutations or only the odd permutations: to generate the next permutation of the same parity from a given permutation, simply apply the same procedure twice.. ==Even's speedup== A subsequent improvement by Shimon Even provides an improvement to the running time of the algorithm by storing additional information for each element in the permutation: its position, and a direction (positive, negative, or zero) in which it is currently moving (essentially, this is the same information computed using the parity of the permutation in Johnson's version of the algorithm). Initially, the direction of the number 1 is zero, and all other elements have a negative direction: :1 −2 −3 At each step, the algorithm finds the greatest element with a nonzero direction, and swaps it in the indicated direction: :1 −3 −2 If this causes the chosen element to reach the first or last position within the permutation, or if the next element in the same direction is greater than the chosen element, the direction of the chosen element is set to zero: :3 1 −2 After each step, all elements greater than the chosen element (which previously had direction zero) have their directions set to indicate motion toward the chosen element. That is, positive for all elements between the start of the permutation and the chosen element, and negative for elements toward the end. Thus, in this example, after the number 2 moves, the number 3 becomes marked with a direction again: :+3 2 1 The remaining two steps of the algorithm for n = 3 are: :2 +3 1 :2 1 3 When all numbers become unmarked, the algorithm terminates. This algorithm takes time O(i) for every step in which the greatest number to move is n − i + 1\\\\. Thus, the swaps involving the number n take only constant time; since these swaps account for all but a 1/n fraction of all of the swaps performed by the algorithm, the average time per permutation generated is also constant, even though a small number of permutations will take a larger amount of time. A more complex loopless version of the same procedure allows it to be performed in constant time per permutation in every case; however, the modifications needed to eliminate loops from the procedure make it slower in practice.; ; . ==Geometric interpretation== The set of all permutations of n items may be represented geometrically by a permutohedron, the polytope formed from the convex hull of n! vectors, the permutations of the vector (1,2,...n). Although defined in this way in n-dimensional space, it is actually an (n − 1)-dimensional polytope; for example, the permutohedron on four items is a three-dimensional polyhedron, the truncated octahedron. If each vertex of the permutohedron is labeled by the inverse permutation to the permutation defined by its vertex coordinates, the resulting labeling describes a Cayley graph of the symmetric group of permutations on n items, as generated by the permutations that swap adjacent pairs of items. Thus, each two consecutive permutations in the sequence generated by the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm correspond in this way to two vertices that form the endpoints of an edge in the permutohedron, and the whole sequence of permutations describes a Hamiltonian path in the permutohedron, a path that passes through each vertex exactly once. If the sequence of permutations is completed by adding one more edge from the last permutation to the first one in the sequence, the result is instead a Hamiltonian cycle.See, e.g., section 11 of . ==Relation to Gray codes== A Gray code for numbers in a given radix is a sequence that contains each number up to a given limit exactly once, in such a way that each pair of consecutive numbers differs by one in a single digit. The n! permutations of the n numbers from 1 to n may be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the n! numbers from 0 to n! − 1 by pairing each permutation with the sequence of numbers ci that count the number of positions in the permutation that are to the right of value i and that contain a value less than i (that is, the number of inversions for which i is the larger of the two inverted values), and then interpreting these sequences as numbers in the factorial number system, that is, the mixed radix system with radix sequence (1,2,3,4,...). For instance, the permutation (3,1,4,5,2) would give the values c1 = 0, c2 = 0, c3 = 2, c4 = 1, and c5 = 1\\\\. The sequence of these values, (0,0,2,1,1), gives the number : Consecutive permutations in the sequence generated by the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm have numbers of inversions that differ by one, forming a Gray code for the factorial number system.; . More generally, combinatorial algorithms researchers have defined a Gray code for a set of combinatorial objects to be an ordering for the objects in which each two consecutive objects differ in the minimal possible way. In this generalized sense, the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm generates a Gray code for the permutations themselves. ==History== The algorithm is named after Hugo Steinhaus, Selmer M. Johnson and Hale F. Trotter. Johnson and Trotter discovered the algorithm independently of each other in the early 1960s. A book by Steinhaus, originally published in 1958 and translated into English in 1963, describes a related puzzle of generating all permutations by a system of particles, each moving at constant speed along a line and swapping positions when one particle overtakes another. No solution is possible for n > 3, because the number of swaps is far fewer than the number of permutations, but the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm describes the motion of particles with non-constant speeds that generate all permutations. Outside of mathematics, the same method was known for much longer as a method for change ringing of church bells: it gives a procedure by which a set of bells can be rung through all possible permutations, changing the order of only two bells per change. These so-called \\"plain changes\\" were recorded as early as 1621 for four bells, and a 1677 book by Fabian Stedman lists the solutions for up to six bells. More recently, change ringers have abided by a rule that no bell may stay in the same position for three consecutive permutations; this rule is violated by the plain changes, so other strategies that swap multiple bells per change have been devised.; . ==See also== * Heap's algorithm * Fisher–Yates shuffle ==Notes== ==References== *. *.

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1931) ==History== Tramelan is first mentioned in 1179 as Trameleins. The municipality was formerly known by its German name Tremlingen, however, that name is no longer used. During the Middle Ages the collegiate church of Saint-Imier was the major landholder in Tramelan. Politically, the villages were part of the seigniory of Erguel under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. From the 13th century until the mid 15th century there was a local noble family that ruled in Tramelan, probably as a fief under the Prince-Bishop. The village of Tramelan- le-Bas was first mentioned in 1334 while Tramelan-le-Haut appears in documents in 1358. In 1481, 1543 and 1581 the two villages met together to officially define their mutual border. In 1686, immigrants from Neuchâtel established the village of Mont-Tramelan. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Tramelan became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Tramelan was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Tramelan's village church was controlled by the Archbishop of Besançon and so formed an enclave in the diocese of Basel. In 1530, the villages accepted the Protestant Reformation and transferred their allegiance to Basel. In 1839, the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt in 1843-44 and renovated in 1958 and enlarged in 2000. The Catholic Church of Saint-Michel was built in 1910. In 1884 a narrow gauge railway connected Tramelan to Tavannes and in 1913 it was extended to Le Noirmont. At the beginning of the 18th century, the watch making industry slowly moved into Tramelan, eventually transforming the villages into an industrial center. In 1896, there were about 2,500 factory and home workers involved in the industry. The engineering and machining expertise gained from the watch industry allowed Tramelan to diversify into other manufacturing in the 20th century. By 1958 there were 75 manufacturing companies with around 1,400 workers. During the economic crisis of the 1970s, demand for watches disappeared and many workshops and factories were forced to close, leading to a population decline. One of the largest factories, which had opened in 1903 and was acquired by Longines in 1961, closed in 1983. However, by the late 1990s the watch industry had rebounded and watch part plants and workshops reopened. In 2005, just over 40% of the jobs in the municipality were in manufacturing. ==Geography== Part of Tramelan and the surrounding hills Tramelan has an area of .

On 1 January 2014 the former municipalities of Vauffelin and Plagne merged into the new municipality of Sauge.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 13 December 2014 ==History== Ruins of a Roman watchtower at Rondchâtel Vauffelin and its parish is first mentioned in the Lausanne Chartular of 1228 as Vualfelim. It was formerly known by its German names Füglistal or Füglisthal though this name is no longer used. The village of Frinvillier was first mentioned in 1393 as Frunwelier. Frinvillier was located at the intersection of two important Roman roads, one leading from Petinesca (now Studen) over the Pierre Pertuis pass to Augusta Raurica (near Augst) and the road from Eburodunum (now Yverdon) over the Plateau de Diesse to Salodurum (Solothurn). A watch tower was built on at Rondchâtel to guard the road. In 1364, Count Thierstein granted the patronage rights of the village church to the Church of St. Benedict in Biel. During the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era it was part of the seigniory of Erguel under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Vauffelin became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Vauffelin was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Vauffelin converted to the new Reformed faith in 1530, when Biel adopted the new faith. Originally the pastor of Orvin supported the church in Vauffelin. After 1798 the pastor in Péry took over that responsibility. In 1839 the Vauffelin parish was created with Romont. The parish was originally administered by a deacon, but it received its own priest in 1860. The church was built in 1715-16 and renovated in 1932-34 and again in 1983. In 2010, Vauffelin, Péry-La Heutte and Orvin joined the parish of Rondchâtel. During the 1970s the village population increased as commuters who worked in Biel moved into the village. In 1971, the villages of Vauffelin, Romont and Frinvillier formed a school district. ==Geography== Suze river canal in Frinvillier Before the merger, Vauffelin had a total area of .

A right-handed relief pitcher, he played Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1959 and 1963 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Houston Colt .45s. Umbricht was born in Chicago but grew up in Georgia. He started his professional career in 1953, making the majors in 1959. Over the next seasons, he alternated between teams, playing for the Pirates and that team's farm system. Umbricht was drafted by the Colt .45s in 1962, and became one of the National League's top relief pitchers. Diagnosed with malignant melanoma in his right leg in March 1963, his comeback to baseball following surgery made national headlines and encouraged research on the disease. He spent the 1963 season as a relief pitcher, sometimes in excruciating pain. Umbricht's health deteriorated soon afterwards and he died within six months, from complications from melanoma in a Houston-area hospital at age 33. His ashes were spread over the construction site of the Astrodome, the future home of the Colt .45s. The team retired Umbricht's jersey number, 32, and wore black armbands for the 1964 season in his honor. == Early career == Umbricht was born in Chicago, and moved with his family to Atlanta in 1946. Aspiring to be a professional baseball player, Umbricht practiced every day on a field by his house and became a multi-sport star at Decatur High School in Decatur, Georgia.Zimniuch, p. 133 He attended the University of Georgia on a scholarship and played on the school's baseball and basketball teams, becoming the captain of both for his senior year. He was named to the All-Southeastern Conference first-team as a shortstop in 1951. After graduating from Georgia, Umbricht participated in a local tryout camp for the Waycross Bears in the Class D Georgia–Florida League, a low-level minor league affiliate in the Milwaukee Braves organization. He made the team, starting his professional baseball career as a pitcher and infielder. In 1953, Umbricht pitched for the Bears in 10 games, starting in eight of them. Umbricht finished with a 4–3 win–loss record and a 2.87 earned run average. Umbricht missed the 1954 and 1955 seasons while serving in the United States Army, but pitched for a military team at Fort Carson in Colorado.Zimniuch, p. 132 After his discharge in 1956, Umbricht played for the Baton Rouge Rebels of the Evangeline League; he had a 15–15 Win–loss record in 32 games as the team finished with a 53–70 record, and led the league with 27 complete games. He was promoted to the Topeka Hawks of the Western League in 1957, and had a 13–8 record with a 3.24 earned run average in 28 games pitched. In 1958 he played for the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association. He went 6–10 with a 4.06 earned run average in 55 games, mostly as a relief pitcher. Umbricht was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for Emil Panko prior to the 1959 season. The Pirates assigned Umbricht to their Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake City Bees in the Pacific Coast League. While with the Bees, Umbricht had a 14–8 record with a 2.78 earned run average in 47 games, mostly in relief. == Major League career == === Pittsburgh Pirates === On the strength of his performance for the Bees, Umbricht was promoted to the Pirates roster near the end of the 1959 season. He appeared in only one game, a 7–6 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched seven innings, giving up five earned runs while striking out three. Umbricht left the game in position for the win, as the Pirates were leading 6–5, but reliever Don Gross gave up two earned runs in the ninth inning for the blown save and the loss. Two spots in the starting rotation were available by the time the Pirates started their 1960 season. At the beginning of spring training, Umbricht competed against fellow rookies Bennie Daniels and Joe Gibbon for a place.Cunning, p. 84 The Pirates began strongly in spring training, winning 11 in a row at one point.Cunning, p. 81 In a game against the Detroit Tigers, Umbricht combined with Daniels to throw a no-hitter. Manager Danny Murtaugh was impressed with Umbricht's pitching and expected him to become the Pirates' fifth starter (a combination of spot starter and reliever) by opening day. He won the spot and in his first start of the season against the Reds on April 17, he gave up six earned runs in 5.1 innings, getting charged with the 11–3 loss. In his next start against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 21, Umbricht had poor control, giving up three runs and walking five batters in 2.1 innings. He made a last-minute start against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale on May 25, after Pirates starting pitcher Bob Friend had a sore throat and could not play. Umbricht pitched five innings, striking out five batters, but gave up two critical second-inning home runs to Frank Howard and John Roseboro and was charged with the loss. After an off-day and a game postponed because of rain, the Pirates faced the Phillies at home on May 28.Cunning, p. 406 After the game went to extra innings, Umbricht pitched the 13th inning. The Pirates won in the later half of the inning, earning Umbricht his first career win. Umbricht continued to struggle in the bullpen and was demoted alongside Daniels on June 27 to the Columbus Jets of the International League as pitchers Tom Cheney and Earl Francis were promoted to the main squad.Cunning, p. 142 Between June 27 and September 9, he appeared in 19 games, 15 of them starts, earning an 8–5 record, two shutouts and a 2.50 earned run average. With his strong pitching performance at Columbus, Umbricht was re-promoted to the main roster in early September to help the Pirates in their pennant race. On September 27 against the Reds, he struck out three batters in two innings in relief as the Pirates broke a team record by striking out 19 batters in a 16-inning victory.Cunning, p. 246 The Pirates managed to win the National League pennant, but he was not named in the final roster for the World Series, which the Pirates won in seven games. Overall during the 1960 season, Umbricht appeared in 17 games for the Pirates, compiling a 1–2 record with a 5.09 earned run average and 26 strikeouts. He appeared in one game during the 1961 season, pitching three innings in relief during a May 5 loss against the Dodgers. He was demoted alongside outfielder Román Mejías on May 10 as the Pirates had to trim their roster from 28 players to 25 per league rules. Umbricht was sent back to Columbus, where he spent the rest of the 1961 season as a full-time starter. In 22 games, Umbricht had a 9–6 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned run average in 142 innings pitched. ===Houston Colt .45s=== Umbricht was selected by the Houston Colt .45s with the 35th pick in the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft. Umbricht had become friends with Houston's general manager Paul Richards when the two were at Waycross in 1953, and Richards selected Umbricht to give him a better chance of pitching in the majors.Zimniuch, p. 134 With the Colts, Umbricht quickly became one of the best relief pitchers in the National League. Umbricht started the season on the Colts roster, but was demoted to the Oklahoma City 89ers of the American Association to make room for veteran pitcher Don McMahon. He appeared in 23 games for the 89ers, posting a 3–4 win–loss record with a 3.39 earned run average, mostly in relief. He rejoined the Colts roster in the middle of the 1962 season as a relief specialist. He appeared in 34 games that season, earning a 4–0 win–loss record with a solid 2.01 earned run average. He struck out 55 batters while walking only 17. Umbricht threw four pitches, a fastball, curveball, slider and the changeup. He was used primarily as a setup pitcher during his brief tenure with the Colts. According to former teammate and roommate Ken Johnson, Umbricht was used by the Colts mainly to control damage caused by starting pitchers after they were removed from games. In his five-year Major League Baseball career, Umbricht compiled a 9–5 win–loss record, with 133 strikeouts, three saves and a 3.06 earned run average in 88 games. ==Cancer and early death== === Cancer diagnosis and 1963 season === At the beginning of spring training for the 1963 season, Umbricht noticed a small black mole in his right leg, near the thigh while on a golf outing with Richards. Umbricht ignored the mole at first, but it grew at a rapid pace. Richards and team trainer Jim Ewell told Umbricht to have it checked by a doctor. A three-inch section of the mole was removed for testing and a doctor confirmed it was a \\"black mole\\" tumor that had spread to his groin area. Ewell, the team trainer said, Umbricht \\"had the most wonderful attitude of anyone you'll ever meet\\". Umbricht's cancer diagnosis shocked baseball and made national headlines. On March 7, Umbricht underwent a six-hour operation using perfusion to remove the tumor from his right leg. The perfusion technique was radical at the time, entering use as a surgical procedure not long before Umbricht's surgery. After a month-long hospital stay, Umbricht and his doctors told the media that he beat the cancer, crediting \\"early detection and good physical condition\\", further stating that he \\"should have five or six good years left\\" in his baseball career. However, Umbricht learned that the doctors were unsure if the cancer surgery was a success, or even if it had been completely removed from his body. Even if it was, his chance of survival was slim at best. Upon hearing the news, Umbricht decided to keep it a secret outside his immediate family. Umbricht wanted to return to pitch for the Colt .45s and was in uniform by opening day. Manager Harry Craft added Umbricht to the Colts' active list prior to a May 9 game against Cincinnati, telling the Associated Press that the player was \\"anxious to get back to pitching\\". He appeared in the sixth inning in a 13–3 loss, giving up four runs, including a home run to Frank Robinson in one inning of work. After the game, Umbricht said he felt \\"real good\\" despite the poor performance. The surgery took a toll on his leg: he required over 100 stitches, and blood seeped from the wound while he pitched at times.Zimniuch, p. 135 That year Umbricht posted a 4–3 win-loss record and a 2.61 earned run average in 35 games. He played his last game on September 29, 1963, the final day of the regular season, and picked up the win in relief. By that time, Umbricht's cancer had started to spread throughout his body and he needed to be sedated at times because of the pain. In November, Umbricht learned that the cancer spread to his chest area and was incurable. He was released from his contract on December 16 due to his deteriorating health. The National League allowed the Colts to sign Umbricht to a scout contract given the circumstances, with the proviso that it would become a player contract if he rejoined the active roster. === Final months and death === By early 1964, Umbricht was constantly in and out of hospital for further treatment, but was only given a few months to live. When he was not hospitalized, Umbricht played golf and attended baseball dinners in his honor, often for a \\"most courageous athlete\\" award ceremony. Umbricht did not travel to Cocoa Beach for the Colts' spring training camp in late February. He returned to the hospital permanently on March 16, where his health steadily declined after a third operation. During his final hospital stay, the Colts' management, his family and the hospital staff agreed not to release any further details about his illness, though word had leaked that he was dying. He remained optimistic that he would beat the illness until his final days, stating that \\"everything will be ok\\" in an interview with United Press International sports editor Milton Richman. Umbricht succumbed to the disease on April 8, 1964. Umbricht's death came on the eve of the Colts' 1964 season, and at his funeral, Manager Harry Craft, coach Lum Harris, and teammates Bob Lillis, Ken Johnson, Dick Farrell, and Russ Kemmerer were the six pallbearers. Kemmerer, who in the off-season was a Methodist preacher, gave the eulogy during the service, and Umbricht's body was cremated. Construction of the Astrodome, the Colts' future ballpark, had begun a few weeks before Umbricht's death. His family decided to spread his ashes on its grounds, so the new ballpark \\"could be his headstone\\". After the funeral service, Umbricht's brother Ed flew a plane over the construction site and scattered his ashes. == Aftermath and legacy== The day after Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their teammate by wearing black armbands for the entire 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; it was the first time the club retired a uniform number, and only the twelfth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to mention his death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose number was retired but who is unfamiliar to baseball fans. Umbricht's death from melanoma helped alert the general public about the disease. Former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Jack Pardee credited Umbricht's battle with melanoma for saving his life in 1965. Pardee, a Pro Bowl linebacker, had been ignoring a mole on his armpit. After hearing of Umbricht's battle with cancer, and that his mole was similar to Umbricht's, he went to the team doctor, who diagnosed him with melanoma. Although Pardee's melanoma had also spread throughout his body, he made a complete recovery. ==See also== * List of baseball players who died during their careers ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== Category:1930 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Baseball players from Illinois Category:Basketball players from Illinois Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Houston Colt .45s players Category:Salt Lake City Bees players Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:Georgia Bulldogs basketball players Category:Georgia Bulldogs baseball players Category:Baton Rouge Rebels players Category:Águilas Cibaeñas players Category:Major League Baseball players with retired numbers Category:Deaths from melanoma Category:Deaths from cancer in Texas Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Jim Umbricht"},{"id":"2569022","text":"Lamboing is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland, located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). The proposed merger of the municipalities of Diesse, Lamboing, Nods and Prêles into the new municipality of Le Plateau de Diesse was rejected by voters. However, on 1 January 2014 the former municipalities of Lamboing, Diesse and Prêles merged into the new municipality of Plateau de Diesse.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 13 December 2014 ==History== View with Mt. Sujet by Leo Wehrli (1945) Lamboing is first mentioned in 1179 as Lamboens though this document is thought to be a forgery from the late 12th Century. In 1235 it was mentioned as Lamboens. The noble de Lamboing family was first mentioned in a document from 1255. But very little is known about this family. In 1423 the de Vaumarcus family were given the village as a fief, which they held until 1509. In that year the village was acquired by the Prince-Bishopric of Basel who ruled over the village for almost three centuries. After the 1798 French invasion, Lamboing became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Lamboing was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. A village school house was built in 1863. During the late 19th century a watchmaker's workshop opened in the village. It was acquired by the Ebauches SA company in 1926 and continued making components for watches until 1981. Beginning in the 1970s the village's population began to grow as commuters settled in Lamboing. It has always been part of the parish of Diesse. When Diesse converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation between 1530 and 1554, Lamboing converted as well. ==Geography== Before the merger, Lamboing had a total area of .

The village is still generally rural and agrarian. Nods is first mentioned in 1255 as Nos. The municipality was formerly known by its German name Nos, however, that name is no longer used. The noble de Nods family first appears in the historical record in the 13th century and vanishes again in the 15th century. The village was located along the border between several competing powers. During the 13th century it was owned by the Counts of Neuchâtel, then by the city of Bern and then by the Bishop of Basel. It then remained under the authority of the Prince-Bishop for centuries. During the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, preachers of the new faith came to convert Nods. However, they encountered serious resistance from the villagers. The village was finally converted after Bern forced the villagers to adopt the new faith. Those families that wished to remain Catholic were forced to move to Le Landeron and Cressier in Neuchâtel. Both before and after the Reformation, Nods was part of the parish of Diesse, until 1708 when it became an independent parish. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, nods became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, it was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Initially part of the District of Erlach, in 1846 it transferred to the La Neuveville District. The village church was built in 1639. The current building was built on the same site in 1835. The village economy was traditionally based on agriculture, animal husbandry and cheese production.

It originally served the towns of Rothesay, Quispamsis, Hampton and much of rural Kings County, though today is mostly populated by students from Quispamsis. This is due in part to the opening of Hampton High School in 1992 which served the town of Hampton and much of rural Kings County. Rothesay High School was then opened in 1997 to serve the town of Rothesay. Following Mr. Bishop, the next principal was Robert Munro, and the current principal of Kennebecasis Valley High School is JoEllen Jensen. ==Events== ===Rip Seeley Memorial Basketball Game=== Each year KV's Varsity basketball teams compete against their rival Rothesay High in this Memorial Basketball Game. The location of the game alternates each year between the KV and Rothesay Gyms. The girls varsity teams play their game first followed by the boys game. Proceeds from the game go toward a scholarship for a student athlete. ===Miller Bowl, Filler-bowl and PJ bowl=== Since 2008, when rival school Rothesay High opened the Arther Miller fields, there has been a memorial football game. The first two of the first four years of this tradition, the games were hosted at Arther Miller field. The following two seasons the games were hosted at KVHS on its own field, Usher Miller field. KVHS won each of the four games played against Rothesay High. In recent years, variations of Miller Bowl have arisen in its stead, carrying titles such as Filler Bowl and Papa John's. These are intended to honour the tradition of Miller Bowl while complying with new restrictions placed on KVHS's football team which prevent them from playing against Rothesay High after having risen to the 12-man league following two consecutive championship wins in the 10-man league. In 2012 they had the Filler bowl against Fredericton High, as they were the first team that played KV at home that season. The following season they hosted the first Papa Johns bowl (as it is sponsored by Papa Johns Pizza) against Saint John High as the coaches and players of KV knew Saint John High School was their true rival in 12 man. The PJ bowl continues to be an exciting game for fans and players alike and is normally a very close game. ===Riverboat Basketball Tournament=== The Riverboat Basketball Tournament is an event that is eagerly awaited by the student body. It showcases the varsity boys and girls basketball teams from KVHS, as well as many rival schools such as Rothesay High School, St. Stephen High School, Fredericton High School, and Woodstock High School. In recent years the tournament has expanded to include teams from other Canadian provinces such as Nova Scotia, and Quebec, and from the state of Maine. It is tradition that one boys game and one girls game takes place during class time, which allows the majority of the student body to attend and cheer on the home team. Students are charged $1 to leave class and attend the game, with proceeds supporting the athletes. ===Campus Market=== Since 2003, KVHS has had an annual fair which students taking the 'Entrepreneurship 110' course participate in. The market consists of students thinking up an idea of a product they want to sell and then constructing a business plan for that product. These students miss all of their morning classes to run their own table in the cafeteria to sell their products to passing students, as well as students whose classes have signed up to come visit the market during class time. In the past, students from Rothesay High's entrepreneurship class have been invited to partake as well. The market takes place mid-December, and as a result many of the products often relate to Christmas and the holidays. ===Pink Day=== One day of each year, every student wears pink clothing to school in support of breast cancer research. Despite being entirely optional, it's very uncommon to see a student dressed in anything other than pink on this day, as it has become a celebrated tradition. Each student and teacher donates one dollar to the breast cancer foundation for a walk around the school, ending with a pep-rally at which the students vote by cheering for the most pink and best dressed student. The costumes prepared for this competition are intentionally ridiculous and over the top, with an older student doing backflips in a pink-painted gas mask famously winning two years in a row. ===Event Realization=== KVHS has a dynamic student council known as the Leadership Team which plans and executes most events that take place at the school, also largely filling the role of a social committee. They can be seen planning, promoting, and setting up school events. The KVHS News team, which launched in 2011, provides information on school affairs and such upcoming events to students over a weekly video broadcast with the aim of encouraging an already high rate of student involvement. ==Athletic achievements== * In the fall of 2010, KVHS became home to the Usher Miller turf field.

The lectures examine what Trilling described as \\"the moral life in process of revising itself\\", a period of Western history in which (argues Trilling) sincerity became the central aspect of moral life (first observed in pre–Age of Enlightenment literature such as the works of Shakespeare), later to be replaced by authenticity (in the twentieth century). The lectures take great lengths to define and explain the terms \\"sincerity\\" and \\"authenticity\\", though no clear, concise definition is ever really postulated, and Trilling even considers the possibility that such terms are best not totally defined. However, he does use the short formula \\"to stay true to oneself\\" to characterize the modern ideal of authenticity and differentiates it from the older ideal of being a morally sincere person. Trilling draws on a wide range of literature in defense of his thesis, citing many of the key (and some more obscure) Western writers and thinkers of the last 500 years. Trilling's Sincerity and Authenticity has been of influence on literary and cultural critics and philosophers, such as Templeton and Kyoto Prize winner Charles Taylor in his book The Ethics of Authenticity. ==References== Category:1972 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:English-language books ","title":"Sincerity and Authenticity"},{"id":"2569110","text":"Forest School Camps (FSC) is an organization that is aimed primarily at children between the ages of 6 and 17. FSC has camps running throughout the year, the main ones lasting 13 nights during late July and August, with one week and weekend camps at Easter and during the spring and early summer. Being a volunteer run organization, it relies on cultural/social bonds and enthusiasm from participants for support and staffing rather than monetary incentive. Many, though by no means all, volunteers have 'grown up' in the organisation. FSC is designed to give children, including those who have never camped before experiences, life skills and social skills. FSC is an English charity registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales in the United Kingdom, number 306006.http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=306006&SubsidiaryNumber;=0 == Culture and history == FSC was originally formed in 1947 by a group of former students and teachers from a radical educational scheme called \\"Forest School\\" that started in 1930 in the New Forest. The school later moved to Whitwell Hall http://www.freewebs.com/whitwellhall/ in Norfolk, but the building was requisitioned at the start of World War II and the school had to close. Forest School had connections with a diverse range of cultures such as the Woodcraft movements, Native Americans cultures and the Quakers. FSC has developed its own distinct culture with traditions and internal practices. Many of the traditions have developed out of physical necessity, such as Rally (a meeting of everyone on the Camp where they discuss what is going to happen through the day), Clan (a vertical age sub-group of the lodge that prepares the meals for the day) or the Arise song, though others sprang forth from cultural and aesthetic bases, such as Merrymoot, or the Camp Songs. The camp songs are sung round a big camp fire and are a great way to have fun and a bit of a laugh. The end of a main standing camp is usually marked by two major events, Merrymoot and Lodge Common Council. Merrymoot is an expanded camp fire session, where the whole camp gathers to entertain one another with sketches and improvisations as well as many of the traditional songs. Lodge Common Council is a formal occasion, usually on the final night, where the entire camp gathers round a special fire. This is traditionally octagonal in shape, and may be some five feet high, though in practice the shape is more commonly rectangular. Before lighting the fire, a few coals from the previous year are added to the fire, which is then lit in front of the whole body of the camp. Once the fire is burning, campers will review the camp and may suggest changes in activities or emphasis for the following year. ==Groups== People on camp have traditionally been separated into the following groups, although some experimental camps have varied this arrangement: :Pixies - Children who are too young to go alone and must be accompanied by a parent or relative :Elves - Children between the ages of 6 and a half and 8. :Woodlings - Children between the ages of 9 and 11. :Trailseekers - Children between the ages of 12 and 13. :Trackers - Children between the ages of 14 and 15. :Pathfinders - Children between the ages of 16 and 17. :Pixie parents- the parent or relative looking after a pixie :Waywardens - Adults who require special attention due to disabilities :Staff - Adults who care for the children and co-operatively run the whole camp. With the exception of camp chiefs (who are in overall charge of the entire camp) and caterers (responsible for food), staff are split into groups that look after the different age groups. In each group there is also a group chief. Generally FSC age groups are based on school year rather than birthday. As most camps take place before September, this means it is possible to have campers whose ages do not exactly fit with the groupings listed above (e.g. 15-year-old Pathfinders). From 2007, as a trial, the age groups have been amended slightly (to those given above), increasing the age range slightly in the lower groups, and reducing it for the pathfinders, to allow the camps to accommodate slightly more older children without distorting the number in each age group. As a high percentage of children who begin camping with FSC fall in love with camp and want to stay on until their final year, when they participate in a coming of age ceremony, when the pathfinder age group previously encompassed ages 15, 16 and 17, there were always more applications from pathfinders than spaces for them to fill. The change in age groups has compensated for this and now more children are able to continue camping into their final year. == Camps == Each camp has a different agenda and model, set by tradition and the Camp Chief. There are several different identifiable types: ; Standing camps : These are set in regularly used locations, at sites generally used for many years, and where a relationship has been built up with the landowners. Sites may be on remote hill farms among mountainous country, or on land in lowland areas. Most camps are in this format and children need to attend at least 2 of these camps to experience FSC life before being able to try activity camps as below. A variety of standard and novel activities take place on these camps, and they can be exciting and challenging, but they are less demanding physically than some of the mobile and activity camps. They may have a theme or special interest depending on the interests of the camp leaders and staff. Both basic and more advanced camping skills are learnt during Standing Camps, particularly during the first part of the camp. These skills are consolidated by the 'hike', during which each age group walks with its staff away from the site for two, three or four nights, taking just their essential camping gear with them. The distance travelled and the time away from the main camp depend on the age of the children in the group. ; Mobile camps : These camps generally do not have a single fixed campsite. They move on most days and are based around walking in lowland or mountain environments, cycling, canoeing or other activities. Whilst most mobiles are based in the United Kingdom some are based abroad. ;Semi-mobile camps :Semi-mobiles are essentially Mobiles, however may either have a site on which they spend a period of time before beginning the journey or have a fixed location (often known as a base camp) from which small trips are made most days. ; Caving camps : These camps are usually based in a caving hut with day adventures out into local caves. These camps often include a day of overground exploration. Recent camps have taken place in parts of the UK such as the Mendips, Devon, Yorkshire and South Wales. Caving camps are often described by those who frequent them as part of the \\"real heart of FSC\\", with the same people attending them year after year, and strong friendships being built up. ; Conservation and Skills camps : These are a special form of standing camps focused on a particular work project, usually an environmental project of some sort. These camps restricted to over 16s or over 18s depending on their nature and leaders. ; Associate Camps : These are run and organised by FSC associates, usually parents of child campers, but can also include staff from children's camps. They are generally shorter weekend camps, and do not follow exactly the same structure as standard child camps, but are similar in ethos and are open to family groups, children are cared for by their own parents/guardians rather than staff. ==FSC Glee== One part of FSC camps is the communal singing and sharing of traditional and contemporary songs. A campfire is often held in the evening where people are encouraged to sing. FSC song books are also printed every few years, these contain some of the more common songs sung on camps. A virtual version of these books is available at the FSC glee website. A few songs unique to FSC such as the Poll Tax song have been written by members and remain part of the oral tradition. ==Primary sources== The historical records of the Forest School Camps are held in the Archives of the community Institute of Education, University of London and a full catalogue can be found on-line. ==References== ==External links== * Forest School Camps website * FSC in the news * Forest School Camps collection at the Institute of Education Archives.

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). On 1 January 2015 the former municipalities of Bévilard, Malleray and Pontenet merged to form the new municipality of Valbirse.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 2 January 2013 ==History== Aerial view (1958) Bévilard is first mentioned in 1182 as Bevilar. In German it was known as Bewiler though this is not used currently. Very little is known about the early history of the village. During the 13th and 14th centuries the noble Bévilard family appear in a few records. Throughout much of its existence, it was owned by the Provost of Moutier-Grandval Abbey. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Bévilard became part of the French Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Bévilard was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village parish church of Saint-Georges was first mentioned in 1263. The current church building is from 1716. In 1531 the Protestant Reformation entered the village and the new faith was adopted. The church was the center of a parish that originally included Bévilard, Malleray and Pontenet. In the 18th century the municipality of Champoz joined the parish. In 1746 a filial church of the parish was established in Sornetan. The village was generally agrarian until the Basel- Delémont-Biel railroad built a station between Bévilard and Malleray in 1877. The convenient link to the transportation network encouraged several precision machining and watch making factories to set up in the municipality. In 1882 the Hélios gear factory opened and was followed in 1915 Schäublin machining factory. The watch industry was a major source of income and led to a growing population in the municipality until the 1970s. Beginning in the 1970s, competition from cheaper electronic watches forced many Swiss watchmakers out of business and the population in Bévilard dropped. ==Geography== Before the merger, Bévilard had a total area of . As of 2012, a total of or 40.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 48.4% is forested.

Of the agricultural land, 8.8% is used for growing crops, 12.7% is pastures and 18.7% is used for alpine pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. The municipality is located in the upper Birs River Valley. Over the years it and the village of Malleray have grown together into a single settled area. On 31 December 2009 District de Moutier, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.

A leader in the early development of psychoanalysis, he began his career as a neurological specialist and, in 1894, began publishing a series of articles on psychophysiology. He studied with Sigmund Freud from 1895 to 1904 with a concentration in homosexuality and fetishism and coined the term Sadomasochismus (sadomasochism) in 1913. He also coined the term \\"Narcissmus\\" (narcissism). In September 1942, he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he died. ==Work== Sadger published \\"Fragment der Psychoanalyse eines Homosexuellen\\" in the Jahrbuch für sexuellen Zwischenstufen in 1908. It described his analysis of a melancholy Danish count who was homosexual. The analysis lasted for only thirteen days before being terminated by the patient, whose sexual orientation was not changed. Later in 1908, Sadger published \\"Ist die konträre Sexualempfindung heilbar?\\", which assessed the value of psychoanalysis as a treatment for \\"contrary sexual feeling\\", in the Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft. He answered the question of whether it could be cured in patients who were moral and determined \\"mit einem runden Ja!\\" (\\"with a definitive Yes!\\"). Sadger believed that it was not enough to establish a spurious kind of heterosexual functioning or \\"masturbatio per vaginam\\", wanting instead to change a patient's \\"Sexualideal\\", the internal image of his sexual object. Freud stated in a note in his revised 1910 edition of “Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality” that his conclusions about homosexuality were partly based on information obtained from Sadger. Sadger's main work, Die Lehre von den Geschlechtsverwirrugen [...] auf psychoanalytischer Grundlage was published in 1921. Although he supported a hereditarian degeneracy theory, Sadger usually argued that homosexuality was due to accidental family events, but for unclear reasons he frequently reported family histories of sexual inversion. Sadger followed Freud's idea that gay men unconsciously desire to castrate their fathers by rendering their male partners flaccid through orgasm so that they can magically incorporate their masculinity and finally obtain access to the mother. ==References== Category:1867 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Austrian Jews Category:Austrian sexologists Category:Psychoanalysts from Vienna Category:Jewish psychoanalysts Category:Freudians Category:People who died in the Theresienstadt Ghetto Category:Austrian civilians killed in World War II Category:People from Nowy Sącz Category:Members of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society ","title":"Isidor Sadger"},{"id":"2569121","text":"Champoz is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

By 1880 almost the entire population (97%) of the village was German speaking. For most of its history, the village was part of the lands of the provost of Moutier-Grandval under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. During the Protestant Reformation in 1528, Seehof/Elay was part of the Sous-les-Roches region that remained by the old faith. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Seehof became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Seehof was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Today it is part of the Catholic parish of Vermes.

He developed several inverting and erecting eyepieces, and was the maker of Kepler’s telescope. \\"Things appear more alive with the binocular telescope,\\" he wrote, \\"doubly as exact so to speak, as well as large and bright.\\"The First 300 Years of Binocular Telescopes. His binocular telescope is the precursor to our binoculars. . == Biography == Two different stories exist about Rheita's early life. The most popular account holds that he is of Czech origin, born in 1597. According to this story he was a priest and a member of the order of Capuchin friars at Rheita, Bohemia, hence his name. At the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, he left the order and established himself in Belgium. The other, more probable account, starts in 1604, when Schyrleus is born in Reutte, Austria. After joining the Augustine order in 1622, he is sent to the university at Ingolstadt, where he probably follows courses in astronomy and learns how to grind lenses. Following his graduation he does not return to his convent but enters the Capuchin order, which sends him to Linz in 1636 where he is to teach philosophy. Here, he comes in the service of Kurfürst Philipp Christoph von Sötern, the archbishop of Trier and Speyer, who is held captive by the emperor, Ferdinand III. The archbishop sends him on a mission to negotiate with Pope Urban VIII. The emperor however, seeing this diplomatic activity as a form of spying, bans Schyrleus from his lands in 1641. From here on, both accounts of Schyrleus' life come together. In the 1640s he was a professor of philosophy at Trier. In 1642, he was in Cologne conducting astronomical observations and optical measurements, and in 1643 his work Novem stellae circa Jovem visae, circa Saturnum sex, circa Martem nonnullae (\\"Nine stars seen around Jupiter, six around Saturn, several around Mars\\") appeared.His \\"discovery\\" of five new satellites around Jupiter was successfully fought by Hevelius in his Selenographia, 1647, p. 49 ff. In 1645, he published Oculus Enoch et Eliae, siue, Radius sidereomysticus, Oculus Enoch et Eliae siue Radius sidereomysticus, first part, 1645 a very influential work on optics and astronomy. ==Optics== In Oculus Enoch et Eliae, besides describing one of his inventions, an eyepiece for a Keplerian telescope, which left the image reverted, it also contained a long section on binocular telescopes, which greatly influenced other telescope-makers and opticians in the next century. His section on binocular telescopes is not illustrated, but the methods he describes became the standard construction techniques for many years. Another engraving in this book may show a lens grinding machine. ==Astronomical observations== Schyrleus was a determined anticopernican. In the foreword of its book, which includes a dedication to Jesus Christ and Ferdinand III, Schyrleus boldly declared that after having meditated for a long time on the systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, and other astronomers, he was convinced that all of these scientists had advanced superfluous theories. He dedicated the moons of Jupiter to Pope Urban VIII, calling them Astres Urbanoctavianes. He also wrote that Saturn had two \\"companions,\\" and that they were periodically eclipsed by the planet. He deduced that they had their own independent orbits, and that they illuminated Saturn, which needed light as it was a hundred times less lit by the sun than the Earth. He tells us that in 1642, in Cologne, he saw pass in front of the Sun a troop (turnam) of shooting stars that followed one another during a period fourteen days, and that the glare of the Sun was considerably weakened by it. In regard to extraterrestrial life, Schyrleus wrote, \\"If Jupiter has…inhabitants…they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of the Earth, in proportion to the [size] of the two spheres.\\" However, he did not dare to confirm the existence of Jovian beings due to certain theological difficulties; Schyrleus wondered, for example, if beings on other planets maintained their primitive state of innocence, or if they are cursed by original sin like humans are. ==The Moon== Schyrleus also included a map of the Moon in Oculus Enoch et Eliae. It was the first depiction of the Moon as seen in an inverting telescope (and thus the Moon itself is inverted in the illustration, with the South Pole at the top). The crater Tycho, for example, was depicted on lunar maps as early as 1645, when Schyrleus depicted the bright ray system. His map, however, did not come into standard use, as it was superseded by those made by Hevelius and the Jesuits Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1650–1651). In 1647, Schyrleus published a lunar chart with a diameter of 19 cm. He may have spent some time in Italy, but it is certain that he died at Ravenna. It is unknown why he was there at the time. ==Legacy== He is credited with bringing into the scientific lexicon the terms \\"ocular\\" and \\"objective\\" (as used in optics). The lunar crater Rheita is named after him. By extension, the lunar valley Vallis Rheita, where the crater stands at the valley’s northwestern end, is also named after Schyrleus. ==See also== *List of Roman Catholic scientist-clerics ==References== * Thewes, Alfons (1983).

Like other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. warneri rarely causes disease, but may occasionally cause infection in patients whose immune system is compromised. ==Identification== Colonies of S. warneri on trypticase soy agar are usually beige, tan, or yellow, sometimes with an orange rim and about 2–4 mm in diameter after 48 hours' incubation at 35 °C. Optimal growth temperature is 30-40 °C. ==Clinical importance== S. warneri has been suggested as a cause of spontaneous abortion in cattle and humans.Barigye R, Schaan L, Gibbs PS, Schamber E, Dyer, NW (2007).

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Loveresse is first mentioned in 1148 as de Loveresce though this document is probably a late 12th-century forgery. In 1225 it was mentioned as Loverasse. In the 12th century both Bellelay Abbey and the college of canons of Moutier-Grandval Abbey owned lands or rights in Loveresse. During the second half of the 13th century, Bellelay Abbey expanded their holdings in the village and became the main landowner there. In 1404 the Prince-Bishop of Basel granted extensive rights to Loveresse in a bid to attract settlers. The village church was part of the parish of Tavannes- Chaindon. When the parish converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, Loveresse also converted. It remained part of the parish until 1928 when it joined the Reconvilier parish. By the beginning of the Early Modern era, the village was owned by the provost of Moutier-Grandval. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Loveresse became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Loveresse was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. In the late 19th century, several watch manufactures established shops in Loveresse. However, none of them survived the worldwide Great Depression. In 1906 the Canton of Bern purchased the hospice in the Vallée de Tavannes. It was converted into a girls' boarding school. In 1975 the building was converted into a clinic for the Bellelay region, and it was used in that capacity until 1987. After 1987 it was used as an agricultural training school, the Centre de formation et de vulgarisation agricole du Bernese Jura. ==Geography== Moron mountain and the surrounding villages, including Loveresse in the center under the cliff face.

The municipality was formerly known by its German name Mallaraya, however, that name is no longer used. Very little is known about the early history of the village. In 1367, the Prince-Bishop of Basel, Johann von Vienne, sent troops to try to force Biel to break a burgrecht treaty that they had entered into with the city of Bern. At Malleray, the Basel troops encountered and were defeated by an army from Solothurn that was marching to support Bern against Basel. The noble de Malleray family appear in historic records during the 14th and 15th centuries. They may have been a cadet line of the local Tavannes family. Over the following centuries, the provost of Moutier-Grandval Abbey gradually acquired most of the rights and lands in the village. After the secularization of the Abbey following the adoption of the Protestant Reformation in Bern, during the end of the 16th century Malleray became part of a bailiwick under the diocese of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Malleray became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Malleray was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The watch making industry started in the village in 1846 and began to change it from an agrarian village into an industrial town. The construction of the Tavannes-Moutier railroad in 1874-77 increased the rate of change. The population grew rapidly as watch factory jobs brought new residents.

Anaconda was a small mining community in Cibola County, New Mexico. The town came into existence in the early 1950s when the Anaconda Copper Company of Butte, Montana opened up a uranium ore processing plant northwest of Grants, along Route 66, to process ore from the Jackpile Mine (or Jackpile-Paguate Mine),Laguna Pueblo Indian Reservation Case Study: Jackpile-Paguate Mine, New Mexico , MiningWatch Canada, Jan 08 2007Native Americans denounce toxic legacy , by Danielle Knight.

Arce Anaconda was the site of somewhere around 100 homes for the supervisors and management of the company. The Mill was also located on the same property. Contrary to reports, none of the homes were built using \\"radioactive\\" material from the plant. Referred to by the residents as \\"Camp\\", a carryover from the original tents used as temporary housing during the initial establishment of the operations. The housing was built in three phases. The first group of about 35 houses was constructed of cinderblock walls and had exposed beam ceilings. A building with four efficiency type apartments was included and used to house unmarried employees and was known as the Bachelors Quarters, or simply \\"The BQ\\". The two subsequent groups of approximately the same number were wood frame construction with stucco exteriors. The groups came to be called by the order of their building. Old Camp, Middle Camp and New Camp The Mill closed in early 1980s and the houses were sold and removed and the land reclaimed during the next 20 years. Testimony given before the New Mexico Legislature's Economic and Rural Development Committee in 2008 claimed that the mill had polluted local aquifers.La Jicarita News, A Community Newspaper for Northern New Mexico, December 2008 Presently there is little to show that the area was once a community. During the time that Old Camp was built the Company also a clinic building that served the employees and was staffed at least part-time by a Doctor, Doctor Wong. This building was later converted to general use and contained various departments including the Geology department during later years. A Quonset hut was added that served a number of purposes. The floor was finished hardwood and used for basketball and volleyball. A large kitchen in the back was used when the floor was turned into a meeting hall. Company and employee events here held here including a number of New Year's Eve celebrations. Two additional buildings were added next to the Quonset Hut that housed a 20yd swimming pool and a four lane bowling alley. The swimming pool building was insulated with blown styrofoam on the inside. In the mid 1970s the pool building was replaced. Two outdoor tennis courts were added in the late 1950s. A golf course was added when the latter housing additions were built. There was no grass the course was periodically mainted with a grader to keep the \\"rough\\" from reclaiming the fairways. The greens were piles of oiled sand leved on top and approximately 15 feet across. A \\"rake\\" was used to smooth the green for putting. Beyond a pre-school held in the Quonset Hut, there were no schools. Students attended Elementary School in Bluewater Village several miles away. Junior High and High School students were bused to Grants. No store or Post Office was ever established on Company Property. ==Jackpile-Paguate mine== Jackpile Mine aerial, pre-1982. Part of Anaconda townsite at lower left. The Jackpile uranium mine opened in 1953 and operated until 1982. The Jackpile was one of the largest uranium mines ever developed and mined in the United States, and by far the largest mine in the Laguna uranium district. The ores of the Laguna district contain uranium, vanadium, and many other elements. Only rarely do the ores contain more than 1% uranium or vanadium; most of the ores ·average about 0.2% uranium and less vanadium. The first 3 million tons of ore shipped from the mine averaged 0.23 percent U3O8 and 0.13 percent V2O5 (1958 data). The ore bodies are typical \\"roll- front\\" deposits, localized in old stream channels. Carboniferous material within the ore zones is often high-grade.

He is best known as president of New Falcon Publications. ==Early life== A native of Chicago, Alan Miller, the son of police lieutenant Leonard Miller and his wife, Bertha Freidman, was born during what he described as the \\"roaring war years\\". Writing and speaking as Christopher Hyatt, he gave two different accounts of the end of his high school career. In the first account, he claimed that he dropped out of high school at the age of sixteen, working instead as a dishwasher and cook, roaming around the United States. ==Occultism== Hyatt's interest in the occult began in his early twenties. His desire to further pursue his studies in magick resulted in meeting Israel Regardie in Studio City in the 1970s. Regardie introduced Hyatt to Reichian therapy, which he insisted Hyatt learn prior to any magical pursuits. Regardie further instructed Hyatt in the magical system of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Hyatt was a Ninth Degree member of the occult Order Ordo Templi Orientis, and he co-founded with David Cherubim the Thelemic Order of the Golden Dawn in Los Angeles on the Vernal Equinox of 1990. ==Academic career== Hyatt was trained in experimental and clinical psychology and practiced as a psychotherapist for many years. As Alan Miller, he used the 18 units earned from his military GED towards his first academic career at Los Angeles City College, where he studied accounting for two years. He later changed his graduate to General Psychology, earning Masters Degrees in experimental psychology and medical education and Counseling. He was a member of a Freudian clinic in Southern California. He spent almost a year studying hypnosis at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute in Los Angeles and also studied hypnosis at the University of California, Irvine. Miller possessed Ph.D.s in both clinical psychology and human behavior and was a Postdoctoral researcher in Criminal Justice. Some of his techniques blended Reichian physiotherapy and tantric yoga. He also incorporated hypnosis alongside his bodywork with patients and students. According to his website: \\"He left academia and state sponsored psychology to become an explorer of the human mind.\\" ==Death== Hyatt died of cancer in Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 64. ==Works== * Undoing Yourself with Energized Meditation and Other Devices.

This battle opened the campaign that led to American victory in the Revolutionary War. The loss by the British in this battle contributed to their surrender at Yorktown seven months later. The battlefield is preserved as a National Military Park and operated by the National Park Service (NPS). Based on research of historical evidence, the interpretation of the battle has changed since the late 20th century, which will affect the placement of monuments and markers. ==Battlefield preservation== In 1886, local resident David Schenck initiated plans to gain control of land to commemorate the Guilford Courthouse battleground as a park. The following year, he chartered the non-profit Guilford Battle Ground Company (GBGC) to advance such efforts. From an early date, he planned on the group's donating the property it purchased to the federal government. When the US Congress finally established Guilford Courthouse as a national military park in 1917, the GBGC turned over its at no charge. Without David Schenck's generosity, it is entirely possible that the park would not exist today. Dedication of Monument to members of the Maryland Line at the Battle of Guilford Court House, Maryland Historical Society, 15 October 1892 Although generous in starting the park, the years of control by the GBGC left a mixed legacy. First, Schenck did not preserve the terrain in its approximate historical state, but beautified the landscape for a pleasing experience. Before the grounds were established as a military park, state historical societies began to erect monuments in the area purchased by the GBGC. Although well-meant, these monuments and interpretations were not based on researched evidence and were often constructed in convenient, if inaccurate, locations. Contrasting National Park Service maps reflect the changing official historiography of the battle. This 1998 map still adheres to the interpretation based on Schenck. Second, he adopted an interpretation of the battle that encompassed a much smaller area than is indicated by contemporary accounts. Historians believe his limited funds, coupled with landowners' demanding top dollar, influenced his interpretation. This mis-led researchers and historical groups who relied on his work; they placed historical monuments and markers in the wrong spots. It also hampered government efforts to acquire land or resist development in areas outside the original area designated as battleground by Schenck. Since his time, the expanding city of Greensboro approached and encircled the park with private development, destroying some battlefield areas. When the National Park Service assumed responsibility for the park, their historians and researchers sought to clarify the accuracy of the locations of the battle. The renewed accuracy places many of the monuments in locations that had very little reference to the actual battle. A current map shows a larger battlefield. In particular, the American third line has been moved back, and the last shots of the battle have been placed further south, in Greensboro Country Park. Today, the National Park Service has moved beyond Schenck's interpretation of the battle with a more researched understanding of the battle's events. It hopes to reconstruct the battlefield and its monuments to be consistent with historical evidence. A revived Guilford Battleground Company supports preservation efforts for Guilford Courthouse National Military Park and Colonial Heritage Center, where British forces assembled for their advance. The park is linked by a bicycle path to the adjoining Greensboro Country Park, and residents use both for jogging and cycling. William Hooper, signer of the Declaration of Independence monument Nathanael Greene statue at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park ==Administrative history== The military park was established on March 2, 1917. It was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service August 10, 1933. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the military park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, when it was established. The park's nomination was substantially updated in 1996, and in 2001 it was designated a National Historic Landmark. ==See also== * Battle of Guilford Court House * Guilford Court House, North Carolina * Hoskins House Historic District * List of National Historic Landmarks in North Carolina * National Register of Historic Places listings in Guilford County, North Carolina ==References== ==Sources== * The National Parks: Index 2001-2003.

It consists primarily of guitarist and vocalist Keith Murray and bass guitarist Chris Cain, with drummer Keith Carne joining the band in the studio and for live performances since 2013. The band have released six studio albums, not including their early release Safety, Fun, and Learning (In That Order), which the band have gone on to describe as more of a rough draft, than a proper album. The band's breakthrough success came with their debut studio album, With Love and Squalor, which sold 100,000 copies in the first six months. This was followed by the releases of Brain Thrust Mastery in 2008, Barbara in 2010, TV en Français in 2014, Helter Seltzer in 2016 and Megaplex in 2018. As well as music, Keith and Chris are known for their comedy, often injecting humour into their interviews, press-releases and off-the-cuff jokes at their live shows. This has been carried over as part of producing many of their own music video treatments and their 2009 series of television shorts Steve Wants His Money made for MTV, as well as a podcast series titled Dumpster Dive in 2020. ==History== ===2000-2004: Formation and Safety, Fun, and Learning=== Keith Murray and Chris Cain met in 1997 whilst attending Pomona College in Claremont, California. Keith had just transferred to Pomona and Chris was holding a Dawson's Creek viewing party and quickly bonded over a mutual love of stand-up comedy, film and television. In late 1999, after graduating and moving to Berkeley, California, they hatched the idea for the band. Murray, Cain along with their roommate, Scott Lamb, who was also a fellow alum from Pomona College cofounded the group. Lamb originally played guitar and provided vocals, whilst Cain played bass and Murray played drums as well as handling vocals. The three of them chose the name We Are Scientists, after renting a truck from U-Haul. When they returned it, the inspector, after looking them up and down and assessing their wardrobe, asked if they were scientists. Some publications later claimed their band name to be a reference to a Cap'n Jazz song of the same name, whilst others believing it to be a homage to the Guided by Voices track \\"I Am a Scientist\\", both of which the band have unequivocally denied. Touching on the subject in their Dumpster Dive podcast, Cain jested \\"I can say that pretty unequivocally that if we had known of Cap'n Jazz at the time of naming our band, we would not have named it We Are Scientists.\\". When it came to songwriting, Keith, Scott and Chris' were particularly influenced by films, comic books, with many of their earliest songs about fighting monsters. Keith and Chris moved to the Los Angeles area in late 2000, without Scott, recruiting Michael Tapper, whom they'd known during their time at Pomona, and who was in his last year at adjoining Harvey Mudd College. Michael would take drums over from Keith, who would now be the band's vocalist and guitarist, whilst Cain would continue playing bass. Moving again, the band relocated to Brooklyn, New York in 2001 and began recording material in November, 2001. The band finished recording in January 2002, completing 12 tracks - two of which credit former member Scott Lamb. The releases title was announced on March 14, 2002 on the band's official website as Safety, Fun, and Learning (In That Order) for release in April 2002 through the band's own label, Devious Semantics. Due to issues with setting up their own label, it wasn't until June that the band were able to release the record. The summer saw them reunite with original vocalist Scott Lamb. In October after several months of performing in California and New York, amongst other places the band recorded their first EP, available originally only at live shows Bitching! was released on October 14, 2002, and featured 6 tracks. Later Bitching! was made available online on January 16, 2003. In March 2003 the band announced they would be heading to the recording studio with Paolo DeGregorio on April 1 to record a second EP; In Action, which was released through MotherWest records in October 2003, featuring 6 tracks. A year after recording In Action the band headed once more to the recording studio with Los Angeles-based producer Chris Fudurich, where they recorded rough versions of \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"Scene Is Dead\\" and \\"This Means War\\", which would make up half of the band's final independently released EP The Wolf's Hour, other tracks included \\"Callbacks Under The Sea\\", \\"Inaction\\" and \\"Nobody Move, Nobody Gets Hurt\\". The EP was released on November 26, 2004. ===2005-2006: With Love and Squalor and breakthrough success=== Keith Murray, Chris Cain and Michael Tapper performing live in 2006, Mainz, Germany. On January 11, 2005 the band began the recording of their first, proper full-length album in Los Angeles with Ariel Rechtshaid and engineering from Rob Brill. The band ended their time in the studio on February 23, throughout their time in the studio the band posted blogs on their official website, many of which told of a cat called Lewis, which would later be used on the album's artwork. Having recorded the album, the band decided to sign to Virgin Records to handle to release. On May 15, 2005, the first single from the album was aired in the UK, \\"Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt\\", this came after a number of dates in the UK with Editors. \\"Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt\\" was released later on June 27 at the same time as their own headline Summer 2005 UK tour. In July the band shot a music video for their second single, \\"The Great Escape\\", as well as appearing on MTV2 for the first time to plug their upcoming release. The band also appeared on at Reading and Leeds Festivals for the first time, performing on the Carling Stage, and later the band released the album With Love and Squalor in the United Kingdom on October 17, 2005 celebrating with an album signing session and intimate gig in London's Selectdisc on Berwick Street. In December 2005 the band made their U.S. Network television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman where they performed \\"Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt\\", as well as announcing the release of their debut album, With Love and Squalor which would be released on January 10, 2006, although in January the band would be in the United Kingdom on the NME Shockwaves Tour with Mystery Jets, Arctic Monkeys and Maxïmo Park, before embarking on their own headline tour in April and releasing \\"Its a Hit\\" on February 20 and re-releasing \\"Nobody Move, Nobody Gets Hurt\\" on May 3. In September a co-headline tour across the US with Art Brut and a new split single with Art Brut covering W.A.S single \\"The Great Escape\\" and in-turn We Are Scientists covering Art Brut's \\"Bang Bang Rock & Roll\\". With their ongoing success in the United Kingdom the band embarked on another full 15 date tour, with two nights at Brixton Academy in London due to demand, it was on this tour that the band released Crap Attack, a compilation album of B-sides and covers, as well as a DVD featuring music videos for all of the tracks on With Love and Squalor and live performances. ===2007-2008: Departure of Michael Tapper and Brain Thrust Mastery=== Keith and Chris after the departure of Tapper remained as the only two official members until Andy Burrows joined in 2009 In January 2007 Murray announced that he had begun working on the band's follow-up to With Love and Squalor in Brooklyn, New York, previewing \\"Impatience\\" and \\"Spoken For\\" later that month. During a UK tour that February they debuted the songs \\"Dinosaurs\\", \\"Chick Lit\\" and \\"Best Behavior\\". Recording of the new album began on June 11 in California with Ariel Rechtshaid and ended on July 19. That August the band made their second appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, performing on the Radio One Stage. September 2007 saw the band hire Max Hart as an additional guitarist and keyboard player for live performances. The addition of Hart was to fit the larger arrangements of new material. Days before the tour was due to start, drummer Michael Tapper quit the band. Gary Powell and Adam Aaronson took over from Tapper for the remainder of the tour. For eight of their November tour dates the band acted as their own support act, conducting \\"self-improvement seminars\\" under the name Brain Thrust Mastery. After Virgin merged in 2007, the band were now signed to EMI. Murray stated that the band had to deal with a lot of bureaucracy recording the new album, with EMI unhappy that they were working with producer Ariel Rechtshaid; who at the time was relatively unknown. EMI instead tried setting the band up with various \\"cheesy, cheesy, big producers who we didn't like at all\\". Ultimately, against their labels wishes the band did record with Rechtshaid and in March 2008 the band announced that Brain Thrust Mastery would also be the name of their new album. Garrett Ray handled drum duties for the album. The first single from the record, \\"After Hours\\", was to be released on March 3 in the UK. The album was previewed a week before its UK release on NME.com. It came out in the United States on May 13. \\"Chick Lit\\" was released as the second single from Brain Thrust Mastery on June 9, coinciding with performances at The Great Escape Festival, Oxegen Festival Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and Reading and Leeds on the main stage, and a consequent North American tour in July. In the latter part of 2008 the band toured the US as support to Kings of Leon in the USA. \\"Impatience\\" was the final single from the album, released on October 27. ===2009-2011: Steve Wants His Money TV shorts and Barbara=== Andy Burrows joined the band for the recording of Barbara and some of the subsequent live shows. In October 2009, Chris Cain and Keith Murray co-created a short television series for MTV, titled Steve Wants His Money. The series premiered on October 25, 2009 during the Lil MTV was created with MTV production company Ja Digital. The series focuses around We Are Scientists playing fictional versions of themselves, owing an American man, Steve, money and consequently running away to England where they attempt to sell off various marketing ideas to musicians, journalists, music DJs and promoters. The band had hoped to make a second series, however it ultimately did not materialise.Lil' MTV › Episodes › We Are Scientists mtv.co.uk, November 18, 2009C: ...that last night's episode of SWH$ was the *penultimate* -- not final -- episode. (We're 80% sure.) Chris Cain on Twitter, November 30, 2009 Having worked with a number of different drummers since Michael Tapper's departure in 2007, the band announced that Andy Burrows would be joining them for recording and touring. The band had originally intended on using a succession of drummers on their third album; however after Burrows left his band Razorlight, he became their permanent drummer. In February 2010 they announced that their new record would be titled Barbara and would be released on June 14, 2010. This would also be the first release through the band's own label, Master Swan Recordings, with distribution handled by PIAS Recordings. Burrows made his live debut with the band at a surprise NME awards show at Camden Barfly on February 21, 2010. Demonstrating the more stripped-back guitar-centric sound of Barbara, the band were now performing predominately as a three-piece, without Max Hart, although Hart amongst other musicians would occasionally feature at live shows for performances of \\"After Hours\\". As Burrows was involved in a number of other projects, the band hired Danny Allen to perform and tour with them, with Allen occasionally handling keyboards at shows where Burrows was drumming. The band released their first single from Barbara on April 5, 2010, titled \\"Rules Don't Stop\\", which peaked at number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. A second single \\"Nice Guys\\" was released on June 7, the week before the release of album Barbara. The band would make appearances at a number of major festivals that summer, including T in the Park, Glastonbury Festival and Reading and Leeds Festivals. Days after the album release on June 10, 2010, the band released their World Cup Anthem \\"Goal! England!\\" in support of the England national team's campaign in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. As well as releasing the single, the band launched their website for the song goalengland.co.uk/, with videos of the recording. In August 2010, We Are Scientists and Ash notably co- headlined two show in Australia as well as performing at Splendour in the Grass in Woodford, Queensland. At their two co-headline shows the bands came together to form WASH; performing a number of covers together as an encore set. A year later the two bands came together again to release a cover of a track called \\"Washington Parks\\" by Robert Manning. The track was covered to help raise money for Multiple Sclerosis Society. The final single to be taken from Barbara was \\"I Don't Bite\\" which was released on October 11, 2010. ===2011-2014: Business Casual and TV en Français=== Keith Carne joined the band as their live and studio drummer in 2013. A new album was first teased by the band at The Isle of Weight Festival 2011, where Murray suggested the band would be recording in Autumn that year. It was in 2012 that the band actually began recording new material, working with producer Chris Coady in New York City, where both Keith Murray & Chris Cain reside. The band worked in a number of New York studios, predominately The Magic Shop, DNA Studio and Ash's home studio Atomic Heart. In December 2012 that drummer Andy Burrows confirmed that they had finished work on their new album, with intent to release in early 2013. Due to the fact the band had recorded without a record label, and had also fired their management after Barbara, the band then spent a lot of 2013 label shopping and looking for new management. Realising they would be unable to put the album out that year, the band released a two-track single featuring the songs \\"Something About You\\" and \\"Let Me Win\\". The single was released through their own record label Master Swan Records and Neon Gold Records on July 16. New material was further previewed across a string of UK tour dates in July. Eventually the band signed to release the finished album with 100% Records, putting out a teaser EP titled Business Casual on October 14, 2013. The EP includes lead singles \\"Return the Favor\\" and \\"Dumb Luck\\" along with album off cut \\"Good Answer\\", a demo of new track \\"Courage\\" and a cover of Berlin's \\"Take My Breath Away\\" - which features occasional scientist Max Hart on pedal-steel guitar. Andy Burrows had recorded drums for the album and subsequent EP and singles, but by the time the band were eventually able to release and tour Burrows was busy with his solo-career. This led to Keith Carne taking over the majority of live commitments, with Burrows stepping in for occasional dates, depending on his availability. In January 2014, the band announced that the album would finally be released on March 3, 2014 through 100% Records and would be titled TV en Français. Accompanying the album announcement was the music video for new single \\"Dumb Luck\\". Soon after the announcement the band revealed another new track titled \\"Make it Easy\\", which was made available to download to those who pre-ordered the album. On February 9, 2014 the band performed \\"Make It Easy\\" acoustically on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch. The band appeared for a third time on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 21, 2015, performing single \\"Make It Easy\\". Across the summer, the band performed at Rock Am Ring in Germany, Godiva Festival, T in the Park and Reading and Leeds festival 2014 in the United Kingdom. In support of their co-headline tour with Surfer Blood, the band recorded a new track titled \\"Distillery\\" which would accompany a new Surfer Blood track on a split- single, available at shows on the tour. As part of Record Store Day 2015 the band would release TV en Français, Sous la Mer through Dine Alone Records. TV en Français, Under the Sea would feature eight reworked tracks from TV en Français, with a stripped back arrangement. The reworked version \\"Overreacting\\" was released as a music video on 8 April 2015. ===2015-2017: Helter Seltzer=== On March 18, 2016, the band released their new single \\"Buckle\\", announcing that it was the first offering from their upcoming fifth studio album Helter Seltzer. The band had been recording new material with \\"occasional-scientist\\" Max Hart, who previously joined the band during the Brian Thrust Mastery era as touring guitarist & keyboard player. The second single, \\"Too Late\\", from their upcoming album was released on April 2, 2016, with third single \\"Classic Love\\" arriving on April 14, 2016. The band's fifth studio album, Helter Seltzer, was released on April 22, 2016 and was followed at the end of April, through to May with a tour of the United Kingdom. On May 6, the band performed \\"Buckle\\", \\"In My Head\\" and \\"Too Late\\" on BT Sport's Football Tonight show. The following month on June 30, 2016 they performed \\"Buckle\\" on CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In July, the band put out a music video for Helter Seltzer track \\"In My Head\\". ===2018-present: Megaplex, Dumpster Dive podcast and \\"I Cut my Own Hair\\"=== On February 5, 2018 the band released their new single \\"On In, One Out\\". This was accompanied by the news that their sixth studio album, Megaplex would be released on April 27, 2018. Prior to the album's release, single \\"Your Light Has Changed\\" was released on 15 March 2018 and then \\"Heart is a Weapon on May 20, 2018. Touring the United Kingdom in promotion of the record took place across March, April and May 2018. Keith and Chris wrote the majority of the album's tracks in sessions for a songwriting club called 'Song Challenge', with Cain describing it as a collective who compete to each write 10 songs in 8 hours and drink beer. The collective also includes Tim Wheeler from Ash, Annie Hart from Au Revoir Simone and MGMT's Simon O'Connor. Megaplex was once again produced by Occasional Scientist Max Heart, and recorded across various sessions in 2017 in New York City. On February 15, 2019, the band released \\"Second Acts\\". They went on to announce Megaplex: Rise of the Lycans, a deluxe version of the album Megaplex, containing new songs, acoustic Under the Sea versions and demos. The compilation was released on 19 April 2019. The release was supported by a tour across the United States supporting Snow Patrol. For Record Store Day on April 13, 2019 We Are Scientists teamed up with Art Brut to release a mini-album WASABI, featuring We Are Scientists covering two Art Brut songs and vice versa, as well as some unreleased tracks by Art Brut. The band celebrated the 15th anniversary of debut record With Love and Squalor, reissuing the album on vinyl on 17 October 2019. The reissue was followed by several dates performing the album in its entirety across Europe, in Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Berlin, Munich and Amsterdam, followed by four dates in the United Kingdom in December 2019. The anniversary celebrations continued with the release of an acoustic version of the album titled With Love And Squalor Live In Woodstock 1969 on 6 December 2019. In later 2019, when discussing new material Chris stated that they had a considerable amount of material to choose from, and were in the process of trying to decide what style the album would centre around, revealing that they had hard-rock record, or a mid-tempo electronic-pop record, amongst others to choose from. In March 2020 as lockdown began for COVID-19, the band started a podcast series centred around dissecting their old material, but often spiralling out into random topics, called the Dumpster Dive. During the first months of lockdown, the band also put out regular live streams on Instagram, featuring them discussing all manner of topics and performing their tracks. On May 21, 2020, We Are Scientists appeared on Jo Whiley's BBC Radio 2 show, premiering their new single \\"I Cut My Own Hair\\". Having been in the midst of recording together in a New York City studio when lockdown was enforced, the band returned to their separate homes, having completed work on two new tracks intended for their seventh album. With the album still months away from completion, they had originally not intended on showcasing their work so soon, especially given the challenges of trying to separately continue their work outside of the studio. Keith and Chris had not been influenced to write \\"I Cut My Own Hair\\" as a result of the Coronavirus disease, and in fact had crafted the song long before the pandemic and resulting lockdown, however, with many people resorting to cutting their own hair in lockdown, the band felt that the song had a new, different resonance and decided it was a fitting time to release the single. On May 22, they made \\"I Cut My Own Hair\\" available to stream and download, as well as releasing some merchandise to accompany the single. The track was also released in conjunction with the Big Buzz Off campaign, part of Mental Health Awareness Week 2020 for the charity Campaign Against Living Miserably. The music video created by Keith and Chris, features them both cutting their own hair and was followed up with posts encouraging fans to post videos of themselves cutting their own hair to the new song. ==Style and performance== We Are Scientists performing in Guildford, United Kingdom in 2016. Before their debut album, their earliest material often drew inspiration for lyrics from comic books and films, whilst the music drew from more punk influences. Keith Murray has cited the influence of such performers as The Rapture and David Bowie on their debut album. The band has noted that tracks on With Love and Squalor were largely written to be performed live, whilst Brain Thrust Mastery was a more specifically studio effort. Older influences include Brian Eno, Velvet Underground, My Bloody Valentine and David Bowie's Berlin era as well as Hall & Oates and Fleetwood Mac. Murray and Cain are known for incorporating comedy into their live performances, music videos and when giving interviews. British magazine God Is In The TV put forward that Keith Murray and Chris Cain demonstrated \\"sarcasm and wit not normally found coming from two of our American cousins\\", going on to put forward that this may have been lost in translation when the band first emerged to prominence in 2005. Writing for The Independent, Ben Walsh wrote \\"they are incorrigible wags, who are refreshingly willing to riff on any given topic\\". Their live and interview \\"banter\\" is always off-the-cuff, with Murray insisting that the thought of ever rehearsing or reusing material makes him \\"cringe\\". The band come up with the majority of their music video concepts themselves. Earlier in the band's career the band frequently collaborated on music videos and other video content with Akiva Schaffer of The Lonely Island. ==Members== Since the departure of Michael Tapper in 2007, We Are Scientists has primarily consisted of just Keith Murray and Chris Cain. Drummer Keith Carne has featured since 2013 in the studio, at live shows and in promotions such as music videos, with Murray stating \\"we really consider him a part of the band\\", going on to joke that \\"it’s the two of us, and then our drummer Keith Carne. That’s the real issue—having another Keith in the band.

The band has released twelve albums and over 35 singles to date with various songs and albums gaining platinum status. They are known for winning the first ever Eurodance competition in 2001 and their various hits throughout the years. ==History== ===1996-1997: Beginnings and Vatra i led=== Colonia was founded in 1996 by Boris Đurđević and Tomislav Jelić, two DJs from Vinkovci, Croatia. As the two of them did not sing, they later hired Indira \\"Ira\\" Vladić (from Županja) to become their vocalist. The name of the group comes from the ancient Latin name of the Croatian town Vinkovci which was \\"Colonia Aurelia Cibalae\\". The first commercial release by the group was \\"Nek' vatre gore sve\\" in 1996. The song was sent to radio stations all over Croatia and enjoyed moderate success. The next single released was \\"Sve oko mene je grijeh\\" which charted on the Croatian the national charts and became a hit. Colonia soon signed with the record company Crno-bijeli svijet (CBS), which facilitated the release their 1997 debut album Vatra i led which sold over 40,000 copies. ===1998-2001: Dora and Croatia Records=== In 1998, Colonia entered HRT Dora, the Croatian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest with hopes to be the Croatian representative at the yearly song contest. At the final, held on March 6, 1998, the group placed fourth with the song \\"U ritmu ljubavi\\" having gained 87 points. The voting was tallied using 20 juries, one from each Croatian province, and a 21st jury consisting of viewer televoting. A few months later, Colonia won a prize for the song \\"Lady Blue\\" at Melodije hrvatskog Jadrana (Melodies of the Adriatic), an annual music festival. Then in 1999, Colonia released their next single \\"Njeno ime ne zovi u snu\\" and soon after their second studio album Ritam ljubavi. Colonia soon became one of the best selling musical groups in Croatia, and switched record labels, signing with Croatia Records. With Croatia Records, Colonia released their third studio album titled Jača nego ikad which is their first album to be released in all Former Yugoslav republics. The song \\"Budi mi zbogom\\" was entered into the Croatian Radio Festival where it won second place and a cover version of \\"Deja vu\\" by the Japanese group KinKi Kids had great success in Asia reaching #1 on the charts. \\"Sexy Body\\" became a dance floor hit, was released in 2001 by Balloon Records in Austria on a compilation album and entered the DJ dance charts. Colonia's fourth studio album Milijun milja od nigdje was released in 2001 and sold 50,000 copies in Croatia and over 300,000 worldwide making it the best-selling album in Croatia. The album was also released in all Former Yugoslav republics. The single \\"Za tvoje snene oči\\" won the Croatian Radio Festival and became a summer hit and the most played song in 2001. The song was also entered into the first annual \\"Eurodance\\" contest in 2001 where it became the first winner. The album was later re-released as a thank you to fans as an LP with the original songs and new remixes. ===2002-2003: Continued success=== In 2002, Colonia released their fifth album Izgubljeni svijet which features 13 new tracks and a DVD with their biography, discography, and music videos.

In 2003, the album Dolazi oluja was released and its first single \\"C'est la vie\\" won the Croatian Radio Festival, Colonia's third win in a row. Milijun milja od nigdje and Izgubljeni Svijet were released in Slovakia and the Czech Republic where they reached number on the music charts. In December 2003, Colonia received three \\"Music Box\\" awards, one for \\"Best International Performer\\" and two for \\"Best Song\\". Both albums were released in all Former Yugoslav republics, though Izgubljeni svijet was released only as an audio CD in these countries. ===2004: International releases=== In January 2004, an English version of \\"Za tvoje snene oči\\" was released as \\"A Little Bit of Uh La La\\" with lyrics by Mary Susan Applegate, who had previously written for Celine Dion, La Bouche, and No Mercy. The song was released in vinyl, as a CD single, and on numerous compilations albums in over 36 countries. \\"A Little Bit of Uh La La\\" was also popular on the charts reaching number one on the Canadian Dance Chart.

The album was also released in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. \\"Najbolje od svega\\" was the first album in six years not to be released in all Former Yugoslav republics, though it still fared well in their charts. During Summer 2006, Colonia went on a tour with the name \\"Gastro club turneja\\" promoting Najbolje od svega, playing in 22 cities. The tour started on July 19, 2006 in Umag, Croatia and ended on October 15, 2006 in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Colonia's last album with Croatia Records was Gold Edition, a compilation album containing their popular hits from their career at Croatia Records such as \\"Za tvoje snene oči\\", \\"Oduzimaš mi dah\\" and \\"Plamen od ljubavi\\". The album also includes 13 previously unreleased remixes. ===2006-2007: Do kraja=== On December 5, 2006, Colonia released their eighth studio album Do kraja, a modern dance album with Balkan and Croatian elements, after signing with Menart Records.

The single \\"Pogledom me skini\\" was released with three remixes and music video. The song competed in the Croatian national selection for the OGAE Song Contest 2007, coming in fourth with 32 points. The contest is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest, but run by OGAE, the official fan club.

The westside Los Angeles residential community of Bel Air is named after him, as well as the Southern California communities of Bell and Bell Gardens. ==Family and background== Bell was a native and lifelong resident of Los Angeles, whose family had deep financial and historical ties to the area, and played a key role in the history and development of Southern California. He was the son of James George Bell, who established Bell Station Ranch (now the site of the City of Bell), in the Santa Fe Springs area in 1875, and of Susan Albiah Hollenbeck. His uncle, Ed Hollenbeck, who arrived in California in the 1850s, founded the First National Bank, created Los Angeles's public transportation trolley system, and developed eastern portions of Los Angeles County. After attending Occidental College, which had been founded by his father in 1887, and graduating at the top of his class as valedictorian in 1895, Bell enrolled at San Anselmo Presbyterian College for two years (he did not return for 3rd year). In 1902 he married Minnewa Shoemaker Bell, a native of Kansas. Bell's son, Alphonzo E. Bell, Jr., later served eight terms as a California Congressman. Bell's daughter, Minnewa Bell Gray Burnside Ross, married Elliott Roosevelt, son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1951. ==Tennis achievements== While in college the senior Bell was Inter-Collegiate Tennis Champion, and later Pacific Coast Tennis Champion, who at one time earned national rankings of fifth in singles and eighth in doubles. Known for his \\"net-rusher\\" style, Bell went on to win two medals in tennis at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis – a bronze in the men's singles event, and a silver in the men's doubles tournament, partnering with Robert LeRoy. ==Oil, real estate & other business ventures== After striking oil on their ranch at Santa Fe Springs, Bell entered the oil business with his father in the early 1920s, establishing the Bell Petroleum Co., and developing what became one of the richest oil fields in California. With the ensuing California oil boom, or \\"black-gold\\" rush, competition from various less scrupulous large oil companies was fierce—several of whom, along with William Randolph Hearst, tried to drive the more honest Bell's smaller operation out of business—a saga documented in the fictionalized account by writer Upton Sinclair in a 1927 novel Oil!, also the basis for the 2007 movie, There Will Be Blood. Bell, known for his almost puritanical morality and honesty, used portions of his initial profits to develop upscale real estate communities in West Los Angeles, including parts of Westwood, Beverly Hills, and Pacific Palisades. He became a visionary real estate developer, anticipating the influx of Hollywood elite and other wealthy residents who would be lured by the burgeoning film industry. In 1922, building on over that he had acquired, Bell founded Bel Air Estates, an exclusive and upscale neighborhood now known as Bel-Air, enhancing the surrounding area with lush vegetation, new roads, and utilities; designed, laid out and developed the Bel-Air Country Club and the Bel Air Bay Club; The Riviera Country Club also owes its inception to Bell*. According to Claude Wayne, Bell went to see the late Frank Garbutt of the Los Angeles Athletic Club and told him that he would give the land free if Garbutt would build the club.(*Alphonzo E. Bell: a Biography by John O Pohlmann ) While many such clubs thrived on sales of bootleg liquor during the years of Prohibition, Bell refused to allow the sale of illegal spirits in any of his clubs or establishments, which lost him some membership. William Randolph Hearst's longstanding vendetta with Bell had started when Bell refused to sell a homesite to Hearst for a home to house his silent-film-star mistress, Marion Davies in Bell's Bel-Air Estates development. For themselves and their young extended family, Bell and his wife Minnewa in 1921 built a showplace 42-room house on in portions of the areas that are now Bel Air and Pacific Palisades which they called ' (Italian for \\"Top of the Hill\\"). Today nothing of the house remains, except for some of the terraced gardens and rock walls, and their former horse riding stables, which now constitute a portion of the Bel-Air Hotel – with what was once the Bell stable's manure barn, now one of the favorite celebrity guest suites. In 1926, Bell provided land in Bel Air to the proposed location of UCLA in Westwood. The deeds for the land granted to the university had strict racial provisions and dictated: > 5\\\\. That neither the whole nor any part of said premises shall be sold, > rented or leased to any person of Ethiopian, Chinese or Japanese descent, > nor shall the same be occupied by any such person excepting as a professor > or instructor of the University of California or a member of his family, > excepting also as a servant or employee of the person using said premises > exclusively for residential purposes. ==Philanthropy== Throughout his lifetime, and just prior to his death in 1947, as well as in his will, Alphozo Bell, Sr. gave the larger share of his wealth to various charities – including Occidental College, University of California, Los Angeles, the L.A. Presbyterian Church, and other church groups and charitable organizations. Today, he is honored by memorial tributes to him at – among others – Occidental College, UCLA, and the Bel-Air Country Club. ==References== ==External links== * Category:American company founders Category:American energy industry executives Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles Category:1875 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Land owners from California Category:Medalists at the 1904 Summer Olympics Category:Philanthropists from California Category:People from Bel Air, Los Angeles Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:American male tennis players Category:Tennis people from California Category:Occidental College alumni Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in tennis Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States in tennis Category:Olympic tennis players of the United States Category:Tennis players at the 1904 Summer Olympics Category:20th- century American businesspeople ","title":"Alphonzo Bell"},{"id":"2569222","text":"Childebrand I (678 - 751 or 743) was a Frankish duke (dux), illegitimate son of Pepin of Heristal and Alpaida, and brother Charles Martel.

It had 85 inhabitants as of 2005. Permafrost is common around the village albeit this low altitude permafrost is disappearing because of global warming and increased snowfall. == Transportation == Daily passenger electric trains run by SJ AB connect Stockholm with the Norwegian city of Narvik, stopping at both the Abisko village (the name of that railway station is Abisko Östra [east]) and the Abisko Turiststation. Additional regional trains provide links along the Kiruna-Narvik stretch. Abisko is also reachable by car via the highway E10 which has linked Kiruna and Narvik since the early 1980s. Other local forms of transportation include hiking and dog-sledding in winter. A chair-lift provides access to a point below the summit of nearby Mt. Nuolja. == Tourism == The 425 kilometer-long Kungsleden hiking trail, which follows the Scandinavian mountain range, starts (or ends) at the Abisko Turiststation (consisting of a railway station of the same name and the Abisko Youth Hostel) (approx. 4 km west of the village itself) and follows through the national park. The Nordkalottruta uses trails of the park as part of its longer passage. The Abisko Turiststation, run by the Svenska Turistföreningen (STF), houses many visitors to the park and provides lodging, food, and other amenities, and is one of many similar facilities located periodically along the Kungsleden trail. The national park is known for its Cross-country skiing opportunities, snowshoeing, and other winter sports (Mount Nuolja and nearby Björkliden provides Backcountry skiing and freeriding opportunities). As its location is 195 km north of the Arctic Circle, summer hikers enjoy the midnight sun, while winter visitors may find the light pollution-free location ideal for viewing the aurora borealis. One of the most recognized natural sights is Lapporten, a U-shaped valley visible from Abisko.

Reconvilier village in 1919 Aerial view (1949) Reconvilier is first mentioned in 884 as Roconis villare. In German it is known as Rokwiler. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are two ceramic and three bronze bowls which probably come from a Roman villa from the 2nd or 3rd century. In 884, the village appears as an estate belonging to Moutier-Grandval Abbey. The noble Reconvilier family appears in historical records beginning in the 12th century and lasting until the 15th. The village remained under the Abbey's control until it was secularized around 1531. Then Reconvilier came under the authority of the provost of Moutier-Grandval who represented the Prince-Bishop of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Reconvilier became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible.

The current parish church was built as a village church in 1740. It was renovated in 1924-26 and again in 1992. Industry began to move into the village in the second half of the 19th century. In 1851 the watch parts factory Bueche, Boillat et Cie opened. In 1876 a station on the Basel-Biel railroad opened in Reconvilier. The convenient transportation link allowed the village to expand into an important watchmaking center. The Bueche, Boillat et Cie company changed their name to Générale Watch Co in 1895 and until 1975 it sold Helvetia brand watches. In 1853, the Société horlogère was created.

Even while the glass factory was in operation, the village remained generally agrarian. In 1876 the Basel-Moutier railroad opened a station in Roches and the village became a local industrial center.

The latter movement instituted a military dictatorship known as Ditadura Nacional (national dictatorship) that would be followed by the corporatist Estado Novo (new state) regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. The sixteen years of the First Republic saw nine presidents and 44 ministries, and were altogether more of a transition between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Estado Novo than they were a coherent period of governance. == Religion == The First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. The leaders of the Republic were secularists and, indeed, were following liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, \\"The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualist middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.\\"Payne, A history of Spain and Portugal (1973) 2: 559 Under the leadership of Afonso Costa, the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 October – five days after the inauguration of the Republic – the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship. A series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by Afonso Costa culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911. The republicans were anticlerical and had a \\"hostile\\" approach to the issue of church and state separation, like that of the French Revolution, and the future Mexican Constitution of 1917 and Spanish Constitution of 1931. On 24 May 1911, Pope Pius X issued the encyclical Iamdudum which condemned the anticlericalism of the new republic for its deprivation of religious civil liberties and the \\"incredible series of excesses and crimes which has been enacted in Portugal for the oppression of the Church.\\"IAMDUDUM: ON THE LAW OF SEPARATION IN PORTUGAL Papal Encyclicals Online The Republic repelled a royalist attack on Chaves in 1912. ==Heads of state and government== The First Portuguese Republic was an unstable period in the History of Portugal. In a period of 16 years (1910–1926) Portugal had 8 Presidents of the Republic, 1 Provisional Government, 38 Prime Ministers and 1 Constitutional Junta: ==Evaluation of the republican experiment and legacy== Most historians have emphasized the failure and collapse of the republican dream by the 1920s. José Miguel Sardica in 2011 summarized the consensus of historians: Portuguese flag dates back to the First Republic. Sardica, however, also points up the lasting effects of the republican experiment: ==References== ==Further reading== * Leal, Ernesto Castro. \\"Parties and political identity: the construction of the party system of the Portuguese Republic (1910–1926).\\" E-journal of Portuguese History 7#1 (2009): 37–44.

It can set parameters such as drive caches, sleep mode, power management, acoustic management, and DMA settings. GParted and Parted Magic both include hdparm. Changing hardware parameters from suboptimal conservative defaults to their optimal settings can improve performance greatly. For example, turning on DMA can, in some instances, double or triple data throughput. There is, however, no reliable method for determining the optimal settings for a given controller-drive combination, except careful trial and error. hdparm has a serious drawback: With certain parameters, it can crash a computer and make data on its disk inaccessible. Several of the 67 parameters are dangerous and could result in massive filesystem corruption if used indiscriminately. == Usage examples == hdparm has to be run with special privileges, otherwise it will either not be found or the requested actions will not be executed properly.

The better way would be to collect small data into bigger chunks and wait until the chunk is big enough to be written to disk. Current web browsers like Chrome write regularly small chunks when browsing in order not to lose any important data when the application crashes. However, this lets the disk spin very often as the drive repeatedly needs to unleash and then park its heads. The generated noises can be thus regarded as distracting by the user. To circumvent this issue, you can switch the drive to the lowest degree of power management (next value, 255, turns power management off): hdparm -B 254 /dev/sda Additionally, changing the value of /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs can have an effect on the performance. It sets the flush interval when dirty pages are written to disk. Note that all these commands are only effective in the long-run, if you make the changes persistent. However, the settings you can set via hdparm are reverted each time you reboot. Therefore, it might be wise to restore the personal settings upon boot.

By the early 20th century watchmaking and sand mining both died out, followed by peat producing in 1945. In 1899 Bellelay Abbey was converted into a psychiatric clinic.

Originally from Colombia, cumbia has been well-known and appreciated in Argentina for a long time, but it gained nationwide scope and attention when it became popular among the lower-class people in main urban centers, the large cities of the Río de la Plata basin, in the 1990s. Among the most important cumbia bands and singers that popularized the genre are Ráfaga, La Nueva Luna, Amar Azul, Gilda, and other traditional cumbia bands like Los Palmeras, Cali and Los Leales. Chocolate had similar success across the water in Uruguay. Most bands are composed of synthesizer keyboards as main instruments, electronic sounds and percussion, and a musical score very charged with vocal harmonies, bells, and trumpets (usually electronically synthesized). ==History== In the 1990s, cumbia first found a place among the working classes, who attended large dancing halls called bailantas, often to listen and watch live concerts by cumbia groups. Some bands, most notably Ráfaga, chose a glamorous style with theatrically presented messages about romantic love and sensuality, hope and despair. Others took to more explicit themes, such as sex, alcohol abuse and the cumbia subculture itself, often in a very light, irreverent style, sometimes intentionally humorous. The rhythm and themes of cumbia then spread to the whole of society, as its romantic and humorous manifestations were adopted to lighten up parties and other social events. Around the beginning of the 2000s, probably influenced by the Argentine economic crisis, romantic cumbia drifted slowly away from the spotlight, while the rest of the bands slowly gave way to the much more aggressive cumbia villera (\\"shantytown cumbia\\") -with lyrics that explored the themes of crime and drug abuse-, which was from the start mostly restricted to the urban lower classes. The musical influences of Cumbia Villera are Peruvian Cumbia and Cumbia Sonidera from Mexico. Over 25 years of history, cumbia in Argentina was heavily influenced by other Argentine folkloric kinds of music, like chamamé, guaracha, and cuarteto. Cumbia songs tell stories about love and experiences of common people. Cumbia in Argentina also has different styles depending on the country region, like norteña, santafesina, cordobesa, sonidera, and other more recent styles like cumbia-rap and cumbia villera. In the present, cumbia bands play electric guitars, bass guitars, electronic percussion and synthesizers, all common instruments of rock bands, and there are also other instruments like bongos, trumpets, accordions, etc... The clothing is also a very important characteristic of cumbia bands. Each band has its own way of dressing, usually all members of the band wear the same special costume or exclusive clothes. In the late 2000s a new brand of cumbia that could be defined as Argentine cumbia became popular in some clubs in Buenos Aires, most notably Zizek Club, led by artists such as El Remolón, Fauna, Chancha via Circuito and Tremor. These artists, who focused on electronic productions featuring the cumbia rhythm, began releasing records largely on the ZZK Records imprintThe Story of ZZK Records - Argentina's Home of Digital Cumbia and achieved some international exposure, with their style of music being labelled as digital cumbia. ==See also== *Music of Argentina * *Cumbia villera ==References== ==External links== * BBC on digital Cumbia Category:Cumbia music by country Category:20th-century music genres Cumbia, Argentina ","title":"Argentine cumbia"},{"id":"2569279","text":"Schelten (La Scheulte in French) is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. This is one of two German speaking municipalities located in the majority French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). The other is Seehof. ==History== Schelten is first mentioned in 1563 as la Schilt. In 1914 it was mentioned as Schelten. For most of its history it was owned by the provost of Moutier-Grandval under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. When many of the nearby cities and towns converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, Schelten remained Catholic along with the sous les Roches region. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Schelten became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Schelten was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village is part of the parish of Mervelier. In 1861 the Chapel of St. Anthony was built in the village. The chapel was restored in 1985–87. Traditionally the village was French speaking, but after it became a part of the Canton of Bern in 1815 the number of German speakers increased. In 1914 its name changed from La Scheulte to Schelten to reflect the growing German speaking population. The village became a stronghold of German culture and generally opposed Jurassic separatism. In the referenda of 1974-75 the population of Schelten voted remain with Bern in contrast to the rest of the neighboring municipalities in the Val Terbi who chose to join the Canton of Jura. ==Geography== Schelten has an area of .

She married journalist and publicist Tex McCrary in 1945.Autobiography: Jinx, Jinx Falkenburg, Duell, Sloan and Pearce (1951) Known as \\"Tex and Jinx\\", the couple pioneered and popularized the talk-show format, first on radio and then in the early days of television. They hosted a series of interview shows in the late 1940s and early 1950s that combined celebrity chit-chat with discussions of important topics of the day. ==Early life== Falkenburg was born to American parents in Barcelona, Spain; her father Eugene \\"Genie\\" Lincoln Falkenburg was an engineer for Westinghouse. Thinking the name would bring good luck, she was nicknamed Jinx by her mother Marguerite \\"Mickey\\" Crooks Falkenburg, an athlete and tennis player (Brazil women's champion in 1927), and the name stuck.\\"Jinx Falkenburg, All American cover girl and actress,\\" Independent newspaper, UK, Sept. 24, 2003 All the Falkenburg offspring became known for their tennis abilities; younger brother Bob won the men's singles championship at Wimbledon in 1948. The family moved to Santiago, Chile, where she spent her early years. She first received media attention at age two when The New York Sun ran a full-page picture and story of her exploits as a \\"baby swimmer.\\" A revolution in Chile caused the family to return to the United States and they moved to Los Angeles, California. She attended Hollywood High School but left in 1935 at the age of 16 to pursue a career in acting and modeling. ==Career== ===Acting and modeling=== Falkenburg on McCall's cover in 1938 The Falkenburgs were at the center of a young social set at the West Side Tennis Club in Hollywood. While playing tennis there, she was noticed by a talent scout for Warner Bros. and was signed to a studio contract. After a few brief walk-ons, her fluency in Spanish won her minor roles in a series of Spanish-language films made for distribution in Latin America. In 1937 her modeling career began when she met celebrity fashion photographer Paul Hesse, whose Sunset Strip studio was a gathering place for advertising moguls and motion picture industry celebrities. Calling her \\"the most charming, most vital personality I have ever had the pleasure to photograph\\", he took her picture for the August 1937 cover of The American Magazine, triggering similar offers from 60 other publications. Falkenburg appeared on over 200 magazine covers and in some 1,500 commercial advertisements in the 1930s and 1940s. She was considered to be one of the most beautiful women of that era, known for her All-American-Girl athletic good looks. The New Yorker magazine said she \\"possessed one of the most photogenic faces and frames in the Western world\\". The New York World-Telegram said her face was seen more often and in more places than any other woman in the country. And a headline story in the January 27, 1941, issue of Life magazine said Falkenburg \\"is the leading candidate for America's No. 1 Girl for 1941\\". Her biggest breakthrough as a model came in 1940 when she was picked by New York-based Liebmann Brewery, maker of Rheingold Beer, to be the first Miss Rheingold. As the face for its marketing and advertising campaign, her image appeared on billboards throughout New York, Pennsylvania, and New England., and she was featured in promotional ads at every store that sold Rheingold. Her face and the campaign were a great success. Rheingold was suddenly the top brand in New York City. A year earlier she was in Hawaii posing for photographer Edward Steichen for a series of ads for the Hawaiian Steamship Company's Matson Line, when she fell through a balcony at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel and landed 30 feet below on a dining room table. While in the hospital recovering from her injuries, she was introduced to singer Al Jolson, who was also convalescing there. Jolson offered her a role in his upcoming Broadway show Hold On to Your Hats, which opened in January 1940. Though her part as a cowgirl was small, she attracted much attention. Fans started gathering nightly at her dressing room door at the Shubert Theater, forming the core of what would become the Jinx Falkenburg Fan Club, the only national fan club not devoted to a movie star. In the early 1940s she did a dozen movies, mainly for Columbia Pictures, sometimes in the starring role. Mostly B movies, neither they nor her acting garnered much critical acclaim. Among them were Two Latins from Manhattan, Sweetheart of the Fleet, Laugh Your Blues Away, She Has What It Takes, Two Senoritas From Chicago, and Nine Girls. The biggest hit was Cover Girl, a musical about the modeling business that starred Rita Hayworth, with songs by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. Falkenburg played herself in a cameo role. ===Tex and Jinx: Radio and television=== Falkenburg met John Reagan \\"Tex\\" McCrary when he came to photograph and interview her for a military publication after she opened in Hold On to Your Hats. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Forces. They were about to be engaged in 1942, but World War II intervened. They married after the war, on June 15, 1945, in a civil ceremony conducted by New York Supreme Court Judge Ferdinand Pecora, famous for investigating the 1929 stock market crash and its aftermath. During the war Falkenburg traveled extensively on USO tours entertaining troops. The most arduous was a 42,000-mile 80-stop series of shows in the rugged China-Burma-India theatre of operations. In 1945 she was awarded the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal for her contributions. Backed by some of his well-connected friends like millionaire statesman Bernard Baruch, McCrary convinced David Sarnoff, the chairman of RCA, which owned NBC, to give the couple a morning show on the network's New York radio station, WEAF. The show was called Hi, Jinx and first aired on April 22, 1946. Reviews ranged from \\"sprightly\\" to \\"rather intense discussions of foreign affairs\\".Newsweek, Vol. 30, 1947 In a cover story about the couple, Newsweek wrote: \\"A soft- spoken, calculating Texan, Tex McCrary, inched up to the microphone and drawled 'Hi, Jinx.' A voice with all the foam substance of a bubble bath answered, 'Hello Tex. Over time they came to be known as \\"Mr. Brains and Mrs. Beauty\\". The McCrarys' radio show was broadcast five mornings a week on New York radio station WEAF and became a hit with critics and the public for tackling controversial issues like the atomic bomb, the United Nations and venereal disease, along with talk about theatre openings and New York nightlife. Their guests were a mix of popular entertainers such as Mary Martin, Ethel Waters and Esther Williams and public figures such as Bernard Baruch, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Truman, industrialist Igor Sikorsky and Indian statesman Krishna Menon.Independent, UK newspaper, Sept. 24, 2003 McCrary wrote the scripts and taught Falkenburg the art of interviewing and the basics of broadcast journalism. Over time she was considered the better interviewer, eliciting candid responses, often from the show's more intellectual guests. Her technique was to ask questions until she understood the answer and so, presumably, did all the housewives at home listening to her. \\"They developed an audience that was ready to start thinking at breakfast\\", wrote New York Times columnist William Safire, who as a teenager was hired by McCrary to do pre-show interviews of guests. In January 1947, McCrary and Falkenburg had their first network TV show, Bristol-Myers Tele- Varieties, also known as Jinx and Tex at Home, broadcast Sunday nights on NBC. The program combined film and live interviews of celebrities in their residences. In May 1947, The Swift Home Service Club combined household tips with breezy interviews. Another radio show, Meet Tex and Jinx got such a big audience that in 1947 and 1948 it became a summer replacement for one of radio's most popular shows, Duffy's Tavern. In the winter of 1948, Falkenburg traveled to Berlin, Germany, during the height of the Berlin Airlift, when the city was under blockade by the Russians and emergency supplies were being flown in by Allied planes. She flew in with comedian Bob Hope and songwriter Irving Berlin to do highly publicized Christmas shows for airmen and occupation soldiers.The Candy Bombers: The Untold Story of the Berlin Airlift, by Andrei Cherny McCrary and Falkenburg's popularity grew, and at one point in the early 1950s they hosted two radio programs and a daily television show and wrote a column for the New York Herald Tribune. Some of their shows were broadcast from the Peacock Alley restaurant in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Armed with tape recorder and microphone, Falkenburg often did interviews outside the studio.Tex McCrary: Wars, Women, Politics: An Adventurous Life across the American Century, by Charles J. Kelly She covered many major stories of the day, including the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London and the wedding of Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier of Monaco. In 1958, she was the only female reporter on the press plane that accompanied then Vice President Richard Nixon on his trip to South America, where he encountered rock-throwing crowds in Venezuela. She also was on assignment and appeared on camera in the historic finger-poking televised \\"kitchen debate\\" in Moscow between Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Safire maneuvered the two leaders into the kitchen of the model home, whose manufacturer was a client of McCrary's, for the confrontation. ==Politics == In 1952, McCrary spearheaded a campaign to get General Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for president on the Republican ticket. A high point of that recruitment effort was a \\"Citizens for Eisenhower\\" rally at Madison Square Garden. Falkenburg and McCrary organized and hosted the three-hour event. At the behest of John Hay Whitney, finance chairman for the Republican Party, Falkenburg became head of the women's division of the finance committee in 1954. (McCrary was a wartime friend and neighbor of Whitney—he and Falkenburg lived in a house on Whitney's Greentree Estate in Manhasset, Long Island). She continued to serve on the finance committee and remained a lifelong Republican, occasionally lending her name to the party's causes. ==Personal life== Falkenburg and McCrary had two sons, John Reagan \\"Paddy\\" McCrary III and Kevin Jock McCrary. Kevin appeared on the A&E; reality TV show Hoarders (Season 4, Episode 12, \\"Kevin & Mary\\"). Kevin faced eviction from his apartment in March 2014 due to his continued hoarding. Falkenburg was a Roman CatholicMorning News, January 10, 1948, Who Was Who in America (Vol. 2) In 1980, McCrary and Falkenburg separated but never divorced and remained friends. McCrary died at 92 on July 29, 2003, less than one month before Falkenburg. ==Later years== Falkenburg informally retired from broadcasting in 1958 and continued to live in Manhasset. In 1962, she and McCrary anchored 16 weeks of coverage of the Billy Graham Crusade for Christianity. In the early 1960s, Falkenburg was a commercial spokesperson for the American Gas Association. She became vice-president of Marian Bialac Cosmetics, a company owned by Whitney. Her athletic prowess remained on display. She took up golf at the age of 40 and within a short time had a 12 handicap. In 1975, at the age of 56, she was part of a celebrity team that played a pre-opening tennis match at Forest Hills before the start of the U.S. Open. She also was involved in charitable work and was on the board of the North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, which her husband was instrumental in getting built. For her contribution to the television industry, Falkenburg has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street. ==Death== Falkenburg died on August 27, 2003, at the age of 84 at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset.

It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). On 1 January 2015 the former municipalities of Châtelat, Monible, Sornetan and Souboz merged to form the new municipality of Petit-Val.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 2 January 2013 ==History== Sornetan is first mentioned in 1179 as Sornetan. The municipality was formerly known by its German name Sornetal, however, that name is no longer used. The area around Sornetan was inhabited since antiquity. Some of the earliest finds are scattered items from the Celtic tribes that lived in the area. They were followed by the Romans and then by the Burgundians. A noble family using the Sornetan name appear in historic records from the 12th until the 14th centuries. The village was eventually acquired by the college of canons of Moutier-Grandval Abbey. When the Abbey was suppressed during the Protestant Reformation, Sornetan was placed under the provost of Moutier-Grandval who was under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Sornetan became part of the French Département of Mont- Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Sornetan was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Until the Protestant Reformation of 1528, Sornetan was part of the parish of Sapran. After it adopted the new Reformed faith, it joined the Tavannes-Chaindon parish, but only remained until 1538. It then joined the Grandval parish and remained in that parish until 1571, when it joined Bévilard. Sornetan remained part of that parish for almost two centuries, but in 1746 it became an independent parish. The parish church was built in 1708-09 and today is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. It was renovated in 1964-67. While the village has remained generally agrarian, beginning in the 1970s the services sector began gaining importance. One of the reasons for this change was the construction, in 1971, of a Swiss Reformed Church meeting and training center in the municipality. ==Geography== Sornetan village and surrounding fields Before the merger, Sornetan had a total area of .

It is located in the French-speaking part of the canton in the Jura mountains. ==History== Hotel de Ville The Birs river near Tavannes Aerial view from 900 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1930) The area around Tavannes was traversed by the early inhabitants of the Helvetic plain because of the natural tunnel through the Jura between the valley of the Suze and the valley of the Birse. Under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the Romans improved this road between 161 and 169 AD. The Roman administrator left an inscription in the cliff at Pierre-Pertuis to this effect. Early mills were built along the Birse, utilizing its water as a source of power. Tavannes was one of the earliest inhabited locations in the district. Its name comes from the ancient Germanic words 'Þahs-winja, ancien haut allemand dahs, germanique *þahsu, « blaireau », et gothique vinja, germanique *venjô, « pâturage » [Perrenot]. ',which means the same as the older German name 'Dachsfelden'. In the fourth century, as the Roman Empire crumbled, the Burgundians moved into the area around Tavannes. In 630, a monastery was established at Moutier- Grandval, and Tavannes belonged to its possessions. The first mention of Tavannes (or its Latin equivalent Theisvenna) dates to 866. In 999, King Rudolph III of Burgundy gave the monastery of Moutier-Grandval and all its possessions to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. At Rudolph's death, the district passed into the Holy Roman Empire, to which it belonged for 760 years. In the spring of 1530, Guillaume Farel preached the Reformation in Tavannes and surrounding areas, with great success. When Tavannes accepted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, the village church of Saint-Etienne, which was built in 1385, became a Reformed church and remained the only church in Tavannes until the Catholic Church of Christ-Roi was built in 1930. After the French Revolution, the French Republican Army invaded the district in 1792 and forcibly recruited local soldiers to its ranks. Some were enthusiastic, among them Théophile Voirol, who after rapid promotions, became a general. He later became a French noble and Governor of Algeria. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Tavannes became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Tavannes was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The city government was not established until after the Bishopric of Basel was dissolved in 1797. The municipality was connected to the growing railroad network in 1874 and by the 1890s was home to several large factories. The establishment of the Tavannes Watch Co. in 1895 turned the village into a major watchmaking center. To house the growing population a number of Swiss chalet and Art nouveau style houses were built between 1900 and 1930. The Royal Cinema opened in 1918 and turned Tavannes into regional cultural center. The population dropped in 1966 when the Tavannes Watch factory closed and dropped again in 1986 when a major manufacturer closed.

It is closely related to the Oriental Shorthair. The Oriental Longhair in some registries, such as The International Cat Association (TICA), is a separate breed. In others, such as the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), it is a division, along with the short- haired variety, of a merged breed, the Oriental. With no globally recognized naming convention, other cat fanciers may refer to this type as Foreign Longhair or Mandarin. It was formerly known as the British Angora before being renamed in 2002 by British cat fanciers in order to avoid confusion with the Turkish Angora. ==Description== Oriental Longhairs feature a long, tubular, Oriental-style body but with a longer silky coat. The range of possible coat colours includes everything from self-coloured (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, red, cream and apricot), tortoiseshell, smoke (silver undercoat), shaded or tipped, tabby or white. The eyes are almond shaped. The preferred eye color for Oriental Longhairs is green; except for the whites, which may have green or blue eyes, or be odd-eyed (two different colored eyes). If an Oriental Longhair is bred to an Oriental shorthair or a Siamese, the kittens will all be short-haired. This is because the gene for long hair is recessive. The kittens will, however, be a variant, a carrier of the long- hair gene. If such a \\"variant\\" is bred to a cat with long hair, or to another variant, they may produce both short-haired and long-haired kittens. Variants may have a slightly longer coat that Oriental Shorthairs, but this is not always the case. ==Behavior== The Oriental Longhair is an active cat that likes to play. If the owner does not have the time to do so, it will find a toy to play on its own. This breed enjoys jumping and does it really well, usually without breaking any objects due to its agility and elegance. The oriental longhair is extremely intelligent and are ideal companions for people who like their pets always around. Some have been know to follow their owners everywhere. They are very loyal and most get along well with other cats, especially if they are of the same breed group. These cats are not adapted to a life of living alone and prefer an interactive home. Some Oriental tend to gravitate to one person in the home. Oriental Longhairs, like their cousin breed the Siamese, have loud and expressive voices that are used often. They are smart cats, with some being quite willful in getting their own way. Many Orientals take to leash training quickly if started young. They have been known to open cabinets, doors and even refrigerators. This breed group is often recommended for more experienced cat keepers. == References == == External links == *Iams website: Oriental Longhair cat *Oriental Longhair Colour Overview (with photos) Category:Cat breeds ","title":"Oriental Longhair"},{"id":"2569372","text":"Princess Louise of Denmark and Norway (; ) (20 January 1750 – 12 January 1831) was born to Frederick V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain. Her eldest daughter, Marie of Hesse-Kassel, was the wife of Frederick VI of Denmark. == Life == Portrayed in 1772 She married Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel on 30 August 1766 at Christiansborg Castle, in Copenhagen, with her brother King Christian VII's consent. This was despite advice given against it, due to many accusations of debauchery by Landgrave Charles and the poor influence he had on the King. This, however, did not last, as Christian VII's warm feelings for him soon evaporated, and in the spring 1767, the couple left Copenhagen to live in Hanau. She would have her first child in Hanau, Marie Sophie, Princess of Hesse on 20 October 1767 and then her second, Wilhelm, Prince of Hesse on 20 January 1769. The family would then move to Gottorp Castle after her spouse was appointed governor of Schleswig Holstein. In 1770, King Christian VII gave his sister a parish and land in Güby, Schleswig-Holstein, which was named Louisenlund in her honour. In the summer of 1770, Louise and Charles hosted the king and queen during their tour of the Duchies on their way to the German border.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. During their stay, rumors circulated about the affair between the queen and Struensee because of their manner, and it was observed that the queen was anxious not to be near Struensee in the presence of Louise. When the royal couple left, Louise was reportedly disappointed that she was not asked to accompany them on their journey. She would have her third child Prince Frederik of Hesse on 24 May 1771. Louisenlund Castle After the removal and execution of Johann Friedrich Struensee on 28 April 1772 her husband found favour with the King again and with it, he was appointed Governor of Norway in September 1772. It was said that Charles planned to raise support in Norway for a coup to take the regency power over the king from prince Frederick and queen dowager Juliana.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 Louise did not initially accompany him there, but when he returned to Denmark in April 1773, she returned with him to Norway in June. They were very well received in Christiania, and upon their arrival in Trondhjem, one aristocrat, Nordahl Brun, welcomed them as the \\"heavenly couple\\", and greeted Louise with a poem.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 In the Landgrave's own words, he became so popular that the Norwegians would gladly have him as King. This was clearly an illusion, and the people of Christiania soon found the cost of constantly entertaining the couple, a huge burden on town expenses. Expensive demands, such as new golden chairs to sit in during church service, and a triumphal arch for the official entry of Louise in to Christiania where examples of the standard the royal couple demanded for their standard during their stay and created antipathy among the population.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 On 4 September, Louise and Charles hosted a ball and a court reception in honor of the birthday of queen Juliana Maria and departed on 8 September 1773.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 With her husband's larger income, he had Hermann von Motz build Louisenlund Castle on the land in Güby as a summer residence for the couple. The Princess would have her fourth child Juliane, Princess of Hesse on 19 January 1773 before leaving Norway and moving into Louisenlund Castle in 1774. Her husband was also made Field Marshal the same year but would stay away from political circles and remain at Louisenlund till the 14th change of government in April 1784. The new change brought a close friendship with Crown Prince Frederik, who would also marry their daughter Princess, Marie Sophie. They would later become King Frederick VI of Denmark and Queen Marie Sophie of Denmark. Princess Louise would have two more children, Prince Christian of Hesse, born 14 August 1776 and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel, born 28 September 1789. Her husband continued as Governor of Norway and Schleswig Holstein all her life. She died at Gottorp Castle on 12 January 1831 and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. ==Ancestry== == Children == She had 6 children together with her husband, they are: # Marie Sophie, Princess of Hesse (20 October 1767 – 21 March 1852), married on 31 July 1790 to the future King Frederik VI of Denmark # Wilhelm, Prince of Hesse (15 January 1769 – 14 July 1772) # Prince Frederik of Hesse (24 May 1771 – 24 February 1845) # Juliane, Princess of Hesse (19 January 1773 – 11 March 1860), Protestant Abbess of Itzehoe # Prince Christian of Hesse (14 August 1776 – 14 November 1814) # Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel (28 September 1789 – 13 March 1867), married on 28 January 1810 to Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Glücksburg == References == == Sources == === Books === === Online === == External links == Category:House of Oldenburg Category:Danish princesses Category:Norwegian princesses Category:1750 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Landgravines of Hesse-Kassel Category:House of Hesse-Kassel ","title":"Princess Louise of Denmark (1750–1831)"},{"id":"2569374","text":"Daniel Sebastian Bergman (; born 7 September 1962) is a Swedish film director.

It works by first checking all items Lkm, where k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} and m is the block size, until an item is found that is larger than the search key. To find the exact position of the search key in the list a linear search is performed on the sublist L[(k-1)m, km]. The optimal value of m is , where n is the length of the list L. Because both steps of the algorithm look at, at most, items the algorithm runs in O() time. This is better than a linear search, but worse than a binary search. The advantage over the latter is that a jump search only needs to jump backwards once, while a binary can jump backwards up to log n times. This can be important if a jumping backwards takes significantly more time than jumping forward. The algorithm can be modified by performing multiple levels of jump search on the sublists, before finally performing the linear search. For an k-level jump search the optimum block size ml for the l th level (counting from 1) is n(k-l)/k. The modified algorithm will perform k backward jumps and runs in O(kn1/(k+1)) time. ==Implementation== algorithm JumpSearch is input: An ordered list L, its length n and a search key s. output: The position of s in L, or nothing if s is not in L. a ← 0 b ← ⌊√n⌋ while Lmin(b,n)-1 < s do a ← b b ← b + ⌊√n⌋ if a ≥ n then return nothing while La < s do a ← a + 1 if a = min(b, n) return nothing if La = s then return a else return nothing ==See also== * Jump list * Interpolation search * Linear search - runs in O(n) time, only looks forward * Binary search - runs in O(log n) time, looks both forward and backward ==References== * * Ben Shneiderman, Jump Searching: A Fast Sequential Search Technique, CACM, 21(10):831-834, October 1978.

Delayed arrival of the pontoons had given Robert E. Lee time to fortify the high ground, and the result was a one-sided massacre. Visitor center staffed by Park Service rangers. *Chancellorsville – May 1–3, 1863 A bold gamble by Robert E. Lee, dividing his forces and sending Stonewall Jackson on a flanking attack, which took the enemy totally by surprise, causing the Union commander General Joseph Hooker to lose his nerve and call retreat. Visitor center staffed by Park Service rangers. *The Wilderness – May 5–7, 1864 Robert E. Lee's first battle against Grant, whose advantage in artillery could not be used in the dense forest. Casualties were high on both sides, and the battle is classed as a draw. Grant withdrew, but only in order to force another battle in more open country. Exhibit shelters, staffed on a seasonal basis. *Spotsylvania – May 8–21, 1864 Key crossroads which Grant hoped to occupy, to keep his army between Lee and the Confederate capital Richmond. Lee was able to take this position just ahead of Grant. Heavy rain had dampened the gunpowder, leading to intense hand-to-hand fighting. Exhibit shelters, staffed on a seasonal basis. The park also preserves four historic buildings associated with the battles: Chatham Manor, Salem Church, Ellwood Manor, and the house where Stonewall Jackson died. The ruins of the Chancellor family mansion are included. Chatham Manor in Stafford County is open daily. All sites are free. ==Park history== The park was established as Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park on February 14, 1927, and transferred from the War Department August 10, 1933. The lengthy name remains its official designation—75 letters, the longest name of any unit in the national park system. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The park includes 8374 acres (33.89 km2), of which 7369 acres (30 km2) are owned by the Federal government. Over 500,000 people visit the battlefield each year. ==Cemetery== Mass grave headstone for 11 soldiers Mass grave headstone for 4 soldiers Fredericksburg National Cemetery was created by act of Congress, in July 1865 after reunification of the states, to honor the Federal soldiers who died in local battles or from disease. The cemetery was placed on Marye's Heights, a Confederate stronghold during the Battle of Fredericksburg. There are a total of 15,243 Civil War interments, of those, only 2,473 were identified. Graves of soldiers, known and unknown, are distinguished by their markers. Identified soldiers are buried in individual graves, marked by a rounded headstone inscribed with the soldier's name and state. Unknown soldiers were buried in mass graves, the headstones marking these plots contain two numbers. The first, upper, number identifies the plot while the second, lower, number identifies the number of soldiers buried in that plot. Approximately 100 20th- century soldiers are buried in the cemetery; in some cases, their spouses were buried next to them. The cemetery allowed new burials until 1945. Willis Cemetery, a separate cemetery on Marye's Heights, was established to serve local needs and predates the Civil War. This cemetery is distinguished from the Civil War burials by its brick wall. The Willis home, which burned down before the outbreak of war, was separated by a gap in the ridge from the Marye's family home, Brompton. Previously known as Willis Hill, the name Marye's Heights was applied to the whole of the ridge as the battle was covered by the national press in 1863. Located near the 127th Pennsylvania Volunteer Monument, and throughout the cemetery, are plaques containing verses from Theodore O'Hara's 1847 poem \\"The Bivouac of the Dead\\". O'Hara wrote the poem to commemorate American dead at the Battle of Buena Vista, fought during the Mexican–American War.

Simple quartering, crudely drawn. De Salis quartered with Fane. The flag of Maryland has a quartering of the coats of arms of the Calvert and Crossland families Typically, a quartering consists of a division into four equal parts, two above and two below (party per cross). Occasionally the division is instead along both diagonals (party per saltier) again creating four parts but now at top, bottom, left, and right. An example of party per cross is the Sovereign Arms of the United Kingdom, as used outside Scotland, which consists of four quarters, displaying the Arms of England, Scotland and Ireland, with the coat for England repeated at the end. (In the royal arms as used in Scotland, the Scottish coat appears in the first and fourth quarters and the English one second.). An example of party per saltier is the arms of the medieval Kingdom of Sicily which also consists of four sections, with top and bottom displaying the coat of the Crown of Aragon, and left and right the coat of the Sicily branch of the Hohenstaufen dynasty during their reign as Holy Roman Emperors. However, in most traditions there is no limit on the number of divisions allowed, and the records of the College of Arms include a shield of 323 quarterings for the family of Lloyd of Stockton. These 323 quarterings include numerous repeated attributed arms assigned to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier. Another example of a shield of many quarterings is the coat of arms of the Powys-Lybbe family, which contains 64 quarterings. Different rules apply in Scottish heraldry, and may well apply in other jurisdictions like Canada and South Africa. The arms of the Queen of the United Kingdom are arms of dominion, which join together the arms of the ex-kingdoms now part of her kingdom. However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent: in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms. Strict rules apply in English Heraldry, both as to what arms may be displayed by way of quarterings, and the order in which they may be displayed. Men and women are always entitled to display the arms of their paternal line but are not usually entitled to display by way of quartering the arms of families from whom there is descent only through a female line (for example, the arms of a mother or grandmother or great-grandmother). An exception is made, however, if the female who breaks the male line of descent is a heraldic heiress—a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have died without issue. Such a woman is entitled to transmit her father's arms to her own children, who add them as a quartering. If her father was himself entitled to one or more quarterings, these will pass to his daughters' children as quarterings as well. Quarterings are displayed in the order in which they are acquired by a family by marriage, starting with those acquired by the earliest marriage to bring in quarterings. It is permissible to omit quarterings, but if a quartering was brought in by a later quartering, it is essential to show the whole chain of quarterings leading to the quartering displayed, or else to omit the chain altogether. The larger the number of quarterings, the smaller the space available for each coat of arms, so that most families entitled to many quarterings make a selection of those they ordinarily use. The Duke of Norfolk, for example, uses only four quarterings, although he is entitled to many more. In Scotland in some cases the plain unquartered coat is the more prized, as entitlement to its use can indicate who is chief of the name and arms and holds the headship of a clan. For example, Flora Fraser, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy has arms as chief of Fraser—the plain coat of 'azure, three fraises argent'—and a 'private' quartered coat. The Powys-Lybbe family appear, likewise, to usually use only the quarterings of Powys and Lybbe. However these are not true quarterings as the arms were changed in 1907 to be an impartible design of the two arms; the personal arms are precisely this design, with no quarterings despite its appearance. (If this were a quartering the following would apply: when only two different coats of arms are shown, each one is repeated twice in order to fill up the minimum number of four quarterings on such a display.) Prior to the 1907 change, the family did quarter their arms with Lybbe but with the Powys arms in the top left quarter as these were the family arms; the new design has Lybbe in the top left as Lybbe is the last part of the name. ==See also== *Division of the field *Quartering of Castile and León, the first use of this method ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Heraldry es:Cuartel (heráldica) ","title":"Quartering (heraldry)"},{"id":"2569406","text":"Didymocistus is a genus of plants in the family Phyllanthaceae first described as a genus in 1940.Kuhlmann, João Geraldo. 1940.

For erosion control, caged riprap is used. For dams or in foundation construction, cylindrical metal structures are used. In a military context, earth- or sand-filled gabions are used to protect sappers, infantry, and artillerymen from enemy fire. Leonardo da Vinci designed a type of gabion called a Corbeille Leonard (\\"Leonard[o] basket\\") for the foundations of the San Marco Castle in Milan.gabiondesign.be Bridge abutment with gabions ==Civil engineering== The most common civil engineering use of gabions was refined and patented by Gaetano Maccaferri in the late 19th century in Sacerno, Emilia Romagna and used to stabilize shorelines, stream banks or slopes against erosion. Other uses include retaining walls, noise barriers, temporary flood walls, silt filtration from runoff, for small or temporary/permanent dams, river training, or channel lining. They may be used to direct the force of a flow of flood water around a vulnerable structure. Gabions are also used as fish screens on small streams. Gabion stepped weirs are commonly used for river training and flood control; the stepped design enhances the rate of energy dissipation in the channel, and it is particularly well suited to the construction of gabion stepped weirs. A gabion wall is a retaining wall made of stacked stone-filled gabions tied together with wire. Gabion walls are usually battered (angled back towards the slope), or stepped back with the slope, rather than stacked vertically. The life expectancy of gabions depends on the lifespan of the wire, not on the contents of the basket. The structure will fail when the wire fails. Galvanized steel wire is most common, but PVC-coated and stainless steel wire are also used. PVC-coated galvanized gabions have been estimated to survive for 60 years.maccaferri- northamerica.com Some gabion manufacturers guarantee a structural consistency of 50 years. In the United States, gabion use within streams first began with projects completed from 1957 to 1965 on North River, Virginia and Zealand River, New Hampshire.Toblaski, R.A., and N.K. Tripp, 1961. Gabions for stream and erosion control. Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 16: 284-285. More than 150 grade-control structures, bank revetments and channel deflectors were constructed on the two U.S. Forest Service sites. Eventually, a large portion of the in-stream structures failed due to undermining and lack of structural integrity of the baskets. In particular, corrosion and abrasion of wires by bedload movement compromised the structures, which then sagged and collapsed into the channels. Other gabions were toppled into channels as trees grew and enlarged on top of gabion revetments, leveraging them toward the river channels. Gabions have also been used in building, as in the Dominus Winery in the Napa Valley, California, by architects Herzog & de Meuron, constructed between 1995 and 1997. The exterior is formed by modular wire mesh gabions containing locally quarried stone; this construction allows air movement through the building and creates an environment of moderate temperatures inside. ==Variations in design== There are various special designs of gabions to meet particular functional requirements and some special terms for particular forms have come into use. For example:ridgeway-online.com * Bastion: a gabion lined internally with a membrane, typically of nonwoven geotextile to permit use of a granular soil fill, instead of rock. * Mattress: a form of gabion with relatively small height relative to the lateral dimensions; commonly very wide. For protecting surfaces from wave erosion and similar attack, rather than building or supporting high structures.foraas.no * Trapion: a form of gabion with a trapezoidal cross section, designed for stacking to give a face that is sloping rather than stepped. The term is in wide usage, but in contexts related to gabions at least, appears to be a trademark registered by Betafence Limited. ==Military use== The interior of Fort Stedman in 1865, showing a parapet constructed with gabions to protect gun positions Early gabions were round cages with open tops and bottoms, made from wickerwork and filled with earth for use as military fortifications. These early military gabions were most often used to protect sappers and siege artillery gunners. The wickerwork cylinders were light and could be carried relatively conveniently in the ammunition train, particularly if they were made in several diameters to fit one inside another. At the site of use in the field, they could be stood on end, staked in position, and filled with soil to form an effective wall around the gun, or rapidly construct a bulletproof parapet along a sap. During the Crimean War, local shortages of brushwood led to use of scrap hoop-iron from hay bales in its stead; this in turn led to purpose-built sheet-iron gabions. Today, gabions are often used to protect forward operating bases (FOBs) against explosive, fragmentary, indirect fires such as mortar or artillery fire. Examples of areas within a FOB that make extensive use of gabions are sleeping quarters, mess halls, or any place where there would be a large concentration of unprotected soldiers. Gabions are also used for aircraft revetments, blast walls, and similar structures. ==See also== * , a small-scale mattress gabion used for roads, retaining walls, and protective structures. * , a modernized version of the same concept * , wire mesh gabions introduced into modern civil engineering * ==References== * Freeman, Gary E.; Fischenich, Craig J.(May 2000), \\"Gabions for Streambank Erosion Control\\", Environmental Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. * University of New South Wales Water Research Laboratory, Research Report No. 156, \\"Some factors affecting the use of Maccaferri gabions and reno mattresses for coastal revetments\\", October 1979, C.

Directed by Richard Rush, the film stars Bruce Willis and Jane March. The cast also features Ruben Blades, Lesley Ann Warren, Brad Dourif, Lance Henriksen, Kevin J. O'Connor and Scott Bakula. It is one of two well-known works by director Rush, the other being The Stunt Man 14 years before. Color of Night flopped at the box office and won a Golden Raspberry Award as the worst film of 1994. Nonetheless, it became one of the 20 most-rented films in the United States home video market in 1995.Billboard vol 108 #1 p.54. Maxim magazine also singled the film out as having the best sex scene in film history. In 2018, Kino Lorber (under license from Disney) released a special edition Blu- ray of the film; it contains an audio commentary by director Richard Rush. ==Plot== Dr. Bill Capa, a New York psychiatrist, falls into a deep depression after an unstable patient dies by suicide in front of him by jumping from his office window. The sight of the bloody body clad in a bright green dress causes Bill to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red. Bill travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist Dr. Bob Moore, who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. However, Bob is violently murdered in the office and Bill is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death. Lt. Hector Martinez considers everyone in Moore's therapy group, including Bill, as suspects in the murder. Bill continues to live in Bob's house and begins an affair with Rose, a beautiful but mysterious young woman who comes and goes. Bill takes the therapy group, which includes; Clark, a temperamental OCD sufferer, Sondra, a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac, Buck, a suicidal ex-cop, Casey, who paints sado-masochist images, and Richie, a 16-year old with social anxiety and a history of drug use. After Casey is found violently murdered, Bill becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose. He eventually learns that \\"Richie\\" is really Rose, and the murders were the work of her deranged brother, Dale. They once had an actual brother named Richie, who was molested by his child psychiatrist along with Dale. After Richie committed suicide, Dale abused Rose into playing the part of their brother. Rose began to re- emerge during therapy and, under another personality named \\"Bonnie\\", started relationships with the other patients. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to Richie. Bill confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply traumatized, she then tries to commit suicide. Bill is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts, one at the beginning, resulting in Bill's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it. ==Cast== *Bruce Willis as Bill Capa *Jane March as Rose *Ruben Blades as Martinez *Lesley Ann Warren as Sondra *Scott Bakula as Bob Moore *Brad Dourif as Clark *Lance Henriksen as Buck *Kevin J. O'Connor as Casey *Eriq La Salle as Anderson *Andrew Lowery as Dale *Kathleen Wilhoite as Michelle *Jeff Corey as Ashland *Shirley Knight as Edith Niedelmeyer ==Release== Richard Rush turned his cut of the film over to producer Andrew Vajna in late 1993. Vajna was concerned about the film's commercial prospects and demanded a recut, something Rush refused. Nonetheless, Vajna mandated he had final cut per contractual obligation, and insisted on testing his own version of the film. After both versions were given a number of test screenings, Vajna determined that his cut would be released and fired Rush in April 1994. This ultimately escalated into a battle between Rush and Vajna that received coverage in the Los Angeles trades. Rush commented that his version tested higher than Vajna's cut; his statements were defended in Variety and by film critic Bill Arnold, who attended a test screening of Rush's version in Seattle, Washington. The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, defended Vajna, stating that Rush stubbornly refused any input from the studio. The Directors Guild of America attempted to intervene on the matter. The battle ultimately ended when Rush suffered a near-fatal heart attack and became hospitalized. Months later, after Rush recovered, he compromised with Vajna that the producer's cut would be released theatrically and that the director's cut would see a video release. Eventually, four versions were released: *The R-Rated theatrical release form the USA *The international theatrical release *The R-Rated Director's Cut *The Unrated Director's Cut (Among them, international theatrical release version also contains numerous scenes that are not included in the Unrated Director's Cut.) ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The film received mostly negative reviews around the time of its release. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave it a score of 22% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 3.98/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Bruce willie shot aside, the only other things popping out in Color of Night are some ridiculous plot contortions and majorly camp moments\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. Referring to the film as \\"memorably bizarre,\\" Janet Maslin in her August 19, 1994 The New York Times review wrote: \\"The enthusiastically nutty Color of Night has the single-mindedness of a bad dream and about as much reliance on everyday logic.\\" She also cited the revelation of the murderer, \\"whose disguise won't fool anyone, anywhere.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"I was, frankly, stupefied. To call it absurd would be missing the point, since any shred of credibility was obviously the first thing thrown overboard. It's so lurid in its melodrama and so goofy in its plotting that with just a bit more trouble, it could have been a comedy.\\" Luke Y. Thompson of The New Times praised March's performance and wrote: \\"Minority opinion here, I know, but I found the sex scenes hot and March's performance truly impressive.\\" Brian McKay of eFilmCritic.com stated the film was a \\"Mediocre L.A. noir thriller made more tolerable by Jane March disrobing frequently.\\" Ken Hanke of the Mountain Xpress (Asheville, North Carolina) wrote the film was \\"Underrated, but far from great.\\" The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. ===Box office=== The film opened at #4, grossing $6,610,488 its opening weekend playing at a total of 1,740 theaters. The film ended up a box office failure, grossing only $19,750,470—far below its $40 million production budget. The film was also a noteworthy failure internationally, grossing only $1,454,085 in the UK, $565,104 in Sweden, $112,690 in Austria, $4,725,167 in Germany, and $364,939 in Argentina. ===Year-end lists=== * 3rd worst – Desson Howe, The Washington Post * 3rd worst – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph ===Accolades=== Color of Night won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, and was also nominated in eight other categories including Worst Actor (Bruce Willis also for North), Worst Actress (Jane March), Worst Director (Richard Rush), Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song (\\"The Color of the Night\\"), Worst Screen Couple (\\"Any combination of two people from the entire cast\\"), Worst Supporting Actor (Jane March as Richie) and Worst Supporting Actress (Lesley Ann Warren). At the 1994 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Bruce Willis won the award for Worst Actor (also for North) while Jane March received a mere nomination for Worst Actress. On more positive notes, Color of Night received a Golden Globe nomination in the category Best Original Song -- Motion Picture for its theme song \\"The Color of the Night\\", performed by Lauren Christy. Maxim magazine also awarded Color of Night for having the Best Sex Scene in film history; Rush was especially proud of the award, and he kept the award in his bathroom. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack to Color of Night as composed by Dominic Frontiere, with songs from Lauren Christy, Jud Friedman, Brian McKnight, and Lowen & Navarro was released on August 9, 1994 by Mercury Records. ==References* * * Category:1994 films Category:1990s crime thriller films Category:1994 independent films Category:1990s mystery thriller films Category:1990s psychological thriller films Category:1994 LGBT-related films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:1990s erotic thriller films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:American romantic thriller films Category:American independent films Category:Mental illness in fiction Category:Obsessive–compulsive disorder in fiction Category:Bisexuality-related films Category:Cinergi Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Erotic mystery films Category:American erotic romance films Category:American erotic thriller films Category:Films about sexuality Category:Films directed by Richard Rush Category:Films produced by Andrew G.

Schulz. It originally aired on March 16, 1990, and was also nominated for an Emmy.Why, Charlie Brown, Why? (1990) (TV) - Awards For decades, Why, Charlie Brown, Why? has helped children to understand what happens when someone they love is sick. It is also the first Charlie Brown special of the 1990s. ==Plot== Janice Emmons is a new friend and classmate of Charlie Brown and Linus, who loves to play on the swings. The special begins with Charlie Brown, Sally, Linus, and Janice waiting for the school bus. As Janice boards the bus, she hits her arm on a railing, causing it to bruise; Linus notices that Janice has been bruising easily lately. When they arrive at school, Janice starts feeling ill. She tells Linus that she is feeling tired and has a fever, so she is sent to the school nurse and is later picked up by her mother. Three days later, the class is told that Janice is in the hospital. After school, Linus and Charlie Brown decide to visit Janice in the hospital, where she tells them that she has cancer (specifically leukemia). Janice explains what tests the doctors did to discover that she had leukemia (blood test, bone marrow test, and X-ray). She then shows them her IV line and explains her chemotherapy. Despite her illness, Janice is determined to recover and return to school, so she can play on the swings and be with her friends again. The news of Janice's illness hits Linus especially hard, as he appears to be falling for her. As Charlie Brown and Linus leave the hospital, Linus asks, \\"Why, Charlie Brown, why?\\" He then walks home feeling both sad and angry, thinking about Janice's condition. When he arrives home, he challenges the ignorance of his sister Lucy towards Janice's illness and tells her cancer does not spread like the cold or flu. It's not long until Linus tells Lucy that he remembers the part when he touched Janice's forehead (trying to feel how warm she was). Lucy is shocked. However, her initial shock becomes an outrage when she finds out that Linus actually touched Janice. She also says that Janice probably got that disease because she is a creepy kid. Some months later, Janice's health has improved enough for her to return to school, but she has lost her hair because of the chemotherapy, and wears a cap to hide it. At school, this attracts the attention of a schoolyard bully, who teases Janice for the color of the cap she is wearing. He knocks it off, revealing her bald head. He then makes fun of her for it. Livid, Linus stands up for Janice and confronts the boy, angrily telling him about Janice's illness and asking him if he would like to go through what Janice has gone through. The boy apologizes to Janice and Linus and compliments her on the cap. As Christmas approaches, Linus goes to Janice's house to give her a present, but one of Janice's two sisters informs Linus that she is at the hospital again, receiving treatment. The other sister complains of the attention Janice has been receiving, and later admits she and her other sister feel left out since Janice got sick. Linus gives her the present and leaves. By the beginning of spring, Janice returns again and tells Linus she has a surprise for him, and she reveals the surprise at the end of the special while playing on the swings. The surprise fills Linus with joy, as Janice's cap falls off revealing that her long blonde hair has grown back even longer than it was before, marking the end of her chemotherapy, and meaning that she has recovered. During the closing credits, the cap falls to the ground, and Janice laughs one last time (although it is not revealed whether there was the same depiction in the first place). ==Hymn== This special also included a brief rendition of the hymn \\"Farther Along\\", sung by Becky Reardon. The song played in the background as an angry Linus tries to make sense of Janice's illness. ==Cast== * Kaleb Henley - Charlie Brown * Brandon Stewart - Linus Van Pelt * Adrienne Stiefel - Sally Brown * Jennifer Banko - Lucy Van Pelt * Olivia Burnette - Janice Emmons * Dion Zamora - The schoolyard bully * Brittany Thornton - Janice's curly- haired sister * Lindsay Sloane - Janice's red-haired sister * Bill Melendez - Snoopy and Woodstock Peppermint Patty, Schroeder, Marcie, Franklin, Violet, and Shermy make cameo appearances. ==Production and reception== The idea for Why, Charlie Brown, Why? was conceived by Sylvia Cook, a registered nurse at the Stanford Children's Hospital. In December 1985, Cook sent a letter to Charles M. Schulz, asking him to produce a short animated film about cancer for young patients featuring the Peanuts characters. Schulz was initially doubtful because of the anticipated high production costs. Eventually, Cook received input from the American Cancer Society, which convinced Schulz to produce, rather than just a five-minute film, a half-hour special about the subject. Producer Bill Melendez and CBS initially balked at this idea, but eventually agreed to do it because of Schulz's enthusiasm for the project. The script of the special was completely written by Schulz, with Cook and the American Cancer Society serving as consultants .\\"A Peanuts-eye View of Cancer\\", written by Eileen Ogintz; The Chicago Tribune, March 16, 1990 Cancer was a subject with which Schulz was familiar; his mother Dena had died of cancer when he was in his twenties, and Schulz himself would succumb to colon cancer in 2000. The special has been shown in hospitals and in public education systems, primarily elementary schools and junior high schools, as a method for explaining the subject to children, and is also a part of the Pennies for Patients fundraiser campaign organized by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Paramount Home Video released the special on VHS in the mid-1990s, and is now available on DVD in the Peanuts Emmy Honored Collection.http://www.awn.com/news/warner-bros-announces-emmy-honored-peanuts- collection The special is available on iTunes. The special has rarely aired on US television since its original premiere; Disney Channel has re-aired it while Nickelodeon and ABC, which at different points have withheld the rights to the Peanuts specials, have not. It has been seen on Boomerang in some European countries. A book adaptation of the special, titled Why, Charlie Brown, Why? A Story About What Happens When a Friend is Very Ill, was published by Pharos Books some weeks before the special's premiere on CBS, and was reissued in 2002. The original printing featured a foreword by actor Paul Newman. Critical reaction to the special was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising it for its realism and poignancy, and for Janice's bravery in facing her disease. The special was also a cult favorite. The first airing of this special brought in an 8.7 household rating and a 16 percent audience share, ranking 65th out of 86 shows that week, and was watched by 15 million viewers.http://www.tvtango.com/listings/1990/03/16/ ==Nominations== Why, Charlie Brown, Why? was nominated for the Emmy for an Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Films about cancer Category:1990s American television specials Category:CBS original programming Category:1990 television specials Category:1990s animated television specials Category:1990s American animated films Category:American films Category:1990 in American television Category:CBS television specials Category:Television shows written by Charles M.

She later financed and took part in record breaking flights to Karachi and Cape Town. ==Early and personal life== Born at Stockbridge, Hampshire, she was the daughter of Walter Harry Tribe, Anglican Archdeacon of Lahore, and his wife, Sophy Lander. On 31 January 1888, she married Lord Herbrand Russell at Barrackpore, India. When Lord Herbrand inherited his childless brother's titles in 1893, she was styled as the Duchess of Bedford. Her only child, Hastings, was born on 21 December 1888. ==Work and activism== A major area of organisation and work for the Duchess was in founding four hospitals in Woburn and in the grounds of Woburn Abbey. The principal establishment was the Abbey Hospital that she financed and built in 1914, and where she worked as a nurse and radiographer through to the 1930s. The Duchess was a collector and watcher of birds, and took an interest in bird migration. Between 1909 and 1914 she spent much time on Fair Isle, often in the company of William Eagle Clarke. Her journal, A Bird-watcher's Diary, was privately published in 1938 after her death. She was a member of the Women's Tax Resistance League, a group associated with the Women's Social and Political Union that used tax resistance to protest the disenfranchisement of women during the British women's suffrage movement.The Duchess of Bedford.

He made his first-team debut on 22 December 1956 and spent over ten seasons with the Clarets. He took over as regular goalkeeper when Colin McDonald suffered a broken leg in March 1959. During his time at Burnley, Blacklaw earned a League championship medal in season 1959–60 and an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1962. He played regularly for Burnley until 1965. Blacklaw joined Blackburn Rovers for £15,000 at the start of the 1967–68 season and stayed for three years before finishing his career with short spells at Blackpool in season 1970–71 and moving into the non-league game with Great Harwood in season 1971–72. He later had a spell as manager of Clitheroe. Blacklaw represented Scotland at schoolboy, under–23 and full international levels. He played in two international friendlies in June 1963, a 4–3 defeat by Norway and a 6-2 win against Spain in Madrid. His last appearance for Scotland was on 7 December 1965 in Naples, where they lost 3–0 to Italy in a crucial 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification match. Blacklaw died on 28 February 2010.

The Church Explorer's Handbook. Canterbury Press Ltd, 2005. . Page 16. and probably the oldest wooden building in Europe still standing, albeit only in part, since few sections of its original wooden structure remain. The oak walls are often classified as remnants of a palisade church or a kind of early stave church, dated either to the mid-9th or mid-11th century. The Grade I listed building lies about a mile west of Chipping Ongar town centre. Its full title is The Church of St Andrew, Greensted-juxta-Ongar. It is, however, commonly known simply as Greensted Church. Greensted is still a functioning church and holds services every week. The volume of tourist visits is light, but steady. The church was featured on a British postage stamp issued in 1972.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue (1982), Part 1: British Commonwealth. London: Stanley Gibbons Publications Ltd., p GB 24. ==History== A stained glass window depicting St Edmund, visible inside the church. Greensted Church has stood for nearly 1,200 years. Archaeological evidence suggests that, before there was a permanent structure, there may well have been another church, or a holy place, on the site for much longer, possibly dating back to around the 4th century. Construction of the first permanent church on this site is thought to have begun shortly after St Cedd began his conversion of the East Saxon people around 654. The archaeological remnants of two simple wooden buildings were discovered under the present chancel floor, and these are thought to have been built in the late sixth or early 7th century. The church's dedication to St Andrew suggests a Celtic foundation for the original sanctuary. The body of King Edmund the Martyr of East Anglia (who was killed in 870, possibly at Hoxne) is said to have rested there in 1013, on its way to reburial at Bury St Edmunds.Jennifer Westwood, Albion: a Guide to Legendary Britain, Book Club Associates (1986) (p.152) There are many tributes to St Edmund in the church itself. ==Construction== The north wall and part of the west wall of the nave; the notch, low down on the 7th trunk along from the corner, may either be a \\"leper's squint\\", or a Saxon window. The church, like many, has had work performed on it over the centuries. ===Anglo-Saxon and Norman elements=== The nave is made of large split oak tree trunks, which was a traditional Saxon way of building. The nave is mostly original, and dendrochronological research in the 1960s dated it to 845. In 1995, however, this date was revised to 1053 +10–55 years (some time between 1063 and 1108).Tree-ring analysis of timbers from the stave church at Greensted, Essex, Ancient Monuments Laboratory Report 14/96 This range of dates is based on the dendrochronological date of the youngest timber (1053), plus a standard allowance of 10–55 years for sapwood rings which are assumed to have been weathered away. An interesting detail of the nave is the so- called \\"Leper's Squint\\" on the north side. This small aperture through the oak wall was formerly thought to have been a place where lepers who, not allowed inside the church with the general populace, were allowed to receive a blessing from the priest. Its position next to the original doorway has led researchers to conclude that it was a window used to see who was approaching the church. In the chancel, the flint footings of the wall and the pillar piscina inside the sanctuary are all that is left of any Norman work. ===16th century=== The original chancel was small and built of timber, but the current brick-built chancel dates from this period of construction. ===17th to 19th century=== The distinctive white weatherboarded tower was added in the Stuart period (17th century), and is what initially draws the eye. One of the bells is inscribed \\"William Land made me 1618\\", and so many consider the tower may in fact have been built earlier. This would not be too surprising as there are a number of mediaeval wooden towers in the district. Around this time the three dormer windows were added to the nave for the first time, and the south porch was added. A fragment of 15th-century glass can be seen in the centre of the quatrefoil window at the west end, but it was set there during the Victorian restoration. The earliest wall memorial is dedicated to Jone Wood, 1585. ===Victorian restoration=== Reconstruction work by the Victorians in the 19th century added some detailed brickwork to the building along with, most probably, some of the more ornate decoration to the outside. Specifically it replaced the 3 dormer windows with 6, and the porch was also reconstructed, along with other minor alterations and stone coping. ==Notable events== Near the porch, a large, coped stone marks the resting place of an unknown early crusader who is said to have arrived, badly wounded, at the church and died there. Some of the Tolpuddle Martyrs were granted farm tenancies in the area after they returned from transportation and the record of marriage of one of them, James Brine, can be seen in the present register. Brine later moved to London, Ontario, Canada. He died in 1902 and is buried in St. Marys, Ontario. ==ReferencesBritish Archaeology, no 10, December 1995: News * Greensted Church on Essex Churches website * Everything2 article: St Andrew's, Greensted-juxta-Ongar * MSN Encarta: Anglo-Saxon Art and Architecture (Archived 2009-10-31) * Virtual Photography: St. Andrew's Church Category:Church of England church buildings in Epping Forest District Category:Grade I listed churches in Essex Category:Stave churches Category:Wooden churches in England Category:11th-century churches in the United Kingdom Category:Standing Anglo-Saxon churches Category:Timber-framed churches ","title":"Greensted Church"},{"id":"2569489","text":"Brough ( , locally ) is a small town in the civil parish of Elloughton-cum- Brough in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Brough is situated on the northern bank of the Humber Estuary, approximately west of Hull city centre. Brough has a long association with BAE Systems. ==History== The town was known as Petuaria during the Roman period, and served as the capital of the Celtic tribe of the Parisi. Petuaria marked the southern end of the Roman road known now as Cade's Road which ran roughly northwards for a hundred miles to Pons Aelius (modern day Newcastle upon Tyne). Brough was created a town by the Archbishop of York in 1239, granted the same liberties as Beverley. There is no record of these liberties having been employed, and the settlement operated as a village for further centuries. The town is significant for its association with the highwayman Dick Turpin. About June 1737 Turpin boarded at the Ferry Inn at Brough, under the alias of John Palmer (or Parmen). Turpin travelled between and resided in Brough, until his capture and execution for horse theft in 1739. ==Demographics== All Saints Church Over the past couple of years, there has been a shift in the socio-economic group of people living in Brough because of improved rail links and new housing developments, most recently the Brough South development. This change has brought more money into the area. As a result, the average wage rate and amount of spending has increased significantly. ==Amenities== Brough has a range of shops and takeaways, and two supermarkets: Morrisons and Sainsbury's Local. There are two dentists, two vets, hairdressers, a medical centre, a private hearing aid audiologist, a post office and a TSB bank. Brough also has a couple of public houses. ==Education== Primary education at Brough is provided by Brough Primary School and newly moved, Hunsley Primary, previously near the secondary school in Melton. The nearest secondary school is South Hunsley School and Sixth Form College is approximately to the east of the town in Melton. ==Transport== Class 222 Pioneer train arriving at Brough railway station The town is served by Brough railway station on the Hull to Selby and Doncaster railway line. Direct rail services to London are provided by Hull Trains and London North Eastern Railway. Other services are TransPennine Express trains running west to Leeds, Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool, and Northern to York, Doncaster and Sheffield. All east-bound trains run to Hull: some then run north to Beverley, Driffield, Bridlington, Filey and Scarborough. Most local bus services are provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services. The services run to Hull as well as other towns and villages in the East Riding such as Goole, Howden, North Ferriby and Beverley. There are daily Stagecoach in Hull services to Leeds. National Express also stop at Brough. The town lies south of the main A63 from Hull to the M62. It is about to the A63 junction east, to the junction west (and then a further to the M62 motorway). Humberside Airport is to the south-east (reached by driving across the Humber Bridge), and overnight ferry services by P&O; Ferries sail to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge from King George Dock, Hull (about away). ==BAE Systems== BAE Systems factory in Brough. BAE Systems (formerly British Aerospace), Brough, manufactured the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer aircraft at Brough Aerodrome. BAE provided apprenticeships to local school leavers. The runway at the site was re-opened for a while for occasional use solely by Hawk aircraft taking off after manufacture to transfer by air to Warton near Preston in Lancashire for final flight testing and painting though the former Air Traffic Control building has now been transformed into the Brough Business Centre. On 3 April 2008 BAE Systems announced it would be losing 450 jobs from the Brough site. On 1 March 2012 BAE Systems announced it would be ending manufacturing at its site in Brough with 845 employees to be made redundant. There are now proposals to build over much of the airfield - including the runway. As of 2020, construction on the runway has started with phase two of the Brough South development (Brough Relief Road). ==Notable people== *Robert Stephenson (1906–1942), first-class cricketer and Royal Navy officer ==References== ==External links== * *Excavations on a Roman Extra-Mural Site at Brough-on- Humber, East Riding of Yorkshire, UK in Internet Archaeology Category:Towns in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire"},{"id":"2569492","text":"Southwest Magnet High School, also known as Southwest-Macon and Southwest Magnet High School and Law Academy, is a high school in Macon, Georgia, United States, serving students in grades 9–12. It is a unit of the Bibb County Public School System. In the 1970s, Macon residents often claimed that Southwest was the largest high school in the United States in both campus size and attendance numbers. Its sprawling campus complex comprised four classroom buildings (McEvoy A, McEvoy B, Willingham A, Willingham B), three of which had their own gymnasium. It had its own baseball field, 1/4 mile track, soccer field, and football field. A fifth building was added in the 1980s to accommodate technical education needs. Southwest High School was born out of the integration and co-ed movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s, during which the Alfred R. Willingham High School for Boys, the adjacent Margaret McEvoy High School for Girls, and nearby all-black Ballard-Hudson High School merged, and eventually rose to national prominence under the leadership of complex principals W. C. Whitley and Gloria Washington. After the merger, the campuses formerly used for Ballard-Hudson High School were converted to junior high campuses (grades 8-9) with the Ballard-Hudson name. Its large student body enabled the school to have successful teams in baseball, track and field, football and basketball, as well as numerous academic teams. Its chief rival was Central High School's Chargers. Each fall, the campus hosted Orange Crush week, designed to celebrate the upcoming game between the Southwest Patriots and the Central Chargers. Now their rival is the Northeast Magnet High School's Raiders. In the late 1980s, because of growing concerns about successful management of the enormous student body, the school was split into Southwest High School and Southeast High School. Southwest later added a magnet program, focusing on preparatory curricula for law and criminal justice careers. Prior to the school's split, Southwest High School produced NBA basketball greats Norm Nixon (#10 Los Angeles Lakers 1977-83), Jeff Malone (Miami Heat, Philadelphia 76ers, and Washington Bullets 1983-90).

It was a pediatric facility serving patients in Western New York and parts of Southern Ontario. It was a teaching hospital loosely affiliated with the State University of New York at Buffalo. The hospital treated infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 and also had extensive women's health facilities. ==History== The hospital was founded in 1892 as The Children's Hospital of Buffalo. During the first year of operation, so many patients were turned away for lack of space that in 1893 the hospital was forced to increase the capacity by 40 beds. During the next few decades, the hospital renovated and added modern medical equipment, and by the 1950s, hospital had about 200 pediatric beds and 75 beds for women and bassinets. Over the years the hospital was recognized many times by U.S. News & World Report for its leading national pediatric programs. After a merger with Kaleida Health, the facility was renamed Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo (WCHOB).

A separate Children's hospital, named the War Memorial Children's Hospital was completed in 1922. It was built in the same art deco style as the School of Medicine and Nurse's residence that shared a block with it. The Children's Hospital shared facilities with Victoria Hospital since 1985, when it was renamed Children's Hospital of Western Ontario. The Children's Hospital acquired its current name, in 2007, when the handsome 85 year old building was determined to be too old to be worth updating, when the Children's Hospital was moved into the Victoria Hospital complex, across the street. The Victoria Hospital complex is the largest hospital in southwestern Ontario. The Globe and Mail called the hospital \\"One of Canada's most prestigious medical institutions\\". In 1951 the Children's Hospital was the first facility in the world to deploy a Cobalt-60 Beam Therapy Unit to deliver radiation therapy to cancer patients. In 2011 the hospital took the rare step of responding to a viral video. Fox News focussed on the hospital's recommendation to remove life support from a brain dead newborn. Other American sites characterized the hospital's recommendation as an example of a Canadian \\"death panel\\". The infant, known as \\"baby Joseph\\", had been born with a \\"severe and progressively deteriorating neurological condition.\\" His body was only being kept alive through a ventilator and has a feeding tube. Hospital medical staff determined he would never be able to show any signs of consciousness, and recommended removing his life support tubes. In October 2018 Ontario's first instance of a new kind of robot assisted brain surgery was performed at the hospital. The fourteen year old patient, had been suffering disabling epileptic seizures almost his entire life. In August 2019 he was deemed seizure free. The hospital is the only facility in Ontario performing robot-assisted stereoelectroencephalography surgery. Hospitals in Calgary and Montreal are also capable of performing this surgery. In 2019 the hospital developed a dispute with the TLC Foundation. The local man who founded the organization was barred from visiting the hospital. In 2019 the hospital introduced a policy barring strangers delivering gifts to patients in person. The policy requires gifts to be vetted by hospital staff, to preserve the safety of patients, and to make sure no patient receives unwelcome visitors, or gifts. A young patient, with brain cancer, who the Foundation's founder had been visiting for four years, released a video, shortly before Christmas, 2019, where he characterized the hospital's policy as stripping him of one of his few friends. ==References* LHSC SOUTH STREET HOSPITAL COMPLEX HERITAGE ISSUES MEETING ON MONDAY, DECEMBER 12,2011:5:45 P.M * London committee endorses staff report calling for the sale of additional old Victoria Hospital lands Category:Hospitals established in 1917 London Health Sciences Centre Category:Hospitals in London, Ontario Category:1917 establishments in Ontario Category:Teaching hospitals in Canada ","title":"Children's Hospital at London Health Sciences Centre"},{"id":"2569506","text":"Philip Roman (born December 21, 1930) is an American animator and the director of all twelve Garfield primetime specials.

His father was Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, the son of Duke Alexander of Württemberg and Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde (created the Countess von Hohenstein). His mother was the Duchess of Teck (née Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge), the youngest daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge and a granddaughter of King George III. Frank was thus styled \\"His Serene Highness Prince Francis of Teck\\". ==Education== He was expelled from Wellington College, Berkshire \\"for throwing his housemaster over a hedge to win a bet. All through his life he was an incorrigible gambler. He then went to Cheltenham where he got into more trouble.\\" ==Personal life== Prince Francis was a gambler, whose debts led to him being sent to pursue his military career in India. Prince Francis never married. According to Julia P. Gelardi's Born to Rule, Prince Francis was vigorously pursued by Maud of Wales, his sister's sister-in-law. The two exchanged letters, but it soon became clear that Francis was not interested in Maud. She went on to marry her first cousin Prince Carl of Denmark, becoming Queen of Norway in 1905. Francis had an affair with society beauty Ellen Constance, wife of Francis Needham, 3rd Earl of Kilmorey, to whom he allegedly bequeathed the Cambridge emeralds, part of the Teck family jewels. To recover these family heirlooms, Francis's sister Queen Mary had his will sealed by a court, and subsequently negotiated with Lady Kilmorey to buy back the emeralds, reportedly paying her £10,000 for them.

A Tribute is the 26th prime-time animated television special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz, who introduced the special. It originally aired on the CBS network on May 30, 1983, Memorial Day in the United States, and one week prior to the 39th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion. It aired on CBS only one other time, on May 26, 1984, which was the Saturday before Memorial Day, and ten days prior to the 40th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion. ==Production== The special directly follows the events of the 1980 theatrical feature film Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!). Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and Woodstock are returning from their student exchange in Paris. The film was purposefully open-ended in case there could be other adventures among the characters prior to returning home. Charles Schulz said about its development, Schulz struggled with development of the storyline until shortly after his open-heart surgery in 1981. While recuperating, he was able to finalize the concept with a common line that would tie everything together, \\"What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?\\" == Synopsis == The special opens with Charlie Brown at home and he takes a book from his shelf titled \\"My Trip\\". His younger sister, Sally, approaches and asks him What he's doing. Charlie Brown tells her that he's making a photo album with pictures he took in France when he, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Snoopy and Woodstock went there for a student exchange. Sally realizes that Charlie Brown never told her what happened after the fire in the chateau and how he got home and asks if he learned anything. From there, it is shown in a flashback: As they begin to head back from the chateau to the train station for the return trip to London (where they would return to America by plane), their problematic rental car (a Citroen 2CV) slows their progress, before breaking down entirely in a small French town. Renting another one from a French lady (who immediately accepts their offer after realizing Snoopy is, in fact, a World War I Flying Ace) they soon become lost and camp at a nearby beach for the night. Linus, however, wakes up shortly before daybreak and walks along the beach, realizing they are at Omaha Beach. Linus then tells of the battle of D-Day, leading the group to the nearby cemetery for all of the American soldiers. The voice of General Dwight D. Eisenhower is also heard, reminiscing about the experiences of the battle. Archival news footage is also used, in some cases with the characters inserted through rotoscoping. While proceeding up north, they head towards Ypres, which Linus recognized as the site of a series of battles during World War I. They arrive at a field of red poppies, which grew throughout the wastelands of battles fought during the war, and which serves as a marker for the Ypres battle site. Linus then recites the poem In Flanders Fields, after directing the group to the British field dressing station where McCrae was inspired to write the poem. They come away realizing what the impact of the wars were, and how important the sacrifice of the soldiers was. Standing among the field of red poppies, Linus then turns and asks, \\"What have we learned, Charlie Brown?\\". The scene flashes back to him and Sally. She then tells him that he is pasting the pictures upside down. ==Voice cast== * Brad Kesten – Charlie Brown * Jeremy Schoenberg – Linus van Pelt * Stacy Heather Tolkin – Sally Brown * Brent Hauer/Victoria Vargas – Peppermint Patty * Michael Dockery – Marcie * Monica Parker – French Lady * Bill Melendez – Snoopy and Woodstock ==Award== The special won a Peabody Award for \\"distinguished achievement and meritorious public service\\" in broadcasting. Schulz would later say of the acclaim, ==Home media== The special was released on VHS in 1996.

Aksak Maboul hasn't stopped changing shape and form throughout its existence (the only permanent member being its initiator), exploring diverse musical styles, which however share common aesthetic and musical foundations. Aksak Maboul started out with two studio albums, Onze Danses Pour Combattre la Migraine (1977) and Un Peu de l'Âme des Bandits (1980), the latter with ex-Henry Cow members Chris Cutler and Fred Frith. They were also active in the Rock in Opposition movement in 1979. Around the mid-1980s, Aksak Maboul went into a 30-year hiatus, during which Marc Hollander fully devoted himself to his Crammed Discs label, before resuming his activities as a musician in 2014 by working on the unfinished third Aksak Maboul album, Ex-Futur Album (by Véronique Vincent & Aksak Maboul), that had been written and recorded between 1980 and 1983. The album came out in October 2014. Since the mid 2010s, Aksak Maboul revolves around Marc Hollander and Véronique Vincent, seconded by Faustine Hollander. The band started touring again in 2015, with a new line-up. In May 2020, they have released a brand-new double album entitled Figures. ==History== The story of Aksak Maboul began in 1977 when producer Marc Moulin commissioned Marc Hollander to write and record an album for his ephemeral label Kamikaze. Hollander soon invited his friend Vincent Kenis to join in, and the pair recorded the album Onze Danses Pour Combattre la Migraine (French for \\"Eleven Dances for Fighting Migraine\\"). Hollander (keyboards, reeds, percussion) and Kenis (guitar, bass guitar, keyboards) were joined by guests such as Chris Joris (percussion, keyboards), Catherine Jauniaux (voice) and others. The album was released in 1977 under the name Marc Hollander / Aksak Maboul on Kamikaze Records, and later reissued on Crammed Discs. Onze Danses Pour Combattre la Migraine was a playful mix of musical forms, cultures and genres. With drum machines and looping organ lines, it shuffled between improvised jazz, ethnic music, electronics and classical music. It was largely an instrumental album with snatches of singing and voices. The album contains many ideas and directions later explored by the Crammed Discs label, which Marc Hollander founded in 1980, and still run to this day. In late 1977 Aksak Maboul started performing live, with Hollander, Kenis, Chris Joris, as well as Marc Moulin (keyboards), who was soon replaced by Frank Wuyts. Denis van Hecke (cello) and Michel Berckmans (bassoon, oboe) of Univers Zéro joined in early 1978. In early 1979, Hollander invited Chris Cutler and Fred Frith of the recently defunct avant-rock group Henry Cow to join Aksak Maboul on their next record. They rehearsed together, performed in a few concerts and then went to Sunrise Studio, Kirchberg in Switzerland to record their second album, Un Peu de l'Âme des Bandits (French for \\"A Little of the Bandits' Spirit\\"). This was released in 1980 on Crammed Discs, a new independent record label Hollander had created to release the album. Un Peu de l'Ame des Bandits (released as \\"Aqsak Maboul\\") was more intense and experimental than their first album. It contained complex written sections as well as improvised ambient pieces. It used sampling before samplers were invented and was a mixture of tangos, Turkish tunes, chamber rock, noisy punk rock and pseudo-Varèse music. Like the first album, it was instrumental with a little singing and voices. Back on the road again, Aksak Maboul joined the Rock in Opposition (RIO) movement and in April 1979 they performed at an RIO festival at the Teatro dell'Elfo in Milano, Italy. Aksak Maboul were one of the last of the original RIO bands. In early 1980, Hollander founded the Crammed Discs independent record label. A few months later the original nucleus of Aksak Maboul (Hollander and Kenis) and the core of a Brussels band Les Tueurs de la Lune de Miel joined forces to become The Honeymoon Killers. They toured Europe between 1980 and 1981, although still under the name Aksak Maboul. \\"Bosses de Crosses\\", one of the first pieces they composed, was included on the CD re-issue of Un Peu de l'Ame des Bandits. In 1981, they recorded an album entitled Tueurs de la Lune de Miel / Honeymoon Killers, which attracted a lot of attention across Europe and Japan. The band toured for four years under that name. During that period, Hollander and Honeymoon Killers vocalist Véronique Vincent, aided by Kenis, wrote and recorded a series of electronic avant-pop tracks which were meant to become Aksak Maboul's third album. The release was announced in the first Crammed Discs catalogues (in the early 1980s), but it was not completed and was put on hold, until 2014. The last Aksak Maboul recording to appear in the 1980s came out on a 1984 compilation album, Made to Measure Vol. 1, where the original duo of Hollander and Kenis contributed seven tracks of new material composed for a play by Michel Gheude based on the life of Maïakovsky. By the mid-1980s Aksak Maboul ceased to exist as a permanent group, while Hollander and Kenis played an active role in Crammed Discs' musical policies (producing and/or performing on dozens of albums,http://www.crammed.be/index.php?id=34&art;_id=85http://www.crammed.be/index.php?id=34&art;_id=134&bio;=full VK) . In the late 1980s, Hollander and Kenis produced several electronic dance music tracks under the name Mr Big Mouse. In 2010, Aksak Maboul produced a new track for Tradi-Mods vs Rockers, the tribute album to the Congotronics series which came out on Hollander's Crammed Discs label. Aksak Maboul's contribution is \\"Land Dispute\\", a new take on a song by Congolese band Kasai Allstars. The song is performed by Marc Hollander, Clément Marion & Faustine Hollander.Tradi-Mods Vs Rockers. Alternative Takes On Congotronics In 2014, Hollander resumed work on the unfinished 3rd Aksak Maboul album from 1981–83, mixing and editing tracks from demos and rough versions (some of them retrieved from cassette tapes). Entitled Ex-Futur Album, the album was released under the name Véronique Vincent & Aksak Maboul, preceded by a first single (\\"Chez les Aborigènes\\") (the song had been released as a rough demo on Crammed Discs' compilation Crammed Global Soundclash 1980–89: The Connoisseur Edition in 2003.https://www.discogs.com/Various-Crammed-Global- Soundclash-1980-89-The-Connoisseur-Edition/release/1028675). The album was followed by a video, Afflux de Luxe. In early 2015, encouraged by the enthusiastic reactions to Ex-Futur Album,http://issuu.com/crammed/docs/ex- futur_album_international_pressb Aksak Maboul started playing shows for the first time since the mid-80s, with a new line-up including Véronique Vincent (vocals), Marc Hollander (keyboards), Faustine Hollander (guitar, bass, vocals), Sebastiaan Van den Branden (guitar, bass, synth) and Christophe Claeys (drums, percussion), the latter two being also members of Amatorski. A full album of reinterpretations (covers and reworks) of the songs from Ex- Futur Album, entitled 16 Visions of Ex-Futur, came out in October 2016. It features contributions by Jaakko Eino Kalevi, Aquaserge, Laetitia Sadier, Forever Pavot, Flavien Berger, Nite Jewel, Bullion, Burnt Friedman, Hello Skinny, Marc Collin, Bérangère Maximin, Lena Willikens etc., as well as two \\"self-covers\\" recorded by the 2016 line-up of Aksak Maboul.http://www.crammed.be/index.php?id=37&rel;_id=450 On this occasion, the band created a live show entitled Aksak Maboul Revue, for which they were joined onstage by Laetitia Sadier, Jaakko Eino Kalevi, and members of Aquaserge.https://www.facebook.com/349558451740772/photos/a.484782798218336.123430.349558451740772/1311840808845860/?type=3&theater; At the end of 2018, Aksak Maboul announced that they were starting to work on a brand-new album.https://www.facebook.com/AksakMaboul1/?ref=settings In October 2019, they announced that the new album will be a double, entitled Figures.

The school operated under the umbrella of the Communist International and was in existence from 1921 until the late 1930s. Part of the university was split into the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. ==History== Manabendra Nath Roy, Indian nationalist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh Deng Xiaoping Chiang Ching-kuo, ROC (Taiwan) President, 1978–1988 The Communist University of the Toilers of the East (KUTV) was established 21 April 1921, in Moscow by the Communist International (Comintern) as a training college for communist cadres in the colonial world. The school officially opened on 21 October 1921. It performed a similar function to the International Lenin School, which mainly accepted students from Europe and the Americas. It was headed in its initial years by Karl Radek, who was later purged from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The curriculum included both theoretical and practical matters, including Marxist theory, party organization and propaganda, law and administration, theory and tactics of proletarian revolution, problems of socialist construction, and trade union organization. From Summer 1922 KUTV had regional branches in Baku (in Azerbaijan), Irkutsk (in Siberia, Russia), and Tashkent (in Uzbekistan). The University published Revolutionary East (Революционный Восток, Revoliutsionnyi Vostok). Amongst those who taught there were Ho Chi Minh, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Leonid Krasin, Mikhail Pokrovsky, Khalid Bakdash, Igor Reisner, and Boris Shumyatsky. In 1928 the Japanese Foreign Ministry estimated that some 1,000 foreign students studied at KUTV, and that 400 Chinese students comprised the largest group, followed by 350 ethnic minorities within the Soviet Union, and between 30 and 40 Japanese. The Soviet Union solicited working-class Japanese to study at the KUTV without the Japanese government's consent. The Japanese students studied under Sadaki Takahashi and Keizo Yamamoto, along with several Russian instructors. The Japanese students studied economics, the history of world revolution, Leninism, philosophy, labor union theory, and Japanese studies. Kyuichi Tokuda, a member of the Japanese Communist Party, was instrumental in recruiting and sending these Japanese workers to KUTV via Shanghai and Vladivostok. KUTV was closed in the late 1930s. Its tasks were transferred to smaller, local institutions in the various Soviet republics. ==Alumni== Prominent alumni of the KUTV include: * Anchimaa-Toka, Khertek, chairperson of the Little Khural of Tannu-Tuva * Bakdash, Khalid, secretary of the Syrian Communist Party from 1936 until 1995 * Chiang Ching-kuo, President of the Republic of China(Taiwan), 1925 class * Deng Xiaoping, paramount leader of the People's Republic of China, 1925 class * Evangelista, Crisanto, founder of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930, class of 1928. * Ghaliev, Sultan, the Muslim National Communist * Hà Huy Tập, third General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam * Haywood, Harry, leading African-American member of the Communist Party USA * Jane Golden, black American student who died during her time at KUTVA * Hikmet, Nâzım, Turkish poet * Hồ Chí Minh, President of Vietnam, 1923 class * Israilov, Khasan, Chechen insurrectionist * Katayama, Sen of the American and Japanese CP * Kenyatta, Jomo, first indigenous head of state of Kenya * Lê Hồng Phong, second General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam * Liu Shaoqi, President of the People's Republic of China, 1921 class * Mamakaev, Magomet, Chechen writer * Malaka, Tan of the Indonesian CP * Roy, Manabendra Nath, helped found the Communist parties in Mexico and India * Sidqi Muhammad Najati, writer, activist in the Palestinian independence movement, from 1925 to 1928 * Pishevari, Ja'far, founder and chairman of communist Azerbaijan People's Government * Toka, Salchak, Tuvan government official * Shwala, Sbulawelani, leader of the Young Communist League of South Africa and Revolutionary writer Republic of South Africa * Trần Phú, first General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam * Wang Fanxi, prominent Chinese Trotskyist * Yusuf, Yusuf Salman (Fahd), secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party from 1941 to 1949 * Zachariadis, Nikolaos, General Secretary of Communist Party of Greece and chairman of Greek Communist Provisional Democratic Government, 1947 to 1949 ==See also== * Moscow Sun Yat-sen University * Communist University of the National Minorities of the West * List of modern universities in Europe (1801–1945) * \\"Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow and the Chinese Revolution: A Personal Account\\" by Yueh Sheng ==Footnotes== ==Other sources consulted== * Great Soviet Encyclopedia entry * \\"The Political Tasks of the University of the Peoples of the East\\" speech by Joseph Stalin (Marxists Internet Archive) Category:Comintern Category:Universities and institutes established in the Soviet Union Category:Foreign relations of the Soviet Union Category:Educational institutions established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Russia Category:Defunct universities and colleges in Russia Category:Education in the Soviet Union Category:Universities and colleges in Moscow ","title":"Communist University of the Toilers of the East"},{"id":"2569571","text":"Wiltz (, ) is a commune with town status in north-western Luxembourg, capital of the canton Wiltz.

The project was to be located on of land on Harmon Avenue, east of the Las Vegas Strip. Las Ramblas would have included 11 towers encompassing a hotel and condominium residences for a total of 4,400 units, including 300 hotel rooms. Other amenities would have included a small casino, retail stores, a spa and health club, and nightclubs. The complex would have totaled , and was designed by Arquitectonica. The design was inspired by La Rambla, an open-air street in Barcelona. Las Ramblas was announced in March 2005, as a $2 billion joint project between Centra Properties and The Related Companies. Actor George Clooney and nightclub developer Rande Gerber signed on to invest in the project in August 2005, at which point new amenities had been added to the project that increased its cost to $3 billion. Las Ramblas was scheduled to begin construction in September 2006, with its first phase opening in June 2007. The property for the proposed project was sold for $202 million in June 2006, to Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, the developers of the adjacent W Las Vegas resort that was also cancelled. ==History== ===Announcement=== On March 11, 2005, Centra Properties announced that it had closed escrow on the 996-unit Harbor Island apartments, as well as 14 four-plex buildings, all located on 25 acres of land on Harmon Avenue, east of the Aladdin resort on the Las Vegas Strip and adjacent to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. The cost of the property totaled $85 million. In partnership with The Related Companies, Centra also announced plans to demolish the buildings and replace them with a $2 billion resort complex consisting of high-rise condominiums and a boutique hotel, with the possibility of a casino as well. Kenny Sullivan, a co-owner of Centra, said, \\"Our intentions are to do an amazing project,\\" noting that the 25-acre property was significantly larger in comparison to other projects the company was working on in the Las Vegas Valley. Sullivan said, \\"The way we're designing this, our intention is to build a Main Street down the middle of the property, like Las Ramblas in Spain, then with residential above it. It will be like living in New York City, with lots of activity down on the street.\\" Early designs depicted a complex of 10 to 12 high-rise buildings, expected to be 28 to 32 stories high, although an exact height had not been decided at that time. The complex would include retail stores and up to 3,500 condominium units. The complex was one of many projects that were being planned along Harmon Avenue. Centra expected to submit its plans to Clark County at the end of March 2005, with its first building expected to be under construction in the first quarter of 2006. ===Clooney and Gerber=== In August 2005, it was announced that actor George Clooney and nightclub developer Rande Gerber had signed on to invest a significant, undisclosed amount of their money into the project, now known as Las Ramblas. Clooney was a regular visitor to Las Vegas and a friend of Gerber, who had developed clubs in Nevada, New York, and California. Clooney, while on a flight to Las Vegas to film Ocean's Eleven (2001), discussed with Gerber the idea of opening a resort in the city; Gerber later recalled that they discussed \\"how great it would be to open a hotel and casino and bring back our perception of Old Vegas, with the glamour and romance, our interpretation of the Rat Pack era.\\" The pair continued to hold discussions about developing a project. Clooney and Gerber tried to convince Ocean's Eleven actor Brad Pitt to join the project and be involved in some of the architectural designs, although he ultimately declined. The project was designed by Arquitectonica. In addition to financing, Clooney and Gerber planned to purchase condominium units in the Las Ramblas project as well, and also planned to be actively involved in its design. At that time, the project's cost had increased to $3 billion, with new amenities that included a casino, spa, health club, and restaurants. Through his company, Gerber planned to develop restaurants, clubs, and lounges for the project. Clooney also planned for the resort to include a movie theater that was capable of holding Hollywood-style movie premieres. Construction was now scheduled to begin in mid-2006, with the project expected to ultimately include 11 high-rise buildings. The first phase was expected to be complete by 2008, and would include a 300-room hotel with an additional 370 condominium-hotel units, a second tower with approximately 560 condominium-hotel units, and two gateway condominium buildings with 285 and 344 units respectively. Upon completion, the complex would ultimately offer 300 hotel rooms, 2,764 condominium units, 1,326 condominium-hotel units, and 19 bungalows. Reservations were being accepted at that time. The project was expected to total , with a total of 4,400 units. The complex was described as largely residential, while the retail portions would potentially range between and . According to reports at the time, the small casino would have either been , or would have ranged between and . A casino management instructor at UNLV told the Las Vegas Sun that he believed that the developers had failed to realize the true potential of including a larger casino. Sullivan said the small casino would not attempt to appeal to high rollers, stating that they \\"have their homes on the Strip. That's where they belong and the big casinos can afford to handle the wins and losses. When you have a smaller, more intimate casino like ours, that's not really something you can do.\\" Centra and The Related Companies planned to select two separate management companies to operate the hotel and the casino, although the names of prospective applicants were not disclosed. At the time, Clooney said that the developers were considering a dress code for the casino \\"so that it will feel like you are walking into a more formal Las Vegas of a different age or a classic Monte Carlo casino.\\" Some experts believed that enforcing a dress code would decrease the number of potential customers to the casino by appealing only to a small customer base, while a member of the Nevada Gaming Control Board's enforcement division was unsure if the dress code would be legal because of a law that required gambling to be conducted within view of the general public. Sullivan said that Clooney wanted to bring elegance to the project, but acknowledged that Clooney's idea of a dress code would not work in a Las Vegas casino. Clooney mentioned the proposed dress code during an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman in September 2005, saying, \\"No cutoffs, culottes or espadrilles.\\" That month, Mark A. Brown, who formerly operated three of Donald Trump's casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, was reportedly in consideration for the Las Ramblas project. In January 2006, Related confirmed that it would proceed with plans to build Las Ramblas, despite the cancellation of one of its high-rise condominium projects in Las Vegas. Clooney spoke about the project during an appearance on Larry King Live on February 15, 2006, stating that it would be \\"the type of place where you dress up to see a show. The kind of casino that doesn't exist anymore.\\" In addition, Clooney said he would donate 25 percent of his profits from Las Ramblas to African relief. The following day, casino executive Bobby Baldwin who was in charge of MGM's $7 billion CityCenter project criticized the Las Ramblas project: \\"I think that's been about as successful as me acting in movies.\\" ===Cancellation=== On March 29, 2006, it was reported that the Las Ramblas was no longer accepting reservations, and that the property was under contract to be purchased by Edge Resorts Group, a partner in the development of the planned W Las Vegas, located on adjacent land. Clooney had reportedly invested $10 million in the Las Ramblas project. On April 5, 2006, Gerber responded to reports that the property had been put up for sale: \\"There are some great opportunities, including selling the land. If that happens, George and I will invest in something else in Las Vegas\\". By May 2006, the project had been cancelled, due to decreased sales and rising construction costs. On June 4, 2006, it was announced that the property had been sold to Edge Resorts for $202 million. Clooney said he would donate his profits from the sale to the African Debt Relief Project. Edge Resorts planned to construct a boutique hotel district known as Edge East on the property to accompany W Las Vegas. Marty Burger of Related said that for the company, Las Ramblas \\"became more about gaming than the residential community we were trying to build. We're the largest developer of residential property in the country, and we saw ourselves getting away from what we do best.\\" Groundbreaking on Las Ramblas had been scheduled to begin in September 2006, with the first phase scheduled to open in June 2007, to accompany Clooney's new film, Ocean's Thirteen, which he wanted to premiere in Las Vegas. In 2010, Jorge Perez of Related said that selling the property was one of the smartest decisions he had ever made: \\"The market was clearly showing signs of decline, and the demand for construction services was so great that construction prices had been inflated to the point of making our project unfeasible. Instead of taking the immense risk, I decided to sell the land for a huge profit.\\" The vacant land was put up for sale in May 2015. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Paradise, Nevada Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States ","title":"Las Ramblas Resort"},{"id":"2569599","text":"Rheita can refer to: * Rheita (crater), the lunar crater * Vallis Rheita, the lunar valley * Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita (1597-1660), the Austrian-Czech astronomer after whom the crater and the valley are named ","title":"Rheita"},{"id":"2569605","text":"Esq or ESQ may refer to: * Employee screening questionnaire, a psychological test developed by Canadian psychology professor Douglas N.

Early in 1923 the vessel together with two other tankers was sold to General Petroleum Corporation and renamed Emidio. The tanker spent the vast majority of her career carrying oil along the West Coast of the United States as well as between West and East coast. In December 1941 she was shelled and damaged by I-17 and eventually wrecked with a loss of five crew. ==Design and construction== After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1047 tank ship was a standard tanker of approximately 10,100 tons deadweight designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. and adopted by USSB. Hammac was part of the order for 6 vessels placed by USSB with Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. on 18 April 1918 and was laid down on 30 November 1920 at the builder's shipyard at Potrero Point and launched on 25 May 1921 (yard number 5274). The ship was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel and had two main decks. The tanker had her machinery placed aft and a cargo pump room located amidships, and had cargo tanks constructed throughout the vessel with a total capacity to carry 3,369,862 gallons of oil. In addition, the ship had four booms and 4 winches to handle deck load and dry hold cargoes. The vessel had electric lights installed along the decks and was also equipped with wireless of De Forest type. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, and had a depth of . Hammac was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 10,000. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 422 Nhp (3,100 ihp) vertical triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch boilers fitted for oil fuel. The sea trials were held outside the Heads on 12-13 July 1921 with the tanker performing satisfactorily. Upon completion of the twelve hour long trial run, the ship returned to port and after applying final touches was handed over to the USSB. ==Operational history== Following the delivery to her owners the tanker was laid up in Bernicia due to scarcity of cargo and overabundance of tonnage. Hammac remained idle until the end of January 1922 when demand picked up and it appeared the recession was easing. After undergoing maintenance, the ship was chartered for one trip by Union Oil to deliver gasoline to United Kingdom. At the time there was widespread confusion as to why the delivery was effected from the West Coast when it was cheaper and quicker to do the same from the East Coast of the United States. Nevertheless, after loading over 3,000,000 gallons of gasoline the tanker departed San Francisco on 14 March 1922 bound for Thames Haven. Hammac passed through the Panama Canal on March 28-30 and reached her destination on April 21. After unloading her cargo, the tanker left England on April 27 and arrived at Port Eads on May 19, successfully concluding her maiden voyage. The tanker conducted one more trip carrying oil for Union Oil from the Gulf ports to Philadelphia before being switched to molasses trade. In that role Hammac carried molasses in bulk from Cuba to Gulf ports or Europe. For example, in December 1922 she brought in approximately 9,500 tons of molasses to Rotterdam. On her next trip the ship brought in a cargo of beet molasses from Holland to Baltimore. Due to lack of storage space for this type of cargo, it had to be unloaded into a discarded tanker Brindina. In March 1923 several tankers including Hammac, still in the USSB possession were sold to Union Oil and General Petroleum Corp. Following the tanker's arrival in Baltimore she was inspected and transferred to her new owners and departed for West Coast on May 26 reaching San Francisco on June 15. Under new ownership, Hammac conducted one trip with a cargo of gasoline to Philadelphia in July 1923 before returning to West Coast and entering coastal trade there. ===Sinking=== Emidio was sailing in ballast from Seattle, Washington en route to San Pedro, California. The found Emidio off Cape Mendocino on the early afternoon of 20 December 1941, immediately attacking with its 14 cm deck gun. Realizing that the situation was futile, Captain Farrow raised a white flag and gave the order to abandon ship. Ignoring the surrender, I-17 continued firing from its deck gun, blasting three crew members who were lowering a lifeboat overboard. Four crew members remained on board: a radio operator and three engineers. I-17 fired a torpedo which struck the engine room and killed two of the engineers and injured the third. In total I-17 hit the tanker with five shells from its 14 cm deck gun and one torpedo killing five crew members. A Catalina flying boat of 44 Patrol Squadron attacked I-17 with depth charges, but the submarine dove and escaped. The United States Coast Guard cutter Shawnee rescued the remaining 31 survivors who had rowed 16 hours to Humboldt Bay.Panic on the Pacific: How America Prepared for the West Coast Invasion, By Bill Yenne The abandoned tanker drifted north and broke up on the rocks off Crescent City. The bow drifted into the harbor, where it lay until scrapped in 1959. The remains of the hull are still in the harbor, near a commemorative plaque. The site has been declared a California Historical Landmark #497. ==Awards== Louis George Finch, able seaman aboard SS Emidio was given the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal by the president of the United States. This was for his extraordinary courage and disregard of his own safety in voluntarily going into the sea to lighten an overload lifeboat. He stayed in water for one and half hours till another lifeboat came. For the president the award was given by Admiral Emory S.

The early Acts concentrated on regulating the hours of work and moral welfare of young children employed in cotton mills but were effectively unenforced until the Act of 1833 established a professional Factory Inspectorate. The regulation of working hours was then extended to women by an Act of 1844. The Factories Act 1847 (known as the Ten Hour Act), together with Acts in 1850 and 1853 remedying defects in the 1847 Act, met a long-standing (and by 1847 well-organised) demand by the millworkers for a ten-hour day. The Factory Acts also sought to ameliorate the conditions under which mill-children worked with requirements on ventilation, sanitation, and guarding of machinery. Introduction of the ten-hour day proved to have none of the dire consequences predicted by its opponents, and its apparent success effectively ended theoretical objections to the principle of factory legislation; from the 1860s onwards more industries were brought within the Factory Act. ==Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802== The Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802 (42 Geo III c.73) was introduced by Sir Robert Peel; it addressed concerns felt by the medical men of Manchester about the health and welfare of children employed in cotton mills, and first expressed by them in 1784 in a report on an outbreak of 'putrid fever' at a mill at Radcliffe owned by Peel. Although the Act included some hygiene requirements for all textile mills, it was largely concerned with the employment of apprentices; it left the employment of 'free' (non-indentured) children unregulated. It allowed (but did not require) local magistrates to enforce compliance with its requirements, and therefore went largely unenforced. As the first attempt to improve the lot of factory children, it is often seen as paving the way for future Factory Acts. At best, it only partially paved the way; its restriction to apprentices (where there was a long tradition of legislation) meant that it was left to later Factory Acts to establish the principle of intervention by Parliament on humanitarian grounds on worker welfare issues against the \\"laissez-faire\\" political and economic orthodoxy of the age which held that to be ill-advised. Under the Act, regulations and rules came into force on 2 December 1802 and applied to all textile mills and factories employing three or more apprentices or twenty employees. The buildings must have sufficient windows and openings for ventilation, and should be cleaned at least twice yearly with quicklime and water; this included ceilings and walls. Each apprentice was to be given two sets of clothing, suitable linen, stockings, hats, and shoes, and a new set each year thereafter. Apprentices could not work during the night (between 9 pm and 6 am), and their working hours could not exceed 12 hours a day, excluding the time taken for breaks. A grace period was provided to allow factories time to adjust, but all night-time working by apprentices was to be discontinued by June 1804. All apprentices were to be educated in reading, writing and arithmetic for the first four years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held in a part of the mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices were to be taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed. Local magistrates had to appoint two inspectors known as 'visitors' to ensure that factories and mills were complying with the Act; one was to be a clergyman and the other a Justice of the Peace, neither to have any connection with the mill or factory. The visitors had the power to impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at any time of the day to inspect the premises. The Act was to be displayed in two places in the factory. Owners who refused to comply with any part of the Act could be fined between £2 and £5. ==Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819== The Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819 (59 Geo. III c66) stated that no children under 9 were to be employed and that children aged 9–16 years were limited to 12 hours' work per day.Early factory legislation. Parliament.uk. Accessed 2 September 2011. It applied to the cotton industry only, but covered all children, whether apprentices or not. It was seen through Parliament by Sir Robert Peel; it had its origins in a draft prepared by Robert Owen in 1815 but the Act that emerged in 1819 was much watered-down from Owen's draft. It was also effectively unenforceable; enforcement was left to local magistrates, but they could only inspect a mill if two witnesses had given sworn statements that the mill was breaking the Act. An amending Act (60 Geo. III., c. 5) was passed in December 1819. When any accident disabled a factory (as had just happened at New Lanark), night working in the rest of the works by those who had previously worked in the affected factory was permitted until the accident was made good. ==Cotton Mills Regulation Act 1825== ' A large manufactory' : the (water-powered) mill complex at Darley Abbey viewed end-on In 1825 John Cam Hobhouse introduced a Bill to allow magistrates to act on their own initiative, and to compel witnesses to attend hearings; noting that so far there had been only two prosecutions under the 1819 Act. Opposing the Bill a millowner MP agreed that the 1819 Bill was widely evaded, but went on to remark that this put millowners at the mercy of millhands \\"The provisions of Sir Robert Peel's act had been evaded in many respects: and it was now in the power of the workmen to ruin many individuals, by enforcing the penalties for children working beyond the hours limited by that act\\" and that this showed to him that the best course of action was to repeal the 1819 Act. On the other hand, another millowner MP supported Hobhouse's Bill saying that he > \\"agreed that, the bill was loudly called for, and, as the proprietor of a > large manufactory, admitted that there was much that required remedy. He > doubted whether shortening the hours of work would be injurious even to the > interests of the manufacturers; as the children would be able, while they > were employed, to pursue their occupation with greater vigour and activity. > At the same time, there was nothing to warrant a comparison with the > condition of the negroes in the West Indies. Hobhouse's Bill also sought to limit hours worked to eleven a day; the Act as passed (the Cotton Mills Regulation Act :6 Geo. IV., c. 63) improved the arrangements for enforcement, but kept a twelve-hour day Monday-Friday with a shorter day of nine hours on Saturday. The 1819 Act had specified that a meal break of an hour should be taken between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.; a subsequent Act (60 Geo. III., c. 5) allowing water-powered mills to exceed the specified hours in order to make up for lost time widened the limits to 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Hobhouse's Act of 1825 set the limits to 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. A parent's assertion of a child's age was sufficient, and relieved employers of any liability should the child in fact be younger. JPs who were millowners or the fathers or sons of millowners could not hear complaints under the Act. ==Act to Amend the Laws relating to the employment of Children in Cotton Mills & Manufactories 1829== In 1829, Parliament passed an 'Act to Amend the Laws relating to the employment of Children in Cotton Mills & Manufactories' which relaxed formal requirements for the service of legal documents on millowners (documents no longer had to specify all partners in the concern owning or running the mill; it would be adequate to identify the mill by the name by which it was generally known). The bill passed the Commons but was subject to a minor textual amendment by the Lords (adding the words 'to include') and then received the Royal Assent without the Commons first being made aware of (or agreeing to) the Lords' amendment. To rectify this inadvertent breach of privilege, a further Act (making no other change to the Act already passed) was promptly passed on the last day of the parliamentary session. ==Labour in Cotton Mills Act 1831 (Hobhouse's Act)== Mule Spinning in action : child 'piecers' spent their day mending broken threads on the moving machinery An Act to repeal the Laws relating to Apprentices and other young Persons employed in Cotton Factories and in Cotton Mills, and to make further Provisions in lieu thereof (1 & 2 Will. IV c39) :(Acts repealed were 59 Geo. III, c. 66; 60 Geo. III, c. 5; 6 Geo. IV, c. 63; 10 Geo. IV, c. 51; 10 Geo. IV, c. 63) In 1831 Hobhouse introduced a further bill with – he claimed to the Commons – the support of the leading manufacturers who felt that \\"unless the House should step forward and interfere so as to put an end to the night-work in the small factories where it was practised, it would be impossible for the large and respectable factories which conformed to the existing law to compete with them.\\" The Act repealed the previous Acts, and consolidated their provisions in a single Act, which also introduced further restrictions. Night working was forbidden for anyone under 21 and if a mill had been working at night the onus of proof was on the millowner (to show nobody under-age had been employed). The limitation of working hours to twelve now applied up to age eighteen. Complaints could only be pursued if made within three weeks of the offence; on the other hand justices of the peace who were the brothers of millowners were now also debarred from hearing Factory Act cases. Hobhouse's claim of general support was optimistic; the Bill originally covered all textile mills; the Act as passed again applied only to cotton mills. ==Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833 (Althorp's Act)== Carding, roving, and drawing in a Manchester cotton mill c. 1834 === The first 'Ten Hour Bill' – Sadler's Bill (1832), Ashley's Bill (1833) === Dissatisfied with the outcome of Hobhouse's efforts, in 1832 Michael Thomas Sadler introduced a Bill extending the protection existing Factory Acts gave to children working in the cotton industry to those in other textile industries, and reducing to ten per day the working hours of children in the industries legislated for. A network of 'Short Time Committees' had grown up in the textile districts of Yorkshire and Lancashire, working for a 'ten-hour day Act ' for children, with many millhands in the Ten Hour Movement hoping that this would in practice also limit the adult working day. Witnesses to one of the Committees taking evidence on Peel's Bill had noted that there were few millworkers over forty, and that they themselves expected to have to stop mill work at that age because of 'the pace of the mill' unless working hours were reduced. see in particular the evidence of a 36-year-old spinner Robert Hyde pp 25–30 Hobhouse advised Richard Oastler, an early and leading advocate of factory legislation for the woolen industry, that Hobhouse had got as much as he could, given the opposition of Scottish flax-spinners and 'the state of public business': if Sadler put forward a Bill matching the aims of the Short Time Committees \\"he will not be allowed to proceed a single stage with any enactment, and … he will only throw an air of ridicule and extravagance over the whole of this kind of legislation\\".John Cam Hobhouse to Richard Oastler, 16 November 1831, quoted in 'Alfred' The History of the Factory Movement from the year 1802, to the Enactment of the Ten Hours' Bill in 1847, (1857) vol I, pp 138–41 , reproduced in (pages 92–94; quote is from page 94 of Ward) Oastler responded that a failure with a Ten Hour Bill would \\"not dishearten its friends. It will only spur them on to greater exertions, and would undoubtedly lead to certain success \\"Richard Oastler to John Cam Hobhouse, 19 November 1831, quoted in 'Alfred' The History of the Factory Movement from the year 1802, to the Enactment of the Ten Hours' Bill in 1847, (1857) vol I, pp 141–6, reproduced in (pages 94–98; quote (italics are in original) is from page 98 of Ward)the correspondence can also be found as in the British Newspaper Archive ==== Sadler's Bill (1832) ==== Sadler's Bill when introduced indeed corresponded closely to the aims of the Short Time Committees. Hobhouse's ban on nightwork up to 21 was retained; no child under nine was to be employed; and the working day for under-eighteens was to be no more than ten hours (eight on Saturday). These restrictions were to apply across all textile industries. The Second Reading debate on Sadler's bill did not take place until 16 March 1832, the Reform Bill having taken precedence over all other legislation. Meanwhile, petitions both for and against the Bill had been presented to the Commons; both Sir Robert Peel (not the originator of the 1802 bill, but his son, the future Prime Minister) and Sir George Strickland had warned that the Bill as it stood was too ambitious: more MPs had spoken for further factory legislation than against, but many supporters wanted the subject to be considered by a Select Committee. Sadler had resisted this: \\"if the present Bill was referred to one, it would not become a law this Session, and the necessity of legislating was so apparent, that he was unwilling to submit to the delay of a Committee, when he considered they could obtain no new evidence on the subject\\". In his long Second Reading speech, Sadler argued repeatedly that a Committee was unnecessary, but concluded by accepting that he had not convinced the House or the Government of this, and that the Bill would be referred to a Select Committee. (Lord Althorp, responding for the Government, noted that Sadler's speech made a strong case for considering legislation, but thought it did little to directly support the details of the Bill; the Government supported the Bill as leading to a Select Committee, but would not in advance pledge support for whatever legislation the Committee might recommend). This effectively removed any chance of a Factories Regulation Act being passed before Parliament was dissolved. Sadler was made chairman of the Committee, which allowed him to make his case by hearing evidence from witnesses of Sadler's selection, on the understanding that opponents of the Bill (or of some feature of it) would then have their innings. Sadler attempted (31 July 1832) to progress his Bill without waiting for the committee's report; when this abnormal procedure was objected to by other MPs, he withdrew the Bill. Sadler, as chairman of the committee, reported the minutes of evidence on 8 August 1832, when they were ordered to be printed. Parliament was prorogued shortly afterwards: Sadler gave notice of his intention to reintroduce a Ten-Hour Bill in the next session ==== Ashley's Bill (1833) ==== Sadler, however, was not an MP in the next session: in the first election for the newly enfranchised two member constituency of Leeds he was beaten into third place by Thomas Babington Macaulay a Whig politician of national standing and John Marshall, the son of one of Leeds' leading millowners. Casting around for a new parliamentary advocate for factory reform, the short-time movement eventually secured the services of Lord Ashley, eldest son of the 6th Earl of Shaftesbury. By the time the new parliament met, public opinion (especially outside the textile districts) had been powerfully affected by 'the report of Mr Sadler's Committee'. Extracts from this began to appear in newspapers in January 1833 and painted a picture of the life of a mill-child as one of systematic over-work and systematic brutality. The conclusion many papers drew was that Sadler's Bill should be revived and passed. However, when Ashley introduced a Bill essentially reproducing Sadler's MPs criticised both the report (since the only witnesses heard had been Sadler's, the report was unbalanced; since witnesses had not testified on oath, doubts were expressed about the accuracy/veracity of the more lurid accounts of factory life) and Sadler's conduct. 'An air of ridicule and extravagance' had been thrown not upon factory legislation, but upon the use of Select Committees for fact-finding on factory conditions.\\"As to the proceedings of Mr Sadler and his committee, or rather Mr Sadler in committee, last year, they are a perfect burlesque on legislative inquiries\\" A Factory Commission was set up to investigate and report. Sadler and the Short Time Committees objected to any further fact-finding and attempted to obstruct the work of the Commissioners. Ashley's Bill proceeded to a Second Reading in early July 1833 (when the likely main recommendations of the Commission were known, but its report was not yet available to MPs); Ashley wanted the Bill to then be considered by a Committee of the whole House and defeated Lord Althorp's amendment to refer the Bill to a Select Committee. However at Committee stage the first point considered where the Bill differed from the Commission's was the age up to which hours of work should be limited Ashley lost (heavily) the vote on this, and left it to Althorp to pilot through a Factory Act based upon the Commission's recommendations. === 1833 Factory Commission === This toured the textile districts and made extensive investigations. It wasted little time in doing so, and even less in considering its report; as with other Whig commissions of the period it was suspected to have had a good idea of its recommendations before it started work. During the course of the Factory Commission’s inquiries, relationships between it and the Ten Hour Movement became thoroughly adversarial, the Ten Hour Movement attempting to organise a boycott of the commission's investigations: this was in sharp contrast with the commissioners' practice of dining with the leading manufacturers of the districts they visited. The commission’s report(Report of the Commissioners on Conditions in Factories, Parliamentary Papers, 1833, volume XX), subsequent extracts are as given in extracts from did not support the more lurid details of Sadler's report – mills were not hotbeds of sexual immorality, and beating of children was much less common than Sadler had asserted (and was dying out). Major millowners such as the Strutts did not tolerate it (and indeed were distinguished by their assiduous benevolence to their employees). Working conditions for mill- children were preferable to those in other industries: after a visit to the coal mine at Worsley one of the commission staff had written Nonetheless, the commission reportedthat mill children did work unduly long hours, leading to * Permanent deterioration of the physical constitution: * The production of disease often wholly irremediable: and * The partial or entire exclusion (by reason of excessive fatigue) from the means of obtaining adequate education and acquiring useful habits, or of profiting by those means when afforded and that these ill-effects were so marked and significant that government intervention was justified but where Sadler's Bill was for a ten-hour day for all workers under eighteen, the commission recommended an eight-hour day for those under thirteen, hoping for a two-shift system for them which would allow mills to run 16 hours a day. ===Althorp's Act (1833)=== The Factory Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. IV) c103 was an attempt to establish a regular working day in textile manufacture. The act had the following provisions: *Children (ages 9–12) are limited to 48 hours per week.Nardinelli, Clark. \\"Child Labor and the Factory Acts.\\" The Journal of Economic History 40, no. 4 (1980): 739–55. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2119999. *Children under 9 could not be employed in textile manufacture (except in silk mills). *Children under 18 must not work at night (i.e. after 8.30 p.m. and before 5.30 a.m.) *Children (ages 9–13) must not work more than 8 hours with an hour lunch break. (Employers could (and it was envisaged they would) operate a 'relay system' with two shifts of children between them covering the permitting working day; adult millworkers therefore being 'enabled' to work a 15-hour day) *Children (ages 9–13) could only be employed if they had a schoolmaster's certificate that the previous week they had two hours of education per day (This was to be paid for by a deduction of a penny in the shilling from the children's wages. A factory inspector could disallow payment of any of this money to an 'incompetent' schoolmaster, but could not cancel a certificate issued by him.)R J Saunders \\"Report on the Establishment of Schools in the Factory District\\" in *Children (ages 14–18) must not work more than 12 hours a day with an hour lunch break. *Provided for routine inspections of factories and set up a Factory Inspectorate (subordinate to the Home Office) to carry out such inspections, with the right to demand entry and the authority to act as a magistrate. (Under previous Acts supervision had been by local 'visitors' (a Justice of the Peace (JP), and a clergyman) and effectively discretionary). The inspectors were empowered to make and enforce rules and regulations on the detailed application of the Act, independent of the Home Secretary *Millowners and their close relatives were no longer debarred (if JPs) from hearing cases brought under previous Acts, but were unlikely to be effectively supervised by their colleagues on the local bench or be zealous in supervising other millowners The Act failed to specify whether lunar or calendar months were intended where the word 'monthly' was used, and one clause limited hours of work per week where a daily limit had been intended. A short amending Act was therefore passed in February 1834 =='Ineffectual attempts at legislation' (1835–1841)== The 1833 Act had few admirers in the textile districts when it came into force. The short-time movement objected to its substitution for Ashley's Bill, and hoped to secure a Ten-Hour Bill. Millowners resented and political economists deplored legislatory interference in response to public opinion, and hoped that the Act could soon be repealed (completely or in part). In 1835, the first report of the Factory Inspectors noted that the education clauses were totally impracticable, and relay working (with a double set of children, both sets working eight hours; the solution which allowed Althorp's Bill to outbid Ashley's in the apparent benefit to children) was difficult if not impracticable, there not being enough children.They also reported that they had been unable to discover any deformity produced by factory labour, nor any injury to health or shortening of life of factory children caused by working a twelve-hour day. ===Poulett Thomson's Bill (1836)=== Three of the four inspectors had recommended in their first report that all children 12 or older should be allowed to work twelve hours a day. This was followed by an agitation in the West Riding for relaxation or repeal of the 1833 Act; the short-time movement alleged that workers were being 'leant on' by their employers to sign petitions for repeal, and countered by holding meetings and raising petitions for a ten-hour act. Charles Hindley prepared a draft bill limiting the hours that could be worked by any mill employing people under twenty-one, with no child under ten to be employed, and no education clauses. Hindley's bill was published at the end of the 1834-5 parliamentary session, but was not taken forward in the next session, being pre-empted by a government bill introduced by Charles Poulett Thomson, the President of the Board of Trade, allowing children twelve or over to work twelve hours a day. The second reading of Poulett Thomson's Bill was opposed by Ashley, who denounced the bill as a feeler towards total repeal of protection for factory children. The Bill passed its second reading by a majority of only two (178–176) – a moral defeat for a government measure. Furthermore, although Poulett Thomson had opened the debate by saying that \\"at the present moment he was unwilling to re-open the whole factory question\\", Peel had said he would vote for the second reading, not because he supported the bill, but because its committee stage would allow the introduction of additional amendments to factory legislation. Poulett Thomson (eventually) abandoned the bill. In 1837 Poulett Thomson announced his intention to bring in a factory bill; consequently Ashley, who had intended to introduce a ten- hour bill, dropped this, promising instead a ten-hour amendment to the government bill. No progress had been made with the government bill when the death of King William, and the consequent dissolution of parliament, brought the session to an end. ===Fox Maule's Bill (1838)=== In the 1838 session another government factory bill was introduced by Fox Maule Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. Children in silk mills were not to work more than ten hours a day (but this was not backed up by any certification of age). Otherwise, the bill made no changes to age limits or hours of work, but repealed the education clauses of the 1833 Act, replacing them with literacy tests. After a transitional period, children who could not read the New Testament were not to be employed more than nine hours a day; children who could not read an easy reader to be published by the Home Secretary could not be employed.full text of the draft Bill is given in His political opponents mocked the thought of Lord John Russell turning his undoubted talents to the production of a reading primer, and it was soon announced that once the Bill went into committee it would be amended to restore the 1833 education clauses. The second reading of the bill was scheduled for 22 June, but in early June Russell announced that the bill had been abandoned for the session. ===Ashley denounces government complacency=== On 22 June, when the government intended to progress a bill on Irish tithes, Ashley forestalled them, moving the second reading of the factory bill. He complained of the evasive conduct of ministers and government apathy and complacency on factory reform. Peel (who normally, even in opposition, deprecated obstruction of government business by backbenchers) supported Ashley: he held very different views on the issue from Ashley, but the issue was important, contentious, and should not be evaded : \\"so long as ineffectual attempts at legislation remained on the table of the house, the excitement of the manufacturing districts would continue to be kept up\\": not to be found in the on-line Hansard,; that jumps from volume 42 to volume 44 Ashley's motion was lost narrowly 111 to 119. Ashley later attacked the government and its complacency and connivance at the shortcomings in the current Factory Act identified by the government's own Factory Inspectors: * Althorp's Act had claimed superiority over Ashley's Bill of 1833 because of its shorter working hours for children and its provision for education. Those provisions had been violated from the outset, and continued to be violated, and the government connived at those violations: \\"notwithstanding the urgent representations and remonstrances of their own inspectors, the Government had done nothing whatever to assist them in the discharge of their duties\\" * Millowners sat on the bench and adjudicated in their own cases (because Althorp's Act had repealed the provisions in Hobhouse's Act forbidding this): they countersigned surgeon's certificates for children employed in their own factory . One factory inspector had reported a case of a millowner sitting as magistrate on a case brought against his own sons, as tenants of a mill he owned. * Magistrates had the power to mitigate the penalties specified in the Act. The inspectors reported that magistrates habitually did so, and to an extent which defeated the law; it was more profitable to break the law and pay the occasional fine than to comply with the Act. > \\"After these representations .. by his own inspectors, how could the noble > Lord opposite reconcile it with his conscience as an individual, and with > his public duty as a Minister of the Crown, during the whole course of his > administration, never to have brought forward any measure for the removal of > so tremendous an evil?\\" * The education clauses were not observed in one mill in fifty; where they were, the factory inspectors reported, \\"the schooling given is a mere mockery of instruction\\"; vice and ignorance, and their natural consequences, misery and suffering, were rife among the population of the manufacturing districts. \\"Would the noble Lord opposite venture to say that the education of the manufacturing classes was a matter of indifference to the country at large?\\" > \\"He wanted them to decide whether they would amend, or repeal, or enforce > the Act now in existence; but if they would do none of these things, if they > continued idly indifferent, and obstinately shut their eyes to this great > and growing evil, if they were careless of the growth of an immense > population, plunged in ignorance and vice, which neither feared God, nor > regarded man, then he warned them that they must be prepared for the very > worst result that could befall a nation.\\" ===Fox Maule tries again (1839–41)=== In the 1839 session, Fox Maule revived the 1838 Bill with alterations. The literacy tests were gone, and the education clauses restored. The only other significant changes in the scope of the legislation were that working extra hours to recover lost time was now only permitted for water-powered mills, and magistrates could not countersign surgeon's certificates if they were mill-owners or occupiers (or father, son, or brother of a mill-owner or occupier). Details of enforcement were altered; there was no longer any provision for inspectors to be magistrates ex officio, sub-inspectors were to have nearly the same enforcement powers as inspectors; unlike inspectors they could not examine witnesses on oath, but they now had the same right of entry into factory premises as inspectors.full text is given in Declaring a schoolmaster incompetent was now to invalidate certificates of education issued by him, and a clause in the bill aimed to make it easier to establish and run a school for factory children; children at schools formed under this clause were not to be educated in a creed objected to by their parents. The bill, introduced in February, did not enter its committee stage until the start of July In committee, a ten-hour amendment was defeated 62–94, but Ashley moved and carried 55-49 an amendment removing the special treatment of silk mills. The government then declined to progress the amended bill. No attempt was made to introduce a factory bill in 1840; Ashley obtained a Select Committee on the working of the existing Factory Act, which took evidence, most notably from members of the Factory Inspectorate, throughout the session with a view to a new bill being introduced in 1841. Ashley was then instrumental in obtaining a Royal Commission on the employment of children in mines and manufactures, which eventually reported in 1842 (mines) and 1843 (manufactures): two of the four Commissioners had served on the 1833 Factory Commission; the other two were serving factory inspectors. In March 1841 Fox Maule introduced a Factory Bill and a separate Silk Factory Bill. The Factory Bill provided that children were now not to work more than seven hours a day; if working before noon they couldn't work after one p.m. The education clauses of the 1839 Bill were retained. 'Dangerous machinery' was now to be brought within factory legislation. Both the Factory and Silk Factory bills were given unopposed second readings on the understanding that all issues would be discussed at committee stage, both were withdrawn before going into committee, the Whigs having been defeated on a motion of no confidence, and a General Election imminent. == Graham's Factory Education Bill (1843) == The Whigs were defeated in the 1841 general election, and Sir Robert Peel formed a Conservative government. Ashley let it be known that he had declined office under Peel because Peel would not commit himself not to oppose a ten-hour bill; Ashley therefore wished to retain freedom of action on factory issues. In February 1842, Peel indicated definite opposition to a ten-hour bill, and Sir James Graham , Peel's Home Secretary, declared his intention to proceed with a bill prepared by Fox Maule, but with some alterations. In response to the findings of his Royal Commission, Ashley saw through Parliament a Mines And Collieries Act banning the employment of women and children underground; the measure was welcomed by both front benches, with Graham assuring Ashley \\"that her Majesty's Government would render him every assistance in carrying on the measure\\". In July, it was announced that the Government did not intend any modification to the Factory Act in that session. ===The education issue and Graham's bill=== The Royal Commission had investigated not only the working hours and conditions of the children, but also their moral state. It had found much of concern in their habits and language, but the greatest concern was that \\"the means of secular and religious instruction.. are so grievously defective, that, in all the districts, great numbers of Children and Young Persons are growing up without any religious, moral, or intellectual training; nothing being done to form them to habits of order, sobriety, honesty, and forethought, or even to restrain them from vice and crime.\\"2nd Report of the Commission on the Employment of Children (Trades and Manufactures), (1843) Parliamentary Papers volume XIII, pp 195–204 as quoted in In 1843, Ashley initiated a debate on \\"the best means of diffusing the benefits and blessings of a moral and religious education among the working classes...\\" Responding, Graham stressed that the issue was not a party one (and was borne out on this by the other speakers in the debate); although the problem was a national one, the government would for the moment bring forward measures only for the two areas of education in which the state already had some involvement; the education of workhouse children and the education of factory children. The measures he announced related to England and Wales; Scotland had an established system of parochial schools run by its established church, with little controversy, since in Scotland there was no dissent on doctrine, only on questions of discipline. In the 'education clauses' of his Factory Education Bill of 1843, he proposed to make government loans to a new class of government factory schools effectively under the control of the Church of England and the local magistrates. The default religious education in these schools would be Anglican, but parents would be allowed to opt their children out of anything specifically Anglican; if the opt-out was exercised, religious education would be as in the best type of Dissenter-run schools. Once a trust school was open in a factory district, factory children in that district would have to provide a certificate that they were being educated at it or at some other school certified as 'efficient'. The 'labour clauses' forming the other half of the bill were essentially a revival of Fox Maule's draft; children could work only in the morning or in the afternoon, but not both. There were two significant differences; the working day for children was reduced to six and a half hours, and the minimum age for factory work would be reduced to eight. Other clauses increased penalties and assisted enforcement. === Reaction, retreats, and abandonment === A Second Reading debate was held to flesh out major issues before going into committee. At Lord John Russell's urging, the discussion was temperate, but there was considerable opposition to the proposed management of the new schools, which effectively excluded ratepayers (who would repay the loan and meet any shortfall in running costs) and made no provision for a Dissenter presence (to see fair play). The provisions for appointment of schoolmasters were also criticised; as they stood they effectively excluded Dissenters. Out of Parliament, the debate was less temperate; objections that the Bill had the effect of strengthening the Church became objections that it was a deliberate attack on Dissent, that its main purpose was to attack Dissent, and that the Royal Commission had deliberately and grossly defamed the population of the manufacturing districts to give a spurious pretext for an assault on Dissent.e.g. open letter by Edward Baines junior published as ; Jelinger Cookson Symons, a member of the Commission staff who Baines had attacked by name responded in Protest meetings were held on that basis throughout the country, and their resolutions condemning the bill and calling for its withdrawal were supported by a campaign of organised petitions: that session Parliament received 13,369 petitions against the bill as drafted with a total of 2,069,058 signatures. (For comparison, in the same session there were 4574 petitions for total repeal of the Corn Laws, with a total of 1,111,141 signatures.) Lord John Russell drafted resolutions calling for modification of the bill along the lines suggested in Parliament; the resolutions were denounced as inadequate by the extra-parliamentary opposition. Graham amended the educational clauses, reports his exposition of the amendments; text of amended clauses is in but this only triggered a fresh round of indignation meetingse.g. – page 6 also gives accounts of a similar meeting at \\"St James Clerken Well\\" and a \\"Great Meeting at Manchester\\" and a fresh round of petitions (11,839 petitions and 1,920,574 signatures). Graham then withdrew the education clauses but this did not end the objections, since it did not entirely restore the status quo ante on education; gives Graham's explanation of this indeed the education requirements of the 1833 Act now came under attack, the Leeds Mercury declaring education was something individuals could do for themselves \\"under the guidance of natural instinct and self-interest, infinitely better than Government could do for them\\". Hence \\"All Government interference to COMPEL Education is wrong\\" and had unacceptable implications: \\"If Government has a right to compel Education, it has right to compel RELIGION !\\" Although as late as 17 July Graham said he intended to get the bill though in the current session, three days later the bill was one of those Peel announced would be dropped for that session. ==Factories Act 1844 ('Graham's Factory Act')== In 1844 Graham again introduced a Bill to bring in a new Factory Act and repeal the 1833 Factory Act. The Bill gave educational issues a wide berth, but otherwise largely repeated the 'labour clauses' of Graham's 1843 Bill, with the important difference that the existing protection of young persons (a twelve-hour day and a ban on night working) was now extended to women of all ages.brief abstract is given in e.g. In Committee, Lord Ashley moved an amendment to the bill's clause 2, which defined the terms used in subsequent (substantive) clauses; his amendment changed the definition of 'night' to 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. – after allowing 90 minutes for mealbreaks only ten-and-a-half hours could be worked; this passed by nine votes. On clause 8, limiting the hours of work for women and young persions, the motion setting a twelve-hour day was defeated (by three votes: 183–186) but Lord Ashley's motion setting the limit at ten hours was also defeated (by seven votes:181–188). Voting on this Bill was not on party lines, the issue revealing both parties to be split into various factions. On clause 8, both 'ten' and 'twelve' hours were rejected (with exactly the same members voting) because five members voted against both 'ten' and 'twelve'.names and constituencies given in Faced with this impasse, and having considered and rejected the option of compromising on some intermediate time such as eleven hours, Graham withdrew the Bill, preferring to replace it by a new one which amended, rather than repealed, the 1833 Act. A Radical MP warned the government during the debate on clause 8 that Ashley's first victory could never be undone by any subsequent vote: morally the Ten-Hour question had been settled; Government might delay, but could not now prevent, a Ten-hour Act. However, the new bill left the 1833 definition of 'night' unaltered (and so gave no opportunity for redefinition) and Lord Ashley's amendment to limit the working day for women and young persons to ten hours was defeated heavily (295 against, 198 for),see account given by Sir James Graham in 1846 it having been made clear that the Ministers would resign if they lost the vote.Letter Sir Robert Peel to Frederick Peel dated Friday June 1844 printed in As a result, the Factory Act of 1844 (citation 7 & 8 Vict c. 15) again set a twelve-hour day, its main provisions being: *Children 9–13 years could work for 9 hours a day with a lunch break. *Ages must be verified by surgeons. *Women and young people now worked the same number of hours. They could work for no more than 12 hours a day during the week, including one and a half hours for meals, and 9 hours on Sundays. They must all take their meals at the same time and could not do so in the workroom *Time-keeping to be by a public clock approved by an inspector *Some classes of machinery: every fly-wheel directly connected with the steam engine or water-wheel or other mechanical power, whether in the engine-house or not, and every part of a steam engine and water-wheel, and every hoist or teagle, near to which children or young persons are liable to pass or be employed, and all parts of the mill-gearing (this included power shafts) in a factory were to be \\"securely fenced.\\" *Children and women were not to clean moving machinery. *Accidental death must be reported to a surgeon and investigated; the result of the investigation to be reported to a Factory Inspector. *Factory owners must wash factories with lime every fourteen months. *Thorough records must be kept regarding the provisions of the Act and shown to the inspector on demand. *An abstract of the amended Act must be hung up in the factory so as to be easily read, and show (amongst other things) names and addresses of the inspector and sub- inspector of the district, the certifying surgeon, the times for beginning and ending work, the amount of time and time of day for meals. *Factory Inspectors no longer had the powers of JPs but (as before 1833) millowners, their fathers, brothers and sons were all debarred (if magistrates) from hearing Factory Act cases. ==Factories Act 1847== After the collapse of the Peel administration which had resisted any reduction in the working day to less than 12 hours, a Whig administration under Lord John Russell came to power. The new Cabinet contained supporters and opponents of a ten-hour day and Lord John himself favoured an eleven-hour day. The Government therefore had no collective view on the matter; in the absence of Government opposition, the Ten Hour Bill was passed, becoming the Factories Act 1847 (citation 10 & 11 Vict c. 29). This law (also known as the Ten Hour Act) limited the work week in textile mills (and other textile industries except lace and silk production) for women and children under 18 years of age. Each work week contained 63 hours effective 1 July 1847 and was reduced to 58 hours effective 1 May 1848. In effect, this law limited the workhours only for women and children to 10 hours which earlier was 12 hours. This law was successfully passed due to the contributions of the Ten Hours Movement. This campaign was established during the 1830s and was responsible for voicing demands towards limiting the work week in textile mills. The core of the movement was the 'Short Time Committees' set up (by millworkers and sympathisers) in the textile districts, but the main speakers for the cause were Richard Oastler (who led the campaign outside Parliament) and Lord Ashley, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury (who led the campaign inside Parliament). John Fielden, although no orator, was indefatigable in his support of the cause, giving generously of his time and money and – as the senior partner in one of the great cotton firms – vouching for the reality of the evils of a long working day and the practicality of shortening it. ==Factories Act 1850 (the 'Compromise Act')== A Victorian power loom (Lancashire loom) The Acts of 1844 and 1847 had reduced the hours per day which any woman or young person could work but not the hours of the day within which they could do that work (from 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.). Under the 1833 Act millowners (or some of them) had used a 'relay system' so that the mill could operate all the permitted hours without any protected person exceeding their permitted workday. The 1833 Act had hoped that two sets of children would be employed and each work a full half-day (the 'true relay' system, which left the other halfday free for education). Instead, some mills operated a 'false relay' system in which the protected persons worked split shifts. The false relay system was considered objectionable both because of the effect on the protected persons and because an inspector (or other millowners) could relatively easily monitor the hours a mill ran; it was much more difficult if not impossible to check the hours worked by an individual (as an inspector observed \\"the lights in the window will discover the one but not the other\\") Section 26 of the 1844 Act required that the hours of work of all protected persons \\" shall be reckoned from the time when any child or young person shall first begin to work in the morning in such factory.\\" but nothing in it or in the 1847 Act clearly prohibited split shifts (although this had been Parliament's intention). The factory inspector for Scotland considered split shifts to be legal; the inspector for Bradford thought them illegal and his local magistrates agreed with him: in Manchester the inspector thought them illegal but the magistrates did not. In 1850 the Court of Exchequer held that the section was to be too weakly worded to make relay systems illegal. Lord Ashley sought to remedy this by a short declaratory Act restoring the status quo but felt it impossible to draft one which did not introduce fresh matter (which would remove the argument that there was no call for further debate). The Home Secretary Sir George Grey was originally noticeably ambivalent about Government support for Ashley's Bill: when Ashley reported his difficulties to the House of Commons, Grey announced an intention to move amendments in favour of a scheme (ostensibly suggested by a third party) giving text of a letter to the Times – John Walter, both the editor of the Times and a Government MP, was said by contemporaries to have discussed such a scheme before the date the letter was supposedly written which established a 'normal day' for women and young persons by setting the times within which they could work so tightly that they were also the start and stop times if they were to work the maximum permitted hours per day. Grey's scheme increased the hours that could be worked per week, but Ashley (uncertain of the outcome of any attempt to re-enact a true Ten Hours Bill) decided to support itletter Lord Ashley , dated 7 May , to \\"The Short Time Committees of Lancashire and Yorkshire\\" and Grey's scheme was the basis for the 1850 Act (citation 13 & 14 Vict c. 54). The Short Time Committees had previously been adamant for an effective Ten-hour Bill; Ashley wrote to them, noting that he acted in Parliament as their friend, not their delegate, explaining his reasons for accepting Grey's \\"compromise\\", and advising them to do so also. They duly did, significantly influenced by the thought that they could not afford to lose their friend in Parliament. The key provisions of the 1850 Act were : *Women and young persons could only work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. or – in winter, and subject to approval by a factory inspector- 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.: since they were to be allowed 90 minutes total breaks during the day, the maximum hours worked per day increased to 10.5 *All work would end on Saturday at 2 p.m. *The work week was extended from 58 hours to 60 hours. Various public meetings in the textile districts subsequently passed motions regretting that the 58-hour week had not been more stoutly defended, with various stalwarts of the Ten-Hour Movement ( various Cobbetts and Fieldens (John Fielden now being dead) and Richard Oastler) offering their support and concurring with criticism of Ashley's actions, but nothing came of this: the meetings were poorly attended (that at Manchester was attended by about 900) and the Ten-Hour Movement had now effectively run its course. Children (8–13) were not covered by this Act: it had been the deliberate intention of the 1833 Act that a mill might use two sets of children on a relay system and the obvious method of doing so did not require split shifts. A further Act of 1853 set similar limits on the hours within which children might work. ==Factories Act 1856== Power shafting, belts and power looms in operation In April 1855 a National Association of Factory Occupiers was formed \\"to watch over factory legislation with a view to prevent any increase of the present unfair and injudicious enactments\\". The 1844 Act had required that \\"mill gearing\\" – which included power shafts – should be securely fenced. Magistrates had taken inconsistent views as to whether this applied where the \\"mill gearing\\" was not readily accessible; in particular where power shafting ran horizontally well above head height. In 1856, the Court of Queen's Bench ruled that it did. In April 1856, the National Association of Factory Occupiers succeeded in obtaining an Act reversing this decision: mill gearing needed secure fencing only of those parts with which women, young persons, and children were liable to come in contact. (The inspectors feared that the potential hazards in areas they did not normally access might be obvious to experienced men, but not be easily appreciated by women and children who were due the legislative protection the 1856 Act had removed, especially given the potential severe consequences of their inexperience. An MP speaking against the Bill was able to give multiple instances of accidents to protected persons resulting in death or loss of limbs – all caused by unguarded shafting with which they were supposedly not liable to come into contact – despite restricting himself to accidents in mills owned by Members of Parliament (so that he could be corrected by them if had misstated any facts). (Dickens thereafter referred to the NAFO as the National Association for the Protection of the Right to Mangle Operatives. Harriet Martineau criticised Dickens for this, arguing that mangling was the result of workers not being careful and: \\"If men and women are to be absolved from the care of their own lives and limbs, and the responsibility put upon anybody else by the law of the land, the law of the land is lapsing into barbarism\\")) For other parts of the mill gearing any dispute between the occupier and the inspector could be resolved by arbitration. The arbitration was to be by a person skilled in making the machinery to be guarded; the inspectors however declined to submit safety concerns to arbitration by those \\"who look only to the construction and working of the machinery, which is their business,and not to the prevention of accidents, which is not their business\\" == Factories Act Extension Act 1867 == In virtually every debate on the various Factories Bills, opponents had thought it a nonsense to pass legislation for textile mills when the life of a mill child was much preferable to that of many other children: other industries were more tiring, more dangerous, more unhealthy, required longer working hours, involved more unpleasant working conditions, or (this being Victorian Britain) were more conducive to lax morals. This logic began to be applied in reverse once it became clear that the Ten Hours Act had had no obvious detrimental effect on the prosperity of the textile industry or on that of millworkers. Acts were passed making similar provisions for other textile trades: bleaching and dyeworks (1860 – outdoor bleaching was excluded), lace work (1861), calendering (1863), finishing (1864). A further Act in 1870 repealed these acts and brought the ancillary textile processes (including outdoor bleaching) within the scope of the main Factory Act. In 1864 the Factories Extension Act was passed: this extended the Factories Act to cover a number of occupations (mostly non-textile): potteries (both heat and exposure to lead glazes were issues), lucifer match making ('phossie jaw') percussion cap and cartridge making, paper staining and fustian cutting. In 1867 the Factories Act was extended to all establishments employing 50 or more workers by another Factories Act Extension Act. An Hours of Labour Regulation Act applied to 'workshops' (establishments employing less than 50 workers); it subjected these to requirements similar to those for 'factories' (but less onerous on a number of points e.g.: the hours within which the permitted hours might be worked were less restrictive, there was no requirement for certification of age) but was to be administered by local authorities, rather than the Factory Inspectorate. There was no requirement on local authorities for enforcement (or penalties for non-enforcement) of legislation for workshops. The effectiveness of the regulation of workshops therefore varied from area to area;paragraph (not separately titled) in editorial material under general heading where it was effective, a blanket ban on Sunday working in workshops was a problem for observant Jews. The Factory and Workshop Act 1870 removed the previous special treatments for factories in the printing, dyeing and bleaching industries;Factory acts while a short Act of 1871 transferred responsibility for regulation of workshops to the Factory Inspectorate, but without an adequate increase in the Inspectorates's resources.; gives details for Sheffield a separate Act allowed Sunday working by Jews. gives a concise account of the history of the measure == Factories (Health of Women, &c.;) Act (1874) == (37 & 38 Vict. c. 44) The newly- legalised trade unions had as one of their aims a reduction in working hours, both by direct concession by employers and by securing legislation. The 1873 Trades Union Congress (TUC) could congratulate itself on \\"a general concession of the 'nine-hour day' in all the leading engineering establishments of the kingdom\\" but regretted that a Private Member's Bill introduced by A. J. Mundella seeking to reduce the hours worked by women and children in textile industriessummarised in had not succeeded, although the Government had responded by setting up a commission on the workings of the Factory Acts. (The TUC had had to support the measure through a committee also containing non- unionists; Lord Shaftesbury (as Ashley had become) had declined to support any measure brought forward on a purely trade union basis.) Mundella again introduced a nine-hour bill in 1873; he withdrew this when the government did not allow enough time for debate; he reintroduced it in 1874, but withdrew it when the government brought forward its own bill, which became the Factories (Health of Women, &c.;) Act. This gave women and young persons in textile factories (silk mills now lost their previous special treatment) a working day of ten hours on weekdays (twelve hours broken into sessions of no more than four and a half hours by two meal breaks of at least an hour); on Saturday six hours could be spent on manufacturing processes, and another half-hour on other duties (such as cleaning the workplace and machinery).The provisions for children now applied to 13-year-olds, and (over a two-year period) the minimum age for children was to increase to ten. === Shaftesbury's valedictory review === Shaftesbury spoke in the Lords Second Reading debate; thinking it might well be his last speech in Parliament on factory reform, he reviewed the changes over the forty-one years it had taken to secure a ten-hour-day, as this bill at last did. In 1833, only two manufacturers had been active supporters of his bill; all but a handful of manufacturers supported the 1874 bill. Economic arguments against reducing working hours had been disproved by decades of experience. Despite the restrictions on hours of work, employment in textile mills had increased (1835; 354,684, of whom 56,455 under 13: in 1871, 880,920 of whom 80,498 under 13), but accidents were half what they had been and 'factory cripples' were no longer seen. In 1835, he asserted, seven- tenths of factory children were illiterate; in 1874 seven-tenths had \\"a tolerable, if not a sufficient, education\\". Furthermore, police returns showed \\"a decrease of 23 percent in the immorality of factory women\\". The various protective acts now covered over two and a half million people. During the short-time agitation he had been promised \\"Give us our rights, and you will never again see violence, insurrection, and disloyalty in these counties.\\" And so it had proved: the Cotton Famine had thrown thousands out of work, with misery, starvation, and death staring them in the face; but, \\"with one or two trifling exceptions, and those only momentary\\", order and peace had reigned. > By legislation you have removed manifold and oppressive obstacles that stood > in the way of the working man's comfort, progress, and honour. By > legislation you have ordained justice, and exhibited sympathy with the best > interests of the labourers, the surest and happiest mode of all government. > By legislation you have given to the working classes the full power to > exercise, for themselves and for the public welfare, all the physical and > moral energies that God has bestowed on them; and by legislation you have > given them means to assert and maintain their rights; and it will be their > own fault, not yours, my Lords, if they do not, with these abundant and > mighty blessings, become a wise and an understanding people. ==Factory and Workshop Act 1878 (the 'Consolidation Act')== In the debates on Mundella's bills and the 1874 Act, it had been noted that years of piece-meal legislation had left factory law in an unsatisfactory and confusing state; the government had spoken of the need to consolidate and extend factory law by a single Act replacing all previous legislation, but had not felt itself able to allocate the necessary legislative time. In March 1875, a Royal Commission (headed by Sir James Fergusson) was set up to look at the consolidation and extension of factory law. It took evidence in the principal industrial towns, and published its report in March 1876. It recommended consolidation of legislation by a single new Act. The new Act should include workplaces in the open air, and carrying, washing and cleaning; however mines and agriculture should be excluded. Work by protected persons should be within a twelve-hour window (between 6 am and 7 pm: exceptionally for some industries the window could be 8 am to 8 pm). Within that window: in factories two hours should be allowed for meals and no work session should exceed four and a half hours; in workshops work sessions should not exceed five hours and meal breaks should total at least one and a half hours. Sunday working should be permitted where both worker and employer were Jewish. All children should attend school from five until fourteen; they should not be allowed to attend half-time, nor be employed under the new Act, until ten. From ten to fourteen employment would be conditional upon satisfactory school attendance and educational achievement. The government announced that the report had been produced too late for legislation in the current parliamentary session, but legislation would be introduced in the following one. A bill was given a First Reading in April 1877, but made no further progress; at the end of July it was postponed to the following year. In 1878, the Bill was given a higher priority: it had its first reading as soon as Parliament convened in January; the Second Reading debate was held on 11 February and it entered Committee stage on 21 February; the Third Reading in the Commons was given at the end of March. ===Provisions of the Act=== The Factory and Workshop Act 1878 (41 & 42 Vict. c. 16) replaced all the previous Acts (it listed sixteen acts repealed in their entirety) by a single Act of some hundred and seven clauses. The Chief Inspector of Factories described it as much less restrictive than the legislation it replaced:Mr (Alexander) Redgrave, reported in \\"The hard and fast line [drawn by the previous Acts] is now an undulating and elastic one, drawn to satisfy the absolute necessities and customs of different trades in different parts of the kingdom.\\"\\"Annual Report for 1878 of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops\\", quoted in The protected persons fell into three categories: * 'Children' (aged 10–14, but a child of 13 who had met required levels of academic attainment and had a good school attendance record could be employed as a 'young person') * 'Young persons' (aged 14–18, of either sex: as noted above 13-year-olds satisfying educational requirements could be employed as young persons) * 'Women' (females aged over 18; it had been urged that women did not require protection, and their inclusion in factory legislation deterred their employment. The countering arguments (that married women required protection from husbands, and unless unmarried women were subject to the same protection, Parliament would be legislating to promote immorality; and that the restrictions were in the interests of public health, since they ensured some maternal attention for the children of working women) had generally prevailed.) The premises being regulated were now separated into five categories: Factories fell into two types; * 'textile factories' – those within the scope of the 1874 Act * 'non-textile factories' – workplaces carrying out a number of specified processes ((textile) print works, bleaching and dyeing works, earthenware works (excluding brickworks), lucifer match works, percussion cap works, cartridge works, paper staining works, fustian cutting works, blast furnaces, copper mills, iron mills, foundries, metal and india-rubber works, paper mills, glass works, tobacco factories, letterpress printing works, bookbinding works) and additionally any workplace in which mechanical power was used (replacing the former distinction between factory and workshop on the basis on the number of employees) Workshops were places in which the manufacture, repair or finishing of articles were carried out as a trade without the use of mechanical power and to which the employer controlled access (it was irrelevant whether these operations were carried out in the open air, and shipyards, quarries and pit banks were specifically scheduled as workshops, unless factories because mechanical power was used). Laundries (originally in the Bill) were excluded from the final Act; in Ireland much laundry work was carried out in convents and Irish members objected to inspection of convents by an (allegedly) exclusively Protestant inspectorate. Three types of workshop were distinguished: * Workshops * Workshops not employing protected persons other than women * Domestic workshops (workshops carried out in a private house, room etc by members of the family living there) The Act excluded domestic workshops carrying out straw-plait making, pillow lace making or glove-making and empowered the Home Secretary to extend this exemption. The Act also excluded domestic workshops involving non-strenuous work carried out intermittently and not providing the principal source of income of the family. Requirements and enforcement arrangements were most stringent for textile factories, least stringent for domestic workshops (and the inspectorate had no powers to secure entry into dwellings). The Act gave the Home Secretary some latitude to vary the requirements for specific industries (but not individual workplaces) to accommodate existing practices where these were not detrimental to the underlying purpose of the Act. The Act followed the recommendations of the Commission by setting a limit of hours on the hours worked per week by women and young persons in textile factories, 60 hours in non-textile factories and workshops (except domestic workshops, where there was no restriction on the working hours of women), but allowing greater flexibility on how those hours were worked for non-textile factories and workshops. The ban on Sunday working (and on late working on Saturday) was modified to apply instead to the Jewish Sabbath where both employer and employees were Jewish. Except in domestic workshops, protected persons were to have two full holidays and eight half-holidays The full holidays would normally be Christmas Day and Good Friday, but other holidays could be substituted for Good Friday (in Scotland and for all-Jewish workplaces, substitution for Christmas Day was allowed; Ireland kept Saint Patrick's Day as a holiday). Half holidays could be combined to give additional full-day holidays; it had to be clarified later that the Act's definition of a half-holiday as \\"at least half\\" of a full day's employment \\"on some day other than Saturday\\" was to give the minimum duration of a half-holiday, not to prohibit one being taken on a Saturday. Children were not to be employed under the age of ten, and should attend school half- time until fourteen (or until thirteen if they had a good record of school attendance and satisfactory scholastic achievement). (In Scotland, for factory children only, this overrode attempts by local school boards to set standards of scholastic attainment to be met before a child could cease full-time schooling; the Scottish education acts ceded precedence to the factory acts. In England and Wales it was unclear whether factory acts or education acts had precedence until the Elementary Education Act of 1880 settled the matter in favour of school board bye-laws, but without any standardisation of criteria between different boards. Specification of a minimum educational attainment before a factory child could work half-time then became enforceable in England, but remained unenforceable in Scotland until passage of the Education (Scotland) Act 1883.) 'Half-time' could be achieved by splitting each day between school and work, or (unless the child worked in a domestic workshop) by working and attending school on alternate days. If the former, the child should work morning and afternoons on alternate weeks; if the latter the schooldays in one week should be workdays the next (and vice versa). No child should work a half-day on successive Saturdays. Surgeons no longer certified the apparent age of a child (or young person), age now being substantiated by a birth certificate or school register entry, but (for employment in factories) they were required to certify the fitness for the work of children and young persons under the age of sixteen. Protected persons should not be allowed to clean moving machinery, the requirement to guard machinery now extended to the protection of men as well as protected persons, and the Home Secretary might direct that some or all of the fine imposed for a breach of this requirement be paid to any person injured (or the relatives of any person killed) as a result. (Guarding was now only unnecessary if the position of machinery meant it was equally safe if unguarded, but hoists still only needed to be guarded if a person might pass close to them.) There were restrictions on the employment of some classes of protected persons on processes injurious to health. Young persons and children could not work in the manufacture of white lead, or silvering mirrors using mercury; children and female young persons could not be employed in glass works; girls under sixteen could not be employed in the manufacture of bricks, (non-ornamental) tiles, or salt; children could not be employed in the dry grinding of metals or the dipping of lucifer matches. Inspectors were given powers to require the mitigation of dusty atmospheres by mechanical ventilation or other mechanical means. ===Subsequent minor Acts=== The Factory and Workshop Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c.53) gave additional powers for the regulation of white-lead manufacture and bakehouses (but sanitary requirements for retail bakehouses were to be enforced by local authorities); in the same session a private member's bill intended to prohibit the employment of female children in the manufacture of nails was defeated at Second Reading. The Factory and Workshops Act 1878 Amendment (Scotland) Act 1888 affected the choice of full-day holidays in Scottish burghs; formerly they had been the sacramental fast days specified by the local church – they could now be specified by the burgh magistrates. The Cotton Cloth Factories Act of 1889 set limits on temperature (and humidity at a given temperature) where cotton cloth was being woven. ===Inadequate resources for strict enforcement=== The TUC had few complaints about the Act, but complained that the inspectorate enforcing it was too small and lacking in 'practical men'. The latter complaint was partially addressed by changing the recruitment process and appointing a number of former trade union officials to the inspectorate.Second leader (paragraph beginning \\"The chorus of praise...\\") in editorials under general heading The total number of inspectors increased from 38 in 1868 to 56 in 1885, but (the general secretary of the TUC complained) these had to cover the more than 110,000 workplaces registered (in 1881) and attempt to detect unregistered workplaces falling within the scope of the Act: 16 out of 39 districts in England had no registered workshops and only half the registered workshops had been inspected in 1881. When, after several unsuccessful attempts to extend some of the protections of the Act to shopworkers, Sir John Lubbock succeeded in securing passage of a Shop Hours Regulation Act at the end of the 1886 session, the Act made no provision for (and the Home Secretary Hugh Childers refused to accept any amendment allowing) enforcement by inspection. The Evening Standard thought that this meant the Act would be a dead letter, given experiences with the Factory Acts: > The Factory Acts are enforced by an elaborate machinery of inspection. > Anyone who has taken the trouble to inquire into the matter knows perfectly > well that without this stringent inspection they would be absolutely > worthless. Even as it is they are contravened openly every day, because the > best inspection must, from the nature of the case, be somewhat spasmodic and > uncertain. When an Inspector discovers that the law has been broken he > summons the offending party; but, as a rule, if he does not make the > discovery himself, no one informs him of it. The chief provisions of the > last Factory Act are hung up, legibly printed on white cardboard, \\"plain for > all men to see\\", in every room of every factory. No one can be ignorant of > them; yet when they are disregarded, as they are constantly, it is the > rarest thing for any of the women affected by the illegality to give > information.untitled paragraph (column 1, p. 5) in editorials under general > heading == Factory Act 1891 == Under the heading Conditions of Employment were two considerable additions to previous legislation: the first is the prohibition on employers to employ women within four weeks after confinement (childbirth); the second the raising the minimum age at which a child can be set to work from ten to eleven == Factory and Workshop Act 1895 == The main article gives an overview of the state of Factory Act legislation in Edwardian Britain under the Factory and Workshop Acts 1878 to 1895 (the collective title of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878, the Factory and Workshop Act 1883, the Cotton Cloth Factories Act 1889, the Factory and Workshop Act 1891 and the Factory and Workshop Act 1895.)The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and the second schedule == Factory and Workshop Act 1901 == Minimum working age is raised to 12. The act also introduced legislation regarding the education of children, meal times, and fire escapes. Children could also take up a full-time job at the age of 13 years old. ==Review in 1910== By 1910, Sidney Webb reviewing the cumulative effect of century of factory legislation felt able to write: He also commented on the gradual (accidentally almost Fabian) way this transformation had been achieved == Factories Act 1937 == The 1937 Act (1 Edw. 8 & 1 Geo. 6 c.67) consolidated and amended the Factory and Workshop Acts from 1901 to 1929. It was introduced to the House of Commons by the Home Secretary, Sir John Simon, on 29 January 1937 and given Royal Assent on 30 July. == Factories Act 1959 == This Act was to amend the previous Acts of 1937 and 1948, as well as adding more health, safety and welfare provisions for factory workers. It also revoked regulation 59 of the 1939 Defence (General) Regulations. The Act is dated 29 July 1959. ==Factories Act 1961== This Act consolidated the 1937 and 1959 Acts. , the 1961 Act is substantially still in force, though workplace health and safety is principally governed by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and regulations made under it. == See also == *History of labour law in the United Kingdom *UK labour law *Mines Act of 1842 *Labour law *Factory inspector ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * Encyclopedia of British History * (Available online here). * Finer, Samuel Edward.

He was a physics professor and vice-chancellor of Empire State University who turned to crime and became a criminal mastermind as a way to prevent budget cuts for higher education that would have negatively affected the university. As the Lightmaster, Lansky employed Kraven the Hunter and the Tarantula to help him kidnap several government officials of the city of New York who had initiated the budget cuts. The three were defeated by Spider-Man, who foiled the plot. Spider-Man ran a current of electricity through the Lightmaster's body suit.Spectacular Spider-Man #3 However, Spider-Man had inadvertently caused Lightmaster to become a being of unstable energy, dependent on constant exposure to light just to survive. Seeking revenge on Spider-Man, Lightmaster accidentally causes a blackout in New York City, causing his own unstable body to dissipate into what he called a \\"light dimension.\\"Spectacular Spider-Man #20 Lightmaster attempted to harness the powers of the mutant Dazzler's powerful light source as a means to regain his physical form on Earth.

Carbon dioxide is a gaseous product of the body's metabolism and is normally expelled through the lungs. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), decreasing the tidal volume on the ventilator (usually 6-8 mL/kg) to 4-6 mL/kg may decrease barotrauma by decreasing ventilatory peak airway pressures and leads to improved respiratory recovery. Hypercapnia (increased pCO2) sometimes needs to be tolerated in order to achieve these lower tidal volumes. The permissive hypercapnia leads to respiratory acidosis which might have negative side effects, but given that the patient is in ARDS, improving ventilatory function is more important. Since hypoxemia is a major life-threatening condition and hypercapnia is not, one might choose to accept the latter. Hence the term, \\"permissive hypercapnia.\\" Altogether, the negative side effects of permissive hypercapnia may outweigh the benefits. For that reason, the implementation of extracorporeal CO2 removal (iLA Membrane Ventilator, Novalung) at an early stage of ARDS, has become a well established standard to allow for protective ventilation and avoid respiratory acidosis. == Symptoms== Symptoms of early hypercapnia (i.e. where PaCO2 is elevated but not extremely so) include flushed skin, full pulse, extrasystoles, muscle twitches, hand flaps, and possibly a raised blood pressure. In severe hypercapnia (generally PaCO2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg), symptomatology progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death. ;Other description about permissive hypercapnia in ARDS patient Mechanical ventilation using high tidal volume (VT) and transpulmonary pressure can damage the lung, causing ventilator-induced lung injury. Permissive hypercapnia, a ventilatory strategy for acute respiratory failure in which the lungs are ventilated with a low inspiratory volume and pressure, has been accepted progressively in critical care for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients requiring mechanical ventilation and is one of the central components of current protective ventilatory strategies. ==See also== *Acute respiratory distress syndrome *Mechanical ventilation ==References== * * * Category:Intensive care medicine Category:Emergency medicine Category:Pulmonology ","title":"Permissive hypercapnia"},{"id":"2569646","text":"Happy New Year, Charlie Brown! is the 30th prime-time animated television special based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M.

In 2002, Father Lý, together with Thích Quảng Độ, received Vietnam Human Rights Award from Vietnam Human Rights Network. As a result of international pressure, including activities of the Vatican's Center of Pastoral Apostolate for Overseas Vietnamese under the leadership of Monsignor Philippe Trần Văn Hoài, Father Lý was released from prison in early 2004 but remains under house arrest in the Archdiocese of Huế. On 8 April 2006, he collaborated with other writers on the \\"Manifesto on Freedom and Democracy for Vietnam\\". Later, the signers of this Manifesto called themselves \\"Bloc 8406\\", referencing the date of the document.Vietnam: End Attacks on Year-Old Democracy Movement (Human Rights Watch, 4 June 2007) On 15 April 2006, Father Lý and three other Catholic priests published the first issue of \\"Free Speech\\" (in Vietnamese: Tự Do Ngôn Luận), an underground online publication.Reporters sans frontières (Vietnam)International PEN: Article Archive On 8 September 2006, Father Lý participated in the establishment of the Vietnam Progression Party (in Vietnamese Đảng Thăng Tiến Việt Nam). ==2007 Arrest and Sentence== On 19 February 2007, security police surrounded and raided Huế Archdiocese to ransack the office, confiscate computers, and arrest him. They moved him to the remote location of Ben Cui in central Vietnam, where he was under house arrest; Father Lý engaged in a hunger strike from 24 February to 5 March 2007. As a member of the Bloc 8406 pro-democracy movement, Lý was sentenced again on 30 March 2007 by Vietnamese provincial court judge Bùi Quốc Hiệp to eight years in prison for committing \\"very serious crimes that harmed national security\\" by trying to organize a boycott of the upcoming election.\\"U.S. calls Vietnamese sentence of Catholic priest...

Between 2003 and 2005, she joined TVB and was featured in four of their dramas before parting ways. In between 2005 and 2008, Bobo reduced her involvement with acting and focused on other projects until the infamous leak of Edison Chen's scandal photos affected her career. ===Photo scandal=== In January and February 2008, explicit photos were found online involving Chan and Edison Chen.

It was established June 13, 1862, by the men of Company G, 2nd Regiment, Infantry, California Volunteers to keep peace between the Tolowa tribe of Native Americans and the miners and settlers of northwestern California. When the California Gold Rush began, people from all over the country ran to Gold Country to try to make their fortunes. Likewise in northwestern California, many men headed that way, leaving their wives, children, and homes. The Tolowa were being forcibly resettled in the region and were beginning to take their vengeance on those who stayed behind. Settlers petitioned the Army for protection, but their pleas were not well received by the Department of the Pacific, whose troops were already stretched thin from protecting stagecoach travelers. However, the petitioners eventually got their wish, and Fort Ter- Waw was established. After that was destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862, the troops were moved to Camp Lincoln. In September 1862, the camp was moved six miles (10 km) north of the city to a more neutral position further away from the settlers. During construction of the new location, tensions between the whites and the Tolowa rose even further. Many of the whites wanted the government to evict the Tolowa, but the government did no such action and they began to take matters into their own hands. Settlers burned crops and harassed the Tolowa, who were told to get out or be killed. Approximately 500 Tolowa decided to leave, and the remaining 1,500 stayed only because the Army promised to keep the peace. Although no truce was reached, after the Civil War, the Army could not afford to staff many small posts, and the camp was abandoned in June 1869 and closed for good in May 1870. Commanding officer's quarters and one barracks remained when the site was declared California Historical Landmark #545 in 1962. Historic California Posts: Camp Lincoln (Long's Camp, Fort Long, Lincoln's Fort, Fort Lincoln) ==Camp Lincoln wasn't the originally intended location== Historical evidence suggests that the original intention of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was to have the Settlers defended from a location other than Camp Lincoln. It appears that GEO. M. HANSON, Superintendent Indian Affairs had another spot in mind. He wrote a letter on July 2, 1862 to Brig. Gen. George Wright requesting that troops be sent to defend the settlers at Crescent City. However, in his letter he mentions a parcel of land loosely known as Fort Dick (later referred to as Russell's Prairie) to be an adequate site to defend the settlers. This letter caused First Lieutenant and Regimental Quartermaster W.F. Swasey to be sent a very long distance to evaluate the site of Fort Dick. In his letter, he too recommends it as a good spot. It's not until a third letter arrives from Major James F. Curtis, that he indicates that Camp Lincoln is far superior of a choice and that his inspection of the \\"Russell place\\" (Fort Dick) found that it was subject to flooding. That sealed the deal and Camp Lincoln won out over Fort Dick. All three letters were published by the United States Department of War in 1897, but digitized by the University of Virginia in 2008. The letters appear in Volume L of the multi volume series \\"The War of the Rebellion\\". > Office Indian Affairs, Northern Dist. California, San Francisco, July 2, > 1862. Brig. Gen.

SWASEY, First Lieutenant and Regimental Quartermaster (Second Infantry California Volunteers) sent a very lengthy letter to Col. F. J. Lippitt at the Headquarters of the District Of Humboldt recommending that the site be that of Fort Dick, CA. Although, not an official US Military Outpost, it was being used by local settlers to defend themselves from the attacks they faced by the Tolowa and Yurok tribes. In his letter, Lieutenant W.F. Swasey goes into great detail about the site and its alternate names, including that of \\"Russell's Prairie\\". This name is briefly mentioned in yet a third letter that actually confirms the selection of Camp Lincoln as the site for the permanent military presence to defend the settlers. On September 15, 1862, a letter was sent to Lieut. Col. R. C. Drum. The letter was sent by JAMES F. CURTIS, Major Second Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Camp Lincoln, Humboldt Military District. In his letter he describes many things. One thing that is very easy to look over is a mere sentence near the end of the letter where he describes why he selected Camp Lincoln over Fort Dick (Russell's Prairie). > Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs.

He directed the first Jamaican feature film, The Harder They Come (1972), co- written by Trevor D. Rhone and starring Jimmy Cliff. ==Life and career== Henzell, whose ancestors included Huguenot glassblowers and an old English family who had made their fortune growing sugar on Antigua, grew up on the Caymanas sugar cane estate near Kingston. He was sent to Shrewsbury School in the United Kingdom at 14 and later attended McGill University in Montreal in 1953 and 1954. He then dropped out of this school, choosing instead to hitchhike around Europe. He eventually got work as a stagehand at the BBC. He returned in the 1950s to Jamaica, where he directed advertisements for some years until he began work on The Harder They Come with co-writer Trevor D. Rhone. In 1965 he married Sally Densham. Henzell also shot some footage for what was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder's aftermath in 1974, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, and the lack of finance for further production, he went on to become a writer, publishing his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. A rough cut of No Place Like Home, which features music from Bob Marley, Toots and the Maytals, The Three Degrees, and Marcia Griffiths, was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out.

Prickwillow Museum is housed in the old pumping station and contains a major collection of working pumping engines. The village is also home to the Ely Group of Internal Drainage Boards. ==History== Evidence for very early settlements near Prickwillow was unearthed in the 1930s, when an archaeological dig took place at Plantation Farm and Peacocks Farm, by the A1101. This provided evidence for Roman and three levels of prehistoric settlements just to the east of the village. The modern parish of Prickwillow was formed in 1878. The name is said to be a reference to the 'prickets' of willow—long thin skewers used to make thatch—that grew in the surrounding marshy land. Prior to the nineteenth century, the River Great Ouse flowed east of Ely as far as Prickwillow, before rejoining the modern course of the Ouse at Littleport. In 1829–30, however, the river was diverted north from Ely,Fowler, Gordon. (1934). The Extinct Waterways of the Fens: A paper read at the Afternoon Meeting of the Society on 13 November 1983.

Other tramways ran from the east bank of the River Lark extending to Shippea Hill station. ==Drainage== Much of the Prickwillow area lies below sea level so, in order to ensure that the land remained arable, a series of steam pumping engines were installed at the base of the newly dug drain, linked to the River Lark. The first of these was the steam side-lever engine, installed in 1831. This was replaced in the 1880s by the steam beam engine, itself replaced in 1924 by the powerful Mirrlees, Bickerton and Day Diesel. With a weight of 25 tonnes and a nominal power output of 250bhp at 250rpm, this engine ran until the 1970s, when it was replaced with automatic electric pumps. The Mirrlees diesel engine remains the centrepiece of the Prickwillow Museum,Prickwillow Museum and is believed to be the only example of an air- blast injection engine remaining in working order. The museum also contains other diesel engines, dating from 1919, recovered from other local pumping stations, and restored by volunteers. The Diesel pumping engines are demonstrated to interested visitors on several days throughout the year. Prickwillow is the current office and workshop base for the Ely Group of Internal Drainage Boards who maintain the current electric pumping station in Prickwillow and surrounding watercourses. The group consists of ten internal drainage boards (IDBs) whose boundaries extend to the New Bedford River and Welney to the west and Mildenhall and Lakenheath to the east. The IDBs provide water level and flood risk management within their districts. In the 1920s, it was reported that the constant draining of the land resulted in the peaty soil sinking by every year. The local school buildings and St. Peter's Church, built in 1862 and 1866 respectively, as well as many of the local houses, were built on piles to ensure stable foundations. Two steps were built up to the front door of the vicarage, but many more had to be added as the land gradually sank. In addition, owing to the high water table, church burials take place in the more elevated settlement of Ely. The B1104 between Prickwillow and neighbouring Isleham is reputedly the most subsidence affected road in the country; so undulating is the drive that some have experienced bouts of motion sickness equal to that of seasickness. ==Other== The combinations of banks and ditches could be a hazard for the unwary, as a newspaper article of 1872 demonstrates.

He was one of the founders of the city of Saltillo, Coahuila and was the mayor of Monterrey. ==Early life and family== Manuel Mederos's parents were Fernão Rodrigues Medeiros and Maria Manuela de Amona. He was born in 1539 on São Miguel Island, in the Azores. He moved to Spain in his youth. He arrived in New Spain (now Mexico) in 1562. He was part of the expedition of Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva during the conquest of northern Mexico and was one of the original founders of the city of Saltillo, Coahuila, on July 25, 1577. He married Magdalena Martínez. ==Later life== Captain de Mederos's hacienda (ranch) was located south of the Villa of Saltillo, next to the properties of Alberto del Canto and Juan Alonso, close to Buenavista. He was a companion of Don Gaspar Castaño de Sosa in his frustrated voyage to New Mexico. In 1583 Captain de Mederos was granted a territory in which he established the Hacienda of San Juan Bautista de la Pesquería Grande, which later become the municipality of Garcia in the Mexican state of Nuevo León. He also joined Carvajal in the founding of the city of Almadén (now Monclova) in April 1588. In 1593 he returned with his family to Saltillo. In 1599 he moved once again to the city of Monterrey where he occupied various positions: first as town councillor; then in 1601 as mayor; in 1602 as church steward; 1603, town councillor again; and in 1605 again as mayor. On July 25, 1606, Mederos associated with Diego de Huelva and José de Treviño to cultivate corn and wheat. The next year they bought from the priest, Cebrián de Acevedo Ovalle all of his mines in el Nuevo Reino de León. On April 22, 1613, he donated land in Santa Catarina to his goddaughter Andrea Rodríguez, wife of Blas Pérez. He still lived as of December 1613. After this, little is known about Captain Mederos. The Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL) has a campus named after him, and there is a Capitán Mederos Avenue in the city of Monterrey.

It is the third film in the series about police officer Johan Falk (Jakob Eklund), the first two being Zero Tolerance (Noll tolerans) and Executive Protection (Livvakterna). Falk has not worked in the year since the events of the second film, but on a trip with his family in central Europe he is contacted by his former boss again. \\"An entire continent is being stolen.\\" Plot: Phoenix Kane is a mobster. His live-in girlfriend, Rebecca, discovers his illegal money laundering and tries to leave him. He half-strangles her to keep her quiet, but is hit by a car as he leaves. While he is taken to the hospital, Rebecca escapes England. For his protection, Kane orders her captured and returned to England and his control, not knowing one of his cohorts has ordered a hit on her if she talks to the police. Falk has not worked for some time. He meets his former boss, who now is part of Europol leading an organized crime task-force, in a Dutch restaurant and refuses a job offer. When he leaves, Rebecca meets with the former boss, offering information in exchange for protection. Falk returns to the restaurant just as hitmen, disguised as police, kill Falk's ex-boss and try to take out Rebecca. Falk returns fire and sneaks her to safety. They escape the hitmen, but are overtaken by a security team from Kane with orders to return her to England. They don't believe Rebecca when she insists she'll be killed if she goes back, but when Kane tracks them down and his hitmen shoot some of the security men, they go rogue and help her. In Munich, Kane has set up a big money deal at a local bank. Falk, his pregnant girlfriend Helen, Rebecca and two uninjured security men head there to stop him. Falk wants to bug Kane's hotel room using cell phones, but because of street rioters, only Helen has credentials that persuade the police to let her in. She bugs the room but can't leave the hotel because rioting has worsened. The hitmen, who had earlier lost them, see her and deduce where their quarry is. They catch Helen when she sneaks from the hotel and use her to compel Falk to turn over Rebecca. Falk refuses, hoping to find a way to save Helen without getting Rebecca killed. Helen succeeds in escaping her captor, but freezes in the street when she sees a hit man shoot Falk, disabling him. Meanwhile Rebecca goes to the bank to confront Kane and learns he didn't arrange the hit on her. She shoots and kills the cohort who did. One hit man sees her and, dressed as a riot policeman, forces his way in, killing Kane in the effort to kill Rebecca. The hitman is himself killed. The second hitman shoots Falk in the head and prepares to kill a distraught Helen, using a dead policeman's gun after his own gun jams. Instead, Falk kills him, saving Helen, still alive since the cop's gun had held only rubber bullets. Falk attends the funeral for his former boss—wearing a policeman's uniform. == External links == * * Category:Swedish films Category:2003 films Category:2003 action films Category:Swedish action films ","title":"The Third Wave (2003 film)"},{"id":"2569807","text":"Palmas (,Pronounced in Brazilian Portuguese. The European Portuguese pronunciation is Palm trees; Akwẽ-Xerénte: Akwẽ krikahâzawre wam hã ) is the capital and largest city in the state of Tocantins, Brazil, newly organized under the 1988 constitution. According to IBGE estimates from 2017, the city had 286,787 inhabitants. Palmas is located at the state geographic centre at an average altitude of 230 m (755 ft). The city is located between these hills and the Tocantins River. In the east, Palmas is bordered by the Serra do Lajeado. Palmas has a metropolitan area with 471,639 inhabitants on the side of Palmas Lake. Palmas was founded in 1990 and developed from the ground up in a former agricultural area as the capital of the newest Brazilian state Tocantins. This was organized under the new 1988 Brazilian Constitution. It was intended to develop a relatively undeveloped area of the nation to provide better jobs for people. The city has a well-designed road system, and its urban zoning is modeled on that of Brasília, the capital. In Palmas a symmetrical park was developed at the city centre. The Federal University of Tocantins was established here in the late 20th century, at the time of other development. In 2002, the Lajeado Hydroelectric Power Plant reservoir was completed, at which point the city gained many river beaches on its lake shore. The project included construction of a huge bridge, the Ponte da Amizade Presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which crosses over over the reservoir, connecting Palmas with the major highway BR-153. The Palmas Airport connects Palmas with many Brazilian cities. ==History== The area where Palmas was built was originally used for agriculture. Before 1990, the only village in the location was Vila Canela (near the river Tocantins, and near the Graciosa beach). The village and the beach were often flooded as the new reservoir lake was developed. The flat area of Palmas is between the river and the Serra do Lajeado hills in the east, and the vegetation is the typical cerrado. In 1989 Miracema was the temporary capital of the state. The new capital was initially designed by the architects Luiz Fernando Cruvinel Teixeira and Walfredo de Oliveira Filho. From 20 May 1989, some of the roads and baracas were built. The government had decided to develop the capital on the east side of the river, in order to stimulate development on the east side of the state. This is also the geodesic center of Brazil. Before the dam was constructed and the reservoir developed, the Tocantins River made curves, forming what would look like the letter S when looking at it from a bird's eye view. It is said that developer Siquera Campos enjoyed the S-like formation, and that added to the choice of the location for Palmas. When the area was chosen in January 1989, Campos decided he wanted the Palacio (the state headquarter) to be built on the highest place in Palmas. Although the architects said the hill was too soft to build on, it was still built. The temporary Palacinho (said to be the first building in Palmas) is standing, but it has been replaced by another Palacio, constructed nearby. The Palacinho is kept as a monument of the early development, and since 2002, it has been used as a museum for Tocantins' history. ==Geography== Tocantins is a state between the Amazon Rainforest and the coastal savanna. As a result, its geography is varied. Many rivers cross through the state (including the Tocantins River). Researchers have identified more than 20 archaeologically significant sites of early indigenous cultures in the state. The municipality contains 88% of the Lajeado State Park. ===Climate=== Most of Tocantins, including where Palmas is located, (except the extreme west and northern regions) is situated within a vast Brazilian area known as the cerrado. The cerrado region's typical climate is hot, semi-humid, with pronounced seasonality marked by a dry winter season from May through September. The annual rainfall is around 800 to 1600 mm. The soils are generally very old, deep, and naturally nutrient-poor. Palmas is the hottest capital city in Brazil. During the May to September dry season, Palmas can be oppressively hot as temperatures climb into the high 30s (°C). During the October to April rainy season, it is not as hot. The heavy rains and cloud cover keep it much cooler. Palmas receives generous rainfall of about 1,300 mm. It is situated in a 'bow' valley of Rio Tocantins and surrounded by mountains from three sides; with its low elevation, 195 metres above sea level, these factors increase the humidity and discomfort of hot days. ===Vegetation=== In spite of being technically located in a watershed of the Amazon basin, Palmas has no rainforest. Typical are short shrubland trees common to a cerrado region. While the city layout was being developed, builders preserved many of the original trees, left intact in green areas along the widely spaced avenues. Many street trees in Palmas are much older than the city, which was started in 1990. Man-planted palms also grace the main thoroughfare, Avenida JK. ==Economy== Palmas was designed to be the economic and administrative center of Tocantins. The service sector is the main driver of the economy. The share of agriculture in the economy is less than the service sector, being based on small farms around the city and the highways that provide access to Palmas. Larger farms, which cultivate soybeans and raise livestock, are located in the district of Buritirana. The economy is mostly formal, consisting primarily of limited partnerships and sole proprietorships. Micro firms are the most common in the city, where they comprise over 80% of companies Palmense 4394. The city has four industrial districts, among them the Industrial District of Palmas, Tocantins Industrial District I Industrial District, and Industrial District Tocantins II of Taquaralto. All are located along the highways and TO-050 TO-010. Today Palmas city has become a center whose trade and economic influence covers the entire state of Tocantins, in addition to the southeastern Pará, the northeastern Mato Grosso, and the southern Maranhão. In town are branches of the following national banks: Banco do Brasil (7 agencies), Bradesco (five agencies, one of Bradesco Prime), Caixa Econômica Federal (4 agencies, 3 more ATM's), Itaú Unibanco (3 agencies), Banco da Amazônia (2 agencies), HSBC (1 agency), Santander (1 agency), Banco BMG (1 agency), Banco Cruzeiro do Sul (1 agency), and Tribanco (1 agency). Palmas has seven self-service terminals of the Banco 24 Horas interbank network. In 2007 the Gross Domestic Product had a strong expansion was estimated at $2.2 billion, driven by investments of the City of Palms in the economy. The increase in GDP of Palmas was 6% and, compared to that of Brazil was very considerable, as the country showed the percentage of 3.5%. By the end of 2007, and capital represented 18.4% of the wealth generated by Tocantins and 0.08% in the country. Due to this growth, Palmas has attracted major investments, such as the Capim Dourado Shopping (inaugurated in August/2010), the multimodal yard of the North-South (located in the municipality of Porto Nacional, on the banks of the TO-080), plus branches of hypermarket networks: Atacadão, Makro, Extra and Assam. ==Governance== :See also: As in all cities in Brazil, Palmas has separate Executive and Legislative branches of local government, represented by the Mayor of Palmas and the Local Assembly, respectively. In Portuguese. Since its founding, Palmas has had 5 elected Mayors. The current incumbent is Cinthia Ribeiro, who succeeded Carlos Amastha (PP).

Its cooler microclimate and natural surroundings attract many tourists from Palmas, other regions of Brazil and abroad. Taquaruçu is famous for the many waterfalls (cachoeiras) surrounding it, where tourists can swim and also practice sports like rappel. == Transport == Palmas is served by a local public bus service and an interstate bus service. Rodoviaria (central bus station) is located at the edge of city, with connections to all capitals of Brazil. ===Airport=== Palmas Airport. The city is served by the Palmas Airport. Planned for a population of one million, Palmas airport is uncrowded, with only a few flights per day, mostly to and from Brasília. The airport is 30 km from city center, and is served by city bus (2 buses). ===Highways=== The Rodovia Coluna Prestes (TO-050) connects the city with Brasília. The Federal Highway (BR-153) connects Palmas north and south through a 60 km drive west to Paraiso de Tocantins. BR-153 is mostly not twinned. The principal avenue of the city is the avenida Theotônio Segurado, connecting the North Director Plan with Taquaralto, on the South Palmas. ===Railway=== There is no passenger rail service to Palmas. The newly constructed North-South Railway (Ferrovia Norte- Sul), runs near Palmas. It is intended to alleviate Brazil's heavy truck traffic and to carry bulk goods to ports in North-Eastern Brazil. ==Sports== In sports, the most notable football club in the city is Palmas FR, which plays at the Nilton Santos Stadium. Palmas has several sports and entertainment clubs, with swimming pools, other sports and cultural programs, clubs such as AABB and SESC.

There are two broad classifications of bedliners: \\"Drop-in\\" and \\"Spray-on/in\\". \\"Drop-in \\" bedliners are easily applied to the truck bed with no preparation work required, and can be easily removed as well for cleaning. Spray-in bedliners require specific preparation to allow the coating to adhere correctly to the bed. How well the coating adheres will determine how long it will last. ==History== Protecting the bed of trucks has been around since the inception of the modern pick-up truck in the early 1950s with simple modifications being made such as installing planks of wood to the beds. Ford's F100 series featured such options, although now done only for cosmetic purposes or restoration. People have also been known to install a simple sheet of wood as a means to protect the floor from being scratched or dented. As pick-up trucks were designed to haul cargo a more advanced method was created. Thermoforming, a technique that has been around since the 1940s in acrylics and styrene would eventually through advances in development and research create the first plastic drop-in bedliner. In 1972, G. Fred Lorenzen filed a patent for \\"protective inner liner of cargo box or body of pickup truck\\". In 1976, Robert J. Zeffero filed a patent regarding the protection of truck beds with a \\"cargo box liner for pick-up trucks\\". In 1983, Penda Corporation along with others would soon figure out a way to replicate the design and start to manufacture their own design of a bed liner. ==Drop-in bedliners== Drop-in or plastic bedliners are the most commonly found type, although with the spray-on bedliner industry garnered recognition, drop-ins have lost some value in market share. Drop-ins can usually be installed rather quickly with no major modification made to the bed of the truck except drilling small holes in key areas to hold it in place in certain applications. Typically made of a polyethylene composite, drop-ins are a rigid structure formed to the contours of a specific vehicle model. A newer version of a drop-in bedliner recently introduced is composed of separate sides and a rubber mat for the floor made by DualLiner. ==Spray-on bedliners== \\"Sprayed-on\\",\\"Sprayed-in\\",\\"Spray-on\\", \\"Spray-in\\" (these terms are used interchangeably in the industry) come in varying formulations and process methods such as high or low pressure, aromatic or aliphatic, polyurea or polyurethane, or hybrid and solvent base. Performance greatly relies on the initial surface preparation done on the bed. It is possible to have the color of the bedliner match that of the vehicle, but with time, color fade from ultraviolet radiation is inevitable. Aromatic is generally used for black and darker colors, and is the least expensive option. Aliphatic can be a better option for colors because its color is more stable over time in ultraviolet light. It is produced with pure polyurethane, which drives up the cost approximately 35%. Aliphatic materials can be sprayed in a wide variety of colors, including metallic finishes. Spray-on bedliners can be applied by roller, low pressure, cartridge driven by an air compressor or high pressure machine. Environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind, and elevation can affect the cure process of a spray-in bedliner. Nozzle aperture, thinners, and spray pressure can be modified to allow proper distribution of the spray lining chemicals. ==Differences in spray-on bedliners== Spray-on bedliner material can vary in texture as well as color. Texture can be smooth for easy cleaning or rough to prevent skidding. Polyurethane can be sprayed from 1/16 inch to 4 inches, depending on the application. Thinner coatings may cost less but can chip and crack. Thicker coatings will alter the shape and size of the truck bed somewhat. For trucks with the most rugged use, ArmorThane sets optimum thickness for bedliners as 1/4 inch on the bed and wheel wells and 1/8 inch on the sides. Truck bedliner applied with a spray-on technique When applied correctly, the value of a truck bedliner is that it resists denting, scratching, and holds shape firmly, yet is flexible enough to not crack when navigating through rough terrain. Unlike a metal bed, it absorbs vibration to protect cargo. Whereas painted metal will chip and rust under rough conditions, polyurethane coatings prevent damage from scratching and from most chemicals, and therefore avoid rusting. Spray on truck bedliners require a professional applicator who has the training and experience to follow the process and deliver a smooth, even surface. The process requires sanding to create a surface for the polyurethane to attach. This allows the polyurethane to bond permanently so it will not bubble even in extreme weather. The choice of colors is virtually unlimited. A color matching system sprays to OEM specs or owners can choose custom colors. Adding an ultraviolet stabilizer maintains the appearance even in prolonged direct sunlight. ==Spray-on bedliner material for other uses== Protect any size truck from work abuse These spray-on polyurethane coatings are not just for truck bedliners. They also protect fenders, bumpers, floor boards, nerf bars and trim. In fact, whole vehicles have been sprayed. The same polyurethane spray can be applied to emergency vehicles, commercial transport, heavy construction, agriculture equipment and boats. Spraying polyurethane serves two purposes. First, it adds years of service by preventing scratching, rusting, and chemical contamination from deteriorating standard OEM paint. Second, it can create a roughed up, anti-skid or anti-slip surface. Some polyurea coatings, using a similar spray system, have been applied to military and private vehicles for blast mitigation. The MythBusters tested myths about the toughness of spray-on truck bedliner resin in 2011 and confirmed it to be an adequate protection against dents in minor crashes (applied on a car), dog bites (applied on a jacket) and explosive blasts (applied on a wooden or brick wall).MythBusters (2011 season): \\"Drain Disaster\\"/\\"Bedlam-Proof Bedliner\\" ==Polyurethane spray bedliners== The bedliner industry has created confusion with regard to all the custom polyurea, polyurethane and polyurea formulations. Each company boasts of its superior durability and profitable dealer opportunities. The reality is that they are all very similar, barring low-quality do-it-yourself products. If you want to learn about the differences between spray bedliners, it is important to understand the differences between polyurethane and polyurea, as well as what is required to achieve different textures and physical properties. Polyureas and polyurethanes have significant differences chemically, but act similarly in many applications. For the purpose of bedliners, the big difference is in the application process and the level of isocyanates and VOCs. This is an important aspect of the bedliner industry, as the presence of VOCs and isocyanates prevents the application of spray bedliners in many states, or places restrictions on how the material can be applied. Spray-Lining Polyurea- Polyurethane Bedliner ==Other applications== Only two types of coatings are mentioned so far but additives can be added to coatings to provide different characteristics, Although this is about Truck Bedliners, the protective coatings can be applied in many other environments have a variety of needs and purposes besides a simple truck bedliner. In recent years it has become more popular to use bedliner to coat the exterior of vehicles as well. This trend is, among other things, due to an increased availability and greater variety of colors offered. Due to the waterproof and anti-corrosive nature of these polyurethane blends, they are also used as a coating for the interior of boats ==HMW/UHMW Medium to heavy duty poly dump bedliners== ===Super heavy duty UHMW asphalt liner=== The “most versatile” dump bedliner can handle hot asphalt one day and rock/concrete the next, maximizing the usage of your dump equipment and lowering maintenance costs. ===Heavy duty UHMW liner=== “Heavy Duty” dump body bedliners allow for low scope dumping, less sticking and freezing while protecting the bed from heavy, abrasive loads in steel and aluminum dump bodies and trailers. ==Origin of the polyurethane liner== It was created in 1983, by American Made Liner Systems, now a division of American Made Systems, Inc. ===Purpose of the original dump bedliner=== * Permanent protection for dump bodies * Lower scope dumping reduces chances of roll-over * Less sticking and freezing of loads * Higher profits with less carry-backs and more hauls per day ==References== Category:Trucks ","title":"Truck bedliner"},{"id":"2569810","text":"Radim Gaudentius (, ) (c. 970 - c. 1020) was Archbishop of Gniezno and the first Polish archbishop. ==Background== Radim was an illegitimate son of Bohemian Prince Slavník, and thus the half-brother of Adalbert of Prague.

It is located west of Luxembourg City. The commune includes Mamer itself, and also the smaller communities of Capellen and Holzem. Mamer is situated on the river Mamer, a tributary of the Alzette. The A6 motorway from Luxembourg to Brussels, also designated European route E25, runs through Mamer. , Mamer, which lies in the east of the commune, has a population of 8,173. The town is the thirteenth-largest in Luxembourg. The commune as a whole is the fourteenth-most populous in the country. ==History== Ruins of the Gallo-Roman baths The Treveri, a Gallic or Celtic tribe, inhabited the region for several hundred years until they were conquered by Julius Caesar in 54 BC. A Celtic necropolis from the 1st century was discovered in the early 1970s on the Juckelsboesch plateau between Mamer and Kehlen. A beautiful dark blue glass bowl was among the offerings found in the tombs.Bol de verre côtelé from Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art . Retrieved 28 November 2007. During the Gallo-Roman era which lasted until about 450, the Romans built and maintained a number of roads in the area including the Kiem (Latin caminus, road) linking Trier to Reims through what is now Mamer. Mambra was a Roman vicus centred on a villa with thermal baths, sited on the banks of the Mamer River at the eastern end of today's Mamer. The Roman settlement was burnt by Germanic invaders around 276. Statue of Nicolaus Mameranus, Mamer The oldest historical reference to Mamer is to be found in a document which records how, on 8 April 960, Lutgardis, daughter of Wigeric, Count Palatine, made a gift of the hamlet of Mambra to Saint Maximin's Abbey in Trier for the benefit of the monks. Nicolaus Mameranus was born in Mamer in 1500. A soldier and historian under Charles V, he succeeded in having the Emperor pay for the restoration of the village of Mamer after the Duke of Orléans' troops pillaged it in 1543. In 1555, he was appointed poet laureate.Mameranus Nicolas - Club Philatelique Mamer. Retrieved 12 November 2006. The road linking Luxembourg City to Brussels, passing through Mamer, was built in 1790. In 1859, the railway to Brussels was opened, with a station in Mamer. The inhabitants of Mamer suffered under the First and Second World Wars, although the town itself escaped bombing. The Voie de la Liberté commemorating the victorious route of the Allies after the D-Day landings passes through Mamer which was liberated on 10 September 1944. Since 1945, Mamer has prospered year-by-year as a result of its location close to Luxembourg City and its excellent road and rail connections. In 2003, the Lycée Technique Josy Barthel was opened, as was the Mamer Lycée railway station, which serves it. == Demographics == The population of Mamer has substantially increased over the past 40 years, reaching 5,047 in 2005 and 8,173 in 2014. Some 46% are foreigners, representing over 60 countries, with significant numbers from Portugal (560), France (478), Belgium (456), Denmark (225), and Germany (214). This can be ascribed to Mamer's development as a commuter town for those working in the international institutions and financial services in and around Luxembourg City. == Politics == ===Local administration=== The communal council, with offices at Mamer Castle, consists of 13 members: 6 from the Christian Social People's Party (currently Luxembourg's leading party), 3 Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party, 2 Democratic Party, and 2 The Greens.

A native of Mamer, he is married with one child. === Coat of arms === The communal coat of arms (top right-hand box) consists of a temple on a blue background with four golden columns which is headed by a blue wheel between two hooks.Granted by ministerial decree on 12 October 1979 (Mémorial B 1979, page 1030) The colours are based on the arms of the Mersch-Rodemacks who were once lords of Mamer. The temple depicts Mamer's long history and its recently discovered Roman vestiges. The wheel stems from the arms of the Mameranus family while the two hooks are reminiscent of the crest of the Mamer family. ==Mamer today== Recently opened retirement home Only 7 km west of Luxembourg City, Mamer enjoys a pleasant semi-rural setting in Luxembourg's Gutland, where the undulating surroundings are ideal for cattle farming, crops and forestry. The centre of the original village is to the south of the N6 (Route d'Arlon) from Luxembourg City to Arlon. This is where the church, town hall, and most of the shops are located. Several restaurants are located along the Route d'Arlon itself. The extensive Belle Etoile shopping centre is 2 km to the east. Most of the recent housing developments have been to the north, between the N6 and the E25 motorway, particularly in the Cité Mameranus area. There have also been commercial developments to the west close to the Mamer motorway exit. Since 2000, Mamer has seen the opening of a high school, the Lycée Technique Josy Barthel; a new railway station, Mamer Lycée; an old people's home; and a new local administrative centre in Mamer Castle. In addition, the Kinneksbond, a large primary school and pre-school complex, opened in 2007.Carolo Losch: Mamer Revisited, Luxembourg 2008 Adjacent to the school buildings, the ultra- modern Kinneksbond cultural centre opened in October 2010.\\"Kinneksbond Cultural Centre to Open over Hallowe'en Week-End\\" , MyMosaik.lu. Retrieved 4 March 2011. A second European School for Luxembourg is now being built in the area. ===Public transport=== The commune boasts three railway stations: Mamer, Mamer Lycée, and Capellen. All three are located on Line 50, which connects Luxembourg City to the west of the country. From Mamer, there are regular train services to Luxembourg City (to the east) and Kleinbettingen and Arlon (to the west). In addition to a frequent bus service to Luxembourg and Kirchberg (European Institutions and financial centre), long-distance routes connect Mamer to Arlon, Clemency, Septfontaines, Keispelt, Steinfort, Redange and Eischen. Mamer also has a variety of school-bus routes serving both the Luxembourg schools and the European School. ===Facilities and services=== In recent years, Mamer has seen the development of a wide range of services including an Ambulance and Fire Station, primary and secondary schools, a post office, a pharmacy, banks, garages, restaurants and an inn. Shopping facilities in the vicinity are excellent (large supermarkets within a couple of minutes' drive) while Mamer itself has a number of smaller shops offering day-to-day produce. Doctors, dentists, opticians and vets can be found in Mamer and its surroundings. There is an open market on the first and third Friday of the month from 4 to 7 p.m. Mamer also has a large park on either side of the river, a sports centre, a football stadium and several children's playing grounds. Bonfire for the winter buergbrennen festival celebrated in most Luxembourgish villages Apart from services in different languages at the parish church, Luxembourg's Islamic Cultural Centre, together with its mosque, offers a variety of educational and religious services. ===Leisure and sports=== Mamer has an active brass band, a stamp-collectors' club and a photo club. Its football club, FC Mamer 32, with teams for both men and women, has been increasingly successful in recent years. There are also facilities for cyclists in the area including a signposted route and, once a year, a traffic- free day for cyclists between Mamer and Mersch. There are also a number of village fetes and festivals, usually centred on the square outside the church. Even in the winter, there is a Christmas market in mid-December and the traditional burgbrennen evening celebrating the end of winter with an enormous bonfire. Domaine Mont Royal: typical of Mamer's residential areas ===Standard of living=== Luxembourg is at or near the top of world rankings for GDP per capita and for quality of life. As a result, living standards are high throughout the country, especially in residential areas around Luxembourg City, including Mamer itself. Private houses, many fully detached, usually have sizeable gardens, garages and cellars. There are also a few apartment buildings and houses for rent. Costs of accommodation are high as a result of increasing demand but are offset by low municipal taxes and Luxembourg's low sales tax, particularly on fuel. Cable television is provided throughout the commune and includes stations broadcasting in languages other than the local French, German and Luxembourgish. A very wide range of TV programmes can be accessed via satellite including English-language BBC and SKY channel. Broadband or cable-based internet access is widely available. There are excellent facilities for garbage collection and recycling. ==Economy== Although Mamer has developed mainly as a residential area, it has also experienced substantial progress in industry and commerce. Its most successful private company, Ceratizit (formerly Cerametal), now with some 950 employees,Télécran, Luxembourg: Cératizit aus Mamer, 6/2007, 3 February 2007 has become a world player in hard materials for wear protection and cutting tools. There are also a number of construction companies in the area, a laundry, a company specializing in computer storage and data protection , a branch of the huge GlaxoSmithKline pharmaceuticals company as well as a private investment bank and some smaller financial institutions and consultants. In addition, the commercial development area between Mamer and Capellen has attracted a number of sophisticated stores and a substantial amount of new office space. ==Environment== Mamer with a sprinkling of snow ===Climate=== Like Luxembourg City, Mamer (altitude 310 m) has a temperate climate with warm summers (average day temperature around 24 C, on occasion as high as 35 C) and chilly winters (daytime average 5 C but sometimes as low as -15 C at night). Rainfall is moderate, but on average it rains less than 10 days per month. The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Unlike many communities in Luxembourg, Mamer does not suffer from flooding but is occasionally hit by gales, hail storms and freezing rain. There is often a little snow in the winter but it does not usually cause inconvenience as salting and snow- clearing facilities are well coordinated. The summer evenings in Mamer are particularly pleasant, often with temperatures of around 25 C until 11 pm. Very occasionally there are short periods of drought but the vegetation seldom loses its rich green for very long. Daylight extends from about 5 am to 10:30 pm in June and from 8 am to 4:30 pm in December. ===Wildlife=== A wide variety of wild animals and birds have been observed in the area. The ones you might see when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins and you may be lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you will hear - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.

Despite not having a commune named after it, Capellen lends its name to the canton of Capellen, and is the only town in Luxembourg to bear the latter distinction but not the former. Capellen is home of the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA), currently being transformed into the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) which will act as the headquarters of NATO's Agencies.Jorge Benitez, \\"Details of NATO's new agency structure\\" , NATO Source, 9 June 2011.

To the west of the NAMSA complex is Capellen railway station, which lies on Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois' Line 50. The town is the site of one of the six regional headquarters of the Grand Ducal Police. A museum dedicated to police uniforms and accessories, both national and international, was opened in the town on 21 June 2007. ==History== Capellen lies on the old Roman road, today's Kiemwee, from Trier in Germany to Reims and Paris.Nadège Anen: Wiederentdeckung der bedeutenden römischen Fernstrasse Reims-Trier zwischen Mamer und Capellen . Retrieved 12 November 2007. Some years ago, a Roman milestone was found on the Kiem in the direction of Windhof to the west of Capellen.Rol Schockweiler: Der Meilenstein von Cap - Capellen . Retrieved 16 November 2007. Furthermore, in 2002, beside the Roman road to the east, the remains of several Roman buildings and brick kilns (see below) were uncovered. These appear to date back to the 4th century. The first reference to Capellen is to be found in the Koerich parish records from 1718 which state that five households reside in Auf der Kappe, soon to be known as Cap. In 1722, a new weekly stagecoach service from Luxembourg to Brussels passed through Cap. The road linking Luxembourg City to Brussels, passing through Capellen, was built in 1790. From 1796, Cap and Capellen came under the jurisdiction of Mamer. When Luxembourg was divided into cantons in 1840, as a result of disputes between Mamer and Koerich, it was decided that the canton should be named Capellen and that Capellen should become its seat. In 1859, the railway from Luxembourg to Brussels was opened, with a station in Capellen. American troops, liberating Luxembourg in September 1944, proceeded through Capellen towards Arlon along what became known as the Voie de la Liberté. In 1951, barracks for the Luxembourg army including the main vehicle depot were built to the south of the town. After the national draft was lifted in 1967, these facilities were taken over by NAMSA as a major NATO supply centre. Since the 1970s, Capellen has expanded rapidly, both as a residential town and, increasingly, a business and financial development area.Histoire de la localité de Capellen from the Commune of Mamer official site.

The Roman brick kiln in Capellen, Luxembourg ===The Roman brick kiln=== In 2002, while excavation work was in progress at the Parc d'Activités site to the east of Capellen, the remains of a Roman brick factory were discovered. With assistance from the National Museum of History and Art, archeologists from Nospelt belonging to the Georges Kayser Altertumsfuerscher uncovered a number of Roman buildings and kilns. One of the kilns was in remarkably good condition. As it was not possible to keep it in its original location, the Ministry of Culture and the Commune of Mamer decided it should be transferred to the centre of Capellen. After long and careful preparations, the kiln was moved to its new position in April 2003.Réimeschen Zillenuewen, i.e. Roman brick oven, from the Industriegeschicht vu Lëtzebuerg site. Retrieved 12 November 2007. The brick kiln is of great historical interest as it shows that in the 4th century, the Romans were undertaking a considerable amount of construction work, probably under the direction of Constantine the Great who frequently resided in nearby Trier from 306 to 316. The site of the brick factory was on the Kiem (Latin caminus, road) or Roman road linking Trier to Reims only 4 km from the vicus of Mamer. The kiln's new site, opposite the church on Route d'Arlon in the centre of Capellen, is open to the public. ==Capellen today== Capellen has prospered over the past 40 years, first as a result of the establishment of NAMSA with personnel from all the NATO countries, then as a residential area for those working in Luxembourg City. With the recent development of the Parc d'Activités, many financial and technology companies now have offices in Capellen. This has all led to the opening of a large supermarket, a new post office, a pharmacy and several restaurants in the locality. There is also a large community centre next to the church and primary school. Capellen also hosts the Ligue HMC, an innovative association offering vocational training and employment for mentally disabled people.Ligue HMC, retrieved 11 February 2011. There are frequent bus services to Luxembourg and to various locations to the west. The A6 motorway or European route E25 from Luxembourg to Brussels runs through Capellen. ==Economy== Capellen's largest employer by far is NSPA (ex NAMSA) with some 1000 employees.

He was a distant younger relative of Xiahou Yuan and a close friend of Cao Pi, the first emperor of the Cao Wei state. ==Early life== Xiahou Shang was a distant younger relative of Xiahou Yuan and Xiahou Dun, generals who served under Cao Cao, the warlord who rose to power in the late Eastern Han dynasty and laid the foundation for the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period. As a youth, he was already known for being well-versed in planning and strategy. Cao Pi, one of Cao Cao's sons, highly regarded Xiahou Shang and treated him as a close friend.(夏侯尚字伯仁，淵從子也。文帝與之親友。) Sanguozhi vol. 9.(魏書曰：尚有籌畫智略，文帝器之，與為布衣之交。) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 9. ==Service under Cao Cao== In the 200s,Zizhi Tongjian vols. 63–65. when Cao Cao was at war with his rival Yuan Shao for control over northern China, Xiahou Shang served as a major () in Cao Cao's army and led cavalry forces into battle against Yuan Shao and his heirs. In 211,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 66. after Cao Pi was appointed General of the Household for All Purposes () in the Han imperial court, Xiahou Shang served as a wenxue (文學; an officer of writings) under him.(太祖定兾州，尚為軍司馬，將騎從征伐，後為五官將文學。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In 213, after Emperor Xian, the figurehead emperor of the Han Empire, enfeoffed Cao Cao as the Duke of Wei (), Xiahou Shang was reassigned to be a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate () in Cao Cao's dukedom.(魏國初建，遷黃門侍郎。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In 216, Emperor Xian elevated Cao Cao from the status of a duke to a vassal king under the title \\"King of Wei\\" ().Zizhi Tongjian vol. 67. When the Wuchendi () branch of the Wuhuan tribes started a rebellion in Dai Commandery (代郡; around present-day Yu County, Hebei) and Shanggu Commandery (上谷郡; around present-day Beijing) in May 218,([建安二十三年]夏四月，代郡、上谷烏丸無臣氐等叛，遣鄢陵侯彰討破之。) Sanguozhi vol. 1. Cao Cao ordered his son Cao Zhang to lead forces to quell the revolt. During this time, Xiahou Shang served as an army adviser () under Cao Zhang and assisted him in defeating the Wuchendi.(代郡胡叛，遣鄢陵侯彰征討之，以尚參彰軍事，定代地，還。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ==Service under Cao Pi== In March 220, after Cao Cao died in Luoyang, Xiahou Shang received orders to lead the convoy escorting Cao Cao's coffin back to Ye (鄴; in present-day Handan, Hebei), the capital of the vassal Kingdom of Wei, for a proper funeral and burial. Cao Pi, as Cao Cao's heir apparent, succeeded his father as the King of Wei and Imperial Chancellor of the Han Empire. He first appointed Xiahou Shang as a Regular Mounted Attendant and later promoted him to Commandant of the Central Army (). As a reward for Xiahou Shang's contributions, Cao Pi also enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Pingling Village ().(太祖崩於洛陽，尚持節，奉梓宮還鄴。并錄前功，封平陵亭侯，拜散騎常侍，遷中領軍。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In late 220,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 69. Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the Cao Wei state with himself as the new emperor. After his coronation, he elevated Xiahou Shang from a village marquis to a district marquis under the title \\"Marquis of Pingling District\\" (). Xiahou Shang was also appointed as General Who Attacks the South () and Inspector () of Jing Province, and put in charge of supervising military affairs in the southern frontiers of Wei.(文帝踐阼，更封平陵鄉侯，遷征南將軍，領荊州刺史，假節都督南方諸軍事。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ===Battle of Shangyong=== During this time, Xiahou Shang proposed to Cao Pi to launch an attack on Shangyong Commandery (上庸郡; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei), which was a territory of Cao Pi's rival Liu Bei. Cao Pi approved and ordered him and Xu Huang(文帝即王位，以晃為右將軍，進封逯鄉侯。及踐阼，進封楊侯。與夏侯尚討劉備於上庸，破之。) Sanguozhi vol. 17. to lead troops to attack Shangyong Commandery. Xiahou Shang achieved success in his mission and pacified a total of three commanderies and nine counties. Cao Pi promoted him to Senior General Who Attacks the South () in recognition of his achievements.(尚奏：「劉備別軍在上庸，山道險難，彼不我虞，若以奇兵潛行，出其不意，則獨克之勢也。」遂勒諸軍擊破上庸，平三郡九縣，遷征南大將軍。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ===Battle of Jiangling=== Sun Quan, another rival of Cao Pi, initially pledged allegiance to the Cao Wei state after Cao Pi became emperor in late 220. Cao Pi was so pleased that he awarded Sun Quan the title of a vassal king, \\"King of Wu\\" (), and recognised Sun Quan's claim to the territories in the Jiangdong region and southern Jing Province. Xiahou Shang knew that Sun Quan was only pretending to submit to Wei rule so he urged Cao Pi to maintain his guard against Sun Quan. As Xiahou Shang foresaw, Sun Quan broke ties with Cao Pi in 222 and declared himself the emperor of an independent Eastern Wu (or simply Wu) regime.(孫權雖稱藩，尚益脩攻討之備，權後果有貳心。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In 222, Cao Pi retaliated against Sun Quan by launching the first of a series of campaigns against Wu. He ordered Xiahou Shang, Cao Zhen and others to lead troops to attack Jiangling (江陵; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei), which was defended by the Wu general Zhu Ran, while he was stationed at Wan (宛; in present-day Nanyang, Henan) to provide backup. Sun Quan ordered his general Zhuge Jin to attack Xiahou Shang. Zhuge Jin deployed his naval forces across different locations in the river. That night, Xiahou Shang ordered some 10,000 troops to split up and board smaller boats to cross the river and launch a stealth attack on Zhuge Jin on both land and water. They scored a major victory over Zhuge Jin as they burnt down the Wu ships and destroyed some Wu camps on the opposite bank of the river.(黃初三年，車駕幸宛，使尚率諸軍與曹真共圍江陵。權將諸葛瑾與尚軍對江，瑾渡入江中渚，而分水軍於江中。尚夜多持油舩，將步騎萬餘人，於下流潛渡，攻瑾諸軍，夾江燒其舟舩，水陸並攻，破之。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In 223,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 70. when an epidemic broke out while Wei forces were laying siege to Jiangling, Cao Pi ordered the Wei forces to pull back, thus bringing an end to the campaign. As a reward for Xiahou Shang's contributions during the campaign, Cao Pi awarded him an additional 600 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number up to 1,900. He also gave Xiahou Shang a ceremonial axe and promoted him to Governor () of Jing Province.(城未拔，會大疫，詔勑尚引諸軍還。益封六百戶，并前千九百戶，假鉞，進為牧。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. When Xiahou Shang assumed governorship of (northern) Jing Province, the lands were barren and infrastructure was in ruins after years of war. Most of the population have migrated to the lands south of the Han River which were Wu territory. Besides, there were various non-Han Chinese tribes living around Jing Province who occasionally started uprisings and caused trouble for the regional government. After conquering Shangyong Commandery (上庸郡; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei) in 221, Xiahou Shang used it as a bridge to establish contact with the non-Han Chinese tribes living in the lands 700 li to the west and succeeded in pacifying them and gaining their support. Within five to six years, thousands of households pledged allegiance to Wei. In 224, Cao Pi changed Xiahou Shang's marquis title to \\"Marquis of Changling District\\" ().(荊州殘荒，外接蠻夷，而與吳阻漢水為境，舊民多居江南。尚自上庸通道，西行七百餘里，山民蠻夷多服從者，五六年間，降附數千家。五年，徙封昌陵鄉侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ===Family feud=== Xiahou Shang married the younger sister of Cao Zhen, an adopted son of Cao Cao and a close childhood friend of Cao Pi.([夏侯]玄，爽之姑子也。) Sanguozhi vol. 9.(景懷夏侯皇后諱徽，字媛容，沛國譙人也。父尚，魏徵南大將軍；母曹氏，魏德陽鄉主。) Jin Shu vol. 31. In his later years, Xiahou Shang took a concubine, whom he loved dearly. A family feud broke out when Xiahou Shang's concubine started fighting with Cao Zhen's sister to become Xiahou Shang's official spouse. When Cao Pi heard about it, he decided to intervene as a show of support for his fellow members of the Cao clan, so he had Xiahou Shang's concubine executed by strangulation.(尚有愛妾嬖幸，寵奪適室；適室，曹氏女也，故文帝遣人絞殺之。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. Xiahou Shang was so upset by his concubine's death that he fell sick and his health started deteriorating. After burying his concubine, he stayed indoors all the time and refused to meet anyone. When Cao Pi heard about it, he remarked, \\"Maybe Du Xi had good reason(s) to look down on (Xiahou) Shang.\\" Despite this incident, Cao Pi still highly favoured Xiahou Shang because he was a close childhood friend.(尚悲感，發病怳惚，旣葬埋妾，不勝思見，復出視之。文帝聞而恚之曰：「杜襲之輕薄尚，良有以也。」然以舊臣，恩寵不衰。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ==Death== In 225, when Xiahou Shang became critically ill, he had to be sent back to the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, from his post in Jing Province. During this time, Cao Pi personally visited him, held his hand and sobbed with grief. Xiahou Shang died shortly after. Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title \\"Marquis Dao\\" ()(六年，尚疾篤，還京都，帝數臨幸，執手涕泣。尚薨，謚曰悼侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. and wrote an official eulogy for him: \\"(Xiahou) Shang had been a close companion to me since my childhood. He was loyal, sincere and faithful. Although we did not have the same parents, we were as close as brothers. He was like my stomach and heart, and like claws and teeth to me. He was intelligent, perceptive and exceptionally brilliant. It is a pity that his life ended so early. Alas, such is life! I hereby grant him the posthumous appointment of Senior General Who Attacks the South and award him the seal of the Marquis of Changling.\\"(魏書載詔曰：「尚自少侍從，盡誠竭節，雖云異姓，其猶骨肉，是以入為腹心，出當爪牙。智略深敏，謀謨過人，不幸早殞，命也柰何！贈征南大將軍、昌陵侯印綬。」) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 9. ==Family== Xiahou Shang married Cao Zhen's younger sister, whose personal name is unknown; she was referred to as the Lady of Deyang District (). She bore him a son, Xiahou Xuan, and a daughter, Xiahou Hui. Xiahou Xuan inherited his father's peerage and marquisate as the Marquis of Changling (). Cao Pi removed 300 taxable households from the marquisate and awarded it to Xiahou Feng (), a nephew of Xiahou Shang who was enfeoffed as a Secondary Marquis ().(子玄嗣。又分尚戶三百，賜尚弟子奉爵關內侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 9. Xiahou Shang had another daughter who married He You (), He Qia's son, and bore He Jiao ().(和嶠，字長輿，汝南西平人也。祖洽，魏尚書令。父逌，魏吏部尚書。嶠少有風格，慕舅夏侯玄之為人，厚自崇重。) Jin Shu vol. 45. Xiahou Shang also had a younger cousin Xiahou Ru (), according to the Weilüe, who served as a military officer in Cao Wei under Zhang Ji (Derong) (). ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== Xiahou Shang is a minor character in the 14th- century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical figures and events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He participates in the Battle of Mount Dingjun as a subordinate of Xiahou Yuan against Liu Bei's forces. During a skirmish, he is captured by the enemy and but is later released in exchange for the enemy officer Chen Shi, who was captured by Xiahou Yuan. During the exchange, Huang Zhong fires an arrow at him, which hits him in the back and seriously injures him. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

He also taught at the University of Rome between 1913 and 1939. During World War II he moved to Ferentino. He was engaged to Laura Pisati, his former master's student who became the first woman invited to deliver a lecture at the fourth International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), but she died in 1908 shortly before both her talk and their intended wedding. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 in Toronto, in 1928 in Bologna, and in 1932 in Zurich. Giorgi died in Castiglioncello, Livorno at the age of 78. ==The Giorgi system== Toward the end of the 19th century, after James Clerk Maxwell's discoveries, it was clear that electric measurements could not be explained in terms of the three base units of length, mass and time, and that some irrational coefficients appeared in the equations without any logical physical reason. In 1901, Giorgi proposed to the (AEI) that the MKS system (which used the metre, kilogram and second as its base units) should be extended with a fourth unit to be chosen from the units of electromagnetism, solving also the presence of the irrational coefficients. Original manuscript with handwritten notes by Oliver Heaviside In 1935 this was adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as the M.K.S. System of Giorgi without specifying which electromagnetic unit would be the fourth base unit. In 1946 the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) approved a proposal to use the ampere as that unit in a four-dimensional system, the MKSA system. The Giorgi system was thus the precursor of the International System of Units (SI) adopted in 1960, which was based on six base units: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, and candela. The mole was added as a seventh base unit in 1971. ==Notes== ==References== # # Category:1871 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Italian electrical engineers Category:Italian physicists nl:Giovanni Giorgi Category:Metrologists ","title":"Giovanni Giorgi"},{"id":"2570012","text":"Bonin may refer to: ==Places== *Bonin, Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) *Bonin, Choszczno County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship (north-west Poland) *Bonin, Drawsko County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship (north-west Poland) *Bonin, Koszalin County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship (north-west Poland) *Bonin, Łobez County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship (north-west Poland) *Bonin Islands, Japan *Bonin, part of the Jeżyce district of Poznań (western Poland) ==Other uses== *Bonin (surname) == See also == * Bonin- Ogródki in Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) * Bonini * Bonnin (disambiguation) * Boning (disambiguation) ","title":"Bonin"},{"id":"2570021","text":"Egon Olsen (born 12 March 1925 (DK), 13 March 1923 (NO))In both the Danish and Norwegian version of the second film, he states his birthday while on the telephone with the police. The birthdate, however, is not the same in the two countries is a fictional character in the Danish Olsenbanden film series as well as in the Norwegian remake. He is portrayed by Ove Sprogøe in the Danish version and by Arve Opsahl in the Norwegian. In the Swedish version of the series, Jönssonligan, his part was taken by the character Charles Ingvar \\"Sickan\\" Jönsson, played by Gösta Ekman (and in the later films by other characters, played by different actors). ==Egon Olsen in the Danish series== In the Danish original, Egon Olsen is the small and wiry boss of the Olsen Gang. His two sidekicks are the merry Benny and the timid, pudgy Kjeld. Kjeld's wife, Yvonne, is the only one who Egon has to fight, as she tends to interfere with his plans. Egon Olsen's hallmark is his bowler hat, pinstripe suit, and an extinguished cigar end in his mouth, even when he is gagged. Egon Olsen is one of the typical antiheroes of film history, an eternal loser who wobbles but does not fall over. Some observers have pointed out that \\"Egon Olsen projects the image of an anarchist, an outcast from the world of established capitalism as well as from the secure world of the middle and upper classes.\\"Steen Sauerberg and Kjetil Kvale Sorenssen, \\"Olsenbanden pa dansk og norsk.\\" Paper presented at the XI. Nordic Conference of Mass Communication Research, Trondheim, 1993. Egon's involvement in each film follows a similar pattern. Egon constantly develops new and \\"genius\\" plans during his stays in prison. His catchphrase is \\"I have a plan\\", which he says to his accomplices in all fourteen films after being released from prison. The plan succeeds through the most intricate machinations (Egon's specialty is the cracking of safes with merely a stethoscope and fine feeling) but Egon always loses his object of desire due to some freak accident at the end of the movie, usually caused by the incompetence of his accomplices. Almost every film, except the fifth, the sixth and the fourteenth, ends with Egon's arrest. ===Reception and influence=== The role of Egon Olsen was Ove Sprogøe's most successful and also last film role. Sprogøe was honoured with a Bodil in 1975 for Olsen-Bandens sidste bedrifter. The role had a legendary renown in former East Germany, and while many West Germans are unable to associate the name of the franchise with the Danish films, nearly all Eastern Germans can at least cite Benny's catchphrase \\"mächtig gewaltig, Egon\\" (Danish \\"skidegodt, Egon!\\" - in English literally \\"shit-good, Egon\\", or \\"bloody good, Egon!\\"). Critics hypothesise that Egon's talent for improvisation impressed East Germans living under a socialist economy of scarcity, more than James Bond did, fighting his enemies with the newest technological gimmicks. The gaolers of the Vridsløselille prison in Copenhagen, where Egon Olsen went at the end of each film, initiated a renaming of the street right in front of the prison into \\"Egon Olsens Vej\\" () in 2004. According to gaolers and the prison warden, \\"Egon Olsen has always been a very nice criminal who deserves to be honoured\\", and \\"Egon has done much for the facility. Up until today, many tourists from Eastern Germany go on a pilgrimage to the prison gate to take pictures\\". ==In the Norwegian series== In the Norwegian series, Egon is quite similar to his Danish counterpart, with the same costumes and mannerisms. He is shown to be quite smart, laying ingenious plans to achieve fortune, and have them ruined by either his companions, poor timing or bad luck, very much like the Danish version where Yvonne is often the cause of his downfall. In the Norwegian series, Egon was originally set to be portrayed by Carsten Byhring, with Arve Opsahl in the role as Kjell Jensen, his companion. During rehearsal, however, Opsahl disagreed with the casting, and suggested that he and Byhring switch roles, to which Byhring and the directors fully agreed. Opsahl brought a lot of his comic talents to the role, in particular his doubletakes and long (and at the time profane) rants and outbursts, which Opsahl was known for on stage. He played the role in all fourteen films, including the final film in which he did half his scenes with a prosthetic foot, after having it amputated due to diabetes half-way through production. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Comedy film characters Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Olsen Gang Category:Fictional Danish people Category:Fictional Norwegian people Category:Film characters introduced in 1968 ","title":"Egon Olsen"},{"id":"2570026","text":"Simon van der Stel (14 October 1639 – 24 June 1712) was the last commander and first Governor of the Dutch Cape Colony, the settlement at the Cape of Good Hope. == Background == Simon was the son of Adriaan van der Stel, an official of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Adriaan was appointed the first Dutch governor of Mauritius in 1639. Simon was born at sea while his father was en route to Mauritius to take up his new posting. Adriaan had a long tenure in Mauritius, and Simon spent seven years there. His mother was Maria Lievens, daughter of a freed Indian slave woman known as Monica of the Coast of Goa, or Monica da Costa. Adriaan's governorship ended after five years, and after a few more years, Adriaan left Mauritius for Dutch Ceylon. Adriaan was murdered in Ceylon and Maria also died. Simon went on to Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies, where he remained until he was 20 years old. == Career == He then went to the United Provinces, where he associated with the most important members of the VOC, such as Willem Six. In 1663 he married Willem's daughter, Johanna Jacoba Six (1645–1700). They had six children.Birth certificate of four children In 1679, he was appointed \\"Commander\\" of the VOC's colony at the Cape of Good Hope, through the growing influence of his relative, Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen.Richard H. Grove (1996) Green Imperialism, p. 138. Simon was involved in making wine in Muiderberg; when he left the country he handed the vineyards over to Hendrik van Rheede. Van der Stel and his wife, Johanna Jacoba Six, did not enjoy a very good relationship and her sister Cornelia accompanied her husband to the Cape. Van der Stel never saw his wife again, though he remained devoted to her and frequently sent her money. Johanna Jacoba remained in Holland, and sent the furnishings and works of art required to fit out the governor's Residence at Groot Constantia. These included several art works including The Fisherman, an unfinished painting by Simon de Vlieger, which was one of 13 of his works purchased by Jan Cappelle upon his death. The painting came up for sale at the auction of Van der Stel's estate in 1716, where it was purchased by the Simon de Vlieger. In 1685 he was visited by Hendrik van Rheede with whom he shared in great interest in tropical botany. To prevent competition anywhere else in the world, young cinnamon-, cloves and camphor trees were destroyed by the ambitious son of Rijckloff van Goens.Heniger, J. (1986) Hendrik Adriaan van Reede tot Drakenstein (1636–1691) and Hortus Malabaricus – A contribution to the history of Dutch colonial botany, pp. 71–72. In 1685-86, he took part in an expedition to the Copper Mountains, Namaqua where he made topographic & geographic, botanical and zoological observations.See the facsimile of his illustrated manuscript on this expedition, ed. by M.L. Wilson and WJJ van Rijssen: Codex Witsenii. Annotated watercolours of landscapes, flora and fauna observed on the expedition to the Copper Mountains, Namaqua, 1685-6 by Simon van der Stel, Cape Town: Iziko Museums, 2002. In 1691, the VOC replaced the office of \\"Commander\\" with \\"Governor\\", and Van der Stel was promoted to the new position. His house Groot Constantia was well furnished with fine paintings including the unfinished painting by Simon de Vlieger \\"The Fisherman\\". Every one of his four sons was at one time or another with him in South Africa. Willem Adriaan, after being magistrate of Amsterdam, succeeded his father as Governor of the Cape; Frans \\"de jonker\\" became a farmer at the Cape; Adrian became governor of Amboina (1706–1720); Cornelis was one of the 352 shipwrecked in the in 1694. An expedition under Willem de Vlamingh was sent out to look for survivors on islands in the Indian Ocean or on the coast of Western Australia. Van der Stel retired in 1699, and was succeeded by his son Willem Adriaan van der Stel. In retirement, Simon devoted himself to his estate at Constantia, where he died in 1712. François Valentijn visited Frans at Constantia in March 1714.Ron Habiboe (2004) Tot verheffing van mijne natie. Het leven en werk van François Valentijn (1666–1727), p. 75. The estate was split up and sold 1716; the auction took four days and was very well attended. == Legacy == Willem Adriaan The town of Stellenbosch (founded in 1679) was named after him and Simon's Town is also named after him, as well as the Simonsberg mountain. An early ship of the South African Navy, was also named for him, in 1952. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his Discourse on Inequality, refers to Governor Van der Stel by name in a story about a Hottentot raised by the Dutch who chooses to \\"return to his equals\\" rather than remain in civilised society. According to Rousseau, Van der Stel himself raised the \\"Hottentot\\" from birth \\"in the principles of the Christian religion and in the practices of European customs.\\" The frontispiece of the Discourse features Van der Stel and the \\"Hottentot\\" above the phrase, Il retourne chez ses Egaux. Widely known for his development of the South African wine industry, Van der Stel was also the first Cape Governor to be of mixed race-origin, a fact that was largely unacknowledged by the Apartheid government. ==References== == External links == * Category:17th-century Dutch colonial governors Category:17th-century Dutch explorers Category:1639 births Category:1712 deaths Category:Commanders of the Dutch Cape Colony Category:Dutch emigrants to South Africa Category:Dutch people of Indian descent Category:Governors of the Dutch Cape Colony Category:People born at sea Category:Early modern Netherlandish cartography ","title":"Simon van der Stel"},{"id":"2570033","text":"Macrocytosis is the enlargement of red blood cells with near-constant hemoglobin concentration, and is defined by a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of greater than 100 femtolitres (the precise criterion varies between laboratories).

He was the fourth son of Xiahou Yuan and a maternal great-grandfather of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin dynasty. ==Life== Xiahou Wei was the fourth son of Xiahou Yuan, a general who served under Cao Cao, the warlord who laid the foundation for the Cao Wei state in the late Eastern Han dynasty before the Three Kingdoms period. His mother, whose maiden family name was Ding (丁), was a younger sister of Cao Cao's first wife. Xiahou Wei was close friends with Cao Cao's sons, including Cao Pi and Cao Zhi. He also knew Yang Hu since young and felt that he was an extraordinary talent, so he advised his second brother Xiahou Ba to arrange a marriage between Yang Hu and Xiahou Ba's daughter. Yang Hu later became a famous general in the late Three Kingdoms period and the Jin dynasty (265–420). Xiahou Wei once met the fortune teller Zhu Jianping (朱建平), who told him, \\"You'll become a provincial governor by the age of 48, but you'll also encounter a major calamity. If you survive the calamity, you'll live up to 69 and will even become a ducal minister.\\" Xiahou Wei consecutively served as the Inspector (刺史) of Jing and Yan provinces under the Cao Wei state before his 48th birthday. However, just as Zhu Jianping foretold, Xiahou Wei became critically ill by the end of the year. He thought that he would not survive, so he instructed his family to prepare for his funeral. To his surprise, he recovered from his illness towards the end of the 12th lunar month, so he threw a banquet on the eve of the Lunar New Year to celebrate. He told his guests, \\"I have recovered from my illness. When the sun rises tomorrow, I'll be 49 years old. I have survived the calamity that Zhu Jianping warned me about.\\" After the banquet, he suddenly suffered a relapse and died of illness that night. ==Family== Xiahou Wei had at least two sons. His first son, Xiahou Jun (夏侯駿), served as the Inspector (刺史) of Bing Province. His second son, Xiahou Zhuang (夏侯莊), married a cousin of Yang Huiyu and served as the Administrator (太守) of Huainan Commandery (淮南郡). Xiahou Zhuang had at least two sons and one daughter. His first son, Xiahou Zhan (夏侯湛), served as a Regular Mounted Attendant (散騎常侍) and as the Chancellor (相) of Nanyang State (南陽國). His second son, Xiahou Chun (夏侯淳), served as the Administrator of Yiyang Commandery (弋陽郡). Xiahou Chun's son, Xiahou Cheng (夏侯承), served as a Regular Mounted Attendant under the Eastern Jin dynasty. Xiahou Zhuang's daughter, Xiahou Guangji (夏侯光姬), married the Western Jin dynasty prince Sima Jin (司馬覲) and gave birth to Sima Rui, the first emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

The station brands itself as \\"The Progressive Voice of Minnesota,\\" and offers a combination of locally produced and nationally syndicated progressive talk programming. It is owned by JR Broadcasting. KTNF's studios and transmitter are located on Valley View Road in Eden Prairie. It operates with 1,000 watts around the clock, using a directional antenna, with a two-tower pattern by day and a three-tower pattern at night. Syndicated hosts heard on KTNF include Stephanie Miller, Thom Hartmann, Amy Goodman and Mike Papantonio Some hours begin with Westwood One News. ==History== On May 13, 1958, the station signed on as KRSI. It was owned by Radio Suburbia and its studios were located at 4500 Excelsior Blvd. in St. Louis Park. On July 1, 1962, it started an FM sister station at 104.1 MHz, which, following many format changes, is now KZJK. At one point, both stations were owned by Red Owl Stores. In October 1972, the two stations moved to what is now the AM station's current studio and transmitter facility in Eden Prairie. The 950 AM frequency has been home to many formats. KRSI was one of the first Top-40 stations in the Twin Cities in the late 1950s. While it was owned by Roy H. Park, KRSI carried one of its most popular formats, simulcasting with 104.1 KRSI-FM as Top 40 \\"All Request Radio,\\" between 1968 and 1972. Over the years the station has been through many formats, including: * MOR format \\"Music You Remember\\" (1958-1968) * Top 40 as \\"Request Radio\\" (1968-1973) (began 24-hour operation) * Country music (Automated Drake-Chenault \\"Great American Country\\") (1973-1979) * Rock/new wave (\\"Musicradio I-95\\") (1979-1980) * Adult standards (Music of Your Life, simulcast with KRSI-FM) (February 1980 – 1982) * Country music (SMN \\"County Coast To Coast\\") (1982-1984) * CHR (SMN \\"Rock America\\") \\"Hot Rock 950 KRSI\\" (1984-1985) * Oldies \\"Request Radio\\" (1985-1986) * Simulcast with FM as KJJO (1986-1988) * Urban AC (SMN \\"Heart And Soul\\") (1988) * Hard rock (Satellite Music Networks' \\"Z-Rock\\") as KZOW (1988-1990) * Business Radio Network (KJJO) (1990-1992) * Simulcast with FM (KJJO/KMJZ) (1992-1995) * R&B; oldies as KSGS (\\"ABC Solid Gold Soul\\" w/Local AM Drive) (\\"9-5-0 Solid Gold Soul\\") (1995-1999) * Urban Adult Contemporary (ABC \\"The Touch\\" w/Local AM Drive) (1999-2001) * Business Radio as KDOW, then KCCO (\\"Business 9-5-0\\") (2001-2004) * Talk as KSNB (2004-) AM 950 simulcast with co-owned 104.1 during a number of periods in its history. The station was running a combination format of news, sports and business news (as KDOW, KCCO, then KSNB) when it was sold by previous owner CBS Radio in 2004. The company that purchased KTNF was founded by Minnesota attorney Janet Robert and former Minnesota Congressman Bill Luther in November 2003, as a result of their concern about the impact right wing talk radio had in the 2002 elections and inspired by Sydney Blumenthal's book The Rise of the Counter-Establishment: The Conservative Ascent to Political Power. When Air America Radio made its debut on March 31, 2004, WMNN, where the group leased airtime, became one of the new network's original affiliates with Al Franken's show, as well as Democracy Radio's Ed Schultz. Eventually, more syndicated and local shows were added. After the sale of WMNN six months later, the format split to broadcasting on both 740 AM and 1530 AM. In October 2004, 950 AM was purchased, and became the permanent home of \\"Air America Minnesota\\". In the summer of 2004, the station was purchased by Janet Robert, former Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate for the US House of Representatives, to provide a local outlet for syndicated programming from the former Air America Radio network (the station was originally known as \\"Air America Minnesota\\"). The station has gotten more and more of its programs from Dial Global which syndicated The Stepanie Miller Show and The Bill Press Show. Along the way, Air America filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganizing under new investors. By the time Al Franken launched his Senate campaign, Air America was KTNF's source for The Thom Hartmann Show and a handful of weekend programs. Air America ceased operations in January 2010. ===Minnesota connections=== In the winter of 2005-2006, U.S. Senator Al Franken, a former St. Louis Park resident, moved his radio show from New York City to downtown Minneapolis, originating his show from studios in the Foshay Tower. ==Former Logos== Former KTNF logo and branding (as \\"Air America Minnesota\\").

The 2004 Ice Palace ==History== In 1885, a New York reporter wrote that Saint Paul was, \\"another Siberia, unfit for human habitation\\" in winter. Offended by this attack on their city, the Saint Paul Chamber of Commerce decided to prove not only that Saint Paul was habitable but that its citizens were very much alive during winter, their most dominant season. A Winter Carnival had been held over the border in Montreal with an ice castle in 1885. With a model to draw upon the Saint Paul Winter Carnival was created in 1886. It was followed by carnivals held in 1887, 1888 and 1896. The Carnival was held against in 1916 and 1917. There was another lapse until 1937 when they continued through 1942. WWII interrupted life in general, but the Carnival resumed in 1946. It remains an annual event today.St. Paul Winter Carnival Association Records The 1887 Ice Palace In 1886, King Boreas the First was crowned and the first Winter Carnival commenced. This festival also featured an ice palace, an elaborate creation made from the ice of Minnesota lakes, which has evolved into an internationally recognized icon for Saint Paul's festival. The event featured many activities including bobsledding and ice horse-racing. The former name uniquely and directly describes the activity as frozen lakes were used as race surfaces for sled-carts. The organizers say the event also served to bring the community closer together, including members of nearby Native American tribes. Many members of local tribes would ride into the city and pitch tents to participate in the Winter Carnival. Over the years the Carnival's Royalty has shown very little diversity. ==Today== Man examines a Winter Carnival ice sculpture. St. Paul Winter Carnival 2007 The Winter Carnival has grown over the years. The Royal Family fraternal organization makes over 400 appearances annually and participates in community activities around the Twin Cities Metro Area. As a community organization, the members of the Royal Family and Vulcan Krewe travel throughout the US and Canada visiting different communities and engaging in various festivals. They aim to promote community awareness and volunteerism and to support charitable causes. The Winter Carnival is held during January each year. It was not held during World War II out of respect for the conflict abroad. Currently the Winter Carnival runs the following events as part of the celebration: * Royal Coronation * Grand Day Parade * Jigsaw Puzzle Competition (Largest in the nation!) * Hotdish Competition * Family Day at Landmark Center * Kids' Day Presented by the YMCA * Frozen Family Fun Night * Snow Sculpting * Ice Sculpture Carving * Klondike Kate Cabarets * Historic Art Exhibit * Torchlight Parade * Winter Carnival Music Series * Ice Bars * And SOO Much MORE! ==Participating groups== ===Royal Family=== Tooth Fairies ice sculpture. (2008) The Royal Family is selected through each character's fraternal organization, and in the case of the queen and princesses, a pageant-style coronation. The Royal Family consists of: * King Boreas (a true king of the St Paul Winter Carnival) * Prime Minister * Aurora, Queen of the Snows * Captain of the King's Guard * Sergeant of the King's Guard * Titan, Prince of the North Wind * North Wind Princess * Euros, Prince of the East Wind * East Wind Princess * Zephyrus, Prince of the West Wind * West Wind Princess * Notos, Prince of the South Wind * South Wind Princess. (Ooh La La) * A minimum of four King's Guards; one each assigned to guard one of the four princesses. ===Vulcan Krewe=== The Vulcan Krewe is selected by the Order of Fire and Brimstone along with the new Fire King, Vulcanus Rex, each year. Each year a new Krewe is hand selected through an application and interview process. Selected Krewe members must complete a five-year commitment to become a full- fledged member of Fire and Brimstone. After a member's fifth year, that individual is then eligible to be a Fire King.SaintPaulVulcans.com history page. Retrieved 19 May 2009 ====Members of the Vulcan Krewe==== St Paul Winter Carnival button * Vulcanus Rex (The Vulc) - The True King of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival. Of all the members of the Krewe, he is the only one to wear red and black (all others wear only red). * General Flameous (Flame) - The Army Commander and Keeper of the flame. Legend says that if the flame dies, the Fire King dies and it will be winter forever. * The Duke of Klinker (Klinker) - The Fire King's aide-de-camp and the herder of the flock. The Klinker is the longest burning ember. * The Count of Ashes (Ash) - The raiser of sleeping spirits. The \\"swinger\\" of the Krewe. * The Prince of Soot (Sooty) - The recorder of past memories. The \\"ladies' man\\". Usually the oldest member of the Krewe. * Baron Hot Sparkus (Sparky) - Commander of the Lancer’s Legion and the Stoker of Emotions. The \\"spark plug\\" of the Vulcan Krewe. * Count Embrious (EB) - The Fire King’s Chancellor of the Exchequer. The young and romantic one. Usually the youngest member of the Krewe. * Grand Duke Fertilious (Ferty) - Minister of Propaganda and the propagator of progeny. Usually the member with the most children. ====Vulcan attire==== The Fire King running suit, the uniform In the early carnivals, when the Fire King ran alone, he wore typically kingly attire, crown and all, with heavy emphasis on the color red in the rest of the costume. In 1916, Ron Stewart, Vulcanus Rex I, wore a warm blanket coat with a wide sash and a headpiece with devil-type horns on it. This attire continued through 1939. Again, in 1940, Vulcanus Rex VI, E.R. Reiff, designed the basic running suit worn today. The horns were replaced by two feathers at the back of the head with a central fin running across the top of the head from front to back. In 1959 the feathers disappeared by order of Vulcanus Rex XXII, John Works. In February, 2012, Vulcanus Rex LXXV; Steve Robertson, began wearing a crown following the overthrow of Boreas to signify Vulcanus Rex as the Victorious King of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival. There are six primary pieces to the current running suit: the hat, the running suit, the cape, boots, gloves, goggles, and grease. ====The Knighting Ceremony==== These ceremonies were started in 1956. Every year, the Fire King \\"knights\\" hundreds of individuals. Special people are singled out by the king and his \\"Krewe\\" for this award. A knighting certificate consists of a \\"title\\" being bestowed, and a certificate being presented. Titles bestowed usually reflect the individual's special contribution to a community, company, club or organization, or family. ====The Royal Chariot==== The current fire engine being used by the Krewe was built in 1932 by Luverne Fire Apparatus of Luverne, Minnesota. Starting out in 1932 as Saint Paul Squad 1 and in 1940 becoming a reserve hose cart, it is believed to be the only one of its type left. The City of Saint Paul began allowing the Krewe to use this fire engine in the late 1950s. Over the years the fire engine has been rebuilt many times while maintaining most of the original body and frame. In 1996, Fire & Brimstone took over ownership and upkeep of the truck. ====The Order of Fire and Brimstone==== In the late 1940s some of the former Krewe members formed a group that included only former Vulcans. In 1958 it was made into a fully incorporated organization. Fire & Brimstone is run by a board of directors that is elected by the general membership at their annual meeting. This board's main objective is to provide support for the Vulcan Krewe and also to plan many activities and events for F&B; members and their families to attend throughout the year. ==Medallion hunt== Starting in 1952, each year during the carnival, there is an annual treasure hunt. The Saint Paul Pioneer Press prints in their newspaper 12 clues on 12 consecutive days. These clues point to a local park, where participants race to the park they think the clues point them towards, and start searching for the medallion. The clues are often cryptic until the 12th day, when people line up outside the newspaper offices, cell phones in hand and partners in parks, when the 12th clue gives them almost the exact location. The medallion has previously been hidden in a diaper, a White Castle hamburger box, a pop can, inside an Oreo cookie, and frozen in ice. The finders of the medallion are awarded up to $10,000 and receive a place of honor riding in the closing Torchlight Parade. ==Ice Palace== 1887 ice palace To date, the St. Paul Winter Carnival has built 37 Ice Palaces. Ice palaces have been built in 1886, 1887, 1888, 1896, 1917, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1986, 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2018, among other years. https://www.wintercarnival.com/events/ice-palaces/ Plop ==See also== * Winter festival ==References== ==External links== * The Official Saint Paul Winter Carnival website * The Official Site of Fire and Brimstone and the Vulcans * The Past Princess Association * The Former Queens Club * The Order of the Royal Guard * Cooler Crew Medallion Hunters * More Ice Carving Photos from years past * Documentary about the Saint Paul Pioneer Press Treasure Hunt * St. Paul Winter Carnival History - Minnesota Historical Society Category:Culture of Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Festivals in Minnesota Category:Tourist attractions in Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Winter festivals in the United States ","title":"Saint Paul Winter Carnival"},{"id":"2570049","text":"Mingus Ah Um is a studio album by American jazz musician Charles Mingus, released in October 1959 by Columbia Records. It was his first album recorded for Columbia. The cover features a painting by S. Neil Fujita. The title is a corruption of an imaginary Latin declension. It is common for Latin students to memorize Latin adjectives by first saying the masculine nominative (usually ending in \\"-us\\"), then the feminine nominative (\\"-a\\"), and finally the neuter nominative singular (\\"-um\\"). The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. ==Composition== The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD calls this album \\"an extended tribute to ancestors\\" (and awards it one of their rare crowns), and Mingus's musical forebears figure largely throughout. \\"Better Git It In Your Soul\\" is inspired by gospel singing and preaching of the sort that Mingus would have heard as a child growing up in Watts, Los Angeles, California, while \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" is a reference (by way of his favored headgear) to saxophonist Lester Young (who had died shortly before the album was recorded). The origin and nature of \\"Boogie Stop Shuffle\\" is self-explanatory: a twelve-bar blues with four themes and a boogie bass backing that passes from stop time to shuffle and back. \\"Self-Portrait in Three Colors\\" was originally written for John Cassavetes' first film as director, Shadows, but was never used (for budgetary reasons). \\"Open Letter to Duke\\" is a tribute to Duke Ellington, and draws on three of Mingus's earlier pieces (\\"Nouroog\\", \\"Duke's Choice\\", and \\"Slippers\\"). \\"Jelly Roll\\" is a reference to jazz pioneer and pianist Jelly Roll Morton and features a quote of Sonny Rollins' \\"Sonnymoon for Two\\" during Horace Parlan's piano solo. \\"Bird Calls\\", in Mingus's own words, was not a reference to bebop saxophonist Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker: \\"It wasn't supposed to sound like Charlie Parker. It was supposed to sound like birds – the first part.\\" \\"Fables of Faubus\\" is named after Orval E. Faubus (1910–1994), the Governor of Arkansas infamous for his 1957 stand against integration of Little Rock, Arkansas schools in defiance of U.S. Supreme Court rulings (forcing President Eisenhower to send in the National Guard). It is sometimes claimed that Columbia refused to allow the lyrics to be included on this album, though the liner notes to the 1998 reissue of the album state that the piece started life as an instrumental, and only gained the lyrics later (as can be heard on the 1960 release Presents Charles Mingus). ==Edited and Unedited Versions== The original Columbia Records LP release of the album featured edited versions of six of the nine compositions. For these tracks, from one to three minutes of the performances were removed, either to meet the playing time constraints of the LP format, or because producer Teo Macero felt the pieces were more effective in edited form. Unedited versions of these pieces were first released, on LP, in 1979. The first widely-available CD edition of the album, 1987's \\"Columbia Jazz Masterpieces\\" edition, used the original LP edits. The edited version has been reissued on compact disc subsequent to 1987, including a 2019 release by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. The unedited version of the album was first widely released on compact disc in 1998 as part of the Sony Legacy series, and it too has remained available through additional compact disc reissues. ==Reception== Mingus Ah Um was one of fifty recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry in 2003. ==50th Anniversary reissue== In 2009, Sony's Legacy Recordings released a special 2-disc 50th Anniversary Edition of Mingus Ah Um. In addition to the complete album, the Legacy Edition includes an alternative take of each of three tracks: \\"Bird Calls\\" (4:54), \\"Better Git It In Your Soul\\" (8:30), and \\"Jelly Roll\\" (6:41). The Legacy Edition of Mingus Ah Um also includes Mingus Dynasty, its companion album recorded later in 1959 (with unedited versions of five tracks shortened on the original LP release). ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Charles Mingus, except 12, composed by Sunny Clapp. Original LP track lengths are given within parentheses. # \\"Better Git It in Your Soul\\" – 7:23 # \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" – 5:44 (4:46) # \\"Boogie Stop Shuffle\\" – 5:02 (3:41) # \\"Self-Portrait in Three Colors\\" – 3:10 # \\"Open Letter to Duke\\" – 5:51 (4:56) # \\"Bird Calls\\" – 6:17 (3:12) # \\"Fables of Faubus\\" – 8:13 # \\"Pussy Cat Dues\\" – 9:14 (6:27) # \\"Jelly Roll\\" – 6:17 (4:01) ;Bonus tracks on later reissues # * \\"Pedal Point Blues\\" – 6:30 # \\"GG Train\\" – 4:39 # \\"Girl of My Dreams\\" – 4:08 ;Notes * * Tracks 1, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 recorded on May 5, 1959; tracks 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 12 recorded on May 12, 1959.

In Treviso, during his adolescence, he met and got to know the sculptor Arturo Martini who introduced him to the writings of Arthur Rimbaud and Friedrich Nietzsche. In 1915, he enlisted in the telegraph Corps of Engineers and participated in the Great War. Together with Gabriele d’Annunzio, he took part in the Fiume enterprise (1919-1920), an experience that would be fundamental to his development as a writer. The following years were years of travel, both along the Adriatic aboard a sailing ship with the sailors of Chioggia, and in Europe and North Africa on behalf of a number of important newspapers. He lived for long periods in Paris, between 1927 and 1928, with his friend the painter Filippo De PisisComisso, Il mio sodalizio con Filippo De Pisis, Vincenza, Neri Pozza, 1993. The following year, in 1929, as a special correspondent for the \\"Corriere della Sera\\", he completed the Grand Tour in the Far East visiting China, Japan and Russia from Siberia to Moscow. After much wandering he wanted to take root in the Veneto countryside and with the proceeds of the articles, on his return, he bought a house and fields in Zero Branco, a town in the Treviso area, while continuing to travel along Italy as a special correspondent for several newspapers. Here he experienced intense periods of writing and friendship and later learned of the bombing of Treviso, where the family home was destroyed. He closed the house in Zero Branco to return to live in Treviso only in 1954 after his mother's death. In his later years he continued to write and publish short stories and novels, in which there are detailed descriptions of despair, disappointments, anxieties and dislikes together with many ironic and bitter descriptions of man’s failings. \\"Our life today is reduced to these extremes from which serenity, beauty and harmony are excluded.” He died in hospital on January 21, 1969 == Works == ===Novels and Short Stories=== *Il porto dell'amore, Antonio Vianello, Treviso, 1924; rpt. as Al vento dell'Adriatico, Ribet, Torino 1928; Ed. di Treviso, Treviso 1953; Longanesi, Milano 1959 (rpt. again as Il porto dell'amore); Oscar Mondadori, 1983 (with an Introduction by Carlo della Corte); Longanesi, Milano 2011 (with a foreword by Nico Naldini) *Gente di mare, Treves, Milano 1928 (Premio Bagutta); Ed. di Treviso, Treviso 1953; Longanesi, Milano 1966 (Opere, 9); Neri Pozza, Vicenza 1994 (with a foreword by Naldini) *Giorni di guerra, Mondadori, 1930; Longanesi, Milano 1960 (Opere, 1); Oscar Mondadori, 1980 (with an Introduction by Mario Isnenghi) *Il delitto di Fausto Diamante, Ceschina, Milano 1933; Sodalizio del libro, Venezia 1958; Longanesi, Milano 1963 (with Storia di un patrimonio in Opere, 4); Neri Pozza, Vicenza 1995 *Storia di un patrimonio, Treves, Milano 1933; Mondadori, Milano 1956; Longanesi, Milano 1963 (Opere, 4); Neri Pozza, Vicenza 1995 (with Il delitto di Fausto Diamante) *Avventure terrene, Vallecchi, Firenze 1935 * I due compagni, Mondadori, Milano 1936; Longanesi, Milano 1973 (Opere, 13) *L'italiano errante per l'Italia, Parenti, Firenze 1937 *Felicità dopo la noia, Mondadori, Milano 1940 *Un inganno d'amore, Mondadori, Milano 1942 (including La ricchezza di Mario); rpt. as Un inganno d'amore e alcuni racconti, 1953 *La favorita, Mondadori, Milano 1945; Longanesi, Milano 1965 (Opere, 7) *I sentimenti nell'arte, Il tridente, Venezia 1945 *La terra e i contadini e altri racconti, with illustrations by Filippo de Pisis, Vallecchi, Firenze 1946; Galleria Pegaso, Forte dei Marmi 1993 *Capriccio e illusione, Mondadori, Milano 1947 *Amori d'oriente, Longanesi, Milano 1949; 1965 (Opere, 6); Fabbri, Milano 2006 (with a presentation by Mario Monti) *Gioventù che muore, Milano-Sera, Milano 1949; Roma, Gherardo Casini, 1965; Longanesi, Milano 1971 *Viaggi felici, Garzanti, Milano 1949; Longanesi, Milano 1966 (Opere, 8) *Le mie stagioni, Garzanti, Milano 1951; Longanesi, Milano 1963 (Opere, 3); ivi 1985 (with Viaggi felici e Donne gentili) (autobiographical) *Un gatto attraversa la strada, Mondadori, Milano 1954 (Premio Strega); Club degli editori, Milano 1969 (with a foreword by Guido Piovene); Utet, Torino 2006 *La mia casa di campagna, Longanesi, Milano 1958; 1968 (Opere, 10); 2008 (with an Introduction by Paolo Mauri) *Satire italiane, Longanesi, Milano 1960 (Opere, 2); 2008 (with an Introduction by Ernesto Ferrero) *La donna del lago, Longanesi, Milano 1962; 1968 (Opere, 12); Guanda, Parma 1993 (including Cribol) *Cribol, Longanesi, Milano 1964; 1968 (including La donna del lago in Opere, 12); Guanda, Parma 1993 (with La donna del lago) *Il grande ozio, Longanesi, Milano 1964 (Opere, 5); Libri Scheiwiller, Milano 1987 (Ed.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. ==Background== Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\". ==Description== The hill fort, which is approximately , and in height, covering , consists of a fairly large flat open area, roughly triangular in shape, that has been fortified by ramparts and shaping of the steep-sided hilltop around the northern, eastern and southwestern sides of the hill. It rises to an altitude of above sea level, and provides views over the lands it would have once commanded. From here, there are clear views north to Bristol, east to Bath and the Cotswold Hills, and south over Stanton Drew stone circles to Chew Valley Lake and the Mendip Hills. The underlying rocks are Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period. ==History== It is believed to have been built, around 250 BC, by the Dobuni who were one of the Celtic tribes living in the British Isles prior to the Roman invasion of Britain. The name Maes Knoll is derived from the Brythonic word maes meaning flat top, derived from Latin mensa meaning table., and Old English knoll or knowle meaning hill. The existing scarp slopes were steepened and, on the north-western edge of the fort is an earthen mound, known as Maes Knoll Tump, about above the rests of the fort defences, which is across and above a defensive ditch. The later Wansdyke runs west from it along the north side of Dundry Hill and south-east from it. During the Second World War, a draughty, rectangular, corrugated-iron hut on the top of the tump sheltered Dundry Home Guard soldiers, allowing them to watch for enemy aircraft and potential parachute or glider invasions of Bristol. The flat plateau immediately to the east of Maes Knoll tump had perhaps 50 stone cairns to deter enemy glider landings. ==See also== *List of hill forts and ancient settlements in Somerset ==References== * == External links == *Illustrated description * Category:Hill forts in Somerset Category:History of Somerset Category:Bath and North East Somerset Category:Neolithic settlements Category:Iron Age sites in England Category:Archaeological sites in Somerset Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Bath and North East Somerset ","title":"Maes Knoll"},{"id":"2570076","text":"Visitation, from Altarpiece of the Virgin by Jacques Daret, 1434-1435. Jacques Daret (c. 1404 – c. 1470) was an Early Netherlandish painter born in Tournai (Doornik; now in Belgium), where he would spend much of his life. Daret spent 15 years as a pupil in the studio of Robert Campin, alongside Rogier or Rogelet de le Pasture (assumed by scholars to be Rogier van der Weyden), and afterwards became a master in his own right. He became a favorite of the Burgundian court, and his patron for 20 years was the abbot of St. Vaast in Arras, Jean de Clercq. Though many works of Daret are mentioned in Jean de Clercq's account books, only four panels have survived: all are from the so-called Arras Altarpiece or Saint-Vaast Altarpiece, painted for the abbot between 1433 and 1435. These paintings show a striking resemblance to the Flemish realism of the Master of Flémalle. This is argued by most scholars to be evidence that the Master of Flémalle was Daret's master, Robert Campin. Daret features rather more in the art historical debates over his period than the merit of his work alone would justify because he is relatively well- documented, and in particular can be securely identified as the creator of the altarpiece mentioned above, as well as a pupil of Campin. The stylistic similarity between him and the Master of Flémalle is therefore crucial evidence in the identification of the latter with Campin. This then becomes an important connection in establishing a link between Robert Campin/the Master of Flémalle and his other major pupil, Rogier van der Weyden. ==Arras Altarpiece== Daret's four surviving securely identified works, all from the Arras Altarpiece, are the Visitation and Adoration of the Magi (both Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), the Nativity (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid), and the Presentation in the Temple (Petit Palais, Paris).

AO is the abbreviation of the German compound word (). Although it would be correctly written in one word, the Nazis chose an obsolete spelling with a hyphen. The party members who lived outside the German Reich were pooled in this special NSDAP department. On May 1, 1931 the new organizational unit was founded on the initiative of Reich Organization Leader () and its management was assigned to . But resigned from office on May 8, 1933, because he had become head of the Hamburg police authority, and later, a member of the Hamburg provincial government, whereupon Ernst Wilhelm Bohle was appointed director of the \\"AO\\", which served as the 43rd and only non-territorial of the NSDAP. Only actual citizens of the German Reich – () – with a German passport could become members of the AO. Persons of German descent, ethnic Germans (), who possessed the nationality of the country in which they lived, were refused entry to the National Socialist Party. ==History== In 1928, in Paraguay and in Brazil, party members abroad joined forces for the first time. Similar associations came into being in Switzerland and in the United States in 1930. These groups were officially accepted by the NSDAP only after the founding of the . On August 7, 1931 Local Group Buenos Aires was accepted. Shortly thereafter followed National Committee Paraguay (August 20, 1931) and Local Group Rio de Janeiro (October 5, 1931). From 1932 until its prohibition in 1934 there existed a national committee in the Union of South Africa, which enjoyed great popularity (see German Namibians) and maintained numerous offices in the former German South-West Africa (today Namibia). NSDAP Local Groups () included at least 25 party comrades (), while the so-called (, literally ) had five members or more. Furthermore, large Local Groups could be partitioned into Blocs (). Ideological training and congruity of all party comrades with the interests of the German nation were the principal tasks of the NSDAP/AO. It was assigned the mandate of uniting all NSDAP party members (and members of NSDAP-affiliated organizations) living abroad in a loosely affiliated group and to educate them in the philosophy, ideology and political programs of the NSDAP for the betterment of Germany. The AO was not a Fifth Column organization and had ten basic principles to be followed that included: # \\"Obey the laws of the country in which you are a guest. # \\"Let the citizens take care of the internal policy of the country where you are a guest; do not mix in these matters, even by way of conversation. # \\"Identify yourself to all, on all occasions, as an NSDAP party member. # \\"Always speak and act on behalf of the NSDAP movement, thus doing honor to the new Germany. Be honest, honorable, fearless and loyal. # \\"Look out for all your fellow Germans, men of your blood, style and being. Give them a hand, irrespective of their class. We are all creators of our people.\\" These and the other principles were intended to create a feeling of amiability towards Germans and Germany in general and hopefully convince as many foreigners as possible that the NSDAP was the right choice for Germany, and as result, the rest of the world. ==In the Dominican Republic== By the early 1940s, the NSDAP/AO had perhaps around 50 active members in the Dominican Republic, a relatively large number considering that the German-born population in the country stood at around 150 with an additional 300 persons of German descent. NSDAP had organized groups in five Dominican cities: , , , Cibao Valley and .Leonard, Thomas M., and John F. Bratzel. Latin America During World War II.

It is served by the and trains at all times, and by the train at all times except late nights. The station is adjacent to Pennsylvania Station, the busiest railroad station in the United States as well as a major transfer point to Amtrak, NJ Transit, and the Long Island Rail Road. ==History== The station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)'s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station, along with thirty-two other New York City Subway stations, underwent a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. Unlike other stations that were renovated under the initiative, 34th Street–Penn Station was not completely closed during construction. In January 2018, the NYCT and Bus Committee recommended that Judlau Contracting receive the $125 million contract for the renovations of 57th and 23rd Streets on the IND Sixth Avenue Line; 28th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line. However, the MTA Board temporarily deferred the vote for these packages after city representatives refused to vote to award the contracts. The contract was put back for a vote in February, where it was ultimately approved. These improvements were substantially completed by May 2019. ==Station layout== There are four tracks, two side platforms, and one island platform. Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line are the only other stations in the system with this configuration. There is no free transfer between this station and the station of the same name on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line, despite the fact that both connect to Penn Station. The nearest transfer location is at 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal with a free transfer to Times Square–42nd Street. South of the station, an additional track begins at a bumper block between the two express tracks with a connection to both at both ends (about 25th Street on the south end and 33rd Street on the north end). This allows for various extra movements of trains including storage or removal of a train with mechanical problems to be sent back in the other direction. It could also be used if 34th Street functioned as a terminal station. Like other subway stations, 34th Street–Penn Station includes black- and-white \\"sighting boards\\" for conductors to point and call, thereby indicating to the motorman that the train has stopped at the right position. On the downtown express platform, there is a blue-and-white sighting board for the R110B, a now-retired prototype New Technology Train whose conductor's cab was not aligned with any other fleet's conductors' cabs. This board is still extant and is one of a few publicly visible remnants of the R110B's operation. ===Exits=== 34th Street–Penn Station spans three streets (33rd, 34th, and 35th Streets) with a set of entrances/exits at all of these streets. For the purposes of this article, entrance and exit are interchangeable. * 35th Street: This is a part-time booth entrance. Each local platform has its own fare control. On the local platforms, there are High Entry-Exit Turnstiles for these exits at platform level. There is a narrow underpass connecting the platforms inside fare control.

The southbound platform has two street stairs to the northwest corner of 35th Street and Eighth Avenue, and one to the southwest corner. * 34th Street: This is a part-time booth entrance. Each local platform has its own fare control. There is an underpass connecting the platforms inside fare control, and it leads to the LIRR West Side Concourse outside of fare control. There is also a passageway providing out-of-system access to the station of the same name on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. The northbound platform has one street stair to each eastern corner of 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. The southbound platform has one street stair to each western corner of 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. There is a single elevator to the northbound platform at the southeastern corner of the intersection, connecting to that platform's fare control. Inside fare control, three elevators from each platform go down to the underpass. * 33rd Street: This is the full-time entrance, with token booths on both sides; the full-time booth is on the northbound platform. All three platforms have their own fare control. The underpass connecting the platforms is outside fare control. The northbound local platform's fare control leads to a street stair to the northeast corner of 33rd Street and 8th Avenue, as well as a direct passageway to the basement of Penn Station/Madison Square Garden.

Groves, USN (1917 - June 4, 1942) was a United States Navy aviator during World War II who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism in the Battle of Midway. ==Early life== Stephen William Groves was born on January 29, 1917 in Millinocket, Maine. He graduated from Schenck High School in East Millinocket, Maine, and received a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Maine in 1939. ==Navy career== Groves joined the U.S. Navy in December 1940 and was commissioned in August 1941. He boarded the aircraft carrier Hornet (CV-8) in December 1941. He was aboard Hornet when she transported Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle's bombers for the April 1942 Doolittle Raid on Japan, setting the stage for the Battle of Midway, considered one of the most crucial Allied victories of World War II. During that battle, Ensign Groves took off nine times from Hornet; his was one of six American fighters that fought off a vastly superior Japanese force that was trying to finish off the damaged carrier USS Yorktown (CV-5) on June 4, 1942. The small group of U.S. fighters was credited with shooting down 14 Japanese planes and causing six others to retreat. Groves was declared missing and presumed dead on June 5, 1942. Ensign Groves was the first Millinocket or East Millinocket serviceman to be killed in World War II. Groves' Navy Cross citation reads: > He fearlessly plunged into aerial combat against large formations of enemy > aircraft threatening the American carriers in the Battle of Midway. > Contributing decisively to the disruption of the enemy, he continued > determined counterattacks against desperate odds until, finally overcome by > sheer aerial superiority, he was shot down from the skies. He gallantly gave > his life to the fulfillment of a mission important to the great victory at > Midway. ==Commemoration== Today the American Legion Post in East Millinocket is named the Feeney-Groves Post, partially in his memory. During World War II, the destroyer escort USS Groves (DE-543) was named for Ensign Groves, but her construction was cancelled in 1944 before she could be launched. In 1981, the guided missile frigate USS Stephen W. Groves (FFG-29) was named in his honor at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. She was commissioned in Portland, Maine commission on April 17, 1982 and decommissioned at Naval Station Mayport, Florida on February 24, 2012. ==External links== * * Official website of USS Stephen W.

It was based on the book by Allan Ahlberg. It was directed by David Cobham with the screenplay by Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss who novelized the second, third and fourth series as Woof! The Tale Wags On, Woof! The Tale Gets Longer and Woof! A Twist in the Tale respectively. ==History== The show was first broadcast in 1989. It starred Liza Goddard as teacher Mrs Jessop. Edward Fidoe played Eric Banks, the boy who turned into a dog (played by Pippin from Come Outside) of the same name. It also starred Thomas Aldwinckle as Eric's best friend Roy Ackerman, and later Sarah Smart as his new best friend Rachel Hobbs, who moves into Roy's old house. Filming was interrupted for a while when Smart suffered a broken leg. The show generally featured weekly escapades to do with the dog power. In the third series of Eric's run of episodes, a start at a plot arc was developed, with Eric suspecting the transition is caused by adrenaline as it happens when he is hot or excited, and meeting up with an adult named Bruce Bentley (played by Anthony Head) who has the same affliction when Eric wonders if it ever happened to anyone else. In the first series Eric's condition is caused by his younger sister Emily wanting a dog. Eric stopped transforming after he bought her a dog but he started again with his friend Roy wanting one too. From Series Six which began airing in 1993, the episodes featured the adventures of Rex Thomas (played by Adam Roper) and his best friend Michael Tully (Monty Allan). Rex \\"inherits\\" Eric's \\"condition\\" when Eric is unlikely to turn into a dog again as stated in a cameo featuring Eric and Rachel at the start of series 6 to explain their absence from this point on. Lionel Jeffries guest-starred in Series 6 as Rex's Grandfather who is the only one in Rex's house who knows about his condition. In the final episode of series 8 he becomes Mrs Jessop's stepson after she marries his father, Ken (Owen Brenman). The ninth and final series, consisting of seven episodes, produced in 1996 but aired in January to February 1997. It featured Jim Walters (Sebastian Mahjouri), accompanied by his cousin Brian Barford (Jack Allen) and next door neighbour Carrie Howard (Faye Jackson) whose previous dog Beth had recently died and her desire for another dog causing Jim's condition shortly after he moved in. By the time the show ended, Liza Goddard was the only original cast member to feature through all nine series. The programme featured several well-known actors over the years. Leslie Grantham appeared in some episodes as Mr Garrett, a ruthless dog warden from the local dog pound. Stephen Fry appeared in one episode, as a cartoonist whose work is disrupted by Grandad and Rex. Others included Ruth Madoc, Anita Dobson, Penelope Keith, Leslie Phillips, John Ringham, Bill Pertwee, Julian Fellowes and Andrew Sachs.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143078/fullcredits/ Four dogs starred across the nine series. Pippin starred as Eric the dog in the first series. She also starred in Children's BBC programme Come Outside and a number of educational schools films. She was owned and trained by Ann Head and was the offspring of one of the dogs who played Benji. Tich was the second dog to play Eric starring in Series 2 to 5. Punch, a small white dog, played Rex the Dog. Tinka appeared as Jim the dog in the final series. Series 1 to 4 were filmed around the suburb of Moseley in Birmingham. For the later series, production moved to Nottingham and much location filming took place in and around West Bridgford, a suburb just south of Nottingham, Keyworth (a large village, 7 miles south of Nottingham) and various other Nottinghamshire towns. The change in location is explained by having Eric's family move to get a bigger house with his mother expecting twins. The school used during filming is Wilford Meadows Comprehensive located in Wilford. The school has since been demolished and a new school (The Nottingham Emmanuel School) was built on the land. The show was broadcast in Australia at 6:50am on weekdays on 7TWO from April 2010. ==Series guide== With Edward Fidoe *Series 1: 4 episodes - 18 February 1989 – 11 March 1989 *Series 2: 7 episodes - 23 November 1989 – 11 January 1990 *Series 3: 8 episodes - 20 February 1991 – 17 April 1991 *Series 4: 7 episodes - 10 January 1992 – 21 February 1992 with Adam Roper *Series 5: 6 episodes - 7 October 1992 – 11 November 1992 *Series 6: 10 episodes - 13 October 1993 – 15 December 1993 *Series 7: 10 episodes - 12 October 1994 – 14 December 1994 *Series 8: 10 episodes - 5 October 1995 – 14 December 1995 With Sebastian Mahjouri *Series 9: 7 episodes - 8 January 1997 – 19 February 1997 ==Home video releases== The series was released in the United Kingdom on VHS but, despite being a British programme, it has never been released beyond that in the UK.

The mountains of the northern, German, part are called the Zittau Mountains. == Geography == The Lausche, viewed from the north The range is among the westernmost extensions of the Sudetes, which stretch along the border between the historic region of Silesia in the north, and Bohemia and Moravia in the south up to the Moravian Gate in the east, where they join the Carpathian Mountains. The northwestern foothills of the Lusatian Mountains are called the Lusatian Highlands; in the southwest the range borders on the České Středohoří mountains. The range is largely made up of sandstone sedimentary rocks leaning on a Precambrian crystalline basement. The northern ridge is marked by the Lusatian Fault, a geological disturbance zone separating the Bohemian sandstones from the Lusatian granodiorite. During the Tertiary volcanic magma streams broke through the sandstone layer and solidified into basalt and phonolite.

The series was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling who together subsequently devised Crossroads. In contrast to the kitchen sink realism of Coronation Street, Compact was a distinctly middle-class serial, set in the more \\"sophisticated\\" arena of magazine publishing. An early \\"avarice\\" soap, it took the viewer into the business workplace, and aligned the professional lives of the characters with more personal storylines. The show was scheduled for broadcast on Tuesdays and Thursdays, thus avoiding a clash with ITV's Coronation Street on Mondays and Wednesdays. ==Synopsis == When Compact began, the editor was female, Joanne Minster (Jean Harvey), yet it was not long before she was replaced by Ian Harmon (Ronald Allen), the son of the magazine's owner. Despite being largely criticised by reviewers, Compact was popular with the general public, and in 1964 a regular omnibus edition was introduced, broadcast on Sundays. Morris Barry, a some-time actor and BBC director – he directed several Doctor Who stories in the 1960s – took over as producer and was given a brief to spice the series up in view of the criticism it had received from the national press. But the BBC, not then comfortable with the concept of soap opera, quietly dropped the series in 1965. ==Cast == When the series ended, the cast members appeared in other popular programmes, Ronald Allen was a regular in the soap opera Crossroads between 1969 and 1985. Australian actor Vincent Ball also featured in Crossroads. Marcia Ashton, who played Lily, appeared in soap opera Brookside many years later. Carmen Silvera played the role of Madame Edith Artois in the sitcom 'Allo 'Allo from 1982 to 1992. The director David Giles had a distinguished television career.

The club takes its name from Friar Tuck's, an Uptown New Orleans local gathering hole and pub, where two college students decided to create their own Carnival krewe after unsuccessfully trying to become white flambeaux carriers. The parade has grown from a small nighttime parade of pick-up trucks and boats pulled on trailers, into a procession of major proportions. In 1983 the parade became a daytime event and in 1986 the parade route finally stretched to downtown. Past Kings include John Candy and Eugene Levy. Notable riders have included The Blues Brothers, WWF Wrestlers, MTV's: The Real World New Orleans Cast, and Rob Dyrdek, from MTV's fantasy factory. ==Membership== Krewe of Tucks admits both men and women stating the only requirement for membership is a desire to put on a magnificent show for the crowds. Even though the club has grown in size and stature with 1800+ riders, Tucks has not lost its sense of humor and maintains an \\"Animal House\\" reputation. ==Parade== The Krewe of Tucks parades during New Orleans Mardi Gras, on the Saturday before Mardi Gras. The parade begins on Napoleon Avenue parading down St. Charles Avenue and ends on Canal Street where the post- parade blowout, the Tucks Extravaganza, kicks into high gear. ===Parade themes=== Krewe of Tucks parade themes are known for irreverence and satire.

Collectible throws include the Tucks emblem beads, stuffed animals, signature beads, light-up medallion beads, custom print go-cups, three different types of doubloons, stuffed toilet paper doll, toilet sunglasses, and hand decorated toilet bowl brushes. Leading up to parade day Krewe of Tucks hosts several events, fundraisers, and community service projects throughout the city for members to attend. Most notably, the Tucks has partnered with Magnolia Community Services, an organization and school dedicated to helping special needs students work with Tucks in designing Signature Throw Items. In 2017, the students from Magnolia created over 10,000 hand decorated Plungers which went into the hands of all Mardi Gras Revilers on parade day. ==Tucks Extravaganza== Tucks Extravaganza is a post-parade party inside the Marriott Grand Ball Room on Canal street that includes live music, food, drink, and dancing. It is open to the public by paid admission and attire is costumed (preferred) or casual. ==Tucks Coronation== Tucks Coronation Ball is a Carnival ball to coronate the new king and queen for the upcoming parade.

The Troupe does not, however, perform silent mime, but each year creates an original musical comedy that combines aspects of Commedia dell'Arte, melodrama, and broad farce with topical political themes. The group was awarded the Regional Theatre Award at the 41st Tony Awards. ==History== ===Origins=== The group was founded in 1959 by R. G. Davis as a medium of expression of his divergent theatrical concepts. The group debuted with Mime and Word (1959) and The 11th Hour Mime Show (1960).Performed at the Encore Theater after shows by the Actors Workshop of San Francisco, where \\"Ronnie\\" Davis was working on the staff. However, by 1961, the group transitioned to the Commedia dell'Arte format to more thoroughly comment on perceived political repression in the United States of America, the growing American Civil Rights Movement and military and covert intervention abroad. In the mid-1960s the group started to rely less on the direct Commedia dell'Arte format and transitioned into a more rambunctious, satirical style. It also began integrating elements of Jazz into its musical composition, eventually leading to the inclusion of a jazz band within the troupe. The group gained significant notoriety for its free performances in Golden Gate Park and numerous altercations with law enforcement. By the early 1970s, the Troupe had earned a reputation for opposing capitalism, sexism, and war. ===Post-Davis history=== In the early '70s Davis left the Troupe when it re-formed as a collective, the members of which operate as the Artistic Director, at which time the Troupe produced one of its most successful shows, The Independent Female (1970). In the 1980s, the group's productions retaliated against the Reagan administration. Some of the Troupe's popular shows include: * Factwino meets The Moral Majority (1981), in which Factwino, an alcoholic superhero that became a recurring protagonist, bestowed wisdom upon prominent icons, such as Jerry Falwell * Steel Town (1984) characterized the plight of steel workers and the decline of steel manufacture in the U.S. For this production, the troupe toured the Midwest, primarily in factory cities. * The Minstrel Show or Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel, which satirized entrenched attitudes among liberals and bigots during the Civil Rights StruggleWhich, when professor Keith Fowler booked it into Massachusetts' Williams College in 1968, elicited comments from the opening night crowd of \\"I've been raped!\\" The next day a panel discussion was held in which professor Paul Gray of Bennington College thrust a KKK hood over his head and shouted, \\"If any of them M--F--s comes near my wife, I'll kill him!\\" * Seeing Double, about a two-state solution in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict * Ripped VanWinkle which explores the gap between the optimism of 1968 and the 1988 reality. * Offshore, about the real cost of globalization * Eating It, about genetic engineering and profit driven science * 1600 Transylvania Avenue, about corporate government feeding on public wealth * GodFellas, a farce exposing the dangers of fundamentalism to democracy * Making a Killing, about war propaganda and the plight of Iraqis contaminated by depleted uranium * , or Death of the Worker, which juxtaposes the stories of workers taking over two factories - one in Argentina and one in the U.S. - and poses the question: why are American workers fighting for a seat at the table? Why not fight for the whole table? As well as the park-based shows, the Mime Troupe also tours nationally and internationally, having performed throughout Europe, Asia, South and Central America, and has won several awards. The group also facilitates community workshops. They are a nonprofit organization. The season traditionally starts on Fourth of July weekend and ends on Labor Day weekend. Early Mime Troupers include Joe Bellan, Saul Landau, Arthur Holden, Nina Serrano, Steve Reich, John Connell, Robert Nelson, William T. Wiley, Sandra Archer, Robert Hudson, Wally Hedrick, Judy North, Jerry Jump, Fred Hayden, Victoria Hochberg, Joaquin Aranda, Esteban Oropezo and John Broderick. Posters for several of the 1970s productions were designed by Jane Norling, and are accessible online. Later veterans include Arthur Holden, Sharon Lockwood, Peter Coyote, Luis Valdez, Barry Shabaka Henley, Bruce Barthol, Joan Holden, Joan Mankin, Melody James, Andrea Snow, Daniel Chumley, Marie Acosta, Jael Weisman, Jim Haynie, John Robb, Emmett Grogan, Bill Graham, and Ed Holmes. The current San Francisco Mime Troupe Collective comprises Rotimi Agbabiaka, Michael Bello, Velina Brown, Ellen Callas, Hugo E Carbajal, Michael Carreiro, Marie Cartier, Lisa Hori-Garcia, Taylor Gonzalez, Keiko Shimosato Carreiro, Daniel Savio, Gene Sullivan. ==Awards== In 1987, the troupe's Brechtian style of guerrilla theatre earned them a special Tony Award for Excellence in Regional Theater. Red State, the Troupe's 2008 fable about a small Midwest town that, after years of being ignored, demands accountability for their tax dollars, was nominated for a San Francisco Bay Area Theater Critic's Award for Best New Script, as was their 2009 production, Too Big to Fail, which detailed how credit and the philosophy of profit at all costs trap mesmerized citizens in a cycle of debt, while endlessly enriching the capitalists who cast the spell. ==Productions== * 1959: Mime And Word * 1960: 11th Hour Mime Show * 1961: Act without Words * 1961: Event I * 1961: Purgatory and Krapp's Last Tape * 1962: The Dowry * 1963: Ubu King * 1963: Event II * 1963: Film: Plastic Haircut * 1963: Ruzante's Maneuvers * 1963: The Root * 1964: Chorizos * 1964: Event III * 1964: Mimes and Movie * 1965: Tartuffe * 1965: The Exception and the Rule * 1965: Candelaio * 1965: Chronicles of Hell * 1965: Civil Rights * 1965: Jim Crow in a Cracker Barrel * 1966: The Miser * 1966: Film: Mirage And Centerman * 1966: Jack Off! * 1966: Olive Pits * 1966: Search & Seizure * 1966: What's That Ahead? * 1967: L'Amant Militaire * 1967: The Condemned * 1967: The Minstrel Show or Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel * 1967: The Vaudeville Show * 1968: Gutter Puppets (Meter Maid) * 1968: Little Black Panther * 1968: Ruzzante or the Veteran Gorilla Marching Band is Formed * 1969: The Congress of Whitewashers or Turandot * 1969: The Third Estate * 1970: Ecoman * 1970: Los Siete * 1970: Seize the Time * 1970: Telephone Man or Ripping off Ma Bell * 1970: The Independent Female * 1971: Clown Show * 1971: The Dragon Lady's Revenge * 1972: American Dreamer * 1972: Frozen Wages * 1972: High Rises * 1972: The Dragon Lady's Revenge * 1973: The Mother * 1973: San Francisco Scandals of 1973 * 1974: The Great Air Robbery * 1975: Frijoles or Beans To You * 1975: Power Play * 1976: False Promises * 1976: Nos Enganaron * 1977: Hotel Universe * 1978: Elektrobucks * 1979: Can't Pay?

The \\"dock\\" consisted of a scaffold for hanging. Its last executions were in 1830. ==History== Wax figure of a pirate hanged at Execution Dock. Madame Tussauds, London The British Admiralty's legal jurisdiction was for all crimes committed at sea. The dock symbolised that jurisdiction by being located just beyond the low-tide mark in the river. Anybody who had committed crimes on the seas, either in home waters or abroad, would eventually be brought back to London and tried by the High Court of the Admiralty. Capital punishment was applied to acts of mutiny that resulted in death, for murders on the High Seas, and specific violations of the Articles of War governing the behaviour of naval sailors, including sodomy. Those sentenced to death were usually brought to Execution Dock from Marshalsea Prison (although some were also transported from Newgate Prison). The condemned were paraded across London Bridge and past the Tower of London. The procession was led by the High Court Marshal (or his deputy) on horseback. He carried a silver oar that represented the authority of the Admiralty. Prisoners were transported in a cart to Wapping; with them was a chaplain who encouraged them to confess their sins. Just like the execution procession to Tyburn, condemned prisoners were allowed to drink a quart of ale at a public house on the way to the gallows. An execution at the dock usually meant that crowds lined the river's banks or chartered boats moored in the Thames to get a better view of the hanging. Executions were conducted by the hangmen who worked at either Tyburn or Newgate Prison. With a particular cruelty reserved for those convicted of acts of piracy, hanging was done with a shortened rope. This meant a slow death from strangulation on the scaffold as the drop was insufficient to break the prisoner's neck. It was called the Marshal's dance because their limbs would often be seen to 'dance' from slow asphyxiation. Unlike hangings on land, such as at Tyburn, the bodies of pirates at Execution Dock were not immediately cut down following death. Customarily, these corpses were left hanging until at least three tides had washed over their heads. This practice stopped at the end of the 18th century. In the cases of the most notorious offenders, the Admiralty would order that their bodies be tarred and hung in chains at either Cuckold's Point or Blackwall Point, on the River Thames, as a warning to all seafarers of the fate awaiting those who turned to piracy.Hanging in Chains By Albert Hartshorne, Pages 73-75, , An account from The Gentleman's Magazine, dated 4 February 1796, gives a vivid portrayal of a typical execution at London's Execution Dock. > This morning, a little after ten o'clock, Colley, Cole, and Blanche, the > three sailors convicted of the murder of Captain Little, were brought out of > Newgate, and conveyed in solemn procession to Execution Dock, there to > receive the punishment awarded by law. On the cart on which they rode was an > elevated stage; on this were seated Colley, the principal instigator in the > murder, in the middle, and his two wretched instruments, the Spaniard > Blanche, and the Mulatto Cole, on each side of him; and behind, on another > seat, two executioners. Colley seemed in a state resembling that of a man > stupidly intoxicated, and scarcely awake, and the two discovered little > sensibility on this occasion, nor to the last moment of their existence, did > they, as we hear, make any confession. They were turned off about a quarter > before twelve in the midst of an immense crowd of spectators. On the way to > the place of execution, they were preceded by the Marshall of the Admiralty > in his carriage, the Deputy Marshall, bearing the silver oar, and the two > City Marshals on horseback, Sheriff's officers, etc. The whole cavalcade was > conducted with great solemnity.The Gentleman's Magazine, 4th February 1796 The infamous Captain Kidd, who had been convicted of piracy and murder, was taken from Newgate Prison and executed at the dock in 1701. During his execution, the rope broke and Kidd was hanged on the second attempt. His remains were gibbeted by the river Thames at Tilbury for three years.^ \\"A brief history of piracy\\". Royal Navy Museum. Retrieved 23 June 2011. George Davis and William Watts, convicted for piracy for the Cyprus mutiny, were the final hangings at the dock on 16 December 1830. ==Location== Rocque's map of 1746 showing location of Execution Dock Stairs at Wapping, London Some sources state there is a large \\"E\\" on the Thames side of the building at Swan Wharf, indicating the site of Execution Dock.Macdonald, Guy.

After he graduated with a degree in philosophy, he collaborated with such newspapers as Il Leonardo of Giovanni Papini and La Voce of Giuseppe Prezzolini. After that, he obtained the chair of theoretical philosophy at the University of Pisa. Attracted by politics, he was elected three times to the Italian Chamber of Deputies for Salerno. In the 1910s, Amendola supported the Italian liberal movement, but he was completely against the ideology of Giovanni Giolitti. During World War I, he adopted a position of democratic irredentism and, at the end of the war, was nominated minister by Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti. His critical positions while confronting the right-wing extremism cost him a series of attacks by hired Fascist killers. In 1924 Amendola refused to adhere to the \\"Listone Mussolini\\", and attempted to become Prime Minister, at the head of a liberal coalition which ran in the elections. He was defeated, but continued the democratic battle by writing columns for the Il Mondo, a new daily newspaper which he founded together with other intellectuals. Amendola is probably most famous for his publishing of the Rossi Testimony on 27 December 1924, during the height of the Matteotti Crisis, in one of his newspapers. The document directly implicated Prime Minister Mussolini in the murder of Giacomo Matteotti (leader of the Socialist PSU party) on the 10 June 1924, as well as declaring that he (Mussolini) was behind the reign of terror which led up to the 1924 general elections (held 6 April). Resented by Benito Mussolini for his prominent activism, Amendola was, together with the Unitary Socialist Party deputy Giacomo Matteotti and the popular priest Don Giovanni Minzoni, one of the régime's earliest victims: he died in April, 1926 at Cannes in agony from violence inflicted by 15 Blackshirts with clubs in July, 1925. His son, Giorgio Amendola, was an important communist writer and politician. In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Amendola is played by Damiano Damiani. ==External links== * Category:1882 births Category:1926 deaths Category:People from Naples Category:Democratic Liberal Party (Italy) politicians Category:Deputies of Legislature XXV of the Kingdom of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XXVI of the Kingdom of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XXVII of the Kingdom of Italy Category:Politicians of Campania Category:Italian journalists Category:Italian male journalists Category:Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals Category:1926 crimes Category:Assassinated Italian politicians Category:Italian people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in France Category:Terrorism deaths in France Category:Italian anti-fascists Category:Italian exiles Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Giovanni Amendola"},{"id":"2570182","text":"Willys Overland Crossley was a company jointly owned by Crossley Motors and Willys-Overland. They had factories in Stockport, England; Berlin, Germany; and Antwerp, Belgium. The company was formed in 1919 and continued until 1934. They manufactured cars, buses and trucks. In 1919, Crossley Motors and John North Willys on behalf of Willys-Overland agreed to set up a British operation to import, manufacture and sell a high volume of cars based on the Overland 4 model. Crossley Motors provided the Heaton Chapel, Stockport aircraft factory they had recently bought from the government after the end of World War 1. This factory was large enough to include a covered test track. Production started in 1920 with the assembly of kits bought in from the Willys-Overland Canadian plant. WOC's first design contribution was to offer British bodies to fit the Model 4's chassis. The Willys-Knight sleeve-valve-engined car was also offered. In 1925, a version of the Willys-Overland Model 91 called the Overland 13.9 was produced using a Morris engine. This was joined later in the year by the six-cylinder Model 93. Sales did not reach expectations, and the company reported a large loss for the year. The company structure meant that responsibility for this loss fell on Crossley Motors, who had to sell the AVRO aircraft company to keep going. For 1926, the Whippet car was introduced, but like its forerunners, this car did not suit the British and European markets, and sales still failed to meet target. The company experimented with their own design of small car known as the X car. Prototypes were well received, but production was vetoed by John North Willys. A 1927 Willys Overland Crossley lorry The company also produced commercial vehicles. First models were built on Model 4 chassis but in 1924 Heaton Chapel designed their own 1 ton model using mainly Overland parts. This was replaced in 1926 by an upgraded 30cwt version. In 1926 a new range using Lycoming engines was announced and these were launched under the Manchester name. Initial models were rated at 25 and 35 cwt but were soon joined by a 2-ton model. WOC also assembled Willys C101 trucks sold as Willys-Commercial but these soon gained a poor reputation for engine reliability. In 1928, the Berlin factory opened under the ownership of Willys-Overland Crossley GmbH to assemble Whippets followed in 1930 by a plant in Antwerp. The depression caused both factories to close in 1930. The Berlin factory re-opened quickly to become an assembly plant for Austin 7's. John North Willys sold his shares in the company in 1929 and resigned from the board. Following continuing losses on car production this was stopped in 1929 to concentrate on the profitable commercials. In 1931, the car business of AJS was purchased but it was too late to turn the company into profitability and, in 1932, Crossley Motors dissolved the partnership with Willys-Overland and WOC went into voluntary liquidation in 1933. Production limped on for another two years with the final production coming in 1934. The factory was sold to Fairey aviation. ==References== Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1919 Category:1919 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Willys Overland Crossley"},{"id":"2570200","text":"In computer programming, an opaque pointer is a special case of an opaque data type, a data type declared to be a pointer to a record or data structure of some unspecified type. Opaque pointers are present in several programming languages including Ada, C, C++, D and Modula-2. If the language is strongly typed, programs and procedures that have no other information about an opaque pointer type T can still declare variables, arrays, and record fields of type T, assign values of that type, and compare those values for equality. However, they will not be able to de-reference such a pointer, and can only change the object's content by calling some procedure that has the missing information. Opaque pointers are a way to hide the implementation details of an interface from ordinary clients, so that the implementation may be changed without the need to recompile the modules using it. This benefits the programmer as well since a simple interface can be created, and most details can be hidden in another file. This is important for providing binary code compatibility through different versions of a shared library, for example. This technique is described in Design Patterns as the Bridge pattern. It is sometimes referred to as \\"handle classes\\", the \\"Pimpl idiom\\" (for \\"pointer to implementation idiom\\"), \\"Compiler firewall idiom\\",Herb Sutter. The Joy of Pimpls (or, More About the Compiler-Firewall Idiom) \\"d-pointer\\" or \\"Cheshire Cat\\", especially among the C++ community. == Examples == === Ada === package Library_Interface is type Handle is limited private; \\\\-- Operations... private type Hidden_Implementation; -- Defined in the package body type Handle is access Hidden_Implementation; end Library_Interface; The type \`Handle\` is an opaque pointer to the real implementation, that is not defined in the specification. Note that the type is not only private (to forbid the clients from accessing the type directly, and only through the operations), but also limited (to avoid the copy of the data structure, and thus preventing dangling references). package body Library_Interface is type Hidden_Implementation is record ... -- The actual implementation can be anything end record; \\\\-- Definition of the operations... end Library_Interface; These types are sometimes called \\"Taft types\\"—named after Tucker Taft, the main designer of Ada 95—because they were introduced in the so-called Taft Amendment to Ada 83. === C === /* obj.h */ struct obj; /* * The compiler considers struct obj an incomplete type. Incomplete types * can be used in declarations. */ size_t obj_size(void); void obj_setid(struct obj *, int); int obj_getid(struct obj *); /* obj.c */ #include \\"obj.h\\" struct obj { int id; }; /* * The caller will handle allocation. * Provide the required information only */ size_t obj_size(void) { return sizeof(struct obj); } void obj_setid(struct obj *o, int i) { o->id = i; } int obj_getid(struct obj *o) { return o->id; } This example demonstrates a way to achieve the information hiding (encapsulation) aspect of object-oriented programming using the C language. If someone wanted to change the definition of \`struct obj\`, it would be unnecessary to recompile any other modules in the program that use the \`obj.h\` header file unless the API was also changed. Note that it may be desirable for the functions to check that the passed pointer is not \`NULL\`, but such checks have been omitted above for brevity. === C++ === /* PublicClass.h */ #include class PublicClass { public: PublicClass(); // Constructor PublicClass(const PublicClass&); // Copy constructor PublicClass(PublicClass&&); // Move constructor PublicClass& operator=(const PublicClass&); // Copy assignment operator PublicClass& operator=(PublicClass&&); // Move assignment operator ~PublicClass(); // Destructor // Other operations... private: struct CheshireCat; // Not defined here std::unique_ptr d_ptr_; // Opaque pointer }; /* PublicClass.cpp */ #include \\"PublicClass.h\\" struct PublicClass::CheshireCat { int a; int b; }; PublicClass::PublicClass() : d_ptr_(std::make_unique()) { // Do nothing. } PublicClass::PublicClass(const PublicClass& other) : d_ptr_(std::make_unique(*other.d_ptr_)) { // Do nothing. } PublicClass::PublicClass(PublicClass&& other) = default; PublicClass& PublicClass::operator=(const PublicClass &other;) { *d_ptr_ = *other.d_ptr_; return *this; } PublicClass& PublicClass::operator=(PublicClass&&) = default; PublicClass::~PublicClass() = default; The d-pointer pattern is one of the implementations of the . It is commonly used in C++ classes due to its advantages (noted below). A d-pointer is a private data member of the class that points to an instance of a structure. This method allows class declarations to omit private data members, except for the d-pointer itself.Using a d-Pointer — Why and how KDE implements opaque pointers As a result, * more of the class implementation is hidden * adding new data members to the private structure does not affect binary compatibility * the header file containing the class declaration only needs to include those files needed for the class interface, rather than for its implementation. One side benefit is that compilations are faster because the header file changes less often. Note, possible disadvantage of d-pointer pattern is indirect member access through pointer (in example, pointer to object in dynamic storage), which is sometimes slower than access to plain, not-a-pointer member. The d-pointer is heavily used in the Qt and KDE libraries. == See also == * Application binary interface * Handle (computing) * Programming idiom * Private class data pattern == References == == External links == * The Pimpl idiom * Compilation Firewalls * The Fast Pimpl Idiom * D-Pointers -- KDE TechBase * When you \\"XOR the pointer with a random number\\", the result is a \\"really opaque\\" pointer . * Making Pimpl Easy, Vladimir Batov Category:Data types Category:C++ Category:Articles with example C++ code Category:Computer programming ","title":"Opaque pointer"},{"id":"2570206","text":"Power Plant Live! in 2017 Power Plant Live! is a collection of bars, restaurants and other businesses in the Inner Harbor section of downtown Baltimore, Maryland.

The complex is located along Market Place and is served by the Baltimore Metro Subway's Shot Tower/Market Place station. ==History== The \\"Power Plant\\" is a mixed-use project re- developed in the late 1990s in a former coal-burning power generating station, originally built in 1900-05 for the old United Railways and Electric Company which operated the recently unified public transportation system of streetcars, trolleys, and some cable cars (in the early years), at the beginning of the 20th century up to its re-organization in 1935 as the Baltimore Transit Company (taken over by the state Mass Transit Administration of the Maryland Department of Transportation in 1968). The President of the U. R. & E. Company at the time was John Mifflin Hood, (1843-1906), who was also recently longtime president of the Western Maryland Railway, 1874 to 1901 and developed its large Port Covington railroad/port terminal on the south side of the city, along the Middle Branch (formerly Ferry Branch) of the Patapsco River in Baltimore Harbor on the South Baltimore peninsula to Whetstone Point.

These new attractions, joined with the recently constructed (1971) of a new exhibition structure for the ancient cultural institution Maryland Academy of Sciences (from 1797) in its Maryland Science Center and the historic ship USS Constellation (1854 Sloop of War) This was also the historic site of the original Centre Market at East Baltimore Street (formerly \\"Long Street\\" when the town was laid out in 1730, and later known as \\"Market Street\\", recognizing the important place that it led to in the east), south to Water Street (former original shoreline of the harbor \\"Basin\\" in colonial times) and east of South Frederick Street (alley) to the adjacent Jones Falls stream. It was also traditionally known as the \\"Marsh Market\\" because of being on the site of the old Thomas \\"Harrison's Marsh\\" on the western banks of the Jones Falls during the colonial era 18th and early 19th centuries which separated old Baltimore Town from the neighboring village of Jones' Town to the northeast across the Falls - spanned by a vital link in early 18th century local commerce and growth, a wooden bridge which was built which resulted in the naming of \\"Bridge Street\\" (later to be renamed North Gay Street, after a local family) and led to the merger of the two villages by 1745. Here in 1763, the first public market house for both merged towns was constructed and became the most important center for commerce resulting in its original name of \\"Centre Market\\". It wasn't until two decades later, after the American Revolution ended, that additional market houses throughout the expanding city were constructed including today's world-famous \\"Lexington Market\\" (old Western Precincts Market) along West Lexington Street between Eutaw, Paca and Greene Streets in 1782 and the \\"Broadway Market\\" (old Eastern Precincts Market) at the foot of Broadway - formerly known there too as Market Street (between Fleet [previously Canton Avenue] and Thames Streets) above the waterfront of the Fells Point neighborhood. During the 19th century, additional market houses under sponsorship of the municipal government were constructed in all quarters of the growing city such as \\"Hanover Market\\", \\"Belair Market\\", \\"Richmond Market\\", \\"Lafayette Market\\" (now \\"The Avenue Market\\"), \\"Hollins Market\\", \\"Northeast Market\\", \\"Cross Street Market\\", \\"North Avenue Market\\" and others which dominated local trade, especially retail, but the most important, largest and center of the trade (including wholesale) was here at \\"Centre Market\\" on Market Place along the Jones Falls west bank. Here also was the old second building of the famous Maryland Institute (then a college founded 1826, of various curriculums including mechanical arts besides today's art and design for which it is now world-famous), which was built on brick arches above a second markethouse with two large clock towers at each end in 1851, and held an additional large assembly hall/auditorium and classrooms on the second floor. This was one of the largest and notable buildings in America at that time, and was the site of several pre-Civil War national political party conventions (when Baltimore preceded Chicago as the common compromise city for presidential nominations, where both candidates Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce were nominated to be President. Another famous President, Abraham Lincoln gave his \\"Liberty Speech\\" (also known as the \\"Baltimore Address\\") on April 18, 1864, at the \\"Sanitary Fair\\" event, one of several held throughout the Civil War-torn nation, to raise money for the support and assistance of wounded soldiers, widows and orphans and other domestic needs by the United States Sanitary Commission, (a precursor to the later American Red Cross). Although he passed through Baltimore numerous times, it was the only occasion that the 16th President spoke in the city. He noted the calmer differences in the southern-oriented city, especially then three years after the secessionist tumult resulting in the disastrous Pratt Street Riots of April 19, 1861 which had solidified Baltimore's reputation and nickname as \\"Mobtown.\\" It was also the only time that he spoke alive in the city although having traveled through several times in his earlier brief congressional career and presidential administration. The Maryland Institute and the second markethouse below was unfortunately destroyed and lost near the end of the Great Baltimore Fire of February 7–8, 1904, on the eastern edge of the blaze along with the rest of the downtown Baltimore business district in the Nation's third largest conflagration ever to hit an American city (Chicago's Great Fire of 1871 was first, followed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire). During the general mass re-construction of the city's \\"Burnt District\\" in the next few years, three new three-story elaborate brick market buildings adjacent to each other on the east side of the square, running east and west were built by 1907, under the supervision of the Centre Market Commission under chairman, General Felix Agnus, (the dominating owner/publisher of the city's largest and oldest newspaper, the \\"Baltimore American\\" dating from 1773, reorganized 1799). Newly constructed on the north side was the \\"Produce Market\\" for fruits and vegetables, in the middle was the \\"Fish Market\\" and to the south end was the \\"Retail/Wholesale Market\\" for various sundry dry items. A new plaza was also constructed that year (1907), featuring a beautiful marble and stone fountain specifically designated by a noted animal-loving philanthropist, General A. E. Booth, for the laboring horses of the busy and crowded commercial district who toiled under heavy weights, reins, blinders, stirrups and heavily loaded cargo wagons, at the end of their ancient era and the beginning of motorized trucks and lorries and their smells of gasoline and diesel fuel odors. By 1984, the traffic concerns and space problems caused the local wholesale fish merchants and those in the other markets to consider moving their delivery and transport centers to a new auto and truck oriented complex built between Baltimore and Washington in Jessup, Maryland along the connecting Interstate (95 and 295) and U.S. Route 1 highways. Despite the best efforts of then Mayor William Donald Schaefer and others of his administration and tourism leaders, who had a wonderful vision of an eastern version of San Francisco's famous \\"Fisherman's Wharf\\" and the nearby Monterey, California's \\"Fish Cannery\\" complex, plus Washington, D.C.'s \\"Fish Market\\" which was centered on moored barges along the side channel of the Potomac River at Maine Avenue just south of the National Mall and a continuing center of popularity by the national capital's Washingtonians. Hoping to build something uniquely similar here with the old historic elaborate brick buildings, their Jones Falls-side water access and with the burgeoning \\"Inner Harbor\\", several blocks south. Mayor Schaefer even took a tour of an interesting development along the twisting stream, San Antonio River, that wound through the urban center of that iconic Texas city and saw the canal boats, canoes, paddle boats, with restaurants, music clubs and strolling tourists along the peaceful route that has since become world-famous attracting tourist visitors from the whole nation, so he attempted to create that vision he called \\"Fallswalk\\", for the route along the lower Jones Falls contained within its old late 19th-century stone retaining walls and its connecting grid of streets and alleys such as The Fallsway (built over the subterranean diversion tunnels for the Falls in 1912-1914) and the web of tangled narrow colonial-era alley streets of Front, President, Concord, Harrison, Frederick and Gay Streets running north to south between the east/west Fayette, Baltimore, Lombard and Pratt Streets. This concept was in the days before additional commercial and residential development had moved east and south across the Falls and began butting up against the tightly packed alley-streets with small brick and a few wooden rowhouses and restaurants of \\"Old Town\\" (renamed of colonial Jones Town), \\"Little Italy\\" (in the renamed southern portion of old colonial \\"Jones Town\\") and the future \\"Harbor East\\" of high-rise hotels, office and apartment skyscrapers developed in the 1990s, followed by \\"Harbor Point\\" to the southeast on the small heavily polluted soil of the peninsula jutting into the Inner Harbor, formerly the site of a large ugly Allied-Signal chrome manufacturing/refining works since the Issac and Jesse Tyson and Brian Philpot beginnings in the 1840s. Here leading further north above East Baltimore Street to the streets where the original Falls were covered over by the newly constructed \\"Fallsway\\" and the sometimes flood-prone stream was diverted underground into three great concrete water tunnels during a flood-control public works project in 1912-13-14. Further north at Pennsylvania Station, used by various railway lines, the Falls emerges again at Mount Royal Avenue in a somewhat natural setting with small trees and shrubs surrounding its course with occasional concrete culverts continuing north out of the city, past the old stone / brick mills, raceways, culverts and dams of valley villages of Hampden and Woodberry, Mount Washington to the old Lake Roland public water reservoir of 1860 and its dam and further north to the Pennsylvania state line. In the early 1980s in the Pratt Street Power Plant, Six Flags (corporation, owner/operator of amusement/theme parks from Texas) developed a Victorian-era indoor theme park, featuring an imaginary turn-of-the-century explorer/scientist/raconteur named \\"Phineas Flagg\\" (modeled after famous author Jules Verne's literary world traveler character in the science fiction/adventure novel \\"Around The World in Eighty Days\\", published 1873). Later in the decade, Six Flags expanded their downtown/Inner Harbor interests three blocks north to construct \\"The Brokerage\\" complex in the middle of the north end of Market Place bordering East Baltimore Street, on the eastern edge of downtown. This was adjacent to the Jones Falls west bank, and the new Shot Tower/Market Place station for the new \\"Metro\\" (subway). Across the Falls further east, was the new re-routing of the President Street Boulevard (running from the southern terminus of the Jones Falls Expressway ([Interstate 83] to the southeast waterfront in the new hotel/commercial and apartments/condos towers development of \\"Harbor East\\" and the future \\"Harbor Point.\\" But in the mid-1980s, the wholesale merchants could not be persuaded to stay and so moved out on the trucks to the Anne Arundel and Howard Counties' border line. Eventually the two northern and southern wholesale markets, despite their distinctive industrial but elaborate brick and trim stone architecture were razed, leaving the central structure - Fish Market a lone survivor. It was used briefly as a background scene during several segments about a license-revocation hearing before the newly established state Home Improvement Commission in locally raised, famous Hollywood producer, Barry Levinson's movie \\"Tin Men\\" (starring Richard Dreyfuss, Danny DeVito, and Barbara Hershey about Baltimore's nostalgic, but amusing aluminum-siding salesmen of the early 1960s) in 1987. After Mayor Schaefer had moved on in that year to become Governor of Maryland, a new re-development proposal for the Centre Market Place was considered by expansion from the recent \\"Power Plant\\" amusement and retail complex on Pratt Street's old Pier 4 and the Inner Harbor. \\"The Brokerage\\" building was constructed on a north-south axis above the historic site of the old Maryland Institute/Centre Market for restaurants, bars, night clubs and a concert hall with some retail stores in the old remaining historic 1905–07 commercial buildings still remaining along the west side of Market Place and the north side of intersecting Water Street. Across the square with the still-flowing former horse fountain on the east side was constructed the Port Discovery children's museum in the old Wholesale Fish Market building, which was given a long-term lease by the City Council and government agencies (opened 1998). Although three blocks further north, the newly renamed \\"Power Plant Live!\\" now includes a new array of restaurants, bars, comedy clubs, dance clubs, dueling pianos, and other concepts as well as the popular concert hall venue Rams Head Live! (which was an expansion of the famously popular establishment \\"Rams Head Tavern\\" from downtown Annapolis). By 2013, the entertainment, commercial, and tourist aspects of the area still seem to be thriving and popular. To the south of the \\"Port Discovery\\" museum was constructed a large \\"Harbor Park\\" structure with a parking garage on its upper floors and several convenience stores/eatery shops on the ground floor with a multi-screen movie theater, the first to be opened in downtown Baltimore since the former New Theatre in Charles Center's Charles Plaza (at North Charles and West Saratoga Streets) in the 1960s, which lasted until the late 2000s, when it was replaced by a newer \\"landmark\\" Cinema theatre further south on President Street Boulevard by the Katyrn Forest Massacre Memorial traffic circle/water fountain. From 1978, on the west side of Market Place and continuing south across a bridge over East Lombard Street, stands the two- building \\"Harbor Campus\\" complex of the former Community College of Baltimore's (later renamed the Baltimore City Community College). The two red- glazed brick structures with unusual sloping walls facing Lombard Street were named for Dr. Harry Bard (first president of the new junior college) and Dr. William Lockwood. Dr. Bard, a legendary local educational leader, had a vision of a downtown campus to direct his vision of an \\"urban mission\\" for years to supplement the college's older, more traditional campus from the 1950s in northwest Baltimore on Liberty Heights Avenue. He was a firm supporter of former mayors Thomas L.J. D'Alesandro, Jr. and Theodore R. McKeldin with their visions of a future downtown Baltimore with the original \\"Charles Center\\" project in the late 1950s/early 1960s and the subsequent \\"Inner Harbor\\" revitalization beginning in the late 1960s. But by the 2000s, the financial pressures on the later state-operated academically troubled junior college and the economic pressure of increasing commercial/residential development in the Inner Harbor/Harbor East areas, led to the sale of the southern Lockwood Building to be razed after only two decades, and to be replaced by a newer development (renamed \\"Lockwood Place\\") between East Pratt and Lombard Streets, facing the waterfront and the \\"Power Plant\\" development with additional upper- level parking garages, offices, apartments/condos, and ground-floor restaurants and night clubs along East Pratt Street. The remaining \\"Bard Building\\" is now shuttered and awaits some re-direction from the BCCC Board of Trustees and administration after three decades as to its downtown mission and opportunities of having a two-campus institution. ==References== ==External links== *Power Plant Live! website *, including photo from 1982, at Maryland Historical Trust Category:Buildings and structures in Baltimore Category:Culture of Baltimore Category:Inner Harbor, Baltimore Category:Tourist attractions in Baltimore Category:2001 establishments in Maryland Category:The Cordish Companies ","title":"Power Plant Live!"},{"id":"2570212","text":"Mohsen Sazegara () is an Iranian journalist and pro-democracy political activist.

He was the main figure of Italian fascist political music and, with Roberto Fiore, a co-founder of the Italian neo-fascist movement Forza Nuova. He was born in Rome on 10 November 1958. He died in London on 10 March 2001. == Biography == Massimo Morsello was born in a middle-class family of Rome. His mother was Bulgarian, and fled to Italy after the Communist takeover. He described his father as \\"deeply anticommunist\\" and an admirer of the social philosophy of Fascism. In 1975, at the age of 16, he joined the Italian post-fascist party Movimento Sociale Italiano. He became a member of the juvenile political association Fronte della Gioventù and, although not attending a university, joined FUAN, an organization of right-wing university students. FUAN was less dependent on parliamentary politics than other organizations, and it was something of a thinktank of the Italian far-right youth in the late 1970s. During the so- called \\"Anni di Piombo\\" or Lead Years he became involved in various violent episodes and is thought to have possibly been a member of the neofascist terrorist organization Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. He was sentenced to 9 years and 6 months for crimes related to terrorism. In these years he also began his career as a musician, with his first performance being at the first Hobbit Camp. He gained the nickname Massimino among the far-right members of Italian society. After the Bologna massacre of 2 August 1980, Massimo Morsello, Roberto Fiore, leader of Terza Posizione and seven other people were accused of subversive association. They will then acquitted in 1990. They escaped first to Germany, then, after a few months, to London. Italy called for their extradition but it was refused by England because the crimes they were accused of were only political. It has been rumoured that Morsello and Fiore escaped extradition by collaborating with the MI6. At the beginning of their exile, Morsello and Fiore survived by taking temporary work in restaurants. In 1986, thanks to their friendship with various far-right exponents like Nick Griffin, they managed to found \\"Meeting Point\\", which was later renamed \\"Easy London\\". Easy London is a society that helps young students and workers live and work in London by providing jobs, beds, and contracts. This rapidly made Morsello and Fiore wealthy (the profits being around 15 million euros), but the society was more of a fundraising tool to help various far-right organizations in Italy. \\"Easy London\\" is still active. While in London, Morsello continued his musical activities. He played a concert entitled Scusate, ma non-posso venire (\\"Sorry, but I can't come in\\") that was transmitted to Italy by satellite on 22 July 1996. In the second half of the 1990s, Morsello was diagnosed with cancer. He attempted the controversial somatostatin therapy of Luigi Di Bella, with no success. In April 1999 Morsello was able to return to Italy without being incarcerated due to his worsening health condition. He nevertheless still managed to play music until his death in 2001 and helped Fiore found Forza Nuova. == Music == While most Italian right-wing musicians are influenced by Celtic music or Oi!, Morsello instead put far-right political themes into a more traditional acoustic, folk guitar-based songwriting. His self-admitted main influence is the Italian singer and songwriter Francesco De Gregori. In his later works he tried to develop a more personal style, influenced by psychedelia, especially in songs like Otto di Settembre and Vandea. His lyrics focused on themes like revolution, nationalism, Fascism, abortion and European Union, all from an unambiguously far-right point of view. The songs of Morsello are often of good quality and can be safely compared to those of much more famous Italian political left-wing songwriters like Francesco Guccini or Claudio Lolli. A self-proclaimed Fascist, his far-right political leanings, as expressed in his songs, won the praise of far-right supporters, but hindered his acceptance by the mainstream public. His first three albums were released as demo tapes and only later re-mastered on CD. Nevertheless, he was the best selling far-right Italian songwriter, selling 15,000 copies of his record Punto di non-ritorno. Morsello took advantage of the low profile he had in the mainstream to play a prank on the Italian communist newspaper Il Manifesto. He published a half- page ad of his record La direzione del vento declaring it \\"a truly revolutionary record\\" and emphasizing his friendly stance towards the Palestinians, one of the few platforms he shared with the far-left. The day after, the newspaper, having discovered from letters sent by its readers the identity of Morsello, publicly apologized and tried to give back the money paid by Morsello. === Discography === *Per me… e la mia gente (1978), first released as demo tape *I nostri canti assassini (1981), first released as demo tape *Intolleranza (1990), first released as demo tape *Punto di non-ritorno (1996) *Massimino, a compilation featuring his first two demo tapes (1997) *La direzione del vento (1998) == External links == * Massimo Morsello official website – Contains discography, photos, and various other material. * An eBook with a long interview and many lyrics (PDF) * A short interview from a nationalist fanzine * A page about the connections between Morsello, Fiore and Easy London == See also == * * Amici del Vento * Compagnia dell'Anello * Sotto Fascia Semplice * Zetazeroalfa Category:1958 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Musicians from Rome Category:Italian neo-fascists Category:Third Position Category:20th-century Italian musicians ","title":"Massimo Morsello"},{"id":"2570253","text":"Best of The Doobie Brothers Live is a live album released by The Doobie Brothers.

The Medici Chapels (Cappelle medicee) are two structures at the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, Italy, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, and built as extensions to Brunelleschi's 15th-century church, with the purpose of celebrating the Medici family, patrons of the church and Grand Dukes of Tuscany. The Sagrestia Nuova (\\"New Sacristy\\") was designed by Michelangelo. The larger Cappella dei Principi (\\"Chapel of the Princes\\"), though proposed in the 16th century, was not begun until the early 17th century, its design being a collaboration between the family and architects. ==The Sagrestia Nuova== The Sagrestia NuovaCharles de Tolnay, Michelangelo, vol. III \\"The Medici Chapel\\" (Princeton, 1948); James S. Ackerman, The Architecture of Michelangelo was intended by Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X as a mausoleum or mortuary chapel for members of the Medici family. It balances Brunelleschi's Sagrestia Vecchia, the \\"Old Sacristy\\" nestled between the left transept of San Lorenzo, with which it consciously competes, and shares its format of a cubical space surmounted by a dome, of gray pietra serena and whitewashed walls. It was the first essay in architecture (1519–24) William E. Wallas, Michelangelo at San Lorenzo. The Genius as Entrepreneur, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. of Michelangelo, who also designed its monuments dedicated to certain members of the Medici family, with sculptural figures of the four times of dayMichelangelo left no note of his \\"allegories\\" as he called them; the identification as Night and Day, Dawn and Dusk was first offered by Benedetto Varchi, 1549 that were destined to influence sculptural figures reclining on architraves for many generations to come. The Sagrestia Nuova was entered by a discreet entrance in a corner of San Lorenzo's right transept, now closed.Modern entrance, which requires a ticket, is through the Cappella dei Principi. Though it was vaulted over by 1524, the ambitious projects of its sculpture and the intervention of events, such as the temporary exile of the Medici (1527), the death of Giulio, now Pope Clement VII and the permanent departure of Michelangelo for Rome in 1534, meant that Michelangelo never finished it. Though most of the statues had been carved by the time of Michelangelo's departure, they had not been put in place, being left in disarray across the chapel, and later installed by Niccolò Tribolo in 1545. By order of Cosimo I, Giorgio Vasari and Bartolomeo Ammannati finished the work by 1555.Antonio Paolucci. The Museum of the Medici Chapels and the Church of San Lorenzo. Sillabe Publishing 1999. There were intended to be four Medici tombs, but those of Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano (modestly buried beneath the altar at the entrance wall) were never begun. The result is that the two magnificent existing tombs are those of comparatively insignificant Medici: Lorenzo di Piero, Duke of Urbino and Giuliano di Lorenzo, Duke of Nemours. Their architectural components are similar; their sculptures offer contrast. On an unfinished wall, Michelangelo's Madonna and Child flanked by the Medici patron saints Cosmas and Damian,The doctor-saints (medici) hold their doctor's boxes of salves and nostrums. executed by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Raffaello da Montelupo respectively, to Michelangelo's models, are set over their plain rectangular tomb. In a statement in the Michelangelo's biography published in 1553 by his disciple, Ascanio Condivi, and largely based on Michelangelo own recollections, Condivi gives the following description: \\"The statues are four in number, placed in a sacristy . . . the sarcophagi are placed before the side walls, and on the lids of each there recline two big figures, larger than life, to wit, a man and a woman; they signify Day and Night and, in conjunction, Time which devours all things… And in order to signify Time he planned to make a mouse, having left a bit of marble upon the work (which [plan] he subsequently did not carry out because he was prevented by circumstances), because this little animal ceaselessly gnaws and consumes just as time devours everything”. In 1976,a concealed corridor with drawings on the walls by Michelangelo was discovered under the New Sacristy.Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel, SLOVO, Moscow, 2006. Peter Barenboim, \\"Michelangelo Drawings – Key to the Medici Chapel Interpretation\\", Moscow, Letny Sad, 2006, ===The lantern=== The lantern at the top of the New Sacristy is made out of marble and has an \\"...unusual polyhedron mounted on the peak of the conical roof\\". The orb that is on top of the lantern has seventy-two facets and is about two feet in diameter. The orb and cross, that is on top of the orb, are traditional symbols of the Roman and Christian power, and recalls the similar orbs on central dome plan churches like St. Maria del Fiore and St. Peter's. But because it is on a private mausoleum, the Medici family is promoting their own personal power with the orb and cross, laurel wreath and lion heads, which are all symbols of status and power. The lantern that holds up the orb helps to accentuate the height and size of the chapel, which is fairly small. The lantern is a bit less than seven meters tall and \\"...is equal to the height of the dome it surmounts\\". The lantern metaphorically expresses the themes of death and resurrection. The lantern is where the soul could escape and go from \\"...death to the afterlife\\". ==Cappella dei Principi== A 19th-century photograph of the interior of the Cappella dei Principi Cosimo III in the Capella dei Principi The octagonal Cappella dei Principi surmounted by a tall dome, 59 m. high, is the distinguishing feature of San Lorenzo when seen from a distance.

Its entrance is from the exterior,A sequence of small spaces leads from the Sagrestia Nuova also. in Piazza Madonna degli Aldobrandini, and through the low vaulted crypt planned by Bernardo Buontalenti before plans for the chapel above were made.In the separate, earlier crypt beneath the nave of the basilica itself are buried Cosimo de' Medici and Donatello. The opulent Cappella dei Principi, an idea formulated by Cosimo I, was put into effect by Ferdinand I de' Medici. It was designed by Matteo Nigetti, following some sketches tendered to an informal competition of 1602 by Don Giovanni de' Medici, the natural son of Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, which were altered in the execution by the aged Buontalenti.Touring Club Italiano, Firenze e dintorni (Milan, 1964) p. 285f. A true expression of court art, it was the result of collaboration among designers and patrons. For the execution of its astonishing revetment of marbles inlaid with colored marbles and semi-precious stone, the Grand Ducal hardstone workshop, the Opificio delle Pietre Dure was established. The art of commessi, as it was called in Florence, assembled jig-sawn fragments of specimen stones to form the designs of the revetment that entirely cover the walls. The result was disapproved of by 18th- and 19th-century visitors, but has come to be appreciated for an example of the taste of its time.TCI, Firenze e dintorni 1964:286: \\"indeed, conceived according to the Baroque aim of arousing stupefaction\\" (concepita già secondo il fine barocco di destare stupore). Six grand sarcophagi are empty; the Medici remains are interred in the crypt below. In sixteen compartments of the dado are coats-of-arms of Tuscan cities under Medici control. In the niches that were intended to hold portrait sculptures of Medici, two (Ferdinando I and Cosimo II) were executed by Pietro Tacca (1626–42). ==See also== * Michelangelo and the Medici * History of early modern period domes == Notes == ==References== * Edith Balas, \\"Michelangelo's Medici Chapel: A New Interpretation\\", Philadelphia, 1995 * Barenboim, Peter (with Heath, Arthur). 500 years of the New Sacristy: Michelangelo in the Medici Chapel, LOOM, Moscow, 2019. * Peter Barenboim, \\"Michelangelo Drawings: Key to the Medici Chapel Interpretation\\", Moscow, Letny Sad, 2006, * Peter Barenboim, Alexander Zakharov, \\"Mouse of Medici and Michelangelo: Medici Chapel / Il topo dei Medici e Michelangelo: Cappelle Medicee\\", Mosca, Letni Sad, 2006. * Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, Michelangelo: Mysteries of the Medici Chapel, SLOVO, Moscow, 2006. * Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, Michelangelo in the Medici Chapel: Genius in details (English, Russian).

The area was used for farming from the 1850s, and subdivision started in the early 20th century, with most of the houses being built between 1950 and 1980. ==History== The suburb spreads across wholly flat land which before the arrival of the first European colonists in the 1850s consisted of streams running into marshland between weathered and grassy sand dunes. Sheep and dairy cattle began to be grazed on the land within a few years of the colonists' arrival, the area being part of the Sandhills station. Land began to be bought by families of small farmers from 1863 onwards, and during the rest of the 19th century the future suburb was a district of market gardens, dairy farms and small grazing farms divided by hedgerows. A farmhouse and stables could be found along the roads every few hundred metres. As more and more land was drained it was often highly productive. One large estate was established by the very wealthy Rhodes family who chose not to live on the land but instead resided in a very large mansion in Merivale. Their estate in the district was run by managers and overseers. The district's settlers were mostly English and Scottish, but some Irish families also settled, as well as – in the 1870s – a significant group of Poles from eastern Germany. A small village of shops and one or two churches had begun to grow up by that time along what would later become known as Shirley Road. Most of the housing in Shirley was built between 1950 and 1980. A large block of state housing, known as the Emmett Block, developed on the western side of the suburb during the immediate postwar years. On the eastern side the housing was built mostly by private developers, among others Paramount Homes. The standard house built by developers was a one-storey bungalow of three or four bedrooms under a low roof in streets that sometimes followed the course of old streams, meandered in various artificial crescents, or else ended in cul-de-sacs. The socio-economic level of the suburb as a whole has always been very near the average for the suburbs of Christchurch. The poorest streets are in the Emmett Block. The most expensive streets tend to be towards the north of the suburb or in a cluster near Dudley Stream. ==Name== Susannah Buxton (née Shirley) was married to John Buxton (1806–1886). On her deathbed in 1868, she asked her son, Joseph Shirley Buxton (1833–1898), to gift land to the Methodists to build a church. Her wish was carried out and the Shirley Methodist Church was named after her. The suburb eventually became known as Shirley after the church. Subdivision started in the early 20th century, at which time the area was known as North Richmond. The name then changed to Windsor, until it was discussed at a meeting at the Windsor Wesleyan School that land agents indicated land sold better if the locality was called Shirley instead of Windsor. Windsor thus went out of fashion as the name of the suburb, but it lives on in names like Windsor Golf Club, Windsor Service Station, Windsor House, and Windsor School. ==Services== The Shirley Community Centre displaying significant earthquake damage The suburb now includes one of the largest shopping malls in Christchurch, called The Palms Shopping Centre, together with the Shirley Golf Course and Bunnings Homebase. Shirley Boys' High School opened in September 1957. The former primary school was converted to a community centre. The building was listed as a Category II heritage structure with Heritage New Zealand and was badly damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It has since been demolished. Another primary school, Quinns Road School, opened on 6 July 1955 and was renamed to Hammersley Park School in 1983. It was closed in 2012 after suffering earthquake damage, since its roll had fallen from more than 200 in the early 1990s to 49. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Christchurch ","title":"Shirley, New Zealand"},{"id":"2570299","text":"The Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate is a nonprofit country house and garden ground museum in Canton, Massachusetts.

She graduated from the National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw and continued her studies at the Parisian Conservatoire d'Art Dramatique. She is one of the most recognized and popular actresses in the contemporary Polish film industry. She often played blond bombshells, prostitutes, and wives of rich men.

In 2004, she made her come-back to theater after a long-term absence. Her role in Alina to the West by Paweł Miśkiewicz in the Warsaw Drama Theater was highly regarded by the critics.

It is on the medial (inner) side of the knee joint in humans and other primates. Its primary function is to resist outward turning forces on the knee. ==Structure== It is a broad, flat, membranous band, situated slightly posterior on the medial side of the knee joint. It is attached proximally to the medial epicondyle of the femur immediately below the adductor tubercle; below to the medial condyle of the tibia and medial surface of its body. It resists forces that would push the knee medially, which would otherwise produce valgus deformity. The fibers of the posterior part of the ligament are short and incline backward as they descend; they are inserted into the tibia above the groove for the semimembranosus muscle. The anterior part of the ligament is a flattened band, about 10 centimeters long, which inclines forward as it descends. It is inserted into the medial surface of the body of the tibia about 2.5 centimeters below the level of the condyle. Crossing on top of the lower part of the MCL is the pes anserinus, the joined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles; a bursa is interposed between the two. The MCL's deep surface covers the inferior medial genicular vessels and nerve and the anterior portion of the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle, with which it is connected by a few fibers; it is intimately adherent to the medial meniscus. ===Development=== Embryologically and phylogenically, the ligament represents the distal portion of the tendon of adductor magnus muscle. In lower animals, adductor magnus inserts into the tibia. Because of this, the ligament occasionally contains muscle fibres. This is an atavistic variation. ==Clinical significance== ===Injury=== An MCL injury can be very painful and is caused by a valgus stress to a slightly bent knee, often when landing, bending or on high impact. It may be difficult to apply pressure on the injured leg for at least a few days. It can be caused by direct blow to lateral side of knee. The most common knee structure damaged in skiing is the medial collateral ligament, although the carve turn has diminished the incidence somewhat. MCL strains and tears are also fairly common in American football. The center and the guards are the most common victims of this type of injury due to the grip trend on their cleats, although sometimes it can be caused by a helmet striking the knee. The number of football players who get this injury has increased in recent years. Companies are currently trying to develop better cleats that will prevent the injury. MCL is also crucially affected in breaststroke and many professional swimmers suffer from chronic MCL pains. There are three distinct levels in a MCL injury. Grade 1 is a minor sprain, grade 2 in a major sprain or a minor tear, and grade 3 is a major tear. Based on the grade of the injury treatment options will vary. ====Treatment==== Depending on the grade of the injury, the lowest grade (grade 1) can take between 2 and 10 weeks for the injury to fully heal. Recovery times for grades 2 and 3 can take several weeks to several months. Treatment of a partial tear or stretch injury is usually conservative. Sports medicine therapists should be a first choice option for diagnosis and treatment of injuries to this structure. This includes measures to control inflammation as well as bracing. Kannus has shown good clinical results with conservative care of grade II sprains, but poor results in grade III sprains. As a result, more severe grade III and IV injuries to the MCL that lead to ongoing instability may require arthroscopic surgery. However, the medical literature considers surgery for most MCL injuries to be controversial. Isolated MCL sprains are common. For higher grade tears of the MCL with ongoing instability, the MCL can be sutured or replaced. Other non-surgical approaches for more severe MCL injuries may include prolotherapy, which has been shown by Reeves in a small RCT to reduce translation on KT-1000 arthrometer versus placebo. Results should be contrasted with meta-analysis such as the one by Rabago et al: The future of non-surgical care for a non- healing MCL injury with laxity (partial ligament tear) is likely bioengineering. Fan et al. (2008) have demonstrated that knee ligament reconstruction is possible using mesenchymal stem cells and a silk scaffold. ==Additional images== File:Slide2CAC.JPGAnterior view of knee ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * () * Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) Tears Category:Knee ligaments ","title":"Medial collateral ligament"},{"id":"2570329","text":"Lateral collateral ligament can refer to: * Fibular collateral ligament, a ligament in the knee * Lateral collateral ligament of ankle joint * Radial collateral ligament of elbow joint ","title":"Lateral collateral ligament"},{"id":"2570332","text":"__NOTOC__ Professor Dines Bjørner (born 4 October 1937, in Odense) is a Danish computer scientist.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 30 November 1982. ==Plot== The episode opens with footage of a flying bomber dropping a payload, revealed to be a huge red atom bomb that lands into the quartet's house unexploded. Neil fails to notice the real reason for an enormous hole in the ceiling when he gets out of bed to do the breakfast, assuming that one of his flatmates had put it there somehow. Eventually Vyvyan points out that the atom bomb is perched against the refrigerator. The initial panic is diverted by the arrival of a sadistic television licence officer who wants blood, but soon the quartet returns to the emergency at hand. Mike tries negotiating with Libya in an attempt to make a profit out of the bomb while Rick uses the bomb with attempts to make threats to the British Government (his efforts at sending a threatening telegram through the Post Office fail when it turns out he has mistakenly walked into the DHSS). Neil, ever the pragmatist, sets out his personal survival plan (\\"I'm going to consult the incredibly helpful Protect and Survive manual!\\") and Vyvyan tries to quicken up the detonation procedure. The final tick of the clock prior to 'explosion' proves to be a little disappointing, with the bomb hatching like an egg and a small aeroplane emerging out of the bomb, flying out of the room and circling outside the house (thus implying the bomb was merely an 'egg' of the bomber). ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). Alexei Sayle starred as Reggie Balowski, a wisecracking used car dealer and son of the students' landlord Jerzei. Roger Sloman appeared as the television license officer named \\"Right Bleedin' Bastard\\". ==Reception== The episode features a performance from Dexys Midnight Runners performing a cover of Van Morrison's \\"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\\". A cut-away sketch 'Dicky and Dino' (played by Mayall and Planer) parodies The Rat Pack, primarily their family-friendly image as depicted in television specials (and the inherent contrast this provides with their supposed involvement with organised crime). ==References== Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1982 British television episodes Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Bomb (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2570338","text":"Shilavo (; also spelled \\"Scilave\\", \\"Shelabo\\") is a town in eastern Ethiopia, in the Korahe Zone of the Somali Region.

Those who had committed serious sins confessed their sins to the Bishop or his representative and were assigned a penance that was to be carried out over a period of time. After completing their penance, they were reconciled by the Bishop with a prayer of absolution offered in the midst of the community. Penance assumed many forms, such as pilgrimages to holy sites; constructing, repairing and rebuilding churches; and caring for the poor and sick. During the time they worked out their penances, the penitents often had special places in church and wore special garments to indicate their status. Like the catechumens who were preparing for baptism, they were often dismissed from the Sunday assembly after the Liturgy of the Word. The use of ashes at the beginning of Lent is an extension of the use of ashes with those entering the Order of Penitents. == The Penitential Movement == Penance in the Judeo- Christian sense can be traced to the time just after the Jewish exile in Babylon (Sirach 5:1–8; 34: 21–31). The repentance and conversion preached by John the Baptist was of this type. In the first centuries of the Christian Church, groups of penitents were established by the Church for those Christians who fell into grave sin and sought reconciliation with the Church. These sins included such things as adultery, murder, idolatry and magic, and theft. Doing penance was a visible sign of conversion. If the sinner refused to do penance, he or she was excommunicated. Public penance consisted of acts of mortification such as wearing a \\"hair shirt,\\" covering the head with ashes, fasting and prayers. These acts were regulated by the bishops. After the period of penance was completed, the repentant sinner was readmitted into the assembly. The Edict of Milan in A.D. 313 declared that the bishop could relegate the sinner into an Order of Penitents called Conversi. This was done in a liturgical ceremony with the laying on of hands and the application of ashes. They worshiped separately from the rest of the congregation, but were not allowed to participate in the Eucharistic celebration. Other restrictions imposed by the bishop were called interdicts, and by the 4th century, some of these interdicts came to be imposed not only for the penitential period, but for life. By the 4th century, there were those who entered the Order of Penitents voluntarily. They accepted the interdicts of the Order which by that time included: * not to participate in military service * not to be merchants * not to occupy public office * to refrain from conjugal relations if married, and to be celibate if single * not allowed to remarry if widowed * single penitents could not marry while in the Order (this was later abrogated) === 5th and 6th centuries === Monastic asceticism, which was popularized by the Desert Fathers of the East, such as St. Anthony the Great and St. Basil, moved into Europe. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of western or Benedictine monasticism in A.D. 529. The emphasis was on communal living under a rule and a life given to prayer, work and charity. Entering a monastery became a substitute for public penance. In the monasteries, a penitential tax or private penance was developed which was less strenuous than the public penances. This was the beginning of penitential commutation. === 7th through 11th centuries === In Italy and Spain, public or Roman Penance was dominant. Those upon whom penance was imposed and those who accepted the life voluntarily were forbidden to associate with the militia saecularis or secular militia. This included holding civil offices or being a merchant (militia saecularis togata) and from bearing arms (militia saecularis paludata). Fasting, which had always been part of the penitential discipline, became more regularized, and three major times of fasting were observed, Advent, Lent (prior to Easter), and a period after Pentecost. There were also two minor Lents. Other periods of fasting and abstinence could be imposed. === 12th and 13th centuries === The penitential movement became popular among the laity after the Gregorian reform at the end of the 11th century. Introduced around A.D. 950, corporal penance or voluntary flagellation became more known. Also almsgiving as a penitential act became more common. There was also the rise of the Donati and the Oblates, who put themselves in the service of God by attaching themselves in service to a particular church or monastery. In all cases, the emphasis of the penance was to practice justice and mercy, to trust in God, to be of pure heart and intent, to have a zeal for Christ and the Scripture, and to be open to God's grace and inspiration. Most of the participants had little or no formal theological training and many developed heretical beliefs. == Types of penitents == * Married conversi – continued to live with their family, but partially or fully abstained from conjugal relations. * Voluntary pilgrims – went on pilgrimages to the Holy Land or to more local shrines if that were not possible. * Hermits – lived alone or with one or two companions in the wild, in grottos and caves or even in the hollows of trees. * Religious virgins – not nuns, lived with family * Recluses – women who consecrated themselves to God without entering a religious institution == Character of penitents == * Attire – tunic, walking-stick, cincture (belt), knapsack, sandals; symbol was often a Tau Cross after St. Anthony of the Desert. * Charitable works – most often in hospitals and hospices and leprosaria (hospitalers); restoring churches and burying the dead. * Life of Prayer. * Abstinence – from feasts and shows and dances, avoidance of drunkenness and gluttony. * Prohibited from public office or from riding horses. * Forbidden to take up arms or to take an oath. == Orders of penitents == ;Umiliati :The Umiliati were established in northern Italy. Innocent III approved their way of life or \\"Propositum\\" in 1201. In 1208 he approved the \\"Propositum\\" of the Poveri Cattolici and in 1210 that of the Poveri Lombardi. ;Penitents of Assisi :Established as a lay order by St. Francis of Assisi, their full name was viri poenitentiales de civitate Assisii oriundi (\\"penitents from the town of Assisi\\") Eventually they became the Secular Franciscan Order. ;Penitents or Hermits of St. John the Baptist :A community near Pamplona in the Kingdom of Navarre, leading a life of mortification and silence, and assembling only for the chanting of the Divine Office. They received the approbation of Gregory XIII (c. 1515), who appointed a provincial for them. :A community founded in France about 1630 by Michel de Sabine for the reform of abuses among the hermits. Only those of the most edifying lives were chosen as members, and rules were drawn up which were approved for their dioceses by the Bishops of Metz and LePuy en Velay. ;Canons Regular of the Penitence of the Blessed Martyrs :There are various opinions as to the period of foundation, some dating it back to the time of Pope Cletus, but it is certain that the order was flourishing in Poland and Lithuania in the second half of the thirteenth century, the most important monastery being that of St. Mark at Cracow, where the religious lived under the Rule of St. Augustine. ;Penitents of Our Lady of Refuge :Also called Nuns or Hospitallers of Our Lady of Nancy, founded at Nancy in 1631 by Ven. Marie-Elizabeth de la Croix de Jésus, daughter of Jean-Leonard de Fanfain of Remiremont. Left a widow at the early age of twenty-four, she opened a refuge for fallen women, assisted by her three young daughters. The new congregation was formally approved by the Holy See in 1634 under the title of Our Lady of Refuge and the patronage of St. Ignatius Loyola, and under constitutions drawn largely from those of the Society of Jesus and in accordance with the Rule of St. Augustine. ;Sisters of the Conservatorio di S. Croce della Penitenza or del buon Pastore :Also known as Scalette, founded at Rome in 1615 by the Carmelite Domenico di Gesu e Maria, who, with the assistance of Baltassare Paluzzi, gathered into a small house (conservatorio) a number of women who were in danger of falling into prostitution. Those desiring to become religious were placed under the Rule of St. Augustine ;Ordo religiosus de penitentia :The members of which were called Scalzette or Nazareni, founded in 1752 at Salamanca, by Juan Varella y Losada (b. 1724; d. at Ferrara, 24 May 1769), who had resigned a military career for a life of voluntary humiliation in a house of the Observants at Salamanca. Being urged to found a religious order, he assembled eight companions in community (8 March 1752) under a rule which he had drawn up the previous year, and for which he obtained the authorization of Benedict XIV. Like the Franciscans, the members take a vow to defend the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and, like all mendicant orders, they derive their means of subsistence entirely from contributions and are forbidden the possession of landed property. ;Order of Penitents established by Bernard of Marseille :The Order of Penitents was a religious order established by Bernard of Marseille about 1272 for the reception into the Roman Catholic Church of reformed courtesans. Noah Webster's Dictionary, 1828, under \\"penitent\\" affirmed \\"Order of penitents, a religious order established by one Bernard of Marseilles, about the year 1272, for the reception of reformed courtezans. The congregation of penitents at Paris, was founded with a similar view.\\" . The entry was repeated in Nuttall's Encyclopedia 1907. The confraternities of penitents of Marseille were traced to the end of the 15th century by A. E. Barnes.

Iwan Bloch (also known as Ivan Bloch) (April 8, 1872 – November 21, 1922) was a German dermatologist and psychiatrist. Born in Delmenhorst, Grand Ducal Oldenburg, Germany, he is often called the first sexologist. He discovered the Marquis de Sade's manuscript of The 120 Days of Sodom, which had been believed to be lost, and published it under the pseudonym Eugène Dühren in 1904. In 1899 he had published Marquis de Sade: his life and works. under the same pseudonym. Together with Magnus Hirschfeld and Albert Eulenburg, Bloch proposed the new concept of a science of sexuality: Sexualwissenschaft or sexology. In 1906 he wrote in German the book Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur which was translated as The Sexual Life of our Time in its Relations to Modern Civilization, a complete encyclopedia of the sexual sciences in their relation to modern civilization.Bloch I., (1906) Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur.

The film is set in and around the small city of Fenyang, Shanxi province, China (Jia's birthplace), from the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1990s. It follows a group of twenty-something performers as they face personal and societal changes. The dialogue is a mixture of local speech, mainly Jin Chinese and Mandarin. The film has been called \\"an epic of grassroots\\". It is named after a popular song about waiting at a railway platform. Platform has garnered wide acclaim from critics in the years since its release, and is often named one of the greatest films of the 2000s. ==Plot== The film starts in 1979 in the wake of the Cultural Revolution. A theatre troupe of young adults in Fenyang performs state-approved material. The troupe includes Cui Minliang and his friends, Yin Ruijuan, Zhang Jun, and Zhong Ping. Zhang and Zhong are together. Cui asks Yin if she is his girlfriend, but she replies that she is not. The troupe leaves their hometown and travels throughout the country for several years during the 1980s. Yin stays behind in Fenyang and becomes a tax collector. The authorities find out about the illegal sexual relationship between Zhang and Zhong, and Zhong then leaves the group, never to return. As China undergoes massive social changes, the troupe alters their performances and starts to play rock music. They eventually return to Fenyang.

Free Church minister 43 Queen Street, Edinburgh Memorial plaque to Alexander Moody Stuart in Kutná Hora (Bohemia) The Rev Dr Alexander Moody Stuart D.D. (15 June 1809 – 31 July 1898) was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly to the Free Church of Scotland in 1875. ==Life== He was born Alexander Moody on 15 June 1809 in Paisley the son of Alexander Moody, chief magistrate of Paisley. He studied at Glasgow University then at Divinity Hall in Edinburgh. He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1831.Ewing's Annals of the Free Church Dr. A. Moody-Stuart from \\"The Sea of Galilee Mission of the Free Church of Scotland\\" Moody was a missionary in Holy Island, Northumberland, from 1831 to 1835. From 1835, at the request of the Kirk session of St George's Church in Edinburgh, he began the work of gathering a congregation for a new church in Young Street. It was opened on 27 July 1837 and named St Luke's. He was ordained as its first minister. On 9 September 1839 he married Jessie Stuart (died 27 April 1891), eldest daughter of Kenneth Bruce Stuart of Annat. Jessie inherited the family estate at Rait on the braes of the Carse of Gowrie, which was named Annat after an old family estate, with the condition that her husband should take the surname Stuart of Annat. Hence Alexander Moody took the name Alexander Moody Stuart. After the Disruption of 1843 he left the established church and joined the Free Church of Scotland. He avoided the issue of losing his church and manse by taking a long vacation \\"on health grounds\\", firstly in Madeira and then in Brazil. He returned to Scotland in the spring of 1845 as minister of St Luke's Free Church. He lived at 43 Queen Street, an impressive Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh's First New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1850–51 The house was remodelled in 1851 by a local architect, John Henderson, who gave it a Gothic frontage, very different from the rest of the street.Buildings of Scotland; Edinburgh; Gifford, John; McWilliam, Colin; Walker, David He also owned a country property: Annat Cottage in Errol, Perthshire.Perth Post Office Directory 1865: List of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Country Seats He was convener of the Jewish Mission of the Free Church from 1847 to 1889 (with a brief interval), and was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church in 1875/76.

In 1875 he succeeded Rev Robert Walter Stewart as Moderator of the General Assembly, the highest position within the Free Church of Scotland.Free Church Monthly July 1875 He was a strong supporter of the Establishment Principle and opponent of disestablishment of the Church of Scotland. He opposed Higher Criticism, and the proposed union with the United Presbyterian Church. He interested himself in promoting friendly relations between Scottish Presbyterians and the Reformed churches of Hungary and Bohemia. He retired in 1876 on completion of his role as Moderator and died at Crieff in Perthshire on 31 July 1898 aged 89.

He is best known for his late 1990s run at Cash Money Records with the group the Hot Boys. ==Early life== Virgil was born February 8, 1981 in New Orleans, Louisiana to his mother \\"Gal\\" and his father Tab Virgil Sr.. He grew up in the Magnolia Projects and attended Fortier High School before dropping out. He was discovered by Birdman rapping with Magnolia Shorty at a block party. ==Career== His debut album Young & Thuggin' became a Top 10 hit on the Billboard 200. After the split of the Hot Boys in 2001 & his departure of Cash Money in 2003 he signed a deal with producer Ke'Noe at Laboratory Recordz and released two albums Raw & Uncut and Penitentiary Chances. In 2005, Turk was convicted on federal charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, a fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm, and an unlawful user addicted to a controlled substance in possession of a firearm. The charges arose from the shooting of a Memphis,Tennessee police officer in early 2004. He was sentenced to 10 years of incarceration. In 2006, he entered an Alford plea in Tennessee state court to second-degree attempted murder, based on the same incident, and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.\\"Hip-Hop News: Hot Boy Turk Sentenced To 12 Years In Officer Shooting\\", Rap News Network. While incarcerated Ke'Noe released two albums of unreleased Turk verses called Still A Hot Boy and Convicted Felons. The albums profits of the last two releases were put on Turk's prison books. Turk was released from prison in October 2012 after almost nine years of incarceration. In December 2012, Turk made a hit single titled \\"Zip It\\" featuring Lil Wayne. Weeks later, a remix with Juvenile was made and released. In February 2013, a version with Turk, Lil Wayne, Juvenile and B.G. was made, making an official Hot Boys reunion song. Turk released a mixtape under SoundCloud called \\"Blame It On The System\\". == Legal issues == On January 26, 2004 at around 2:00pm local time, dozens of Shelby County Narcotics Officers and SWAT officers served a search warrant for drugs believed to be inside Turk's apartment in the Hickory Pointe Community in Southeast Memphis. After knocking on the door and identifying themselves led to no response, the officers entered and began searching the apartment. Turk then allegedly shot at them with a 9mm handgun. The officers and SWAT returned fire, engaging in a 15-minute shootout with Turk. Turk finally surrendered to Shelby County officers and the SWAT Team. Turk was charged Wednesday, January 28, 2004 with first-degree attempted murder for allegedly shooting two Memphis, Tennessee Police Officers. In February 2015, Turk filed lawsuit against Cash Money Records for $1.3 million, over unpaid royalties for recordings dating back to 1999, including solo work from his debut Young & Thuggin' and group, the Hot Boys. The rapper eventually won the suit by default, when Cash Money failed to respond. However, in June 2015, Turk requested that the lawsuit be dismissed after both parties reached an amicable settlement. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Young & Thuggin' (2001) * Raw & Uncut (2003) * Penitentiary Chances (2004) * Still A Hot Boy (2005) * Convicted Felons (2006) ===Collaboration albums=== * Get It How U Live! with Hot Boys (1997) * Guerrilla Warfare with Hot Boys (1999) * Baller Blockin' with Cash Money Millionaires (2000) * Let 'Em Burn with Hot Boys (2003) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1981 births Category:20th- century American musicians Category:African-American male rappers Category:Cash Money Records artists Category:Living people Category:Rappers from New Orleans Category:Gangsta rappers Category:Rap-A-Lot Records artists Category:21st-century American rappers Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Turk (rapper)"},{"id":"2570425","text":"A non-denominational person or organization is not restricted to any particular or specific religious denomination. ==Overview== The term has been used in the context of various faiths including Jainism,Jainism in a global perspective: - Page 115, Sāgaramala Jaina, Shriprakash Pandey, Pārśvanātha Vidyāpīṭha - 1998 Baháʼí Faith,Earth Versus the Science-fiction Filmmakers - Page 70, Tom Weaver - 2005 Zoroastrianism,Zoroastrianism: An Introduction - Page 227, Jenny Rose - 2011 Unitarian Universalism, Neo-Paganism, Christianity,Models for Christian Higher Education, Richard Thomas Hughes, William B.

It should not be confused with Goulash, a stew with more gravy or a soup (using meat with bones, paprika, caraway, vegetables and potato or different tiny dumplings or pasta simmered along with the meat), or Paprikás (using only meat, paprika and thick heavy sour cream). The traditional Hungarian stews: Pörkölt and Paprikás along with the traditional soup \\"Goulash\\" are considered to be the national dishes of Hungary. There are different pörkölt variations from region to region. In most parts of Hungary pörkölt is made with beef or pork. The word Pörkölt simply means \\"roasted\\". Pörkölt is made of meat, onion, and sweet paprika powder. Tomatoes or tomato paste, green pepper, marjoram, and garlic are common additions to the basic recipe. Fresh yellow Hungarian wax peppers are preferred if no paprika powder is available. Any kind of meat can be used when making pörkölt. Most common are beef, lamb, chicken and pork, but game, tripe and liver can also be used. A variant of pörkölt, called pacalpörkölt, is prepared using tripe. Nokedli used as side dish Much of the quality of a pot of pörkölt is found in the use of the very few ingredients. The spiciness and the taste of the paprika powder used is very important to the taste. A simple Hungarian trick for making good pörkölt is first frying the onions in lard or oil, before making anything else. Then set aside the pot and immediately add paprika powder and the meat and \\"stir-fry\\" – (this is the origin of the verb pörkölni – to roast). This way the juices are kept inside. Water is added, the same volume as the meat. Pörkölt should be simmered slowly in very little liquid. Flour should never be used to thicken a Hungarian pörkölt. In Hungary pörkölt is served with pasta (tészta), tarhonya (big Hungarian pasta grains) or galuska/nokedli as a side dish. Boiled potato is also a common garnish, and pickles go with the dish nicely, counterbalancing the heavy stew with a touch of sour. ==Outside Hungary== Beef stew with sheep's cottage cheese noodles There is a different style Hungarian pörkölt stew, tokány, a Transylvanian stew that doesn't emphasize the use of paprika as much as the pörkölt in Hungary proper. These are stews using black pepper and kitchen herbs like marjoram for spices instead, often made with mixed meats, vegetables and wild mushrooms, depending on the season and the region. Tokány is often served topped with sour cream, and mostly puliszka (polenta) or boiled potatoes are being served as the side dish. In the Czech Republic pörkölt is made with pork, beer, dark bread and caraway. Often large Czech knedlíky dumplings are served with it. In Slovakia the dish is called perkelt and is served with Halušky dumplings. Goulash (Polish: Gulasz) is similar to Hungarian Pörkölt, and is also popular in Poland, usually being eaten with potatoes. ==See also== * List of stews ==References== Category:Hungarian stews Category:Slovak cuisine Category:Austrian cuisine Category:Czech cuisine Category:Croatian cuisine Category:Serbian cuisine Porkolot Category:Hungarian words and phrases Category:Montenegrin cuisine Category:Meat dishes ","title":"Pörkölt"},{"id":"2570452","text":"Sir William Kerr Fraser (18 March 1929 – 13 September 2018) was a British civil servant, who served as Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Office, and as Principal and later Chancellor of the University of Glasgow. ==Early life== William Kerr Fraser was educated at Eastwood High School in Glasgow.

Depending on the appliance selected, one or more BIG-IP product modules can be added. Offerings include: * Local Traffic Manager (LTM): Local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture. * Application Security Manager (ASM): A web application firewall. * Access Policy Manager (APM): Provides access control and authentication for HTTP and HTTPS applications. * Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): On-premises DDoS protection, data centre firewall. * Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): through technologies such as compression and caching. * IP Intelligence (IPI): Blocking known bad IP addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets. * WebSafe: Protects against sophisticated fraud threats, leveraging advanced encryption, client- less malware detection and session behavioral analysis capabilities. * BIG-IP DNS: Distributes DNS and application requests based on user, network, and cloud performance conditions. ====BIG-IP history==== On September 7, 2004, F5 Networks released version 9.0 of the BIG-IP software in addition to appliances to run the software. Version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company's TMOS architecture, with significant enhancements including: * Moved from BSD to Linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.) * Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities. * Creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the BIG-IP and establishes new connections between the BIG-IP and the member servers in a pool. This allows for optimum TCP stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction. Subsequent releases enhanced performance, improves application security, and supported cloud application deployments. In July 2020 F5 admitted a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system.https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current- activity/2020/07/04/f5-releases-security-advisory-big-ip-tmui-rce- vulnerability-cve Because of the severity of this vulnerability (CVE-2020-5902), F5 recommended updating BIG-IPs to the latest version and provided additional mitigation details in a security advisory. ===BIG-IQ=== F5 describes BIG-IQ as a framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open RESTful APIs. BIG-IQ uses a multi-tenant approach to management. This allows organizations to move closer to IT as a Service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24] === Silverline === Silverline is a cloud-based managed security service. Its offerings include security services such as WAF, DDoS, and Anti-Bot protection services. The Silverline services are enabled by BIG IP ASM, Shape, and NGINX technology platforms. === Cloud, container and orchestration solutions === In 2017, the company introduced technologies to make F5 capabilities more portable across a broader range of IT environments, including: *Application Services Proxy is an automated traffic management proxy that provides F5 services (and service portability) with containerized environments. * Container Connector combines F5's application services platforms (including BIG-IP and Application Services Proxy) with native container environment management and orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, RedHat OpenShift, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Mesos. === Shape AI Fraud Engine (SAFE) === SAFE is a SaaS offering designed to eliminate fraudulent online transactions by evaluating them via AI in order to understand intent and block potential fraud before it happens.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 14 December 1982 and was the final episode of the first series. ==Plot== With none of the quartet noticing a medieval execution in their back garden, there is initial tranquility in the house, with Neil randomly hitting himself in the face with a frying pan, and Vyvyan reading one of Rick's \\"SS Death Camp Battalion go to Monte Cassino for the Massacre\\" war comics, leading to an argument with Rick over the comic's content. After Neil prepares to go on a shopping trip for \\"Everything except Green Globules and Super Mousse\\", Vyvyan mentions that he had concocted a 'homicidal axe-wielding maniac' potion disguised in a Coca-Cola can, that transforms the drinker into said person, under the guise of a \\"cure for not being a homicidal axe-wielding maniac\\", to which Vyvyan mentions the potential size of the market for such an invention. Torrential rain soon traps everyone in the house and a game of hide and seek gets underway to pass the time. The house takes on a Narnia-esque feel, with a lion tamer in Mike's bedroom and Vyvyan finding a witch in a sleigh lurking in a new world at the back of the wardrobe where he was hiding. But all that - plus the sharks at the window and the arson attack on Rick's bedroom caused by Vyvyan - becomes irrelevant as Mr. Balowski arrives, unwittingly drinks Vyvyan's potion, and goes on the hunt. As Mike, Rick and Vyvyan prepare to kill Neil for food with an electric hedge trimmer, Mr. Balowski breaks down the door to Neil's room with an axe, leading to the group trying to escape him. After tricking Mr. Balowski into entering Mike's room, which was being rented out to Bobby the Lion Tamer and his man-eating lions, (Bobby coincidentally was Robert Raven from Gerry Cottles Circus), the group notice the floodwaters are subsiding. The episode ends by showing Vyvyan's hamster, SPG, floating on a discarded McEwan's Export can on the floodwaters, indicating he had survived Vyvyan's angry outburst which led to him throwing him outside. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). The episode also features their landlord Jerzei Balowski (Alexei Sayle), a character who was appearing for the second time during the first series, and would appear once more in total. This episode was the only one of the dozen made not to feature a band performing mid-show; the lion-tamer provided the \\"cabaret\\" instead. ==Cultural references== While the boys are playing hide-and-seek, Vyvyan hides in a wardrobe and ends up in a Narnia-like world. Mr. Balowski's homicidal axe-wielding condition caused by Vyvyan's potion is a reference to the Stanley Kubrick film version of Stephen King's novel, The Shining. The monks at the medieval execution at the beginning are chanting 'Dominus ad nauseam', which means '[Discussing] the Lord to [the point of] nausea'. SPG has an olive branch in his mouth at the end, a biblical reference (Genesis 8:11) to the dove in the story of Noah. ==References== ==External links== * Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1982 British television episodes Category:Television episodes about floods Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Flood (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2570494","text":"Pharmacode sample Pharmacode, also known as Pharmaceutical Binary Code, is a barcode standard, used in the pharmaceutical industry as a packing control system.

Boats built according to the rule reached their peak in the large J-class yachts. This Rating Rule is intended to calculate a rating for yachts, which can then be used to calculate its Time Correction Factor (T.C.F.) in order to have disparate yachts racing against each other. The first boat said to be built under the universal rule was Herreshoff's Doris built in 1905. Before 1914, the Seawanhaka Rule was used for America's Cup racing, and after 1937 smaller boats were desirable, and so the International Rule gained popularity in the 12-Metre Class and smaller to the detriment of the M-class and smaller and became the standard. The 6, 8 and 12 Metre Classes and from 1948 on the 5.5 Metre, were the most popular and the 12-Metre was used for the America's Cup until 1987, the last year the America's Cup was sailed in 12-meter yachts. Yacht designer Nathanael Herreshoff devised the rule in 1902 \\"Herreshoff Rule\\" and accepted by the New York Yacht Club as the rule-making body for 1903.The Herreshoff Marine Museum Twelve Meter Challenges for the America's Cup, Norris D. Hoyt, 1977 Herreshoff had designed winning America's Cup yachts which fully exploited the Seawanhaka rule, which was based only on a yacht's upright waterline length and sail area, to create narrow boats with long overhangs. This reached its peak with Reliance, the defender of the 1903 America's Cup, which was described as a \\"racing freak\\", suitable only for certain conditions.The New York Times coverage articles 1903 This prompted Herreshoff to propose a rule which also took into account the displacement of the boat. ==Universal Rule formula== Mathematically, the Universal Rule formula as introduced in 1903 was: R=\\\\frac {0.2 \\\\cdot L \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{S}} {\\\\sqrt[3]{D}} Variables: *L - Rated Boat length, definition tweaked from year to year by the New York Yacht Club *S - Measured Sail area, up to 1923 to British Navy method, then amended for 3/4 mast-height jibstay and foresails, after the 1928 IYRU London Conference same as Metre-boats of the International Rule. See J-Class. *D - Dead-weight by weighing, no sails no provisions, converted by formula to the equivalent cubic feet of seawater. *R - Rating The numerator contains a yacht's speed-giving elements, length and sail area, while the retarding quantity of displacement is in the denominator. Also the result will be dimensionally correct; R will be a linear unit of length (such as feet or meters). Sailing craft are thus rated when their R rating falls within a certain range. J-Class boats, for example, are any single masted craft with an R between 65 and 76 feet (adjusted upward from original to allow British yachts under the International Rule to compete. The listing for single mast boats, namely classes I through S. *Class I: Rating = 76– 88 feetSkene,1941, indicates this applicable to yachts from around 1930: :Universal Rule: \\\\textbf{Rating}=\\\\frac{0.182\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{L}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{SailArea}}\\\\sqrt[3]{Displacement} :where :*\\\\textbf{L}=L.W.L.+.5(q.b.l.-\\\\frac{100-\\\\sqrt{L.W.L.}}{100}\\\\cdot L.W.L.) :*L.W.L. = Length (on) Waterline, measured in measurement trim, in upright position Seawanhaka RuleSkene, 1941 :*q.b.l. = quarter-beam length, measured at the quarter-beam position of the maximum beam (mainframe)on the inside of the hull to the inside of the hull skin :*The Length factor in the 1903 Formula is the Measurement Length Skene, 1941 The yachts were divided into Development Classes *Class J: Rating = 65 – 76 feetJ-class yacht *Class K: Rating = 55 – 65 feet *Class L: Rating = 46 – 55 feet *Class M: Rating = 38 – 46 feet *Class N: Rating = 31 – 38 feet *Class P: Rating = 25 – 31 feet *Class Q: Rating = 20 – 25 feet *Class R: Rating = 17– 20 feet *Class S: Rating = 0 – 17 feet Incorrect upper limits; should read 16.x feet, etc.Skene's, 1941 *The Pond Racing Yacht Marble-head is related to the Universal Rulehttp://forum.woodenboat.com/showthread.php?64794-2007-M-Class- Model-Yacht-Championship *The current International A class yacht retains several elements of the Universal Rule in its formulashttps://www.radiosailing.org/classes/a-class There were multi-mast classes too, running Class A to Class H. ==See also== * Square Metre Rule (sailing) * Ton class * International or 'Metre' Rule ;Footnotes: Note: The 1941 edition of Norman Skene's book (posthumously (1878-1932)) is the most up to date outside the confidential notes of the Rules Commission notes of the New York Yacht Club.

M. A. Azeez, a member of the university's council. Eliezer was appointed foundation professor of mathematics at the University of Malaya in 1959. The appointment was only meant be for two years but the deteriorating situation in Ceylon meant that Eliezer decided to stay in Malaya. During his nine years at the university he was dean of the Faculty of Science from 1959 to 1963 and deputy principal and vice-chancellor for another three years. Eliezer became the first professor of applied mathematics at La Trobe University in 1968. During his 15 years at the university he was dean of the School of Physical Sciences (1969–71 and 1982–83) and deputy vice-chancellor for a period. After retiring in 1983 he was appointed emeritus professor at La Trobe. Eliezer had been president of the Ceylon Association for the Advancement of Science. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. He received an honorary D.Sc.Inf. degree from the University of Jaffna in 1981. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1996. He was awarded the Maamanithar (Great Man) honour by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on 19 October 1997.

The Alex Delaware detective series begins with When the Bough Breaks, published in 1985. Delaware appears in 32 of Kellerman's popular murder mysteries. Kellerman set the series in Los Angeles. Delaware is a forensic psychologist, although Kellerman wrote a back story in which Delaware practiced as a child psychologist. Delaware has a friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a gay LAPD detective. Delaware helps Sturgis in his investigations, and the detective, who eventually reaches the rank of lieutenant, appears in each book in the series. As the series progresses, Delaware's relationship with Robin Castagna evolves, despite two long separations, during which various other romantic interests are introduced. In some of the more recent books in the series, Detective Petra Connor, introduced in Kellerman's standalone novel Billy Straight, also makes an appearance. ==The Post-Modern Detective== {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 35%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\"'I tried to create Alex as a good psychologist,' says Kellerman, 'Actually he's much more sensitive than I am.

Basically you sit there and try to get that person to communicate to you. So Alex asks people to talk to him. He doesn't inject a lot of himself in there.' - style=\\"text\\"-align: left;\\"—Jonathan Kellerman } Alex Delaware (born in 1951) is empathetic and caring with particular emphasis on his concern for children. In Alex Delaware, Kellerman draws a hero who appears to be \\"a levelheaded, appealingly thoughtful guy\\". Kellerman also provides Alex Delaware with a side-kick, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, as is customary in the mystery genre. It is also revealed that his mother was a manic-depressive and his father a raging, physically abusive alcoholic. Kellerman also adds a girlfriend, Robin Castagna, and a French bulldog, which serve to emphasize Delaware's empathetic nature. In several novels, Alex and Robin break up. Alex begins dating Dr. Alison Gwynn, also a Ph.D., clinical psychologist, while Robin dates Tim Plachette, a voice coach. Kellerman's characterization of Delaware is typical of the \\"Post-Modern Detective\\" whom Professor Dick Gibson defines as \\"often an untrained amateur ... often sensitive, caring, thoughtful and socially aware, and he is often from a traditionally noninvolved group.\\" Kellerman characterizes Delaware as \\"sensitive, socially involved, loving and passionate about his patients and his family relationships and cynical only about 'bad guys.'\\" Additionally, Kellerman brings a professional \\"sophistication\\" to the series. Delaware's friend Milo Sturgis, adds to the portrayal of the post-modern detective. As Gibson explains: \\"[The] other important male role is Milo, a career policeman, a big shambling bear of a man, but, in a stunning role reversal, he is gay.\\" Milo, Gibson points out, \\"the gay cop all too often functions as the cavalry. Delaware as amateur Knight Errant often gets into horrendous nightmare difficulties.\\" In the American Psychology Association Patrick McGuire writes about Kellerman's characterization of Delaware: \\"Alex Delaware's style is unlike that of the typical hard-nosed private eye. He goes about his work by interacting sympathetically with the people he meets and by quiet, professional observation. Kellerman says an empathetic psychologist is an ideal model for a detective.\\" Some reviewers, however, have criticized the Delaware novels based on overly intricate plotting, too much description of unnecessary elements, and \\"formula characters.\\" ==Plot summaries== ;' (1985) Kellerman introduces Alex Delaware, Ph.D., in When the Bough Breaks. Kellerman characterizes Delaware as a successful (albeit retired) child psychologist suffering from burn-out after working on a case of systematic child molestation that culminates when the offender commits suicide in Delaware's office. Detective Milo Sturgis urges Delaware to come out of retirement and interview a seven-year-old child who may have witnessed a crime. Sturgis appoints Delaware as a \\"special consultant\\" to the Los Angeles Police Department. Kellerman's timing in this novel coincided with news stories about child abuse in child care facilities. The book was adapted as a 1986 film starring Ted Danson as Alex and Richard Masur as Milo. ;' (1986) In Blood Test, Alex Delaware acts as a consultant in the divorce and child custody case of Richard Moody, a bipolar and potentially dangerous father of two. At the same time, Delaware is contacted by a former colleague, Dr. Raoul Melendez- Lynch, of the oncology department at Western Pediatric Medical Center. Dr. Raoul Melendez-Lynch asks Delaware to consult with Mr. and Mrs. Swope whose child, Woody, needs treatment for cancer. Before Delaware has the opportunity to visit Woody, he vanishes from the hospital and the parents turn up murdered. Delaware sorts through a maze of clues to find the child. Additionally, Kellerman highlights the issue of established medical treatments and new \\"cult cures\\" for children. ;' (1987) In Over the Edge, Kellerman presents Delaware's back story as a researcher in the study \\"Project 160\\", that involved the treatment of gifted children. As the novel opens, Delaware receives a phone call from Jamey Cadmus, who had been involved in the research project. Jamey has been arrested and accused of being a serial killer who preys on young male prostitutes. Delaware is hired by Cadmus' attorney to investigate. In this novel, Kellerman examines preconceived notions about homosexuality; and he examines how others perceive Delaware because of his friendship with Milo Sturgis. In the course of the investigation, Delaware eliminates the obvious clues and discovers a greater evil than he imagined. Additionally, Kellerman investigates psychological problems resulting from childhood genius. ;' (1989) In Silent Partner, Kellerman has Delaware involved in a romantic interlude with a former girlfriend. Delaware's lover apparently commits suicide, and he begins an investigation into her death. His lover's identity becomes the focus of the investigation, as Delaware peels away layer after layer to discover a maze of childhood abuse. ;' (1990) Time Bomb highlights a school shooting at a Los Angeles elementary school; although the only fatality is the shooter herself, Holly Lynn Burden. Holly's father contacts Delaware and asks him to perform a psychological autopsy. During the course of the investigation Delaware encounters dysfunctional families and political extremism as he races to unravel the real villain as he pulls together all the threads.Gecan, Carolyn E. (04-1991) 'Time Bomb\\" Library Journal 37 (4):154 ;' (1992) In Private Eyes, former patient Melissa Dickinson contacts Delaware with a request to investigate a past crime. Her mother, Gina Dickinson had been the victim of an acid attack before Melissa's birth and subsequently suffered from agoraphobia. Shortly after Delaware contacts Dickinson, she disappears. With the help of Milo Sturgis, Delaware begins an investigation into the disappearance. ;' (1993) In Devil's Waltz, Delaware is asked to investigate the case of 20-month-old Cassie Jones, who is frequently hospitalized. The investigation leads Delaware to uncover secrets within Western Pediatric Hospital and to a \\"chilling discovery.\\" When a physician is found murdered, Delaware turns to previous murders for clues to the puzzle. ;' (1994) In Bad Love, Kellerman presents Delaware with an incident involving an anonymous cassette tape with the sound of a screaming child and chants of \\"bad love\\". The phrase refers to a seminar Delaware participated in when employed at Western Pediatrics. As usual, his interview skills provide the clues to keep the sleuthing psychologist moving from locale to locale. The action culminates in a fiery climax, when Delaware's canyon home is destroyed. ;' (1995) Thirteen months after the events in Bad Love, Delaware meets a former patient who sat on the jury in a serial killer case. The woman suffers recurring nightmares. Delaware must unravel two puzzles: the young woman's recurring nightmares; and the present-day patient who may be the target of a killer. Unraveling the two strands, Kellerman has Delaware face repressed memories, murder groupies, jailhouse autobiographers, all on the trail of a serial killer. ;' (1996) Delaware and his girlfriend Robin travel to an island where Delaware assists a doctor collect and organize his works. A complicated plot, laced with ever-present murder, and a weird experiment gone terribly wrong is woven through the uneven writing, uncharacteristic for Kellerman. ;' (1997) In The Clinic Kellerman presents Delaware with a cold case of murder, and the victim was a \\"pop psychology\\" author named Hope Devane. When Sturgis gets the cold case he calls in pal and psychologist Delaware hoping to find insights to Devane's life. The two uncover an execution style crime, her compartmentalized life, and her link to a second murder victim. However, Delaware's turns his forensic psychology skills toward her childhood where he finds answers, danger, and a killer. ;' (1997) In the previous books, Kellerman often used a first person narrative form with Alex Delaware's voice, as well as the more objective third person. Character insights have been limited to those observations made by Delaware. However, in this novel, while the first person is limited to Delaware, there are also multiple presentations of the internal perspective of the character of Daniel Sharavi. ;' (1999) In the thirteenth novel of the Delaware series, Kellerman paints an end-of- millennium Los Angeles reminiscent of Kenneth Millar's works, to whom Kellerman dedicates Monster. Delaware and Sturgis investigate a crime that leads them to an inmate in the Starkweather Hospital for the Criminally Insane. As usual the plot twists as Delaware and Sturgis uncover the monster living openly in society. The novel also offers a realistic depiction of a mental disorder caused by psychiatric drugs; and features a character, wrongfully blamed for a multiple murder, who suffers mental illness as a result of psychoactive medication.Kellerman, Jonathan. Monster. Ballantine Books (1999). ;' (2000) In Dr. Death, Kellerman opens with a corpse found in the Hollywood Hills area, and Alex Delaware is called in to help. Delaware, teamed up with Sturgis, investigates the grisly death of the victim, a Jack Kevorkian type assisted suicide doctor known as \\"Dr. Death\\" the victim. Suspects abound with relatives of Dr. Death's \\"victims\\". Detective Petra Connor, who Kellerman introduced in Billy Straight, puts in an appearance and helps Sturgis and Delaware. ;' (2001) In this novel, Delaware receives a call from a former patient's mother, whose daughter is missing. Delaware last saw her at a bachelor party performing as a stripper. Once again, he finds himself in dangerous situations as he attempts to help Sturgis uncover clues.Maslin, Jane Book of the Times: The Case of the Good Girl Gone Bad The New York Times. 2001-11-22.

Delaware receives a photo album from an unknown source that chronicles a number of murders. Sturgis recognizes the photo of a victim from one of his unsolved crimes two decades earlier. The first part of the novel focuses on Sturgis' early career and a cover-up that's lasted to the present. ;' (2003) In A Cold Heart, Kellerman has Milo Sturgis tell Delaware \\"I've got a weird one, so naturally I thought of you.\\" Sturgis summons Delaware to an art gallery where a young artist has been murdered and the scene suggests to Delaware the work of a serial killer. Teaming up with Petra Connor and her new partner, Sturgis and Delaware follow the clues to a fanzine writer, and as they track down the clues to the killer, bringing them to the doorstep of Delaware's ex-lover Robin Castagna. ;' (2004) In Therapy, Delaware and Sturgis investigate the death of a double murder on Mulholland Drive that leads to human rights' atrocities in Rwanda. Full of red herrings and clues, Kellerman throws out a plethora of psychological leads for Delaware. ;' (2005) In Rage Kellerman presents Delaware with a case of child abduction and murder. Upon his release from prison, the child murderer contacts Delaware, but is murdered himself. Teaming up with Milo Sturgis, Delaware encounter \\"wayward children, a foster family from hell....and a serial killer who's the exact opposite of the genre's usual madman slasher but just as deadly.\\" Delaware and Sturgis sift the evidence piece by piece in this complicated case. ;' (2006) Delaware investigates the kidnapping of two aspiring young actors. When one of the actors is murdered, Delaware and Sturgis follow the clues that show the two were prey to an odd acting coach and an aspiring real estate developer. ;' (2007) A teenage girl whom Delaware had treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder as a child suddenly wants to see him. The girl's aunt—and adoptive mother—has made a stunning deathbed confession. The ensuing investigation triggers murderous steps to cover up a series of old crimes. ;' (2008) A tipsy young woman seeking aid on a desolate highway disappears into the inky black night. A retired schoolteacher is stabbed to death in broad daylight. Two women are butchered after closing time in a small-town beauty parlor. These and other bizarre acts of cruelty and psychopathology are linked only by the killer's use of luxury vehicles and a baffling lack of motive. The ultimate whodunits, these crimes demand the attention of LAPD detective Milo Sturgis and his collaborator on the crime beat, psychologist Alex Delaware. ;' (2009) In Bones, a wealthy teenager gets an unnerving message about something \\"real dead . . . buried in your marsh.\\" Later, the body of a young piano teacher is found in the swamp. Delaware and Sturgis begin their investigation, as more bones begin to surface from the protected urban swamp. Delaware and Sturgis unearth the details of the young piano teacher's life. ;' (2010) In Evidence, L.A. police lieutenant Milo Sturgis investigates a double homicide at the site of an unfinished, obscenely large mansion. Construction halted on the house two years earlier, and ownership can be traced only to a defunct holding company in Washington, D.C. The male victim is easily identified—Desmond Backer, who worked for an odd little architectural firm—but the female victim's identity isn't immediately apparent. Alex serves as a sounding board while Milo pursues assorted rumors and false leads: the site owners are Arabs, Asians, Muslims; the killings were vengeance; the victims were eco-terrorists; the deaths are linked to the disappearance of a Swedish or Swiss woman years before. Without magic, just steady, inspired police work, including horse- trading with the FBI and skillful interrogations, Milo uncovers the unsavory truth. ;' (2010) In Deception, Deputy Chief Weinberg assigns LAPD Lt. Milo Sturgis the particularly sensitive murder case of Elise Freeman, a teacher and tutor at exclusive Windsor Preparatory Academy in Brentwood. Despite Elise's having left a DVD accusing three fellow teachers at the academy of repeated sexual harassment, Sturgis and Delaware have it made clear to them that their investigation is to involve the prestigious academy as little as possible.

A backyard renovation unearths an infant's body, buried sixty years ago. And soon thereafter in a nearby park, another disturbingly bizarre discovery is made not far from the body of a young woman shot in the head. Helping LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis to link these eerie incidents is brilliant psychologist Alex Delaware. But even the good doctor's vast experience with matters both clinical and criminal might not be enough to cut down to the bone of this chilling case—and draw out the disturbing truth. ;' (2014) In Killer, Dr. Delaware becomes briefly embroiled in a bizarre custody battle between two sisters; one, a sophisticated, successful doctor, the other, an itinerant groupie. When the former is found murdered and the other disappears with her child, gay LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis will need Dr. Delaware's insight, expertise - and instinct - to solve the case. ;' (2015) Even hundreds of closed cases to his credit can't keep LAPD lieutenant Milo Sturgis from agonizing over the crimes that don't get solved—and the victims who go without justice. Victims like Katherine Hennepin, a young woman strangled and stabbed in her home. A single suspect with a solid alibi leads to a dead end—one even psychologist Alex Delaware's expert insight can't explain. The only thing to do is move on to the next murder case—because there is always a next one. This time the victim is Ursula Corey, a successful, attractive divorcee who's been gunned down—not a robbery but an execution, a crime that smacks of simple, savage revenge. And along with that theoretical motive come two strong contenders for the role of suspect: the dead woman's business partner/ex-husband and her divorce lawyer/secret lover. But just as Alex and Milo think they're zeroing in on the killer, a bizarre new clue stirs up echoes of the unsolved Hennepin murder. And the discovery of yet another crime scene bearing the same taunting signature raises the specter of a serial killer on a mission, whose twisted method is exceeded only by his manipulative and cunning madness. ;' (2016) Psychologist Dr. Alex Delaware meets beautiful and emotionally fragile TV actress Zelda Chase when called upon to evaluate her five-year-old son, Ovid. Years later, Alex is unexpectedly reunited with Zelda when she is involuntarily committed after a bizarre psychotic episode. Shortly after Zelda's release, an already sad situation turns tragic when she is discovered dead on the grounds of a palatial Bel Air estate. Having experienced more than enough of L.A.’s dark side to recognize the scent of evil, Alex turns to his friend LAPD Lieutenant Milo Sturgis for help in finding out who ended Zelda's broken life. At the same time, Alex is caught up in another quest: the search for Zelda's missing son. And when other victims vanish from the same upscale neighborhood, worry turns to terror. As Alex struggles to piece together the brief rise and steep fall of a gorgeous, talented actress, he and Milo unveil shattered dreams, the corruption of a family, and a grotesque betrayal of innocence. With each devastating revelation and damning clue, Alex's brilliant mind is challenged as never before—and his determination grows to see a killer caged and the truth set free. ;' (2017) At nearly one hundred years old, Thalia Mars is a far cry from the patients that child psychologist Alex Delaware normally treats. But the charming, witty woman convinces Alex to meet with her in a suite at the Aventura, a luxury hotel with a checkered history. What Thalia wants from Alex are answers to unsettling questions—about guilt, patterns of criminal behavior, victim selection. When Alex asks the reason for her morbid fascination, Thalia promises to tell all during their next session. But when he shows up the following morning, he is met with silence: Thalia is dead in her room. When questions arise about how Thalia perished, Alex and homicide detective Milo Sturgis must peel back the layers of a fascinating but elusive woman's life and embark on one of the most baffling investigations either of them has ever experienced. For Thalia Mars is a victim like no other, an enigma who harbored nearly a century of secrets and whose life and death draw those around her into a vortex of violence. ;' (2018) Alex is called in to assist with a murder of a faceless victim, with whom the owners of the home the body is found in, the Corvins, are unfamiliar. The investigation uncovers that, aside from the Corvins, the rest of the community is particularly secretive and uncooperative, and unwilling to divulge information to Alex and the LAPD to solve this violent crime. Alex navigates the secrets of this well- to-do enclave of Los Angeles, exploring everything from the greed to shady sexual and deadly secrets, to get to the bottom of this case. ==Bibliography== The ISBN is for the first U.S. edition of each Alex Delaware novel: *When the Bough Breaks (1985) *Blood Test (1986) *Over the Edge (1987) *Silent Partner (1989) *Time Bomb (1990) *Private Eyes (1992) *Devil's Waltz (1993) *Bad Love (1994) *Self-Defense (1995) *The Web (1996) *The Clinic (1997) *Survival of the Fittest (1997) *Monster (1999) *Dr. Death (2000) *Flesh and Blood (2001) *The Murder Book (2002) *A Cold Heart (2003) *Therapy (2004) *Rage (2005) *Gone (2006) *Obsession (2007) *Compulsion (2008) *Bones (2009) *Evidence (2010) *Deception (2010) *Mystery (2011) *Victims (2012) *Guilt (2013) *Killer (2014) *Motive (2015) *Breakdown (2016) *Heartbreak Hotel (2017) *Night Moves (2018) *The Wedding Guest (2019) ==Adaptation== The first novel in the series,When the Bough Breaks was adapted as a 1986 film starring Ted Danson as Alex Delaware and Richard Masur as Milo Sturgis. ==Footnotes== Category:Book series introduced in 1985 Category:Detective novels Category:Fictional psychologists Category:Literary characters introduced in 1985 ","title":"Alex Delaware"},{"id":"2570541","text":"Cherry Burton is a village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is approximately north-west of the market town of Beverley, east of Market Weighton and south west of Driffield. The village lies on the eastern edge of the Yorkshire Wolds and lies to the west of the B1248 road. ==History== The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Burtone, and belonging to the then Archbishop of York. The name derives from a combination of Old and Middle English; Burh-tūn and Chiri, which means a fort enclosure; a farm with a palisade and a cherry tree. Due to its location, some north of Bishop Burton, the village was sometimes known as North Burton (or even rarer, as Sheriff Burton). Historically in the Wapentake of Harthill, the village also came under the Beverley for its local district. Until rapid house- building in the 1960s and 1970s, the village mostly consisted of one long main street as laid down in the 18th and 19th centuries with farmhouses. The civil parish is formed by the village of Cherry Burton and the hamlets of Gardham and High Gardham. According to the 2011 UK Census, Cherry Burton parish had a population of 1,392, a reduction on the 2001 UK Census figure of 1,473. The village has a Costcutter shop which also acts as a post office and a village hall which holds live musical events and hosts an annual local pantomime. The village pub, The Bay Horse, holds events each week. The village has a primary school which has ties with the local church. Its rating by OFSTED is good. Sports in the village include cricket, football, tennis, and rounders. Clubs for cricket and football have junior sections. Just outside of the village is a golf course and leisure park currently under development. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1824, followed by a Primitive Wesleyan Methodist chapel in 1851; both have ceased being used for worship with the Wesleyan chapel now being the village hall. An Anglican church was also built in the village in 1852, which is now grade II listed. It was built on the site of a previous undated church. The village is one of the few in the UK awarded Fairtrade Village status for promoting fairtrade and local produce. It gained this status on 22 July 2003 and was the second village to do so. In 2011–2012, a flood alleviation scheme was implemented with funding from DEFRA. Like many other places in the East Riding of Yorkshire, Cherry Burton was subject to severe flooding in the 2007 floods. Cherry Burton was served by Cherry Burton railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1865 and 1959, with the station remaining open for another five years for the inward and outward transportation of agricultural produce. The line closed completely in 1965. In 2018, a new footpath from the village to the old railway line opened, which allowed the inhabitants of Cherry Burton to access the Hudson Way, a foot and cycle path built on the formation of the old railway line. Previous to this, to access the path, villagers needed to negotiate the main road out of the village which had no footpaths and where traffic could travel at . ==Gallery== Cherry Burton c early 60s.JPGAerial Photo Cherry Burton Cherry Burton Cricket Club - 15th May 2008.JPGCherry Burton Cricket Club team photo, 15 May 2008 Cherry Burton.jpgA winter day in Cherry Burton Cherry Burton railway station.jpgCherry Burton railway station Cherry Burton-on-Sea - geograph.org.uk - 1402619.jpgCherry Burton in the 2007 floods ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Villages in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Cherry Burton"},{"id":"2570560","text":"One-year-old Red Point Siamese Colorpoint Shorthairs are a variety of domestic cat. Depending on the cat registry, they may be considered a separate breed of cat, or more often a variant of a pre-existing one, if accepted at all. These cats are distinguished by their conformance to wide range of sixteen different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors. The variety was initially created by crossbreeding Siamese with the American Shorthair – the same mixture that created the Oriental Shorthair, but with different goals. The Colorpoint Shorthair shares the point-coloration pattern with the Siamese, but in the nontraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points, and minor variations thereof. In body style, head shape, and other features, it may be intermediate between the two foundation breeds, which show cats leaning toward Siamese traits. Those who favour the Traditional Siamese look may also favour the more moderate-typed Colorpoint Shorthairs that take after their American Shorthair ancestors in shape. The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and the World Cat Federation (WCF) are the only major registries that recognize them as a standalone breed. In other registries, they are part of the Siamese or Oriental Shorthair breeds (and may not be accepted as show and breeding quality, depending on what colors the registry permits in these breeds, and whether they permit any outbreeding in the lineage). Because these cats are a crossbreed, various registries are resistant to accepting either as breeds, or as valid Siamese. ==Description== \\"Colorpoint Shorthair\\" is the name the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), a United States breed association, uses to refer to pointed cats of Siamese ancestry and type in colors other than the four \\"traditional\\" Siamese colors (seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac point). This name is also given to cats of Siamese ancestry in the four recognized colors whose eight generation pedigree show ancestors with other colors. In registries of other countries, however, \\"Colorpoint\\" (or \\"Colourpoint\\") is the name given to cats of Persian type and pointed coloring, as in Himalayans. Two-year-old Red Point Siamese female Three-month-old red point Siamese kitten Mekong Bobtail Blue-cream-torty-point In the CFA, a Colorpoint Shorthair cat may also be any of the four traditional Siamese colors; however, they may only be shown in the red point (also called flame point, in the Persian Family) or cream point, or any of the above colors in tabby point (also called lynx point) or tortoiseshell point. In most registries besides CFA, the Colorpoint Shorthair is not considered a separate breed but merely a color class in the Siamese breed. ==Origin== The effort to produce a Siamese-style pointed cat in colors other than the traditional four began in England and in America in the 1940s, carried out by breeders who used foundation crossings between the Siamese, Abyssinian, and the red domestic shorthair. The American Shorthair also became part of the matrix. Initially, the Colorpoint breeders experienced setbacks and failures; in the effort to achieve the proper colors in the proper places, the Siamese body type was often sacrificed. The breeding was further complicated by the difficulty of working with the red coloration because it is a sex-linked color. ==Temperament== The Colorpoint Shorthair is a highly intelligent, playful, and people-friendly breed. They are extremely affectionate and outgoing and enjoy lounging around and playing with people, causing them to also be described as \\"extroverts\\". They can also be very sensitive with nervous temperaments, which do not adapt well to changes of environment or to strangers. Like Siamese, they can be extremely vocal and attention-demanding, feeling a need for human companionship. They have over 100 vocal sounds, much more than other breeds, making for very unusual meows. Males are sometimes found to be overly aggressive towards other animals and will fight with other cats whenever they feel their territory has been invaded or just to express dominance. ==Point colors== The Colorpoint Shorthair comes in a variety of point colors. They include: Red Point (also called Flame Point), Cream Point, Cinnamon Point, Fawn Point, Seal Point, Chocolate Point, Blue Point, Lilac Point, Lynx Point (in any of the colors), Tortie Point (in any of the colors), and Torbie Point (in any of the colors). If a solid pointed kitten is born from \\"Colorpoint Siamese\\" parents, it is Registered as a \\"Colorpoint Siamese,\\" because it is still genetically a Colorpoint. CFA and CCA do not accept cinnamon points or fawn points as Colorpoint Shorthairs; they are considered to be pointed Oriental Shorthairs. CFA does not allow the cinnamon and fawn points to show. However, they are acceptable in a breeding program. CCA does allow cinnamon and fawn points to be shown as Oriental Shorthairs. ==See also== *Cat coat genetics *Tabby cat ==References* Category:Cat breeds Category:Cat breeds originating in the United States ","title":"Colorpoint Shorthair"},{"id":"2570561","text":"Lydia Moss Bradley (July 31, 1816 - January 16, 1908) was a wealthy bank president and philanthropist notable for her philanthropic works. She founded Bradley Polytechnic Institute in Peoria, Illinois, in 1897.\\"Lydia Moss Bradley,\\" in \\"Discover the Women of the Hall.\\" Seneca Falls, New York: National Women's Hall of Fame, retrieved online June 24, 2018. ==Earlier life== Lydia Moss was born on July 31, 1816 in Vevay, Indiana, alongside the Ohio River. She was a daughter of Loudoun County, Virginia native Zealy Moss and a granddaughter of Revolutionary War chaplain Nathaniel Moss. Her mother was Fauquier County, Virginia native Jeanette (Glasscock) Moss. According to her National Women's Hall of Fame biographical sketch, Lydia Moss \\"grew up on the frontier\\" and was \\"educated in a log home.\\"Lydia Moss Bradley, National Women's Hall of Fame. In fact, she lived in Vevay with her family until she wed Tobias S. Bradley on May 11, 1837. At the age of 31, she and her husband then moved to Peoria, Illinois.Bradley Polytechnic Institute: The first decade, 1897-1907. Over the next three decades they prospered in real estate and banking. Despite his death in 1867 and the prior deaths of all six of their children, Bradley continued to work in business and pursued philanthropic interests, particularly in the areas of healthcare and education. ==Works== In 1875 Bradley became the first female member of a national bank board in the United States when she joined the board of directors of the First National Bank of Peoria (now part of Commerce Bank). Bradley was also one of the first American women ever to draft a marriage contract (a \\"prenuptial agreement\\" in modern terms) to protect her assets. Bradley gave land to the Society of St. Francis to build a hospital, now known as the OSF St. Francis Medical Center. In 1884 she built the Bradley Home for Aged Women to care for widowed and childless women, and funded the construction of the Universalist church in Peoria. Bradley then won a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1903 over a land dispute. She also helped to establish the first park system in Illinois. Bradley always considered Bradley University to be her fondest project, which she established in 1896 to honor her husband Tobias and her six children, who all died at an early age. Originally organized as a four-year academy, Bradley University became a four- year college in 1920 and has continued to grow ever since.Lydia Moss Bradley, National Women's Hall of Fame. Today the university enjoys the status of a fully accredited, independent institution that provides undergraduate and graduate education in engineering, business, communication, teacher education, nursing, physical therapy, fine arts, and the liberal arts and sciences. ==Death and interment== According to biographer Allen A. Upton, Lydia Moss Bradley \\"was confined to her home with illness\\" in December 1907. Initially diagnosed with internal inflammation, she briefly improved under the care of her physician, but her health then declined once again following a revised diagnosis of \\"la grippe\\" in early January 1908. Although in great pain, the now-91-year-old philanthropist reportedly remained alert and engaged with the affairs of her estate. She succumbed to complications from her condition at 7:15 a.m. on January 16, 1908. Following funeral services at her home, she was laid to rest beside her husband at the Springdale Cemetery \\"in the family plot that held the remains of her father, mother, Laura, the five other children and the children of William Moss.\\"Upton, Allen A.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was broadcast on BBC2 on 8 May 1984, as the first episode of the show's second series. Its parody of University Challenge has been widely acclaimed. This scene also showcased the two emerging sides of British comedy at the time: The Young Ones, representative of the new British 'Punk' Alternative Comedy scene, against comedians who represented the new 'Oxbridge' Comedy Scene. ==Plot== An upset Neil bursts into the house, interrupting a story Rick is telling to an uninterested Vyvyan and Mike, and describes an encounter in which a complete stranger called him smelly. Mike realizes that none of the four have washed any laundry for over two years. One of Vyvyan's dirty socks comes to life and tries to escape the house; after they destroy it, Mike insists that they visit the local launderette immediately, but they have to wait until it opens the next morning. After a night's sleep, the four rush downstairs and set out for the launderette, only to find that none of the washing machines will accept their clothing. Vyvyan tricks one machine into opening its door so he can stuff in the load, but the four then discover that they have neither any laundry detergent nor the coins needed to operate the machine. Once they return to their house, Neil suddenly remembers that he and the other four have been invited to represent Scumbag College on University Challenge that evening. Still wearing their dirty clothes, they rush to catch a train as Motörhead perform their song \\"Ace of Spades\\" in the living room. During the train ride, Neil frantically studies some of Rick's old class notes, Rick complains about disparaging comments written in them by his classmates, and Vyvyan has Neil quiz him from a book of bizarre trivia and world records. Ignoring posted warning signs, Vyvyan sticks his head out the window as the train enters a tunnel and accidentally decapitates himself. The four leave the train to chase down Vyvyan's head and ends up hitchhiking to the studio. They arrive two weeks later, bedraggled and filthy, and Vyvyan tries and fails to smuggle in a pig. Mike's friend, Bambi, is the host of University Challenge and a play on host Bamber Gascoigne. He has lost most of his fur and is now walking on two legs, exactly resembling a human, and he declines Rick's request to let Scumbag win. Scumbag is pitted against the incredibly wealthy Footlights College team from Oxbridge, to whom Bambi shows blatant favouritism by accepting wrong answers and bribes. The match is complicated by Neil's desperate need to use a toilet. Enraged at not receiving easier questions, Vyvyan blows up the entire Footlights team with a German stick grenade. The questions become much easier, with Vyvyan recognizing them as being from his book of trivia, but Mike and Neil beat him to the buzzer every time. A trick question fools Rick into admitting that he cheated by swapping the question cards, causing the audience to boo and throw things at Scumbag. They are suddenly squashed by a giant éclair, which belongs to a medical doctor who has been observing the events of the episode as a bacterial culture under his microscope. The episode ends when the doctor later feeds it to an elephant, Jumbo, who is supposedly a horribly disfigured man. ==Cast== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall); and Neil (Nigel Planer). The title character was portrayed by Griff Rhys Jones in a parody of real-life University Challenge presenter Bamber Gascoigne, while Jones' comedy partner Mel Smith has a cameo as a security guard. The opposing University Challenge team, from (the fictional) Footlights College, Oxbridge, comprises Lord Monty (Hugh Laurie); Lord Snot (Stephen Fry: who had himself appeared on University Challenge while a Cambridge student); Miss Money-Sterling (Emma Thompson); and Kendal Mintcake (Ben Elton). Alexei Sayle appears briefly as a train driver to deliver his trademark monologue (in this case to a lone Mexican bandido). Robbie Coltrane portrays Dr Carlisle, who has been observing the episode under a microscope. Tony Robinson portrays Dr Not-The-Nine-O'Clock-News, who brings in the elephant. The episode's musical guests, the heavy metal group Motörhead, perform their 1980 single \\"Ace of Spades\\". ==Criticism== Writing for The Guardian in 2013, Alexei Sayle claimed that \\"Bambi\\" had a detrimental effect on the UK alternative comedy scene of the 1980s, as the guest stars were prominent members of the established Cambridge Footlights, in direct contrast to Sayle's Marxist leanings. ==References== ==External links== * *\\"Bambi\\" at British Comedy Guide Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1984 British television episodes Category:University Challenge Category:Quizzes and game shows in popular culture Category:Motörhead Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Bambi (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2570570","text":"Sir William Walworth (died 1385) was an English nobleman and politician who was twice Lord Mayor of London (1374–75 and 1380–81). He is best known for killing Wat Tyler. His family came from Durham. He was apprenticed to John Lovekyn, who was a member of the Fishmongers Guild, whom he succeeded as Alderman of Bridge Ward in 1368. Walworth became Sheriff of London in 1370 and Lord Mayor of London in 1374. He was Member of Parliament for the City of London in 1371, 1376, 1377, and 1383, as one of the two aldermanic representatives of the city. He is said to have suppressed usury in the city during his term of office as Lord Mayor. His name frequently figures as advancing loans to Richard II. He supported the king's uncle John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster in the city, where there was a strong opposition to John. William Walworth worked for a time in the Customs House under Geoffrey Chaucer. John Gardner, in The Life and Times of Chaucer, contends that Walworth were one of a number of important merchants, all friends of Alice Perrers, who manipulated Edward III. Gardner contends that complaints in the House of Commons demonstrate that this group conspired to keep food prices up, lent money to the king at inflated interest, and through personal and financial influence persuaded the king to issue edicts profitable to themselves.The Life and Times of Chaucer, Barns & Noble Inc., 1977. Walworth's most famous exploit was his encounter with Wat Tyler during the English peasants' revolt of 1381, in his second term of office as Lord Mayor. In June of that year, when Tyler and his followers entered south London, Walworth defended London Bridge against them. He was with Richard II when he met the insurgents at Smithfield, and killed the rebel leader with his baselard. Walworth raised the city bodyguard in the king's defence, for which service he was rewarded by knighthood and a pension. He subsequently served on two commissions to restore the peace in the county of Kent. Statue of Sir William Walworth at Holborn Viaduct He died in 1385, and was buried in the church of St. Michael, Crooked Lane, of which he was a considerable benefactor. Sir William Walworth was the most distinguished member of the Fishmongers Guild, and he invariably figured in the pageants prepared by them when one of their members attained the mayoralty. He became a favorite hero in popular tales, and appeared in Richard Johnson's Nine Worthies of London in 1592. William Walworth is commemorated with a statue on Holborn Viaduct, near the boundary of the City of London. His wife, Margaret, survived him; she died before 1413. ==See also== * List of Sheriffs of the City of London * List of Lord Mayors of London * City of London (elections to the Parliament of England)

Kingdom-based political website. Founded in 2001, openDemocracy claims that through reporting and analysis of social and political issues, they seek to \\"challenge power and encourage democratic debate\\" across the world. The founders of the website have been involved with established media and political activism. It has been funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation among other organisations including the Open Society Foundation the National Endowment for Democracy, the Ford Foundation and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. ==History== openDemocracy was founded in 2000 by Anthony Barnett, David Hayes, Susan Richards and Paul Hilder. Publishing started in May 2001.Tony Bennett (Autumn/Winter 2005-06). \\"Opening up democracy, interview with the founder of openDemocracy.net Anthony Barnett\\" (PDF). Society Matters (8): 15. Retrieved 2017-01-26. Originally attracting a meager following, visits to openDemocracy's website grew exponentially following the September 11 attacks after it published an article by Todd Gitlin on the subject, who was in New York during the attacks. In it, Gitlin wrote that what was needed was \\"a focused military response— a precise one, not a revenge spasm... but an action that distinguishes killers from civilians.\\" openDemocracy began receiving daily international contributors and many Americans who were dissatisfied with their media's coverage on the issue logged onto the website for an alternative source. With a shift to a more broad base, the e-magazine \\"became a forum of debate for political activists, academics, journalists, businesspeople, politicians, and international civil servants from around the world\\" drawing interest from charitable sponsors. By 2002, the three main topics of debate covered on the website were: the impact of globalisation, the use and abuse of American power around the world and the character of Islam. As the magazine grew, so did its coverage of topics from climate change and regulation of global markets to the future of multiculturalism and the impact of migration. openDemocracy's mission statement asserts: \\"With human rights as our central guiding focus, we ask tough questions about freedom, justice and democracy. We give those fighting for their rights the agency to make their case and to inspire action.” In 2008, the website averaged 224,000 monthly visits while receiving visits from 229 countries in the previous two years. It attracts around 8 million hits a year. openDemocracy is owned and published through a non-profit foundation. It has been funded by a number of philanthropic organisations, including George Soros' Open Society Initiative for Europe, the Mott Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Ford Foundation, David and Elaine Potter Foundation, Lush, Andrew Wainwright Trust and the Network for Social Change. Founder Anthony Barnett, Charter 88 organiser and political campaigner, was the first editor (2001–2005) and Isabel Hilton was editor from 2005–2007. She was succeeded by Rosemary Bechler. In 2012 the editor-in-chief was Magnus Nome who was then succeeded by Mary Fitzgerald. In May 2017, openDemocracy helped sponsor The Convention on Brexit. ==References== ==External links== * Category:British political websites Category:Internet properties established in 2001 ","title":"OpenDemocracy"},{"id":"2570610","text":"Morris Michael Edelstein (February 5, 1888 – June 4, 1941) was a Polish-born Congressional Representative from the state of New York. Edelstein was born in Meseritz (Międzyrzec Podlaski), Poland, and at three years of age immigrated to the United States with his parents, who settled in New York City. He attended public schools and Cooper Union College in New York. He graduated from the Brooklyn Law School of St. Lawrence University, in 1909, and was admitted to the bar in 1910 and practiced law in New York. Edelstein was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-sixth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William I. Sirovich. He was reelected to the Seventy-seventh Congress and served from February 6, 1940, until his death on June 4, 1941, in the cloakroom of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC, after completing the delivery of a speech on the floor of the House. ==June 4, 1941== Edelstein's last speech was a response to Mississippi Representative John Elliott Rankin, widely described as an anti-Semite who advocated peace with Nazi Germany. Rankin had just delivered a House floor speech accusing \\"international Jewish brethren\\" of trying to drag America into World War II. In response, Edelstein, who was Jewish said: \\"Hitler started out by speaking about 'Jewish brethren.' It is becoming the play and the work of those people who want to demagogue to speak about their 'Jewish brethren' and 'international bankers.' ... I deplore the idea that ... men in this House ... attempt to use the Jews as their scapegoat. I say it is unfair and I say it is un-American. ... All men are created equal, regardless of race, creed or color, and whether a man be Jew or Gentile, he may think what he deems fit.\\" Edelstein then walked out of the House. He collapsed and died shortly afterwards in the House cloakroom. He is buried in Mount Zion Cemetery, Maspeth, New York. ==Legacy== The SS M.

Vukanović (1907–1997) was a Serbian ethnologist of the Balkans region of south-eastern Europe. Born in Vranje, Southern Serbia, he concentrated on the history, folklore and culture of the Serb and Roma (Gypsy) inhabitants of Yugoslavia in general and the southern province of Kosovo in particular, as well as in gender issues, most specifically of sworn virgins,Cf. a text about \\"Third gender\\"“Sexual tendencies toward females seem to be present in [some cases], albeit in a rather limited and repressed way. Although I found no trace of liaisons with women, cohabitation of masculine ‘sworn virgins’ with female partners is not completely unknown. I know of three such couples, in two of which a sexual relationship is actually indicated. At least two of these three couples were bound by ‘blood- sisterhood,’ a kind of ritual or spiritual kinship that, however, does not usually include living together. According to Tatomir Vukanovic, sworn virgins were in some places ill reputed for ‘certain abnormal sexual relations’ with their blood-sisters.” (From the chapter “Woman Becomes Man in the Balkans” by Rene Gremaux; of “Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History” Edited by Gilbert Herdt.) the latter due to the fact that he himself was gayAs remarked by Dejan Medaković in Efemeris which in homophobic Socialist Yugoslavia led to his marginalisation as a scholar and demise from positions of authority to which he had aspired as a Josip Broz Tito's partisan guerilla petty officer. ==Bibliography== * \\"The Vampire\\".

Meos speak Mewati. ==History and origin== Meos are inhabitants of Mewat, a region that consists of Mewat district in Haryana and some parts of adjoining Alwar and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh, where the Meos have lived for a millennium. According to one theory, they were Hindu Rajputs who converted to Islam between the 12th and 17th centuries, until as late as Aurangzeb's rule but they have maintained their age-old distinctive cultural identity until today. According to S. L. Sharma and R. N. Srivastava, Mughal persecution had little effect of strengthening their Islamic identity, but it reinforced their resistance to Mughal rule. Despite pressure by the princely states of Alwar and Bharatpur, who ruled in the region, the Meo community decided not to migrate to Pakistan during the Partition of India. In 1947, Mahatma Gandhi visited Ghasera, a village in present day Nuh district to urge the Muslims living there not to leave, calling the Meos “Iss desh ke reed ke haddi” or the backbone of India. ===Hindu origins=== Meo profess the beliefs of Islam but the roots of their ethnic structure are in Hindu caste society. The neighbouring Hindu Jats, Minas, Ahirs and Rajputs share the same mores. According to some sources, the Meo community may have a common origin with the Meena community. Hindu inhabitants of Mewat, although belonging to the same Kshatriya castes to which the Meos belonged before conversion to Islam, are not called Meo. Thus the word \\"Meo\\" is both region-specific and religion-specific. Apparently, Meos come from many Hindu clans who converted to Islam and amalgamated as Meo community. ===Connection with other Hindus communities in Mewat region=== Many Rajasthani Meos retain mixed Hindu-Muslim names. Names such as Ram Khan or Shankar Khan are not unusual in the Meo tracts in Alwar. The Muslim community of Meos was highly Hinduised before independence. Meos celebrated Diwali and Holi as they celebrated two Eids (Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha). They do not marry within one's Gotras like Hindus of the north though Islam permits marriage with cousins. Solemnization of marriage among Meos was not complete without both Nikah as in Islam. Meos believe that they are direct descendants of Krishna and Rama even as they claim to be among the unnamed prophets of God referred to in the Quran.Resisting Regimes: Myth, Memory and the Shaping of a Muslim Identity by Shail Mayaram. ==Cultural aspects== ===Marriage and kinship customs=== Meos generally do not follow the Muslim law of inheritance and so among them, like various other communities in the region, custom makes a younger brother or a cousin marry the widow of the deceased by a simple Nikah ceremony. The Meo have been subject to a number of recent ethnographic studies. These books have dealt with issues such as marriage and self- perception of the community. Raymond Jamous studied kinship and rituals among the Meo and wrote a book.Kinship and Rituals Among the Meo of Northern India : Locating Sibling Relationship/Raymond Jamous. Translated from the French by Nora Scott. New Delhi, Oxford University Press, 2003, xiv, 200 p., ills., tables, $31. . ==Geography and demography== The boundary of Mewat region is not precisely defined. The region largely consists of plains but has hills of Aravali range. The inconsistency in Mewat topography is evident from its patches of land with hills and hillock of the Aravali on the one hand and plains on the other. The region is semi-arid with scanty rainfall and this has defined the vocations the Meos follow. They are peasants, agriculturists and cattle breeders.People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal & N.N Vyas page 638 to 640 Popular Prakashan ==Meo gotra== Meo profess the beliefs of Islam but the roots of their ethnic structure are in Hindu caste society. Meos claim high-caste Hindu Rajput descent. This may be true for some of them. However, some of them may be descendants of other castes who might have laid claim to Rajput ancestry after converting to Islam to enhance their social standing. The names of many gots (gotra) or exogamous lineages of Meos are common with other Hindu castes as Meena, Ahir and Gujjar who live in their vicinity. It thus seems possible that the Meos belonged to many different castes and not just to the Rajputs (Aggarwal 1978:338)., but this phenomenon is also seen in other Rajput communities and not limited to the Meos, in particular.Caste and Kinship in Kangra By Jonathan P. Parry Pg.133Caste and Kinship in Central India By Adrian C. Mayer Pg.161-163 ==Meos outside Mewat== ===Uttar Pradesh=== In Uttar Pradesh, the Meos are found mainly in the western regions of Rohilkhand and Doab. Unlike those of Mewat, the Uttar Pradesh Meos are dispersed. Their main gotras in the state are the Chhirklot, Dalut, Demrot, Pandelot, Balot, Dawar, Kalesa, Landawat, Rattawat, Dingal and Singhal. The Uttar Pradesh Meos maintain a system of community endogamy, and gotra exogamy. The Meos of UP are a community of small farmers, and urban wage labourers. The Meo also extend to Meerut District. The Doab Meos now speak Urdu, and have abandoned Mewati. Separate from the Doab Meo are the Meo of Rohilkhand. Culturally they are now indistinguishable from the neighbouring Muslim communities. They are found mainly in Moradabad, Bareilly, Rampur and Pilibhit districts. These Meo are said to have Mewat in the 18th Century, fleeing the great famine of 1783, and these Meo are generally referred to by the term Mewati. They now speak Khari Boli and Urdu, and no longer maintain a system of gotra exogamy, with now many practicising parallel-cousin marriages. ===Delhi=== The Meo in Delhi are found mainly in the neighbourhood of Walled City (Kucha Pandit Lal Kuan, Gali Shahtara Ajmri Gate and Bara Hindu Rao), Azadpur, Hauz Khas, Mehrauli and various outlying villages with names ending in Sarai which have become urbanised. All their villages have been swallowed up by ever-expanding Delhi city. The growth of urban Delhi has led to the abandonment of the Mewati dialect in favour of Hindi, which is now their main language. Similarly, there has been a decline in the power of the caste council (panchayat). The Meos of Delhi have maintained gotra exogamy, very rarely marrying into their own gotra.People of India Delhi Volume XX edited by T Ghosh & S Nath pp. 469−474 Manohar Publications ==References== Category:Muslim communities of Uttar Pradesh Category:Muslim communities of Rajasthan ","title":"Meo (ethnic group)"},{"id":"2570640","text":"A wayzgoose (or wayz-goose, waygoose or wayzegoose) was at one time an entertainment given by a master printer to his workmen each year on or about St Bartholomew's Day (24 August). It marked the traditional end of summer and the start of the season of working by candlelight. Later, the word came to refer to an annual outing and dinner for the staff of a printing works or the printers on a newspaper. In modern times, the tradition has been adopted by large publishing and educational sales companies in The United States. Southwestern Advantage throws an annual festival at the end of the summer/fall (early September) for their most successful dealers to celebrate a long summer of work. The festivities largely consist of several days of chanting, games, and libations. == Possible derivations == The derivation of the term is doubtful. It may be a misspelling for \\"waysgoose\\", from wase, Middle English for \\"sheaf\\", thus meaning \\"sheaf\\" or \\"harvest goose\\", a bird eaten at harvest- time, cf. the \\"stubble-goose\\" mentioned by Chaucer in The Cook's Prologue. The most likely origin is the word \\"Weg(s)huis\\", which was current in early Modern Dutch. This word (literally, \\"way house\\") was one of several words meaning the English \\"inn\\" and was figuratively used for \\"a banquet\\". The Low Country origin of the word \\"wayzgoose\\" has never seriously been disputed by etymologists, seeing that much early chapel terminology was borrowed from Low Country printers by their English apprentices (and later journeymen). The variety of spellings and pronunciations (including with and without the \\"z\\") indicate that it is an orally-borrowed Dutch word that fit somewhat uneasily in the mouth of English speakers. Another plausible origin is a more general word for a merry-making or feast, reputedly referring to the grand goose-feast annually held at Waes, in Brabant, at Martinmas. However that is pronounced quite differently, as \\"Waas\\". It apparently means \\"cloud-veil\\" in Dutch: also there are no places called Waes or Waas in Brabant, but there are several places with \\"Waes\\" in their name in East Flanders. Relations between England and the Low Countries were often very close, and it is plausible that such entertainments might have grown to be called colloquially a \\"Waes-Goose\\". It is not clear why the term should have survived later in the printing trade. Certainly the goose has long ago parted company with the printers' wayzgoose, which was usually held in July, though it had no fixed season. A keepsake was often printed to commemorate the occasion. It could be printed ahead of time, or the printing could form part of the evening's activities. Some bookbinders believe that Wayzgoose was held on St Bartholomew's Day because he was the patron saint of leather workers. It was no coincidence that on 24 August 1456 the printing of the Gutenberg Bible was completed, perhaps triggering the very first wayzgoose party at Fust–Schöffer shop in Mainz. The holiday, a break in printing, was traditionally also the day that papermakers took a break from making paper for the printers, and used up the last of the pulp to make paper for windows, waxed paper being the traditional window material for the yeoman class before the use of glass became more widespread, and after this was done, the pulp vats would be cleaned out for the new fibre, made from rags collected in the spring, and retted (prepared by rotting) over the summer. The paper windows were fitted on St. Martin's Day (11 November). Just as the saint had supposedly cut his cloak in half to share with a beggar during a snowstorm, so yeoman farmers would give offcuts of the windows to the poor, to help them keep warm during the coming winter. Parchment was the original mediaeval material for keeping northern homes warm, for those who could not afford glass for the windows. The patron saint of parchment makers was the same St Bartholomew. With paper replacing parchment, the name of the traditional Martinmas party, the Wayzgoose, might have been transferred to both papermakers' and printers' parties. == Contemporary uses == Since 1979, the Grimsby, Ontario Public Art Gallery has held its annual Wayzgoose festival showing handmade books and paper arts and demonstrating their technologies. The festival occurs on the last Saturday in April. The wayzgoose is held in the Grimsby Art Gallery. The town produces a limited edition anthology showing samples of the work by private presses and celebrating print media and book arts across Canada and internationally. In addition to publishers with displays at the fair, the anthology includes the work of private presses that cannot come to Grimsby for the event. The usual edition is 115 copies. To celebrate its 35th anniversary, the gallery published a two-volume anthology in an edition of 135 copies. For almost 20 years the Letterpress Guild of New England has met in late September for their annual Wayzgoose. In 2009, Coach House Books, an independent Canadian press, began hosting an annual Wayzgoose Party, in celebration of buying the building which they had rented since 1965. The University of California, Irvine's student government (ASUCI) hosts a medieval fair called Wayzgoose every April for an open house event known as Celebrate UCI. Minnesota Center for Book Arts, a contemporary art center preserving traditional printing and bookmaking crafts, celebrates an annual Wayzgoose in appreciation of its donors and members. Tacoma, Washington holds an annual Wayzgoose event dubbed a \\"printer's celebration\\". This event, which includes a large-scale relief printing project using a steamroller, is designed to get the community interested and involved in the art of printmaking. The School of Visual Concepts in Seattle, Washington also celebrates an annual Wayzgoose festival which includes a \\"Steamroller Smackdown\\" competition. The Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin holds a Wayzgoose in November. The event is a multi-day conference with presentations and workshops by letterpress printers and historians. The Museum of Printing (in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia) held its first Wimble's Wayzgoose on 28–30 April 2017. It is named after the FT Wimble & Co. Collection which is housed at the museum. The Ann Arbor District Library in Ann Arbor, MI hosted their inaugural url=https://aadl.org/wayzgoose Wayzgoose & Printing Festival in 2018. It is now an annual event with lectures, exhibits, vendors, learning workshops, and a tour around town. ==Cultural references== Wharfedale Wayzgoose is the name of a Border Morris side (team of Morris dancers) from Otley, West Yorkshire, a town renowned for the development of the Wharfedale printing press. In 1928, South African poet Roy Campbell wrote a satirical poem, The Wayzgoose, about racism in South Africa. In 1978 a children's sketch comedy TV show entitled Wayzgoose was produced and screened for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The series ran for about ten half-hour episodes. == References == == External links == * Yale University Library article on Wayzgoose Category:Traditions Category:Printing ","title":"Wayzgoose"},{"id":"2570642","text":"The three letter abbreviation LCR may stand for: ==Molecular biology== * Leucocyanidin reductase, an enzyme in the leucocyanidin biosynthesis pathway * Ligase chain reaction, a method for DNA amplification similar to the polymerase chain reaction * Locus Control Region, a phrase used in epigenetics in molecular biology * Low copy repeats ==Organizations== * LifeWay Christian Resources, a Nashville, TN, USA, based Christian publisher * Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire, a former political party in France * Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire, a political party in Belgium * Lutheran Churches of the Reformation * Log Cabin Republicans, a LGBT organization that supports the U.S. Republican Party * London and Continental Railways, a railway company based in the United Kingdom, owners of the contract to build and operate High Speed 1 * Louis Christen Racing, a company, named after its owner, that manufactures sidecar road racing chassis ==Other== * Landing Craft Rubber, an inflatable rubber boat used to carry troops * Lake County Railroad, a railroad company based in Lakeview, Oregon, United States, owned by the Lake County government and operated by the Modoc Northern Railroad * LCR circuit * LCR meter * Lead and copper rule, a regulation issued under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act * Least-cost routing, the process of selecting the path of outbound communications traffic based on cost * Left/Center/Right, a speaker designation type used in surround sound * Line Concentration Ratio in a remote concentrator * Liquidity Coverage Ratio, a global minimum liquidity standard that is part of Basel III * Loughborough Campus Radio * Low Chip Rate, one of the two transmission modes of UMTS-TDD 3G standard * Low Claims Rebate (Insurance terminology) * Ruger LCR, a revolver made by the Ruger company * Team LCR, a motorcycle team currently competing in MotoGP * Level crossing ratio * Lateral Connection Rehabilitation, a trenchless method for repairing the connection between a sanitary sewer lateral and its associated main ","title":"LCR"},{"id":"2570643","text":"Stones River National Battlefield, a park along the Stones River in Rutherford County, Tennessee, three miles (5 km) northwest of Murfreesboro and twenty- eight miles southeast of Nashville, memorializes the Battle of Stones River.

Styles, Stones River National Battlefield Historic Resource Study (National Park Service, 2004),1. ==Creation of the National Battlefield== The national battlefield was established through the efforts of both private individuals, the Stones River Battlefield and Park Association, the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (in 2011, part of CSX Transportation), and a 1927 act of Congress authorizing a national military park under the jurisdiction of the War Department.Styles, 1. During the early years of the twentieth century, the railroad emphasized the battlefield as a destination to increase passenger traffic. It promoted veteran reunions and acquired parts of the battlefield as points of historical interest. In 1906, the company erected a obelisk to commemorate the January 2, 1863, position of massed Union artillery used to repel a Confederate assault on Union troops across the river.Styles, 64–65. A cannon at Stones River National BattlefieldThe Stones River Battlefield and Park Association was chartered on April 28, 1896, after the establishment of Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park increased interest in preserving significant Civil War battlefields. The association secured options on property connected with the battle, reportedly by June 1897. Association members erected wooden signs to mark and interpret battlefield locations.Styles, 65; Jesse W. Sparks, \\"Stones River Battlefield and Park Association,\\" Confederate Veteran, 5, No.1 (1897): 31; Sparks, \\"The Stone's River Battle-Field,\\" Confederate Veteran, 6, No. 2 (1898): 58. In 1912, the Association lobbied to have Congress \\"establish an accurate system of markers,\\" but the measure failed, in part because of the testimony of former congressman and Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Park Commissioner Charles H. Grosvenor, who believed the landmarks had been \\"entirely obliterated.\\"Styles, 66. Land acquisition began in 1928 and was completed in 1934. In 1992, the park accepted a donation from the City of Murfreesboro of an intact segment of Fortress Rosecrans, the largest enclosed earthwork built during the Civil War. The park preserves less than a fifth of the more than 3,000 acres (12 km2) over which the battle was fought. On March 3, 1927, the site was established as Stones River National Military Park. It was transferred from the War Department to the U.S. Department of the Interior's National Park Service on August 10, 1933, and redesignated as a national battlefield on April 22, 1960. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (October 15, 1966). On April 10, 2009, the Good Friday tornado damaged the battlefield park.Several trees were toppled, and the park closed for three weeks: Historynet's Tornado Strikes Stones River National Battlefield Park Since 1997 the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield in four acquisitions.

The electrophilic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction is the iminium ion CH2+NR2. The initial reaction product is an iminium which is hydrolyzed to the aldehyde.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC Two on 15 May 1984. ==Plot== The quartet are so poor that they are burning their clothes and belongings just to keep warm. Neil prepares meals of snow passed off as risotto, and Vyvyan goes around the neighbourhood to find winter fuel although the episode is set in September. Eventually they decide that someone needs to get a job to bring money into the house, but when the only vacancy advertised in the local paper is for the Army, Rick and Mike both rule themselves out on medical grounds (perforated eardrum and flat feet, respectively), while Vyvyan declares that he is pregnant, leaving Neil the only one to take the job. After a poor haircut and a quick loan of Mike's suit, Neil goes to join up, but having been told not to mention it, is rejected for being a pacifist. After spotting a recruitment poster for the police, the other three throw Neil into the police station next door, where he meets Alexei Sayle's character, a Mussolini-lookalike. While the others get lucky when a lorry full of food and expensive furnishings crashes through the front window, Neil takes to his new job - arresting a bunch of his drugged-up hippie friends, where the track Electrick Gypsies by Steve Hillage is playing on the record player until he pulls the plug on it and says - \\"Oh no, Steve Hillage!\\" Arriving home, Neil tries to arrest his flatmates, assuming they have stolen the luxury items. His harsh use of the baton forces Vyvyan into labour. Mike leaves the room, being afraid of the sight of childbirth. Instead, Vyvyan actually ends up passing wind loudly. Having been handcuffed together with Vyvyan, Rick and Neil frantically try to escape the smell but Neil is unable to find the key. Unaware, Mike comes back in, and tries to light a celebratory cigar. The flame reacts with the gas, causing the house to explode. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). Alexei Sayle starred as a Benito Mussolini cabaret act and police recruitment officer. DJ Alan Freeman plays God, sitting at a radio mixing desk, on the first of two occasions in the series. ==Edits== The episode features a performance from Ken Bishop's Nice Twelve, a one-off conglomerate of high-profile rock musicians and theme writers, including Jools Holland, Simon Brint, Stewart Copeland and Chris Difford performing \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" by Bob Dylan. For contractual reasons, this was edited out of DVD releases in the past, but was reinstated for the 25th Anniversary edition. On the original release DVDs, to go with the edit, the scenes of the main cast are cut, all bar the scene where they take Neil to the job centre. The band's name is also edited out of the credits, but rather than simply erase the name, the portion of credits with the group name is cut, with the credits before and after that intersected by a thick orange line, which also shows two sets of footage playing. However, when a total list of all cast members of all 12 episodes of the series are in the credits for \\"Summer Holiday\\", the names of the three musicians are not taken out.

In 1951 Macpherson received a BA from Carleton College (now Carleton University) in 1951, followed by a year at University College in London. She received a BLS from McGill University, and then completed her MA and PhD at Victoria College, University of Toronto, both supervised by professor and critic Northrop Frye. Macpherson published poetry in Contemporary Verse in 1949. Her first book was published in 1952. In 1954 Macpherson began her own small press, Emblem Books, which published her second volume, O Earth Return. Between 1954 and 1963, Emblem Books published eight chapbooks featuring the work of Canadian poets, including Dorothy Livesay, Alden Nowlan, and Al Purdy.\\"Macpherson, Jay,\\" Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1988), 623.) Macpherson's two earlier volumes were incorporated into The Boatman (1957), a book which \\"gained her a considerable reputation. Dedicated to Northrop Frye and his wife, the collection reflects Frye's emphasis on the mythic and archetypal properties of poetry.\\" The Boatman won the Governor General's Award in 1958. Macpherson taught English at Victoria College from 1957 until 1996. She became a Professor of English in 1974.\\"Jay Macpherson (Jay Jean Macpherson) Biography,\\" Encyclopedia of Literature, 4911, JRank.org, Web, Apr. 10, 2011. Her 1982 book The Spirit of Solitude is \\"a highly regarded study of the elegiac and pastoral traditions from the 17th century onward.\\" Jay Macpherson died on Mar 21, 2012. ==Writing== Macpherson has been described \\"as a 'mythopoeic' poet - rooted in the teachings of Frye, the archetypes of Carl Jung, and the intensely conservative social vision of T.S. Eliot.\\" Within her work, \\"recurring themes involve the creation, fall, flood, redemption and the apocalypse.\\" Her interest is in \\"authentic myth\\", \\"the ones that have some imaginative force behind them.\\" In technique, Macpherson has been placed \\"beside Margaret Avison, P. K. Page, Phyllis Webb, but especially Anne Hébert - particularly in the use of the Gothic and macabre themes and devices.\\" ===The Boatman=== Macpherson's first major work, The Boatman (1957), \\"describes a world where redemption is still possible.\\" Northrop Frye (to whom The Boatman was dedicated) called it the \\"one good book\\" of Canadian poetry for that year. He added: \\"There is little use looking for bad lines or lapses in taste: The Boatman is completely successful within the conventions it adopts, and anyone dissatisfied with the book must quarrel with the conventions. Among these are the use of a great variety of echoes, some of them direct quotations from other poems, and an interest in myth, both Biblical and Classical.\\"Northrop Frye, \\"Letters in Canada - 1957,\\" The Bush Garden (Toronto:Anansi, 1971, 70-76. The Boatman of the title \\"is Noah, but both Noah and the ark itself form an allegory for the artist and the artistic experience, the ark representing Jung's collective unconscious.\\" \\"The creation is inside its creator, and the ark similarly attempts to explain to Noah ... that it is really inside him, as Eve was once inside Adam: When the four quarters shall Turn in and make one whole, Then I who wall your body, Which is to me a soul, Shall swim circled by you And cradled on your tide, Who was not even, not ever, Taken from your side. \\"As the ark expands into the flooded world, the body of the Biblical leviathan, and the order of nature, the design of the whole book begins to take shape. The Boatman begins with a poem called 'Ordinary People in the Last Days,' a wistful poem about an apocalypse that happens to everyone except the poet, and ends with a vision of a 'Fisherman' who ... catches 'myriad forms,' eats them, drinks the lake they are in, and is caught in his turn by God.\\" ===Welcoming Disaster=== Macpherson's next major work, Welcoming Disaster (1974), \\"employs more complex forms to pursue its quest for meaning; the poems frequently succeed in maintaining imaginative contact with social reality while extending Macpherson's essential concern with psychological and metaphysical conditions.\\" George Woodcock saw Welcoming Disaster and The Boatman as similar, even complementary: \\"They are narratives of journeys into spiritual day and night, disguised, no doubt, by all the devices of privacy, but nonetheless derived from true inner experiences.\\" Margaret Atwood emphasized their differences: \\"If The Boatman is 'classical,' . . . then Welcoming Disaster is, by the same lights, 'romantic': more personal, more convoluted, darker and more grotesque, its rhythms more complex\\"W.J. Keith, \\"Jay Macpherson's Welcoming Disaster: a Reconsideration,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews,\\" No. 36 (Spring/Summer 1995), UWO, Web, Apr. 12, 2011. \\"Welcoming Disaster, has the critics baffled. They cannot agree on its proper interpretation - is it a darker, more tragic vision or is the possibility of redemption there?\\" Suniti Namjoshi saw it as a book about redemption: about the necessity \\"to hit bottom and then to make the journey up\\"; \\"after a descent into the underworld ... it is possible to return to the ordinary world of everyday life\\". David Bromwich, reviewing the book in Poetry, saw it as even more positive: for him, it \\"moves from consolation to guilt to terror and finally to a deepened consolation.\\" On the other hand, Lorraine Weir interpreted the book to be saying that the \\"underworld journey of redemption ... fails\\". \\"Fertility is not restored, the underworld is not left behind.\\" Weir calls Macpherson's vision \\"inescapably a tragic one.\\" ==Recognition== Macpherson won Poetry magazine's Levinson Prize, and the University of Western Ontario President's Medal, in 1957. She won the Governor General's Award for The Boatman in 1958.

It was meant to defuse the growing tension between the American military and the locals. The euphoria of victory over Germany was short-lived, and within months of Liberation, tensions began to rise between the French and the U.S. military personnel stationed in the country, with the former seeing the latter as arrogant and wanting to flaunt their wealth, and the latter seeing the former as proud and resentful. Fights were breaking out more often, and fears were raised, even among high officials, that the situation might eventually lead to a breakdown of civil order. Set out in a question-and- answer format, 112 Gripes about the French posed a series of well-rehearsed complaints about the French, and then provided a common-sense rejoinder to each of them — the aim of the authors being to bring the average American soldier to a fuller understanding of his hosts.

She is the daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The character is born in the serial, conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, at the time of the first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Early suspects were Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), but then four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts. As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car to give it all away: Den Watts is the father of Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. Vicki's character was written out in 1995, after Susan Tully, who played Vicki's mother Michelle, decided to leave the soap. After an eight-year absence, she was reintroduced by Executive Producer Louise Berridge in 2003 as a rebellious teenager. Her reintroduction was part of the soap's attempt to rebuild the Watts clan, a successful family headed by Den, that featured prominently in the 1980s. Johnson quit the role in 2004. The media was generally critical about the character upon her return due to her American accent and its sudden disappearance. During the character's original stint, a storyline featuring Vicki being kidnapped was criticised due to its coincidental airing alongside the real-life abduction and murder of toddler James Bulger. ==Storylines== ===1986–1995=== 16-year-old Michelle Fowler gets pregnant in 1985 after a one-night stand with her best friend Sharon's (Letitia Dean) father, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Her family decide Michelle should have an abortion but she refuses, keeping the baby but keeping the father's name a secret. Vicki, named in honour of her great-grandparents Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Lou's late husband Albert, is born in 1986 and Den is allowed to hold her but he and Michelle agree that he should keep his distance so nobody guesses he is her father. Michelle raises Vicki with her fiancé, Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), who she marries after jilting him at the altar, although Den provides for Vicki secretly. After Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) realises that she has had a phantom pregnancy, she is devastated and suggests to Michelle that she lets her and Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) adopt Vicki, which infuriates Michelle. Vicki's grandmother, Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), realises Den is Vicki's father when she sees him give money to Michelle and slaps him. Lofty begins to pressure Michelle to let him adopt Vicki and have another child, but their marriage soon breaks down after Michelle has an abortion and Michelle refuses to name Vicki's father upon Lofty's departure. When Den is shot and presumed dead, Michelle tells Sharon that Vicki is her half-sister and Sharon is devastated whilst Arthur is furious. Vicki survives meningitis but Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) fails to diagnose it, reuniting Michelle and Sharon. Michelle decides to go on the run with Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) after he is accused of murdering Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), taking Vicki and Kofi Tavernier (Marcel Smith), Clyde's son, with them. Michelle and Clyde are caught by the police when trying to flee the country and Vicki and Kofi are sent to a children's home, but are later collected by their grandmothers. Vicki is kidnapped when an old woman, Audrey Whittingham (Shirley Dixon), takes her from outside her school. A national police investigation is launched and Vicki is returned home safely. When Michelle is shot by Dougie Briggs (Max Gold), Vicki discovers she is Sharon's half-sister when she stays with Sharon and her husband, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and the following day, Sharon tells Vicki about her father, which infuriates Michelle. The truth about Vicki's paternity spreads and Michelle's aunt, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), is upset about not being told by Michelle herself, finding out from Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton). In October 1995, Michelle and 9-year-old Vicki leave Walford for Birmingham, Alabama, in the United States. ===2003–2004=== A teenage Vicki returns to Walford in February 2003 when she runs away from home. She has been arguing regularly with Michelle and it is decided that she can stay in Walford. After clashing with her grandmother Pauline, Vicki moves in with Sharon. Manipulative and mischievous, Vicki does as she pleases. Just weeks later, she discovers that she and Sharon have a half-brother, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) – and persuades him to move to Walford. When she becomes pregnant by Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker), Sharon, who believes she is infertile, offers Vicki £10,000 to give her the baby to bring up as her own. Spencer wants to be a father but Vicki terminates the pregnancy. Dennis soon tells Vicki that Den, who had supposedly died in 1989, is alive and living in Spain, and she brings him back to the Square to reunite with his family. She's horrified to discover that Sharon and Dennis have started a romantic relationship. Although they aren't biologically related, Vicki cannot accept it and rebels by dating Ash Ferreira (Raji James), which ends when he realizes that she is using him to get at her siblings. Eventually, Vicki and Den's objections take their toll on Sharon and Dennis and they end the relationship. In 2004, an 18-year-old Vicki starts a relationship with her 46-year-old college lecturer, Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah); her family, particularly stepmother Chrissie Watts (Tracy- Ann Oberman), are outraged. Tommy feigns love for Vicki and they talk about leaving Walford to go travelling. Knowing that Tommy is untrustworthy, Chrissie attempts to seduce him. After a brief kiss, Chrissie strips him naked in the toilets of The Queen Victoria public house, on the promise that she will soon join him. She steals his clothes and forces Vicki to see him for the lying cheat he is. Vicki is devastated and initially furious with Chrissie but eventually realizes she had her best interests at heart. During a family meal on Christmas Day 2004, Sharon and Dennis announce that they have resumed their romantic relationship, only for Dennis's girlfriend Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) to announce that she is pregnant. Sharon decides to go to America alone and persuades Dennis to stay with Zoe and their baby. Den talks to Sharon alone, trying to persuade her to stay. Vicki overhears him say he does not love Vicki as much as he loves Sharon. Deciding she cannot live with such a father, Vicki decides to return to her mother in America. It is later revealed that she has moved to Australia and reunited with Spencer. In January 2014, Sharon tells Spencer's brother, Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), that they need someone to help them open a bar in Sydney, so Alfie goes there for a few weeks to work with them. When Lofty returns to Walford in 2019, he gives Martin a £20,000 cheque to give to Vicki. ==Creation and development== ===Conception and childhood characterisation=== The conception of Vicki Fowler in 1985 was one of the first controversial storylines featured in EastEnders since its inception that February, as it involved the pregnancy of a schoolgirl, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Exploiting a whodunnit angle, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 on episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a car pulled up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leapt out of a car and gave it all away: Den Watts had fathered Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. Baby Emma Henry originated the role and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully \\"Mummy Shell\\" and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, \\"Daddy Sharon\\". Tully has commented, \\"What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved for a couple of weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me.\\" Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, \\"[Samantha] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her\\". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator. In 1995, after 9 years onscreen being featured in various plot lines such as kidnapping, Vicki was written out of EastEnders, moving to America with Michelle. ===Recast (2003)=== In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge decided to reintroduce the character 8 years after she had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, the second stage of the audition process was an interview with EastEnders' Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue in front of a camera and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: \\"At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing—I'd been guessing for ages!\\" Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: \\"I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!\\" The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house. To signify the character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was required to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, \\"It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it.\\" After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained the reason for the change in 2004: \\"The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. It's not something that's going to fit in for a long period of time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life.\\" The reintroduction of Vicki was part of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's \\"iconic\\" father Den, Johnson said, \\"I was 2 when he left EastEnders [in 1989] so I never witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. How could I not be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [and] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and no one does edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. EastEnders is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well- written.\\" ===Personality=== Vicki has been described as a \\"little madam\\" and a rebel. An EastEnders source commented, \\"Vicki has inherited a lot of her dad Den's traits – she is going to be a right handful\\". Johnson has said, \\"Everyone loves to hate her, but I rather like that. I'd be more upset if she was nondescript. At least I provoke a passionate response in people. It's great being a bad girl.\\" ===Departure (2004)=== In August 2004, the BBC announced that Johnson had decided to quit her role as Vicki. She commented, \\"I've had a really good two years, enjoyed all the experiences but it's time to move on\\". Johnson filmed her final scenes in October and her departure coincided with that of Vicki's half-sister, Sharon (Letitia Dean). Vicki departed on the Christmas Day episode of 2004. 12.3 million viewers watched the episodes that involved the Watts family's disbandment. Media reports claimed that there were plans to bring Vicki back the following year, played by a new actress; this proved to be false. Her character was notably absent at the funerals of Vicki's father Den in September 2005, her brother Dennis in January 2006, and her grandmother Pauline in January 2007. Following her departure from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: \\"I've had a great time but it got to the point where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment – but never say never.\\" ==Reception== According to author Hilary Kingsley, the scenes in EastEnders' early years that showed toddler Vicki \\"chattering happily\\" with the baby actor who played her uncle Martin (Jon Peyton Price) were viewer favourites. EastEnders was criticised in 1993 for featuring a storyline about child abduction at an inappropriate time. In the storyline, 6-year old Vicki was abducted, leaving Michelle frantic with worry. In what has been described as a \\"coincidence of ill-timing,\\" the storyline was screened at the same time as the real-life abduction and murder of 2-year-old James Bulger. The BBC was forced to transmit a health warning prior to the airing of the episodes, announcing that the storyline would be \\"resolved positively.\\" In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless script editor opined that the abduction storyline sought to engage the audience at the expense of any parent's realistic concerns: \\"We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again.\\" The character received media criticism due to her American accent upon her reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, \\"I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart.\\" However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as \\"hilarious\\" and branding the character \\"Go Away Again Vicki\\". He added, \\"Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys.\\" Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: \\"When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that for a few months and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else – all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent – but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth.\\" A proportion of viewers responded negatively when Vicki was shown to have an abortion. Johnson claims she received abusive letters from fans of the show and that she was stopped in the street twice by older women who told her \\"it was quite wrong [...] to have got rid of the baby. I found that awkward at the time. But, gradually, I came to realise it was rather flattering. Those women believed in my character so completely they forgot she wasn't real. So now I think I must have been doing a good job.\\" Johnson has since been critical of the storylines given to her character describing them as weak. ==See also== *List of soap opera recasts ==References== ==External links== * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1986 Category:Female characters in television Category:Watts family Category:Beale family (EastEnders) ","title":"Vicki Fowler"},{"id":"2570714","text":"William Tyler Olcott (1873-1936) was an American lawyer and amateur astronomer.

Negotiations between the three Great Powers (Britain, France and Russia) resulted in the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece under a Bavarian Prince. The decisions were ratified in the Treaty of Constantinople later that year. The treaty followed the Akkerman Convention which had previously recognized another territorial change in the Balkans, the suzerainty of Principality of Serbia.Konstantopoulou Photeine, The foundation of the modern Greek state: Major treaties and conventions, 1830-1947 (1999) ==Background== Greece had won its independence from the Ottoman Empire in the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) with the help of Britain, France and Russia. In the London Protocol of 3 February 1830, the three powers had assigned the borders of the new state. However, when the governor of Greece, John Capodistria (Ioannis Kapodistrias) (Καποδíστριας) was assassinated in 1831 in Nafplion, the Greek peninsula plunged into confusion. The Great Powers sought a formal end of the war and a recognized government in Greece. As Foreign Secretary, Viscount Palmerston was deeply interested in Greece ==Conference of London== In May 1832, British Foreign Secretary Palmerston convened with French and Russian diplomats, and, without consultation of the Greeks, decided that Greece should be a monarchy. The convention offered the throne to the Bavarian Prince, Otto. They also established the line of succession which would pass the crown to Otto's descendants, or his younger brothers should he have no issue. It was also decided that in no case would the crowns of Greece and Bavaria be joined. As co-guarantors of the monarchy, the Great Powers also empowered their ambassadors in Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, to secure the end of the Greek War of Independence. On 21 July 1832 British ambassador Sir Stratford Canning and the other representatives concluded the Treaty of Constantinople, which set the boundaries of the new Kingdom of Greece along the Arta–Volos line. ==References== * Protocol of London, 1832 Category:1832 in London Category:History of modern Greece Category:Diplomatic conferences in the United Kingdom Category:19th-century diplomatic conferences Category:1832 in international relations Category:Greece–United Kingdom relations Category:Conferences in London Category:1832 conferences Category:Succession acts ","title":"London Conference of 1832"},{"id":"2570745","text":"The general structure of an iminium cation An iminium cation in organic chemistry is a functional group with the general structure [R1R2C=NR3R4]+.

He studied at the philosophy department of Moscow State University. While at university, Kuznetsov became involved with the first unsanctioned samizdat (self-published) magazines. In 1958-61, he co-edited the underground literary journals Sintaksis and Boomerang, and helped compile the samizdat poetry anthology Phoenix. In 1961, Kuznetsov was arrested and tried for the first time for his involvement in publishing samizdat, and for making overtly political speeches in poetry readings at Mayakovsky Square in central Moscow.

He later built Total Sports as an early online sports information source. ==NandO== In 1993, The News & Observer hired Schlukbier as director of its newly formed New Media division. Editor Frank Daniels III set Schlukbier to work creating an on-line presence for the N&O.; Schulkbier assembled a technical and editorial staff to carry out his ideas for an interactive service that would appeal to young people—a crucial and shrinking readership for U.S. newspapers. His first step was to purchase an existing internet access provider. Then he joined with the N&O; Newspapers in Education program to make NandO IAP access free to all North Carolina schools. Once familiar with the internet and with NandO's offerings, students wanted access to its chatrooms and games at home. Schlukbier, the vice-president of NandO, worked with Daniels, Seth Effron, and Eric Harris in developing Nando Times as an interactive online newspaper offering a full menu of news, sports, and features from local to international. It became forerunner of the hundreds of such newspaper sites that popped up over the following decade. ==Total Sports== McClatchy Newspapers (coincidentally, Schlukbier's former employer) purchased the News & Observer and its chain of smaller publications in 1995. Frank Daniels III left the newspaper, which had been owned and run by generations of his family, in favor of online ventures such as KOZ community news. He took Schlukbier with him. Daniels merged KOZ with Total Sports Publishing of Kingston, New York, known for its Total Baseball encyclopedia. The publishing arm, under founder John Thorn, continued to produce highly regarded sports books, including Total Hockey. Schlukbier became president and chief operating officer of Total Sports, charged with building a multifaceted online sports news information service. Assembling a staff made up, in large part, of the same people who had helped create NandO, Schlukbier accomplished this. The company offered subscribers instant access to scores, statistics and standings. Total Sports' landed a contract with the collegiate Atlantic Coast Conference to provide live online coverage of ACC games, a novelty at the time. A falling out with Daniels and the board of directors led to Schlukbier's resignation from Total Sports in May 2000. The company was sold later that year to Quokka Sports, Inc., of San Francisco. ==Beginnings== Born in 1951 in Germany, Schlukbier was the younger of two sons of a career U.S. military officer. His father was of German-American immigrant stock and his mother was of Norwegian-American extraction. The family lived on or near Air Force bases around the United States as the boys grew up. George Schlukbier spent his teen years and early adulthood in San Diego, California. After graduating from the University of California, San Diego, with a degree in comparative literature, he moved to Vermont and then to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he earned a master's degree in library science from McGill University. ==Canadian career== Settling north of Toronto, Ontario in the 1970s, Schlukbier founded Info Bank, a company that was ahead of its time in anticipating the information age. Although the time and technology for Info Bank had not arrived, the experience he gained pointed to his later work with internet companies. He also worked as a newspaper librarian in Toronto. As a public librarian in the Borough of York, Schlukbier helped bring the library into the new age of digital catalogues and computer access. ==Return to California== Schlukbier returned to California in the 1980s when Gregory Favre, executive editor of the Sacramento Bee, hired him to update its news \\"morgue,\\" or newspaper library. From Sacramento, Schlukbier began reaching out to the Bee's sister newspapers in communities including Fresno, California, Anchorage, Alaska, and Kennewick, Washington. For the Bee's parent company, McClatchy he became point man in coordinating new technology for information storage and retrieval. This work brought him to Daniels' attention. ==Digital news archives== Schlukbier in 2004 accepted a position with the Office of Strategic Initiatives at the U.S. Library of Congress, to shape its efforts in digital preservation of newspapers and other periodicals. In 2006 he joined Content Conversion Specialists of Hamburg, Germany, a technology company serving publishers, libraries, archives, and other repositories of printed matter in need of digital conversion. ==Later projects== From 2011 to 2013 Schlukbier served as editor-in-chief of Best Thinking, a general-interest website, and Thinker Books, its affiliated e-book publishing enterprise. He left that position to concentrate on the print-publishing company Black Kettle Books, which he co-founded and which he operates as managing partner, and on a reconstituted Total Sports (again teamed with John Thorn, among other partners), which is now a developer of sports information apps for smart phones and tablet devices. . ==External links== *Columbia Journalism Review *Exploring the New Media, UVa Continuing Education *National Digital Newspaper Project Architecture *Raleigh News & Observer news archive *Library of Congress Digital Preservation *Content Conversion Specialists *The McClatchy Company *NandO becomes McClatchy Interactive *Edgar Online *Triangle Business Journal *Schlukbier Consultants *Best Thinking * Thinker Books Category:1951 births Category:Businesspeople from San Diego Category:American computer businesspeople Category:Living people Category:University of California, San Diego alumni Category:The News & Observer ","title":"George Schlukbier"},{"id":"2570758","text":"Leaves and flowers Grevillea robusta, commonly known as the southern silky oak, silk oak or silky oak, silver oak or Australian silver oak, is a flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is a tree, the largest species in its genus but is not closely related to the true oaks, Quercus. It is a native of eastern coastal Australia, growing in riverine, subtropical and dry rainforest environments. ==Description== Grevillea robusta is a fast-growing evergreen tree with a single main trunk, growing to tall. The bark is dark grey and furrowed. Its leaves are fern-like, long, wide and divided with between 11 and 31 main lobes. Each lobe is sometimes further divided into as many as four, each one linear to narrow triangular in shape. It loses many of its leaves just before flowering. The flowers are arranged in one-sided, \\"toothbrush\\"-like groups, sometimes branched, long. The carpel (the female part) of each flower has a stalk long. The flowers are glabrous and mostly yellowish orange, or sometimes reddish. Flowering occurs from September to November and the fruit that follows is a glabrous follicle. ==Taxonomy and naming== Grevillea robusta was first formally described in 1830 by Robert Brown after an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham. The type specimen was collected by Cunningham on the eastern edge of Moreton Bay in 1827. Brown's description was published in Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet (robusta) is a Latin word meaning \\"strong like oak\\" or \\"robust\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Silky oak occurs naturally on the coast and ranges in southern Queensland and in New South Wales as far south as Coffs Harbour where it grows in subtropical rainforest, dry rainforest and wet forests. It is now relatively rare in its natural habitat but has been widely planted, including on Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. It has become naturalised in many places, including on the Atherton Tableland in Australia and in South Africa, New Zealand, Hawaii, French Polynesia, Jamaica and Florida. It is regarded as a weed in parts of New South Wales and Victoria, as \\"invasive\\" in Hawaii and as an \\"invader\\" in South Africa. ==Uses== Before the advent of aluminium, Grevillea robusta timber was widely used for external window joinery, as it is resistant to wood rot. It has been used in the manufacture of furniture, cabinetry, and fences. Owing to declining G. robusta populations, felling has been restricted. Recently G. robusta has been used for side and back woods on guitars made by Larrivée and others, because of its tonal and aesthetic qualities. ==Cultivation== When young, it can be grown as a houseplant where it can tolerate light shade, but it prefers full sun because it grows best in warm zones. If planted outside, young trees need protection on frosty nights. Once established it is hardier and tolerates temperatures down to . It needs occasional water but is otherwise fairly drought-resistant. Care needs to be taken when planting it near bushland because it can be invasive. G. robusta is often used as stock for grafting difficult-to-grow grevilleas. It has been planted widely throughout the city of Kunming in south-western China, forming shady avenues.

Nothing is known of her family background, apart from the fact that an Ottoman inscription (vakfiye) describes her as Hātun binti Abdullah (daughter of Abdullah); at that time, people who converted to Islam were given the name Abdullah meaning Servant of God, which is evidence of her non-Muslim origin. Her name, hüma, means \\"bird of paradise\\", after the Persian legend. There are two traditions or theories on her origin: that she was an Jewish origin; or that she was of Serbian Christian origin. Turkish historian and professor, Ilber Ortayli, supports that she was of Slavic descent. Hüma Hatun married Murad II. On 30 March 1432, she gave birth to her only son Mehmed the Conqueror. In 1438, Mehmed was circumcised along with his elder half-brother Şehzade Alaeddin. When Mehmed was 11 years old, he was sent to Manisa as a prince governor, Hüma followed her son to Manisa. In 1444, after the death of Mehmed's elder half-brother Şehzade Alaeddin, Mehmed was the only heir left to the throne. The same year, Murad II deposed from the throne because the death of his son and depressed events he retreated to Manisa. Her son Şehzade Mehmed succeeded the throne as Mehmed II, she held the Vâlide Hatun position for two years, in 1446 Murad took over the throne again and Hüma and her son again returned to Bursa. However, Mehmed succeeded the throne in 1451, again after the death of his father, but she was never a Valide Hatun again as she died before the accession. She was not alive to see the conquest of Constantinople, which became the capital of Ottoman Empire for nearly five centuries, before the Empire was abolished in 1922, and Turkey was officially declared as a republic. ==Death== She died in September 1449 in Bursa, two years before her son's second accession to the throne. Her tomb is located at the site known as \\"Hatuniye Kümbedi\\" (Hatuniye Tomb) to the east of Muradiye Complex, which was built by her son Mehmed. The quarter where her tomb lies has been known thus far as Hüma Hatun Quarter. ==See also== *Hatun *List of consorts of the Ottoman Sultans *List of mothers of the Ottoman sultans ==Further reading== *Peirce, Leslie P., The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, Oxford University Press, 1993, (paperback). *Yavuz Bahadıroğlu, Resimli Osmanlı Tarihi, Nesil Yayınları (Ottoman History with Illustrations, Nesil Publications), 15th Ed., 2009, (Hardcover). ==References== ==External links== * Osmanlı Padişahlarının yabancı anneleri ve padişahların yabancılarla evlenme gerekçeleri.

She began her career writing short stories in Burmese for Dagon Magazine in 1934. She worked on the editorial staff of The Burma Journal during anti-colonial movements. After the war, Khin Myo Chit wrote for The Oway, a Burmese newspaper. ==National activism== Her birth name was Khin Mya. She started her work in Burmese culture, literature and politics in the 1300 Movement. She acted as deputy head of the Women's Front of the 1300 Movement which demanded self-rule at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon (now Yangon) on 29 January 1939. Starting from that moment, she adopted the name, Khin Myo Chit. ==Journalism== After the 1300 Movement, Khin Myo Chit started writing in many patriotic Burmese papers, including the Deedoke Journal. She graduated from the University of Rangoon in 1952, and served as an editor for The Guardian Daily, when she began writing short stories and articles in English. Her story, \\"The 13-carat Diamond\\", which appeared first in The Guardian Daily, was featured in Fifty Great Oriental Stories, published by Bantam Classics. Other stories, including \\"Her Infinite Variety\\" and \\"The Four Puppets\\", won acclaim in Asia. During her career, Khin Myo Chit wrote many English publications, including a historical novel on King Anawrahta. Khin Myo Chit also served as an editor in the Working People's Daily, voicing her political opinions and also her nationalistic spirit. She also wrote many books on Burmese culture – such as the Wonderland of Burmese Legends, where she documented famous myths, legends and folktales of Myanmar, and the Colourful Burma series. ==Death== Khin Myo Chit died on 2 January 1999 at her home in Yangon.

It is part of the Dragon Knight series of games created by Japanese game developer ELF, who originally released the game for the NEC PC-9801 computer in 1991, followed by ports for the Sharp X68000 and PC Engine CD platforms in 1992 and 1994. The game is a sequel of Dragon Knight and Dragon Knight II. Its gameplay system is different from that of previous installments of the Dragon Knight series, resembling this of the early Final Fantasy (even more in the PC version) series instead of first-person-view dungeon crawler, and enabling the player to explore the entire world of the game. Some of the characters were renamed in the English and German localized Knights of Xentar release, including the protagonist Takeru's name changed to Desmond. == Gameplay == Boss battle on the PC Engine The RPG system is completely different from that of the previous games in the Dragon Knight series. The player travels with a top-down view on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons (including Strawberry Fields and Phoenix from the first two games, Dragon Knight and Dragon Knight II respectively). The game's quest is nearly two times longer than the series' first episode.Electronic Gaming Monthly 43 (February 1993), page 64 The enemy encounters are random and the battles, depending on the version, are displayed either in a first-person perspective like in the previous games in the series (similar to these in Wizardry) or in a side-view style (like in many other Japanese RPGs from that era such as the early Final Fantasy entries). The battles are partially automated with the enemies and characters attacking each other in real-time. A battle can be paused at any time to cast a spell, use an item, or change attack style through a list of AI scripts.Dragon Knight III: Staff Review, Honest Gamers. There are eight levels of attack strength, each with its advantages and disadvantages (for example, more powerful attack levels require more time). The game features cartoonish cut scenes, many of which contain nude erotic images - the girls the main character encounters and helps will often feel grateful and award him with sexual favors. However, there are no explicit hardcore sex scenes in the game and the girls' genital areas are censored as in most eroge (the sound of a toilet flushing is played when the main character supposedly reaches his climax). Visiting a girl for a sexual encounter has the same effect as resting in an Inn for most traditional RPGs: HP and MP are restored. Crude erotic humour is combined with classical fairy takes; the hero for examples save Little Red Riding Hood from rape by the Wolf, and Snow White from rape by the seven dwarves. == Plot == The main character is a young wandering hero warrior named Desmond (タケル, Takeru). After liberating Strawberry Fields (now called Arcadia) from a demon's curse and saving the girls of city of Phoenix from an evil witch queen in his previous adventures, Desmond finds himself in a situation unworthy of his heroic status: robbers have taken all his possessions, including his legendary armor, his magic sword, and even his clothes. So the first task for the unsuccessful hero is to get some money. Luckily, the mayor has an assignment for him, for which he is also willing to pay. Desmond accepts the assignment without knowing what it will lead to - traveling all over the world, fighting fearsome enemies, encountering beautiful women, and solving a mystery that will also reveal the secret of his own true identity. In his journeys, Desmond is repeatedly attacked by demons. In the process, his companion Rolf (バーン, Bān) from Dragon Knight II and the sorceress Luna (ルナ) from Dragon Knight join him. He dreams of a woman who later turns out to be the goddess of light Althea (メシア, Meshia). She and the god of darkness Deimos (ディード, Dīdo) have made an agreement that they would decide the fate of the world through a duel between their respective children. Desmond is the son of Althea and his friend, the black knight Arstein (アルスィーン, Arusutīn) is the son of Deimos. Since Arstein does not want to kill his friend Desmond, he gets Desmond to kill him. Since Deimos does not stick to the agreement and attacks Althea, the group has to fight against him in the end. After Deimos is destroyed, Desmond is offered an ascension to the council of gods, but decides to stay in the mortal world. He marries Luna, and Arcadia's ruler Princess Diana（ネイナ, Naina）builds them a great palace. Rolf marries Marie (from Dragon Knight II). == Release == Knights of Xentar was the second hentai RPG released by Megatech Software after Cobra Mission and remains the only Dragon Knight game to be ever released outside Japan. A CD-ROM \\"full talkie\\" version was also produced. The game has been originally released in Japan for different platforms between 1991 and 1994. A soundtrack CD was also released in 1992 and 1994. Megatech could not use the title \\"Dragon Knight\\" in the West due to copyright reasons.https://retrocdn.net/images/2/25/AnimericaAVI_US_Vol.3_02.jpg In their version of the game, the names of the two main characters were changed: Baan as he was known in the Japanese version was changed to Rolf and Takeru, the main hero of the game, was changed to Desmond. The dialogue was also modified, having a major localization overhaul in the same manner that Working Designs approached in translating several JRPGs. For example, the North American release's dialogue included many American pop culture references and jokes, and several times broke the fourth wall with the Megatech script writers even joining in the heroes' conversation. Desmond's partners Rolf and Luna, and even some of the girls, Desmond meets make fun of him cruelly for his small penis and body odor problem (not existent in the Japanese version). Megatech released two versions of this game: NR-13 and NR-18 (USK 12 and USK 16 in Germany), and the NR-13 version can be upgraded to the NR-18 via a software patch. The NR-18 version is the uncensored version whereas the NR-13 is censored in that all the nude girls had their private parts covered up by hands or clothing and some of the crude, crass dialogue was edited as well. ==Reception== Japanese magazine PC Engine Fan rated the PC Engine release an overall score of 23.5 out of 30. The PC DOS version's varied western review scores included 93% in Joypad, 80% in Megazin, 62% in PC Joker, 61% in PC Player, and 59% in Power Play. == References == ==External links== *Official website *Knights of Xentar at GameFAQs *Dragon Knight III at Hardcore Gaming 101 * Category:1991 video games Category:1995 video games Category:Bishōjo games Category:Censored video games Category:DOS games Dragon Knight III Category:Fantasy video games Category:FM Towns games Category:Japanese role- playing video games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Sharp X68000 games Category:TurboGrafx-CD games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Knights of Xentar"},{"id":"2570815","text":"Celia Elizabeth (Betsy) Hoffman (born November 12, 1946) was Executive Vice President and Provost of Iowa State University from 2007-2012, where she remains as professor of economics.

Weakness usually develops in other areas of the body as well, such as the abdomen and next to the shin, causing foot drop. Often weakness develops on one side of the body before the other. Symptoms typically begin in early childhood and become noticeable in the teenage years, with 95% of affected individuals manifesting disease by age 20 years. Non-muscular manifestations of FSHD include hearing loss and blood vessel abnormalities in the back of the eye. FSHD is caused by complex genetic changes involving the DUX4 gene. In those without FSHD, DUX4 is expressed (ie: turned on) in early human development and later repressed (ie: turned off) in mature tissues. In FSHD, DUX4 is inadequately turned off, which can be caused by several different mutations, the most common being deletion of DNA in the region surrounding DUX4. This mutation is termed \\"D4Z4 contraction\\" and defines FSHD type 1 (FSHD1), making up 95% of FSHD cases. FSHD due to other mutations is classified as FSHD type 2 (FSHD2). Regardless of which mutation is present, disease can only result if the individual has a 4qA allele, which is a common variation in the DNA next to DUX4. Up to 30% of FSHD cases are due to a new mutation, which then is able to be passed on to children. FSHD1 follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of also being affected. How DUX4 expression causes muscle damage is unclear. Expression of DUX4 gene produces DUX4 protein, whose function is to modulate hundreds of other genes, many of which are involved in muscle function. Diagnosis is by genetic testing. There is no cure for FSHD. No pharmaceuticals have proven effective for altering the disease course. Symptoms can be addressed with physiotherapy, bracing, and orthopedic surgery. Surgical fixation of the scapula to the thorax is effective in reducing shoulder symptoms in select cases. FSHD is the third most common genetic disease of skeletal muscle (Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy being first and myotonic dystrophy being second), affecting 1 in 8,333 to 1 in 15,000 people. Prognosis is extremely variable, with many never facing significant limitations, although up to 20% of affected individuals become severely disabled, requiring use of a wheel chair or mobility scooter. Life expectancy is generally not affected, except in rare cases of respiratory insufficiency. The first description of an individual with FSHD is an autopsy report from 1852, although FSHD wasn't distinguished as a disease until the 1870s and 1880s when French physicians Landouzy and Dejerine followed a family affected by it; thus FSHD is sometimes referred to as Landouzy–Dejerine muscular dystrophy. In 1991, the association of most cases with the tip of chromosome 4 was established, which was discovered to be due to D4Z4 contraction in 1993. DUX4 was discovered in 1999, but it wasn't until 2010 that the genetic mechanism causing its expression was elucidated. In 2012, the predominant mutation of FSHD2 was discovered. In 2014, researchers published the first proposed pathophysiology definition of the disease and four viable therapeutic targets for possible intervention points. == Signs and symptoms == Muscles of the face, shoulder girdle, and upper arm are classically affected, although these muscles can be spared and other muscles usually are affected. Distribution and degree of muscle weakness is extremely variable, even between identical twins. Individual muscles can weaken while adjacent muscles remain healthy. Muscle weakness usually becomes noticeable on one side of the body and not the other, a hallmark of the disease. The right shoulder muscles are more often affected than the left shoulder muscles, independent of handedness. Musculoskeletal pain is very common, most often described in the neck, shoulders, lower back, and the back of the knee. Classically, symptoms appear in those 15 - 30 years of age, although infantile onset, adult onset, and absence of symptoms despite having the causal genetics also occur. Long static phases, in which no progression is apparent, is not uncommon. FSHD1 and FSHD2 have similar signs and symptoms, although very large D4Z4 deletions in FSHD1 (EcoRI 10-11 kb) are more strongly associated with infantile onset, progressive hearing loss, retinal disease, and various rare manifestations. ===Face and shoulder=== Weakness typically begins in the muscles of the face. The muscles surrounding the eyes (orbicularis oculi muscle) are commonly affected, which can result in sleeping with eyelids open. The muscle surrounding the mouth (orbicularis oris muscle) is also commonly affected, resulting in inability to pucker the lips or whistle. There can be difficulty pronouncing the letters M, B, and P, or facial expressions that appear diminished, depressed, angry, or fatigued. After the facial weakness, weakness usually develops in the muscles of the upper torso, especially those connecting shoulder girdle to the thorax (serratus anterior muscle and middle and lower trapezius fibers). The upper trapezius fibers often are spared. The scapulas become downwardly rotated and protracted, resulting in winged scapula and sloping shoulders. In advanced cases, the scapula appears to \\"herniate\\" up and over the rib cage. A common complaint is difficulty working with the arms overhead. The rotator cuff muscles are usually spared, even late in the disease course. Another commonly affected upper torso muscle is the pectoralis major muscle, particularly the sterno costal portion, atrophy of which can contribute to a prominent horizontal anterior axillary fold. ===Upper arm and lower body=== After facial and upper torso weakness, weakness can \\"descend\\" to the upper arms (biceps muscle and triceps muscle) and the pelvic girdle. The forearms are usually spared, resulting in an appearance some compare to the fictional character Popeye. Sometimes, the weakness is observed to \\"skip\\" the pelvis and involve the tibialis anterior (shin muscle), causing foot drop. Weakness can also occur in the abdominal muscles, which can manifest as a protuberant abdomen, lumbar hyperlordosis, the inability to do a sit-up, or the inability to turn from one side to the other while lying down. The lower fibers of the rectus abdominis muscle are more often affected than the upper fibers, manifesting as a positive Beevor's sign. Weakness in the legs can manifest as difficulty walking or hips held in slight flexion. ===Muscle involvement from medical imaging perspective=== Medical imaging (CT and MRI) has shown muscle damage that doesn't cause obvious symptoms. A single MRI study shows the teres major muscle to be commonly affected. The semimembranosus muscle, part of the hamstrings, is commonly affected, with one author stating it to be \\"the most frequently and severely affected muscle.\\" Also, MRI shows that the rectus femoris is more often affected than the other muscles of the quadriceps, the medial gastrocnemius is more often affected than the lateral gastrocnemius, and the iliopsoas muscle is very often spared. ===Non-musculoskeletal=== The most common non-musculoskeletal manifestation of FSHD is mild retinal blood vessel abnormalities, such as telangiectasias or microaneurysms, with one study placing the incidence at 50%. These abnormal blood vessels generally do not affect vision or health, although a severe form of it mimics Coat's disease, a condition found in about 1% of FSHD cases and more frequently associated with large 4q35 deletions. High-frequency hearing loss can occur in those with large 4q35 deletions, but otherwise is no more common compared to the general population. Breathing can be affected, associated with kyphoscoliosis and wheelchair use; it is seen in one-third of wheelchair-bound patients. However, ventilator support (nocturnal or diurnal) is needed in only 1% of cases. ==Genetics== The genetics of FSHD are complex, culminating in abnormal expression of the DUX4 gene. In those without FSHD, DUX4 is expressed during embryogenesis and, at some point, becomes repressed in all tissues except the testes. In FSHD, there is inadequate repression of DUX4, allowing ectopic production of DUX4 protein in muscles, causing muscle damage. Two genetic elements are required for inadequate repression of DUX4. First, there must be a mutation that causes hypomethylation of the DNA surrounding DUX4, allowing transcription of DUX4 into messenger RNA (mRNA). Several mutations cause hypomethylation, upon which FSHD is subclassified into FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) and FSHD type 2 (FSHD2). The second genetic element needed is a polyadenylation sequence downstream to DUX4 that allows stability to DUX4 mRNA, which allows DUX4 mRNA to persist long enough to be translated into DUX4 protein, the causal agent of muscle damage. There are at least 17 variations, or haplotype polymorphisms, of 4q35 (DNA encompassing D4Z4 repeat array) observed in the population. These 17 variations can be roughly divided into the groups 4qA and 4qB. It are the 4qA alleles that contain polyadenylation signals, allowing stability to DUX4 mRNA. The 4qB alleles do not have polyadenylation sequences. ===DUX4 and the D4Z4 repeat array=== thumbrightalt=D4Z4 array diagram400pxD4Z4 array with three D4Z4 repeats and the 4qA allele. { style=\\"width: 100%; -  CEN  centromeric end  TEL  telomeric end -  NDE box  non-deleted element  PAS  polyadenylation site -  triangle  D4Z4 repeat trapezoid  partial D4Z4 repeat -  white box  pLAM  gray boxes  DUX4 exons 1, 2, 3 -  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"text-align: center; background: #cccdcf;\\"  arrows -  corner  promoters  straight  RNA transcripts -  black  sense  red  antisense -  blue  DBE-T  dashes  dicing sites } DUX4 resides within the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array, a series of tandemly repeated DNA segments in the subtelomeric region (4q35) of chromosome 4. Each D4Z4 repeat is 3.3 kilobase pairs (kb) long and is the site of epigenetic regulation, containing both heterochromatin and euchromatin structures. In FSHD, the heterochromatin structure is lost, becoming euchromatin. The name \\"D4Z4\\" is derived from an obsolete nomenclature system used for DNA segments of unknown significance during the human genome project: D for DNA, 4 for chromosome 4, Z indicates it is a repetitive sequence, and 4 is a serial number assigned based on the order of submission. D4Z4 regulatory element transcripts (DBT-E) are reported to de-repress DUX4 expression. Their transcription starts at the non- deleted element (NDE). Some transcripts might be degraded in areas to produce si-like small RNAs.DUX4 consists of three exons. Exons 1 and 2 are in each repeat. Exon 3 is in the pLAM region telomeric to the last partial repeat. ===FSHD1=== FSHD involving deletion of D4Z4 repeats (termed 'D4Z4 contraction') is classified as FSHD1, which accounts for 95% of FSHD cases. Typically, chromosome 4 includes between 11 and 150 repetitions of D4Z4. In FSHD1, there are 1–10 repetitions of D4Z4. The number of repeats roughly inversely correlates with disease severity. Namely, those with 1 - 3 repeats are more likely to have severe, atypical, and early onset disease; those with 4 - 7 repeats have moderate disease that is highly variable; and those with 8 - 10 repeats tend to have the mildest presentations, sometimes with no symptoms. D4Z4 contraction causes D4Z4 hypomethylation, allowing DUX4 transcription. Deletion of the entire D4Z4 repeat array does not result in FSHD because then there are no complete copies of DUX4 to be expressed, although other birth defects result. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, although 10 - 30% of cases are from de novo (new) mutations. The subtelomeric region of chromosome 10q contains a tandem repeat structure highly homologous (99% identical) to 4q35. The repeats of 10q are termed \\"D4Z4-like\\" repeats. Because 10q usually lacks a polyadenylation sequence, it is generally not implicated in disease, except in the instance of chromosomal rearrangements between 4q and 10q leading to 4q D4Z4 contraction, or the other instance of transfer of a 4q D4Z4 repeat and polyadenylation signal onto 10q. Each triangle represents a D4Z4 repeat. The circles above the triangles represent DNA methylation: high methylation resulting in heterochromatic DNA and low methylation resulting in euchromatic DNA. === FSHD2 === FSHD without D4Z4 contraction is classified as FSHD2, which constitutes 5% of FSHD cases. Various mutations cause FSHD2, all resulting in D4Z4 hypomethylation, at which the disease mechanism converges with FSHD1. About 80% of FSHD2 cases are due to deactivating mutations in the gene SMCHD1 (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes flexible Hinge Domain containing 1) on chromosome 18, a gene responsible for DNA methylation. SMCHD1 deactivation results in hypomethylation of the D4Z4 repeat array. Another cause of FSHD2 is mutation in DNMT3B (DNA methyltransferase 3B), which also plays a role in DNA methylation. As of 2020, early evidence indicates that a third cause of FSHD2 is mutation in both copies of the LRIF1 gene, which encodes the protein ligand-dependent nuclear receptor-interacting factor 1 (LRIF1). LRIF1 is known to interact with the SMCHD1 protein. As of 2019, there are presumably additional mutations at other unidentified genetic locations that can cause FSHD2. Mutation of a single allele of SMCHD1 or DNMT3B can cause disease. Mutation of both copies LRIF1 has been tentatively shown to cause disease in a single person as of 2020. As in FSHD1, a 4qA allele must be present for disease to result. However, unlike the D4Z4 array, the genes implicated in FSHD2 are not in proximity with the 4qA allele, and so they are inherited independently from the 4qA allele, resulting in a digenic inheritance pattern. For example, one parent without FSHD can pass on an SMCHD1 mutation, and the other parent, also without FSHD, can pass on a 4qA allele, bearing a child with FSHD2. === Two ends of a disease spectrum === Initially, FSHD1 and FSHD2 were described as separate diseases. However, it seems that the two are both are risk factors for disease, and not rarely do both contribute to disease in the same individual. In those with FSHD2, although they have a 4qA allele with adjacent D4Z4 repeat number greater than 10, it is often still less than 17 (relatively short compared to the general population), suggesting that a large number of D4Z4 repeats can prevent the effects of an SMCHD1 mutation. Further studies need to be done to determine the upper limit of D4Z4 repeats in which FSHD2 can occur. In those with a 4qA allele and 10 or fewer repeats, an additional SMCHD1 mutation has shown to worsen disease, classifying them as both FSHD1 and FSHD2. In these FSHD1/FSHD2 individuals, the methylation pattern of the D4Z4 repeat array resembles that seen in FSHD2. This combined FSHD1/FSHD2 presentation is most common in those with 9 - 10 repeats, and is seldom found in those with 8 or less repeats. The relative abundance of SMCHD1 mutations in the 9 - 10 repeat group is likely because a sizable portion of the general population has 9 - 10 repeats with no disease, yet with the additive effect of an SMCHD1 mutation, symptoms develop and a diagnosis is made. In those with 8 or fewer repeats, symptoms are more likely than in those with 9 - 10 repeats, leading to diagnosis regardless of an additional SMCHD1 mutation. The apparent frequency of FSHD1/FSHD2 cases in the 9 - 10 repeat range, combined with the FSHD2-like methylation pattern, suggest the 9 - 10 repeat size to be an overlap zone between FSHD1 and FSDH2. ==Pathophysiology== 400px As of 2020, there seems to be a consensus that aberrant expression of DUX4 in muscle is the cause of FSHD. DUX4 is expressed in extremely small amounts, detectable in 1 out of every 1000 immature muscle cells (myoblast), which appears to increase after myoblast maturation, in part because the cells fuse as they mature, and a single nucleus expressing DUX4 can provide DUX4 protein to neighboring nuclei from fused cells. It remains an area of active research how DUX4 causes muscle damage. DUX4 protein is a transcription factor that regulates many other genes. Some of these genes are involved in apoptosis, such as p53, p21, MYC, and β-catenin. It seems that DUX4 makes muscle cells more prone to apoptosis, although details of the mechanism are still unknown and contested. Other DUX4 regulated genes are involved in oxidative stress, and it seems that DUX4 expression lowers muscle cell tolerance of oxidative stress. Variation in the ability of individual muscles to handle oxidative stress could partially explain the muscle involvement patterns of FSHD. DUX4 downregulates many genes involved in muscle development, including MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and PAX7. DUX4 has shown to reduce muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and fusion. Estrogen seems to play a role on in modifying DUX4 effects on muscle differentiation, which could explain why females are less affected than males. DUX4 regulates a few genes that are involved in RNA quality control, and DUX4 expression has been shown to cause accumulation of RNA with subsequent apoptosis. The cellular hypoxia response has been reported in a single study to be the main driver of DUX4-induced muscle cell death. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are upregulated by DUX4, possibly causing pathologic signaling leading to cell death. Another study found that DUX4 expression in muscle cells led to the recruitment and alteration of fibrous/fat progenitor cells, which helps explain why muscles become replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. == Diagnosis == === Genetic testing === Genetic testing is the gold standard for FSHD diagnosis, as it is the most sensitive and specific test available. Commonly, FSHD1 is tested for first. A shortened D4Z4 array length (EcoRI length of 10 kb to 38 kb) with an adjacent 4qA allele supports FSHD1. If FSHD1 is not present, commonly FSHD2 is tested for next by assessing methylation at 4q35. Low methylation (less than 20%) in the context of a 4qA allele is sufficient for diagnosis. The specific mutation, usually one of various SMCHD1 mutations, can be identified with next-generation sequencing (NGS). ==== Assessing D4Z4 length ==== Measuring D4Z4 length is technically challenging due to the D4Z4 repeat array consisting of long, repetitive elements. For example, NGS is not useful for assessing D4Z4 length, because it breaks DNA into fragments before reading them, and it is unclear to which D4Z4 repeat each sequenced fragment came from. In 2020, optical mapping became available for measuring D4Z4 array length, which is more precise and less labor intensive than southern blot. Molecular combing is also available for assessing D4Z4 array length. Sometimes 4q or 10q will have a combination of D4Z4 and D4Z4-like repeats due to DNA exchange between 4q and 10q, which can yield erroneous results, requiring more detailed workup. Restriction enzyme sites on 4q and 10q subtelomeric repeat arrays Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was the first genetic test developed and is still used as of 2020, although it is being phased out by newer methods. It involves dicing the DNA with restriction enzymes and sorting the resulting restriction fragments by size using southern blot. The restriction enzymes EcoRI and BlnI are commonly used. EcoRI isolates the 4q and 10q repeat arrays, and BlnI dices the 10q sequence into small pieces, allowing 4q to be distinguished. The EcoRI restriction fragment is composed of three parts: 1) 5.7 kb proximal part, 2) the central, variable size D4Z4 repeat array, and 3) the distal part, usually 1.25 kb. The proximal portion has a sequence of DNA stainable by the probe p13E-11, which is commonly used to visualize the EcoRI fragment during southern blot. Considering that each D4Z4 repeat is 3.3 kb, and the EcoRI fragment contains 6.9 kb of DNA that is not part of the D4Z4 repeat array, the number of D4Z4 units can be calculated. :D4Z4 repeats = (EcoRI length - 6.9) / 3.3 === Alternative testing === MRI showing asymmetrical involvement of various muscles in FSHD When cost is prohibitive or a diagnosis of FSHD is not suspected as the cause of symptoms, patients and doctors may rely on one or more of the following tests, all of which are less sensitive and less specific than genetic testing.FSHD Fact Sheet , MDA, 11/1/2001 * Creatine kinase (CK) blood level is often ordered when muscle damage is suspected. CK is an enzyme found in muscle, and it is released into the blood when muscles become damaged. However, CK levels are only mildly elevated, or even normal, in FSHD. * Electromyogram (EMG) measures the electrical activity in the muscle. EMG shows nonspecific signs of muscle damage or irritability. * Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) measures the how fast signals travel from one part of a nerve to another. The nerve signals are measured with surface electrodes (similar to those used for an electrocardiogram) or needle electrodes. * Muscle biopsy involves surgical removal of a small piece of muscle, usually from the arm or leg. The biopsy is evaluated with a variety of biochemical tests. Biopsies from FSHD-affected muscles show nonspecific signs, such as presence of white blood cells and variation in muscle fiber size. This test is rarely indicated. * Muscle MRI is sensitive for detecting muscle damage, even in paucisymptomatic cases. Because of the particular muscle involvement patterns of FSHD, MRI can help differentiate FSHD from other muscle diseases, directing molecular diagnosis. == Management == * As of 2020, no pharmaceuticals have proven effective for treating FSHD. * Physiotherapy can address specific symptoms; there is no standardized protocol for FSHD. Anecdotal reports suggest that appropriately applied kinesiology tape can reduce pain. * Occupational therapy can be used for training in activities of daily living (ADLs) and to help adapt to new assistive devices. * Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce chronic fatigue and decelerate fatty infiltration of muscle in FSHD. The American Academy of Neurology (ANN) recommends that people with FSHD engage in low-intensity aerobic exercise to promote energy levels, muscle health, and bone health. * Moderate-intensity strength training appears to do no harm, although it hasn't been shown to be beneficial. * Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce chronic fatigue in FSHD, and it also decelerates fatty infiltration of muscle when directed towards increasing daily activity. * A dilated eye exam to look for retinal abnormalities is recommended in those newly diagnosed with FSHD. Those with large D4Z4 deletions should be referred to a retinal specialist for yearly exams. * A hearing test should be done in individuals with early-onset FSHD, prior to starting school, or any other FSHD-affected individual with symptoms of hearing loss. * Pulmonary function testing (PFT) should be done in those newly diagnosed to establish baseline pulmonary function. PFT should also be done recurrently for those with risks for or symptoms of pulmonary insufficiency. ===Facial weakness=== Various manifestations of facial weakness are amenable to surgical correction. Upper eyelid gold implants have been used for those unable to close their eyes. Drooping lower lip has been addressed with plastic surgery. === Scapular winging === * Scapular bracing can improve scapular positioning, which improves shoulder function, although it is often deemed as ineffective or impractical. * Scapulothoracic fusion (arthrodesis), an orthopedic procedure to achieve bony fusion between the scapula and the ribs, usually increases shoulder active range of motion, improves shoulder function, decreases pain, and improves cosmetic appearance. Active range of motion increases most in the setting of severe scapular winging with an unaffected deltoid muscle; however, passive range of motion decreases. Namely, the patient gains the ability to slowly flex and abduct their shoulders to 90+ degrees, but they lose the ability to \\"throw\\" their arm up to a full 180 degrees. * Scapulopexy, an orthopedic procedure, involves tethering the scapula to the ribs, vertebrae, or other scapula using tendon grafts, wire, or other means. Unlike the scapulothoracic fusion, no fusion between bones is achieved. Many different procedures exist, and outcomes are different for each. Compared to scapulothoracic fusions, scapulopexies are considered to be less invasive, but also more susceptible to long-term failure. * Tendon transfer is an orthopedic surgery that rearranges the attachments of muscles to bone. Tendon transfers such as pectoralis major transfer and the Eden-Lange procedure, although potentially helpful in specific cases of FSHD, is considered alternative treatment.

The scapulas are tethered together with an Achilles tendon graft, holding them in a retracted position. In the right image, the rhomboid major muscles are easily visible. === Foot drop === * Ankle-foot orthoses can improve walking, balance, and quality of life. * Tendon transfer, such as the Bridle procedure, in select cases can correct foot drop. == Epidemiology == The prevalence of FSHD ranges from 1 in 8,333 to 1 in 15,000. The Netherlands reports a prevalence of 1 in 8,333, after accounting for the undiagnosed. The prevalence in the United States is commonly quoted as 1 in 15,000. After genetic testing became possible in 1992, average prevalence was found to be around 1 in 20,000, a large increase compared to before 1992. However, 1 in 20,000 is likely an underestimation, since many with FSHD have mild symptoms and are never diagnosed, or they are siblings of affected individuals and never seek diagnosis. Race and ethnicity have not been shown to affect FSHD incidence or severity. Although the inheritance of FSHD shows no predilection for biological sex, the disease manifests less often in women, and even when it manifests in women, they on average are less severely affected than affected males. Estrogen has been suspected to be a protective factor that accounts for this discrepancy. One study found that estrogen reduced DUX4 activity. However, another study found no association between disease severity and lifetime estrogen exposure in females. The same study found that disease progression wasn't different through periods of hormonal changes, such as menarche, pregnancy, and menopause. ==History== The first description of a person with FSHD in medical literature appears in an autopsy report by Jean Cruveilhier in 1852. In 1868, Duchenne published his seminal work on Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and as part of its differential was a description of FSHD. First in 1874, then with a more commonly cited publication in 1884, and again with pictures in 1885, the French physicians Louis Landouzy and Joseph Dejerine published details of the disease, recognizing it as a distinct clinical entity, and thus FSHD is sometimes referred to as Landouzy Dejerine disease. In their paper of 1886, Landouzy and Dejerine drew attention to the familial nature of the disorder and mentioned that four generations were affected in the kindred that they had investigated.Landouzy-Dejerine syndrome, whonamedit.com, date accessed March 11, 2007 Formal definition of FSHD's clinical features didn't occur until 1952 when a large Utah family with FSHD was studied. Beginning about 1980 an increasing interest in FSHD led to increased understanding of the great variability in the disease and a growing understanding of the genetic and pathophysiological complexities. By the late 1990s, researchers were finally beginning to understand the regions of chromosome 4 associated with FSHD.Impossible Things: Through the looking glass with FSH Dystrophy Researchers, Margaret Wahl, MDA, Quest magazine, Vol 14, No 2, March–April 2007 Since the publication of the unifying theory in 2010, researchers continued to refine their understanding of DUX4. With increasing confidence in this work, researchers proposed the first a consensus view in 2014 of the pathophysiology of the disease and potential approaches to therapeutic intervention based on that model. Over the years, FSHD has, at various times, been referred to as: * Landouzy-Dejerine * Landouzy-Dejerine syndrome * Erb-Landouzy-Dejerine syndrome * Landouzy-Dejerine dystrophy or atrophy * faciohumeroscapular === Chronology of important FSHD-related genetic research === === Past pharmaceutical development === Multiple pharmaceuticals have failed to show efficacy. * Prednisone, a steroid, was trialed due to its therapeutic effect in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. * Oral albuterol, a β2 agonist, although it improved muscle mass and certain measures of strength in clinical trials, it did not improve global strength or function. Interestingly, after DUX4 was identified as an integral part of FSHD pathophysiology, drug screens showed that β2 agonists reduce DUX4 expression. * Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, was trialed in FSHD on the bases of anecdotal reports of it being beneficial and the theory that calcium dysregulation may play a part in muscle cell death (this was before identification of DUX4 as part of pathophysiology). * MYO-029 (Stamulumab) was developed to promote muscle growth. It is an antibody that inhibits myostatin, a protein that inhibits the growth of muscle tissue.Wyeth Initiates Clinical Trial with Investigational Muscular Dystrophy Therapy MYO-029 * ACE-083 is a TGF-β inhibitor was developed to promote muscle growth. == Society and culture == * In the Amazon Video series The Man in the High Castle, Obergruppenführer John Smith's son, Thomas, is diagnosed with Landouzy-Dejerine syndrome. * In the biography Stuart: A Life Backwards, the protagonist was affected by FSHD. * Chris Carrino, the radio voice of the Brooklyn Nets, is affected by FSHD. He created the Chris Carrino Foundation for FSHD. ===FSHD Society=== In 1991 the FSHD Society (named \\"FSH Society\\" until 2019) was founded by two individuals with FSHD, Daniel Perez and Stephen Jacobsen. The FSHD Society raised funding to provide seed grants for FSHD research, advocated for the field to standardize the name of the disease as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and FSHD, and co-wrote the MD-CARE Act, passed into law in 2001, which for the first time mandated federal resources, including National Institutes of Health funding, for all muscular dystrophies. The FSHD Society has grown into the world's largest grassroots organization advocating for patient education and scientific and medical research. === FSHD-EUROPE === In 2009 the FSHD-EUROPE was founded by European associations. ==Research directions== Based on the consensus model of pathophysiology, researchers propose four approaches for therapeutic intervention: # enhance the epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 # target the DUX4 mRNA, including altering splicing or polyadenylation; # block the activity of the DUX4 protein # inhibit the DUX4-induced process, or processes, that leads to pathology. === Current pharmaceutical development === * Losmapimod, a selective inhibitor of p38α/β mitogen-activated protein kinases, was identified by Fulcrum Therapeutics as a potent suppressor of DUX4 in vitro. A phase IIb clinical trial started in July 2019 and is expected to end in August 2020. * Antisense nucleotides directed against DUX4 messenger RNA are in the preclinical stage. Antisense nucleotides have been shown to reduce DUX4 and downregulate DUX4 target genes, with few off-target effects. The current challenge is delivering the nucleotides to the muscle cells; these antisense nucleotides have poor ability to penetrate muscle. * Gene therapy consisting of microRNAs (miRNAs) directed against DUX4, delivered by viral vectors, are in the preclinical stage. In mouse FSHD models, miRNAs have shown to reduce DUX4, protect against muscle pathology, and prevent loss of grip strength. === Potential pharmaceutical development === * Inhibition of the hyaluronic acid (HA) pathway is a potential therapy. One study found that many DUX4-induced molecular pathologies are mediated by HA signaling, and inhibition of HA biosynthesis with 4-methylumbelliferone prevented these molecular pathologies. * P300 inhibition has shown to inhibit the deleterious effects of DUX4 * BET inhibitors have been shown to reduce DUX4 expression. * Casein kinase 1 (CK1) inhibitors have been identified by Facio Therapies, a Dutch pharmaceutical company, as repressors of DUX4 expression. Facio Therapies claims that CK1 inhibition leaves myotube fusion intact, unlike BET inhibitors, p38 MAPK inhibitors, and β2 agonists. * Antioxidants could potentially reduce the effects of FSHD. One study found that vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc gluconate, and selenomethionine supplementation increased endurance and strength of the quadriceps, but had no significant benefit on walking performance. Further study is warranted. === Outcome measures === Ways of measuring the disease are important for assessing the efficacy of drugs in clinical trials. * Electrical impedance myography is being studied as a way to measure muscle damage. * Quality of life can be measured with questionnaires, such as the FSHD Health Index. * Muscle MRI is useful for assessment of all the muscles in the body. Muscles can be scored based on the degree of fat infiltration. ==References== == External links == * list of clinical trials for FSHD, Clinicaltrials.gov. * Category:Muscular dystrophy Category:Rare diseases Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy"},{"id":"2570842","text":"The formyl group A formylation reaction in organic chemistry refers to organic reactions in which an organic compound is functionalized with a formyl group (-CH=O). The reaction is a route to aldehydes (C-CH=O), formamides (N-CH=O), and formate esters (O-CH=O). A reagent that delivers the formyl group is called a formylating agent. A particularly important formylation process is hydroformylation which converts alkenes to the homologated aldehyde. The conversion of benzene to benzaldehyde is the basis of the Gattermann–Koch reaction: center ==Aromatic formylation== Formylation reactions are a form of electrophilic aromatic substitution and therefore work best when the aromatic starting materials are electron-rich. Phenols are very commonly encountered as they can be readily deprotonated to form phenoxides which are excellent nucleophiles, other electron rich substrates such as mesitylene, pyrrole, or fused aromatic rings can also be expected to react. Benzene will react under aggressive conditions but deactivated rings such as pyridine are difficult to formylate effectively. ===Selective ortho-formylation of phenols=== Phenol would normally be expected to react to give a mixture of ortho and para products, however many formylation reactions will selectively give only the ortho product (e.g. 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). This can be explained by strong attractive interactions between the phenoxide and the formylating reagent during the reaction, for example ionic interactions with cationic nitrogen centres in the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction and Duff reaction or coordination to high oxidation metals in the Casiraghi formylation and Rieche formylation (c.f. Kolbe–Schmitt reaction). The direct reaction between phenol and paraformaldehyde is possible via the Casiraghi formylation, all other methods used masked forms of formaldehyde, in part to limit the formation of phenol formaldehyde resins. Aldehydes are strongly deactivating and as such phenols typically only react once, however certain reactions, such as the Duff reaction, can give double addition. ===Other substrates=== Formylation can be applied to other aromatic rings. As it generally begins with nucleophilic attack by the aromatic group, the electron density of the ring is an important factor. Some aromatic compounds, such as pyrrole, are known to formylate regioselectively. Formylation of benzene rings can be achieved via the Gattermann reaction and Gattermann-Koch reaction. These involve strong acid catalysis and proceed in a manner similar to the Friedel–Crafts reaction. ===List of aromatic formylation reactions=== * Dimethylformamide and phosphorus oxychloride in the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction. * Hexamethylenetetramine in the Duff reaction and the Sommelet reaction * Carbon monoxide and hydrochloric acid in the Gattermann-Koch reaction * Cyanides in the Gattermann reaction. This method synthetizes aromatic aldehydes using hydrogen chloride and hydrogen cyanide (or another metallic cyanide as such zinc cyanide) in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts: * Chloroform in the Reimer-Tiemann reaction * dichloromethyl methyl ether in Rieche formylation. Formylation of 3-methylamino-1-propanol with formamide (instead of ethyl chloroformate) as a protecting group in the preparation of Protriptyline. Formamide was also used (instead of formic acid) in the synthesis of primidone. ==Aliphatic formylation== Hydroformylation of alkenes is the most important method of aliphatic formylation, however it is largely restricted to an industrial setting due to the high temperatures and pressures involved. Several specialty methods exist for laboratory-scale synthesis, including the Sommelet reaction, Bouveault aldehyde synthesis or Bodroux–Chichibabin aldehyde synthesis. ==See also== * Hydroformylation * Hydroacylation ==References== ","title":"Formylation reaction"},{"id":"2570858","text":"La Guaira () is the capital city of the Venezuelan state of Vargas and the country's main port. It was founded in 1577 as an outlet for Caracas, to the southeast. The town and the port were badly damaged during the December 1999 floods and mudslides that affected much of the region. The city hosts its own professional baseball team in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, the Tiburones de La Guaira. They have won seven national championships since their founding in 1962. ==History== Picacho de Galipán Port of La Guaira La Guaira Beach in la Guaira San Carlos Fortress After the founding of Caracas by Spanish in 1567, toward the turn of the 16th century, the Port of La Guaira emerged on the coast and, since that time, has been the gateway to Caracas. This coastal city, almost without land to develop and bathed by the Caribbean Sea, became an important harbour during the 18th century. Attacked by buccaneers and by the English, Dutch, and French armadas, La Guaira was transformed into a fortified, walled city. During the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739–1748), the first attack of the Royal Navy took place on La Guaira. This period also saw the trading monopoly of the Royal Gipuzkoan Company of Caracas, which controlled the major ports of La Guaira and Puerto Cabello and was instrumental in the development of large-scale cocoa production along the valleys of the coast. The English frigate HMS Hermione (1782) was delivered to the Spanish authorities at La Guaira after her crew mutinied in 1797. Another small naval battle was fought off La Guaira in 1812, between privateers of the United States and the United Kingdom. Now La Guaira is the second port by importance in Venezuela after Puerto Cabello. ==Geography== La Guaira Bank () is an underwater ridge that is approximately 12 miles off the coast from the city of La Guaira. The bank is approximately long from east to west and wide from north to south, and it rises from in the surrounding area to . The area provides the structure to deep-sea animals, and other organisms such as gorgonians, sponges, and coral, that require ocean currents to bring their food to them. Westerly currents flow off the coast of Venezuela, and the bank acts as a barrier to the current, creating an upwelling of nutrients to the ocean surface from deep-water stockpiles. These nutrients fuel an explosion of planktonic plant and animal growth, and attract larger animals such as whales, porpoises, seabirds, and large pelagics such as tuna, sharks, wahoo, dolphin fish, and four different types of marlin. It is considered one of the top sport fishing destinations in the world due to the unusually high numbers of Atlantic blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, and spearfish that congregate at different seasons, and are available year-round. ==References== Category:Cities in Vargas (state) Category:Populated places established in 1577 Category:Port cities in the Caribbean Category:Port cities in Venezuela Category:Ports and harbours of Venezuela ","title":"La Guaira"},{"id":"2570864","text":"Laufen is a town on the southeastern border of Bavaria, Germany with Austria. ==History== It was first mentioned in a deed of 748. The rapids that gave the town the name (Laufen = rapid running waters) were also responsible for the town's wealth from the salt trade. Small boats that transported the extremely valuable cargo from the rapids north of Salzburg were reloaded at Laufen to larger boats by privilege of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. When the independent principality was finally divided in 1816 between the Bavarian kingdom and the Habsburg Empire in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, the town was split into a Bavarian part carrying the name of Laufen and into an Austrian town (the former Laufen suburbs on the right hand side of the river) by the name of Oberndorf. With the building of railways by the middle of the 19th century the transport of salt on the river Salzach came to an end, taking away the former source of wealth. A number of floods devastated both towns by the end of the century. The flood of 1899 destroyed the old bridge. A new iron bridge was built in a safer place up the river and opened jointly by the King of Bavaria and the Austrian Emperor in 1903. Laufen Castle is a square-shaped 15th-century castle that was built for the Archbishop of Salzburg. It overlooks the Salzach river. During World War II the castle was used first as a prisoner-of-war camp for officers, Oflag VII-C. Then In May 1942 the officers were transferred to another camp, and the castle was used as an internment camp Ilag VII housing some hundreds of men deported from the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey and some American civilians that had been caught in Europe by the declaration of war by Germany on the United States on 11 December 1941.

Alphonsus Johannes Maria Diepenbrock (2 September 1862 in Amsterdam – 5 April 1921) was a Dutch composer, essayist and classicist. ==Life and work== Witsen's studio (1891) Diepenbrock was not a musician by training. Brought up in a prosperous Catholic family, although he showed musical ability as a child, the expectation was that he would enter a university rather than a conservatory. And so he studied classics at the University of Amsterdam, gaining his doctorate cum laude in 1888 with a dissertation in Latin on the life of Seneca. The same year he became a teacher, a job which he held until 1894, and his decision to devote himself to music. As a composer, he had been completely self-taught from an early age. He created a musical idiom which, in a highly personal manner, combined 16th- century polyphony with Wagnerian chromaticism, to which in later years was added the impressionistic refinement that he encountered in Debussy's music. His predominantly vocal output is distinguished by the high quality of the texts used. Apart from the Ancient Greek dramatists and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, he was inspired by, among others, Goethe, Novalis, Vondel, Brentano, Hölderlin, Heine, Nietzsche, Baudelaire and Verlaine. As a conductor, he performed many contemporary works, including Gustav Mahler's Fourth Symphony (at the Concertgebouw) as well as works by Fauré and Debussy. Diepenbrock is one of the Dutch composers whose name is displayed on the first balcony of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Throughout his life, Diepenbrock continued his interests in the wider cultural sphere, remaining a classics tutor and publishing works on literature, painting, politics, philosophy and religion. Indeed, during his lifetime his musical skills were often overlooked. Nonetheless, Diepenbrock was very much a respected figure within musical circles. He counted amongst his friends Mahler, Richard Strauss and Arnold Schoenberg. Alphons Diepenbrock is related to Cardinal Melchior von Diepenbrock, who was his great uncle, as well as to a branch of the family that immigrated to America in 1879. He married Rosmalen, Netherlands 8 August 1895 Lady Wilhelmina Elisabeth Cornelia Petronella de Jong van Beek en Donk. ==Works and discography== * Ave Maria, RC 23 (1880) ** Christa Pfeiler (mezz. sop.), Rudolf Jansen (piano), Alphons Diepenbrock—Songs 3, NM Classics 92052 (1996) * De klare dag, RC 4 (1881) ** Christoph Prégardien (ten.), Rudolf Jansen (piano), Alphons Diepenbrock—Songs 3, NM Classics 92052 (1996), Alphons Diepenbrock—Anniversary Edition, Et'Cetera KTC 1435 (2012) * Avondzang, RC 13 “Het zuidewindje suist” (1885) ** Christoph Prégardien, Rudolf Jansen (piano), Alphons Diepenbrock—Songs 3, NM Classics 92052 (1996), Alphons Diepenbrock—Anniversary Edition, Et'Cetera KTC 1435 (2012) * Meinacht, RC 14 “Ik zag in ’t grondloos blauw de sterren vonken” (1885) ** Jard van Nes (mezz. sop.), Rudolf Jansen (piano), Alphons Diepenbrock—Songs 3, NM Classics 92052 (1996), Alphons Diepenbrock—Anniversary Edition, Et'Cetera KTC 1435 (2012) * Maanlicht, RC 15 “O geur’ger heft zich ied’re bloeme” (1885) ** Christoph Prégardien (ten.), Rudolf Jansen (piano), Alphons Diepenbrock—Songs 3, NM Classics 92052 (1996), Alphons Diepenbrock—Anniversary Edition, Et'Cetera KTC 1435 (2012) * Drei Ballades, op. 1 (1885) ** 1.

It is the Pays de Bitche's capital city and the seat of the canton of Bitche and the communauté de communes du Pays de Bitche. The town belongs to the Northern Vosges Regional Nature Park and is rated 4-flowers at the towns and villages in bloom competition. As of the 2013 France census, the town's population is 5,225. The inhabitants of the commune are known as Bitchois and Bitchoises. The town is known for its large citadel originating from a castle built at the beginning of the 13th century. The fortress is noted for its resistance during the Franco-Prussian War. Louis-Casimir Teyssier, its commander and chief, held the place for about 8 months with 3,000 men against about 20,000 Prussian and Bavarian soldiers until the French government ordered him to surrender after the ceasefire in . The town became part of Germany after that date until the end of the First World War, when it was given back to France. During the Second World War, it was annexed by the Third German Reich (-). ==Geography== Bitche is located near the German border on the small river Horn, at the foot of the northern slope of the Vosges between Haguenau and Sarreguemines. ==History== The town of Bitche, which was formed from the villages of Rohr and Kaltenhausen in the 17th century, derives its name from the old stronghold (mentioned in 1172 as Bytis Castrum) standing on a rock some above the town. This had long given its name to the countship of Bitsch, which was originally in the possession of the dukes of Lorraine. In 1297 it passed by marriage to Eberhard I of Zweibrücken-Bitsch, whose line became extinct in 1569, when the countship reverted to Lorraine. It passed with that duchy to France in 1766. After 1766 the town rapidly increased in population. The citadel, which had been constructed by Vauban on the site of the old castle after the capture of Bitche by the French in 1624, had been destroyed when it was restored to Lorraine in 1698. This was restored and strengthened in 1740 into a fortress that proved impregnable up until the 20th century. The attack upon it by the Prussians in 1793 was repulsed. In 1815 during Napoleon's Hundred Days, Brigadier-General Creutzer was the commandant. Bitche was besieged by General Zollern's Fourth Infantry Division of the Austrian IV Corps, but Creutzer refused to surrender until the general armistice. Although Bitche was hotly contested by the Germans after the battle of Wörth during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, it held out until the war's end. A large part of the fortification is built into the red sandstone rock, and was rendered bomb- proof; a supply of water was secured to the garrison by a deep well in the interior. Commander of the fortress of Bitche was Louis-Casimir Teyssier.. After the war, it was given to German Empire as part of Alsace-Lorraine. It was given back to France in 1918. The town is near the Maginot Line, into which the citadel was integrated. Alsace-Lorraine returned to Germany after the French Campaign in the summer of 1940 and remained under German occupation. The training ground at Bitche was utilized by the German Army to form new divisions, for example the 65th Infantry Division formed at Bitche in July 1942.Welten, Wilhelm \\"Vom Kugelbaum zur Handgranate: die Gesichte der 65. Infanterie Division\\" Bitche was liberated in December 1944 by allied troops but was relinquished in the withdrawal forced by the German counteroffensive. In March 1945 the U.S. 100th Infantry Division broke through the Maginot Line in the Bitche area and liberated the town for good. The attack was a part of Operation Undertone. After 1945, Bitche became one of the busiest military camps where all parts of the French army manoeuvered. Infantry and cavalry also went to Bitche for experimenting with new weapons during the Cold War. Special training took place against potential bacteriological attacks from the \\"EAST\\" side.

It is approached by a road which runs along the top of a barrier constructed in the 1960s to create dry land. The project is considered by many to be a failure since little dry land was created and massive ecological disruption was caused by salt water penetration of the delta. The delta is covered mostly by mangrove swamp but there is a huge range of other flora and fauna, making it one of the world's more ecologically diverse places. Significant amounts of oil have been discovered in the western parts of the delta and there is apprehension that exploitation of this oil will cause substantial ecological damage. == Religion == Tucupita is the cathedral see of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Tucupita, with the Cathedral of the Divine Shepherdess. == (Eco-)Tourism == Chicharronera in Tucupita.

It was announced on 20 June 2013 that VOSA would merge with the Driving Standards Agency into a single agency in 2014.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/improving-services-for-motorists The name of the new agency was confirmed as the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) on 28 November 2013.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/driver- and-vehicle-standards-agency-named VOSA was abolished on 31 March 2014, and its responsibilities passed to the DVSA on 1 April 2014. ==History== The Agency was created from the merger of the Vehicle Inspectorate (VI) and the Traffic Area Network (TAN). The public are most aware of its activities through its regulation of the MOT vehicle inspection test in Great Britain. VOSA are generally better known by commercial vehicle operators as \\"The Ministry\\", a throwback to the days of the former Ministry of Transport (MOT). In Northern Ireland this role is performed by the Driver & Vehicle Agency. In 2005 it had approximately 2,500 staff, 1,700 of which are based at its lorry testing garages across Great Britain. Chief Executives Maurice Newey had been appointed chief executive of the Vehicle Inspectorate in 1998 and became the first chief executive of VOSA in 2003. Stephen Tetlow, joined VOSA as Chief Executive in December 2004 following the retirement of Newey. Alastair Peoples took over from Tetlow as Chief Executive in 2008 until 2014 when VOSA and DSA merges to form DVSA ===Enforcement charges=== Its examiners have been granted the ability to issue fixed penalty tickets from 1 April 2009. These cover a range of offences including breaches of drivers hours legislation, overloaded vehicles and also mechanical defects. These tickets can be issued to both UK and foreign nationals. In the first 3 months since the implementation of fixed penalties, the Agency has taken more than £500,000 in fines. == Intent == * To improve road safety and the environment and safeguard fair competition by promoting and enforcing compliance with commercial operator licensing requirements; * Processing applications for licences to operate lorries and buses; * Registering bus services; * Operating and administering testing schemes for all vehicles, including the supervision of the MOT Testing Scheme; * Enforcing the law on vehicles to ensure that they comply with legal standards and regulations; * Enforcing drivers' hours and licensing requirements; * Providing training and advice for commercial operators; and * Investigating vehicle accidents, defects and recalls. == Customers == Its customers were the Road Haulage and Public Service Vehicle (PSV) industries, trade associations, vehicle manufacturers, MOT garages, and offenders and defendants. == Powers to stop vehicles == Under the Police Reform Act 2002, section 41 and Schedule 5, Chief Constables could grant powers (under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme) to VOSA officers to stop vehicles, for checks on vehicle and driver compliance without the need for police support (later expanded to stop any vehicle, although mainly goods and passenger carrying vehicles). At that time, only police officers had the power to stop vehicles and therefore had to be present. The powers were piloted in 2003 and brought more widely into force in 2004.Minister launches VOSA's Power to Stop, VOSA press release, 29 July 2004 Following a consultation in July 2010, the law was overhauled in 2011 to grant VOSA officers the power to stop vehicles without relying on police approval through Community Safety Accreditation Schemes as above. This also allowed VOSA officers to stop vehicles in Scotland, as well as in England and Wales as previously. The amendment, which was made by the Road Vehicles (Powers to Stop) Regulations 2011, allows \\"stopping officers\\" approved by the Department for Transport to stop vehicles for certain reasons.Road Vehicles (Powers to Stop) Regulations 2011 To be appointed as a stopping officer, a person must: *be a suitable person to exercise the powers of a stopping officer, *be capable of effectively exercising their powers, and *have received adequate training for the exercise of their powers.

British Geological Survey In the early 19th century the settlement was a hamlet, no more than a group of cottages on common land. At first part of Downton parish, by 1841 Nomansland had been excluded from the parish and was deemed an extra-parochial place, then in 1857 became a civil parish which was joined to Redlynch parish in 1934.

It is found in the cuisines of the Turkish cuisine, Balkans, the South Caucasus, the Levant, and other parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. A börek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. The top of the börek is occasionally sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds. ==Origin and name== Börek was a popular element of Ottoman cuisine, and has been invented at the Ottoman court,Oxford Companion to Food, s.v. though there are also indications it was made among Central Asian Turks;Perry, Charles. \\"The Taste for Layered Bread among the Nomadic Turks and the Central Asian Origins of Baklava\\", in A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East (ed. Sami Zubaida, Richard Tapper), 1994, . other versions may date to the Classical era of the eastern Mediterranean.Patrick Faas (2003). Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 184.Speros Vryonis The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor, 1971, p. 482 The word börek comes from Turkish and refers to any dish made with yufka. Tietze proposes that the word comes from the Turkic root bur- 'to twist',.Tietze, Türkisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, Band I, Ankara/Wien Sevortyan offers various alternative etymologies, all of them based on a fronted vowel /ö/ or /ü/. Tietze's proposed source \\"bur-\\" (with a backed vowel /u/) for büräk/börek (with fronted vowels) is not included, because sound harmony would dictate a suffix \\"-aq\\" with a harmonised, backed /q/.Э.В. Севортян, Этимологический Словарь Тюркских Языков, Том Б, Москва 1978 Turkic languages in Arabic orthography, however, invariably write ك and not ق which rules out \\"bur-\\" which has a backed vowel /u/ at its core. Börek may have its origins in Turkish cuisine and may be one of its most significant and, in fact, ancient elements of the Turkish cuisine, having been developed by the Turks of Central Asia before their westward migration to Anatolia in the late Middle Ages, or it may be a descendant of the pre-existing Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Anatolian dish en tyritas plakountas (Byzantine Greek: εν τυρίτας πλακούντας) \\"cheesy placenta\\", itself a descendant of placenta, the classical baked layered dough and cheese dish of Ancient Roman cuisine. Recent ethnographic research indicates that börek was probably invented separately by the nomadic Turks of central Asia some time before the seventh century. ==Distribution and variants== Börek is very popular in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, especially in North Africa and throughout the Balkans. The South Slavic cuisines also feature derivatives of the börek. Börek is also part of Mizrahi and Sephardic Jewish traditions. They have been enthusiastically adopted by the Ottoman Jewish communities, and have been described, along with boyos de pan and bulemas, as forming \\"the trio of preeminent Ottoman Jewish pastries\\". ===Turkey=== Turkey Sigara or kalem böreği Çibörek and Ayran Turkey enjoys a wide variety of regional variations of börek among the different cultures and ethnicities composing it, including: *Su böreği 'water börek' is one of the most common types. Sheets of dough are boiled briefly in large pans, then a mixture of feta cheese and parsley (or in an alternative recipe minced meat, onions, tomato sauce) and oil is scattered between the layers. The whole thing is brushed with butter and laid in a masonry oven to cook. it may be thought of as a drier, less saucy version of the Italian lasagna. *Sigara böreği 'cigarette börek' or kalem böreği 'pen börek', a smaller, cylindrical variety is often filled with feta cheese, potato, parsley and sometimes with minced meat or sausage. A variety of vegetables, herbs and spices are used in böreks, such as spinach, nettle, leek, and courgette, and usually ground black pepper. The name kalem böreği was adopted in September 2011 by some Turkish pastry organisations in order to avoid alluding to smoking. *Paçanga böreği, is a traditional Sephardic Jewish specialty of Istanbul filled with pastırma or kaşar, and julienned green peppers fried in olive oil and eaten as a meze. *Saray böreği 'palace börek' is a layered börek where fresh butter is rolled between each of the dough sheets. *Talaş böreği or Nemse böreği 'sawdust' or 'Austrian' börek, is a small square börek mostly filled with lamb cubes and green peas, that has starchier yufka sheets, making it puffy and crispy. *Kol böreği 'arm börek' is prepared in long rolls, either rounded or lined, and filled with either minced meat, feta cheese, spinach or potato and baked at a low temperature. *Sarıyer böreği is a smaller and a little fattier version of the \\"Kol böreği\\", named after Sarıyer, a district of Istanbul *Gül böreği 'rose börek', also known as Yuvarlak böreği 'round or spiral börek' are rolled into small spirals and have a spicier filling than other börek. *Çiğ börek or Çibörek 'raw börek' is a half-round shaped börek, filled with raw minced meat and fried in oil on the concave side of the sac, very popular in places with a thriving Tatar community, such as Eskişehir, Polatlı and Konya. *Töbörek is another Tatar variety, similar to a çiğ börek, but baked either on the convex side of the sac, or in a masonry oven instead of being fried in oil. *Laz böreği, a specialty of the Rize region, is a sweet version, filled with muhallebi (Ottoman-style milk pudding or custard) and served sprinkled with powdered sugar. It similar to Greek Bougatsa. *Küt Böreği is similar to Laz böreği, without the custard filling. It is also called sade (plain) börek and served with fine powdered sugar. Most of the time, the word \\"börek\\" is accompanied in Turkish by a descriptive word referring to the shape, ingredients of the pastry, for the cooking methods or for or a specific region where it is typically prepared, as in the above kol böreği, su böreği, talaş böreği or Sarıyer böreği. Tatar böreği (Tatar börek) is an alternative name for the cheese and mint filled dumpling dish known as mantı. ===Albanian byrek and lakror=== Byrek in Albania In Albania, this dish is called byrek. In Kosovo and few other regions byrek is also known as \\"pite\\". Byrek is traditionally made with several layers of dough that have been thinly rolled out by hand. The final form can be small, individual triangles, especially from street vendors called 'Byrektore' which sell byrek and other traditional pastries and drinks. It can also be made as one large byrek that is cut into smaller pieces. There are different regional variations of byrek. It can be served cold or hot. The most common fillings include: cheese (especially gjizë, salted curd cheese), ground meat and onions (ragù style filling), spinach and eggs, milk and eggs with pre-baked dough layers, but it can also be made with tomato and onions, peppers and beans, potato or a sweet filling of pumpkin, nettles (known as byrek me hithra), kidney beans (popular in winter), etc. Lakror is a specific kind of byrek from the region of Korça. The defining characteristics of lakror is that it is made up of only two layers of pastry and traditionally cooked on embers with a metal semispherical lid. Lakror is generally filled with greens, e.g. leek and gjizë (a kind of cottage cheese, thicker than ricotta), lakër being an Albanian word for cabbage but in this context an abbreviation of \\"lakër e egër\\", a term which describes a family of green leaf vegetables i.e. sorrel, dandelion, scarole, catsear, etc. Other fillings are also possible, and tomato and onion is also common. Another related dish is Fli, typical from the North of Albania and Kosovo. It is made up of layers of a flour and water batter, cream and butter. Traditionally, it is baked on embers like lakror. ===Armenian byorek=== In Armenia, byorek (բյորեկ) or borek (բորեկ), consists of dough, or phyllo dough, folded into triangles and stuffed with cheese, spinach or ground beef, and the filling is typically spiced. A popular combination is spinach, feta, cottage cheese (or pot cheese) and a splash of anise-flavoured liquor (such as raki). ===Assyrian burek=== Assyrian burek is usually stuffed with spiced ground beef, finely chopped onion, paprika, parsley and spices. The stuffing is placed on a thin layer of rolled out dough, then sealed, resembling a half moon or an empanada. Lastly, it is oven-baked or fried. ===Bulgarian byurek=== The Bulgarian version of the pastry, locally called byurek (Cyrillic: бюрек), is typically regarded as a variation of banitsa (баница), a similar Bulgarian dish. Bulgarian byurek is a type of banitsa with sirene cheese, the difference being that byurek also has eggs added. In Bulgarian, the word byurek has also come to be applied to other dishes similarly prepared with cheese and eggs, such as chushka byurek (чушка бюрек), a peeled and roasted pepper filled with cheese, and tikvichka byurek (тиквичка бюрек), blanched or uncooked bits of squash with eggs filling. ===Greek bouréki, bourekáki, bougatsa, and pita=== Galaktoboureko, sweet börek flavoured with lemon or orange In Greece, boureki (μπουρέκι ) or bourekaki (μπουρεκάκι , the diminutive form of the word), and Cyprus poureki (πουρέκι, in the Greek dialects of the island) are small pastries made with phyllo dough or with pastry crust. Pastries in the börek family are also called pita (pie): tiropita, spanakopita and so on. The traditional filling for spanakopita comprises chopped spinach, feta cheese, onions or spring onions, egg, and seasoning.Zane, Eva (1992). Greek Cooking for the Gods. Santa Rosa, California: The Cole Group. . A special type of boureki is found in the local cuisine of Crete and especially in the area of Chania. It is a pie filled with sliced zucchini, sliced potatoes, mizithra or feta cheese and spearmint, and may be baked with or without a thick top crust of phyllo. A photo of bougatsa, a Greek variant of börek Bougatsa (Greek μπουγάτσα ) is a Greek variation of a börek which consists of either semolina custard, cheese, or minced meat filling between layers of phyllo, and is said to originate in the city of Serres, an art of pastry brought with the immigrants from Constantinople and is most popular in Thessaloniki, in the Central Macedonia region of Northern Greece.http://www.thessalonikiartsandculture.gr/blog/texnopersona/i-istoria- tis-bougatsas#.Vwkdo5yLT4Y The Greek city of Serres achieved the record for the largest puff pastry on 1 June 2008. It weighed 182.2kg, was 20 metres long, and was made by more than 40 bakers.http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-bougatsa Guinness World Records In Venetian Corfu, boureki was also called burriche, and filled with meat and leafy greens. Galaktoboureko is a syrupy phyllo pastry filled with custard, common throughout Greece and Cyprus. In the Epirus, σκερ-μπουρέκ (derives from the Turkish şeker-börek, \\"sugar-börek\\") is a small rosewater-flavoured marzipan sweet. The Pontian Greek piroski (πιροσκί) derives its name from börek too.Κοπιάστε στην Κουζίνα μου. Υγιεινές – αυθεντικές Ελληνικές και Κυπριακές συνταγές It's almost identical in name and form to pirozhki (Russian: пирожки), which is of Slavic origin, and popular in Russia and further east. ===Israel=== Fresh potato bourekas on sale at a stall in Mahane Yehuda Market, Jerusalem In Israel, bourekas () became popular as Sephardic Jewish immigrants who settled there cooked the cuisine of their native countries. Bourekas can be made from either phyllo dough or puff pastry filled with various fillings. The most popular fillings are salty cheese and mashed potato, with other fillings including mushrooms, ground meat, sweet potato, chickpeas, olives, spinach, mallows, swiss chard, eggplant and pizza-flavour. Most bourekas in Israel are made with margarine-based doughs rather than butter-based doughs so that (at least the non-cheese filled varieties) can be eaten along with either milk meals or meat meals in accordance with the kosher prohibition against mixing milk and meat at the same meal. Israeli bourekas come in several shapes and are often sprinkled with seeds. The shapes and choice of seeds are usually indicative of their fillings and have become fairly standard among small bakeries and large factories alike. For example, Salty cheese (Bulgarian cheese)-filled as well as Tzfat cheese (from the city of Safed) with Za'atar-filled bourekas are usually somewhat flat triangles with white sesame seeds on top. Less salty cheese-filled are semi-circular and usually made with puff pastry. Potato- filled are sesame topped, flat squares or rectangles made with phyllo and tend to be less oily than most other versions. Mushroom-filled are bulging triangles with poppy seeds. Tuna-filled are bulging triangles with nigella seeds. Eggplant-filled are cylindrical with nigella seeds. Bean sprout-filled are cylindrical without seeds. Spinach-filled are either cylindrical with sesame seeds or made with a very delicate, oily phyllo dough shaped into round spirals. Bourekas with a pizza sauce are often round spirals rising toward the middle or sometimes cylindrical without seeds, differentiated from the bean sprout-filled cylinders without seeds by the red sauce oozing out the ends. Bourekas can also be found with mashed chickpeas, tuna and chickpea mix, pumpkin and even small cocktail frankfurters. Another variation filled with meat (beef, chicken or lamb), pine nuts, parsley and spices are eaten mainly as a main dish but sometimes as meze. The North African version, Brik can also be found in Israel. Bourekas come in small, \\"snack\\" size, often available in self-service bakeries, and sizes as large as four or five inches. The larger ones can serve as a snack or a meal, and can be sliced open, and stuffed with hard-boiled egg, pickles, tomatoes and Sahawiq, a spicy Yemenite paste. Supermarkets stock a wide selection of frozen raw-dough bourekas ready for home baking. Bakeries and street vendors dealing exclusively in bourekas can be found in most Israeli cities. Small coffee-shop type establishments as well as lottery and sports betting parlors serving bourekas and coffee can also be found. Meat bourekas are less common at bakeries and are considered something which is to be made at home. Meat bourekas are made from lamb, beef or chicken mixed with onion, parsley, coriander, or mint, pine nuts and spices, They are served as hot meze. The use of margarine in bourekas has caused some controversy in Israel due to a general trend of moving away from trans fats, which are found in many margarines. Bourekas have given their name to Bourekas films, a peculiarly Israeli genre of comic melodramas or tearjerkers based on ethnic stereotypes. ===Former Yugoslavia=== In the nations established or reestablished in the stead of the territories of the former Yugoslavia, burek is regularly available at most bakeries, and usually eaten as \\"fast food\\". It is often consumed with yogurt. Apart from being sold at bakeries, burek is served in specialised stores selling burek (or pitas) and yogurt exclusively (Buregdžinica). As of 2019, these terms seem to be virtually synonymous to one another, the reason being that Buregdžinica style shops would diversify and sell other pastries as well. ====Bosnian burek==== Bosnian rolled burek In the former Yugoslavia, burek, also known as pita in Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively, is an extremely common dish, made with yufka and the Bosnian variant is arguably the most regionally prominent. It may be eaten for any meal of the day. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the burek is a meat-filled pastry, traditionally rolled in a spiral and cut into sections for serving. The same spiral filled with cottage cheese is called sirnica, with spinach and cheese zeljanica, with potatoes krompiruša, and all of them are generically referred to as pita. Eggs are used as a binding agent when making sirnica and zeljanica. This kind of pastry is also popular in Croatia, where it was imported by Bosnian Croats, and is usually called rolani burek (rolled burek). In Serbian towns, Bosnian pastry dishes were imported by war refugees in the 1990s, and are usually called sarajevske pite or bosanske pite (Sarajevo pies or Bosnian pies). Similar dishes, although somewhat wider and with thinner dough layers, are called savijača or just \\"pita\\" in Serbia. These are usually homemade and not traditionally offered in bakeries. In 2012, Lonely Planet included the Bosnian burek in their \\"The World's Best Street Food\\" book. ====Round burek in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Slovenia==== Round burek (filled with minced meat) is made in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia. In Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia, burek is made from layers of dough, alternating with layers of other fillings in a circular baking pan and then topped with a last layer of dough. Traditionally it may be baked with no filling (prazan, meaning empty), with stewed minced meat and onions, or with cheese. Modern bakeries offer cheese and spinach, apple, sour cherries, potato, mushroom, and other fillings. The recipe for \\"round\\" burek was developed in the Serbian town of Niš. In 1498, it was introduced by a famous Turkish baker, Mehmed Oğlu from Istanbul. Eventually burek spread from the southeast (southern Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia) to the rest of Yugoslavia. Niš hosts an annual burek competition and festival called Buregdžijada. In 2005, a 100 kg (220 lbs) burek was made, with a diameter of 2 metres (≈6 ft) and it is considered to have been the world biggest burek ever made. In Slovenia, burek is one of the most popular fast-food dishes, but at least one researcher found that it is viewed negatively by Slovenes due to their prejudices towards immigrants, especially those from other countries of Former Yugoslavia. A publication of a diploma thesis on this at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana in 2010 stirred controversy regarding the appropriateness of the topic. The mentor of the student that had written the thesis described the topic as legitimate and burek as denoting primitive behavior in Slovenia in spite of it being a sophisticated food. He explained the controversy as a good example of the conclusions of the student. Actually, already in 2008, an employee of the Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SRC SASA) had attained his PhD degree with a thesis on meta-burek at the University of Nova Gorica. ===Romania=== In Romania, the food falls under the name \\"plăcintă\\" and is most often made with cheese or cheese and spinach.

Mexican cumbia is a musical subgenre of cumbia which was reinvented in Mexico. == Origins == The cumbia started in Colombia in the 1800s. In the 1940s Colombian singer Luis Carlos Meyer Castandet emigrated to Mexico where he worked with the Mexican orchestra director Rafael de Paz. In the 1950s he recorded what many people think was the first cumbia recorded outside of Colombia, \\"La Cumbia Cienaguera\\". He recorded other hits like \\"La historia\\". This is when Cumbia began to be popularized in Mexico. In the 1970s Aniceto Molina also emigrated to Mexico, where he joined the group from Guerrero, La Luz Roja de San Marcos, and recorded many popular tropical cumbias like \\"El Gallo Mojado\\", \\"El Peluquero\\", and \\"La Mariscada\\". Also in the 1970s Rigo Tovar became very popular with his fusion of cumbia with ballad and rock. ==Subgenres and variations== The Mexican cumbia has adapted versions of Colombian music like Peruvian cumbia or Argentine cumbia, among others. This diversity has appeared in different ways. For example, originally the northern cumbia (cumbia norteña) was usually played with accordion and consists of tunes with few chords and slower speed than original cumbia. This musical subset of cumbia is featured by artists, such as Ramón Ayala, Acapulco Tropical, Bronco, Límite, and Los Barón de Apodaca. In southern cumbia, however, the accordion is replaced by piano or organ, and the pace is faster and more elaborated both harmonically and instrumentally than in the original cumbia. Notable artists of this style include names such as Los Sonnors, Socios del Ritmo, and Chico Che. Other subgenres of Mexican cumbia include Cumbia Mariachi, Cumbia Andina Mexicana, and Cumbia Sonidera. The Orchestral Cumbia is another variant represented by big orchestras, like Pablo Beltrán Ruiz, Orquesta Tampico, Orquesta Coatzacoalcos, Roy Luis among others, that popularized many cumbias with full big band sound. ==1950s== The 1940s through the mid-1960s were Colombia's \\"golden age of cumbia,\\" during which the country's folklore was reflected on a worldwide scale. However, Colombia was also influenced by other musical genres, especially those from the north, such as the Mexican mariachi music, as well as the Afro-Caribbean salsa, merengue, and vallenato. Colombian cumbia has spread throughout Latin America, and it has gained popularity in countries like Argentina, Mexico, and Peru. The adaptation of cumbia was easy in these countries for several reasons. For example, in Argentina cumbia was picked up effortlessly because of the use of accordion, an instrument also widely used in the Argentinian tango music. Moreover, the Mexican norteño style similarly featured accordion as the main musical instrument being used. == The origins of Mexican cumbia dance and instrument composition == The emergence of the original Mexican ensemble for performing cumbia emerged from the early 1940s in the orchestras of Rafael de Paz and Tony Camargo.[LA BANDOLERA - TONY CAMARGO (1953- RCA Víctor, división tropical)] Rafael de Paz and Tony Camargo added the metallic sounds from Cuban music, which predominated in the country, into cumbia music when Luis Carlos Meyer (native of Colombia) migrated to Mexico carrying the cumbias (dances) and porros (folk dances) of his country. Cumbia originates from Colombia, and variations have been made in various countries based on the original Colombian style.2) Favoretto, Mara. Tango and Cumbia villera: Origins, Encounters, and Tensions. University of Texas Press. 2016. There have been various writers who have analyzed the cross-country spread of Cumbia and both its positive and negative effects on listeners.4) Agudelo, Juan. “Cumbia! Scenes of a Migrant Latin American Music Genre/ Natión, Etnia Y Género en Latinoamerica/ Troubling Gender: Youth and Cumbia in Argentina’s Music Scene.” Latin American Music Review, vol 35, no. 2, Fall/Winter2014, pp 289-293. EBSCO Both styles of ensembles were merged due to Meyers not having the traditional Colombian instrumentation. This is shown in the recordings of RCA Víctor Mexico by 1945 when they were already popular.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FnxyTBvDio The traditional Bolero music in Mexico of the Cuban and Puerto Rican trios included maracas, and the predominant Cuban music of the time as shown in the national cinematography gave account of the adoption of these instruments. In Colombia, Lucho Bermúdez already was playing cumbias starting in 1940. He used an orchestra with a greater number of instruments that differed with the ones used in Mexico, being based mainly on saxophones and clarinets that are used to play the melody, along with an orchestral base. His music was shown in national film, but in the Mexican style.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxNtLGG3wxs One reason why Lucho Bermúdez decided to leave Colombia was because there were not many quality recording studios, so he was invited to Argentina to record in studios of superior quality (RCA Víctor).Fontalvo, Jose Portaccio. Carmen Tierra Mía: Lucho Bermudez: Disformas Triviño LTDA., 1997, Print.

This was a style not seen in the Colombian recordings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aC1zp3XG08 This conductor is supported by the musical arrangements of the renowned and international Mexican author Fernando Z.

His two wives both predeceased him, and he died in Glasgow in 1913. ==Career== Howden served as an apprentice from 1847 with James Gray & Co., a Glasgow engineering firm,Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland, ed. Keay, J. and J., London, HarperCollins, 1994, p. 524 passing through the various departments and eventually becoming chief draughtsman. Having finished his apprenticeship he started work first with Bell and Miller, the civil engineers, then with Robert Griffiths, who designed marine screw propellers. In 1854 Howden launched himself as a consultant engineer and designer, his first major invention being a rivet-making machine. The selling of the patent rights to a company in Birmingham for this secured him financially and James Howden & Co. was established as a manufacturer of marine equipment. In 1857 Howden began work on the design and supply of boilers and steam engines for the marine industry;History of the Howden Group howden.com, accessed 27 September 2009 his first contract was with Hendersons to supply the Anchor Liner Ailsa Craig with a compound steam engine and water boilers, using steam at 100 lb pressure. That same year, together with Alexander Morton of Glasgow, he was awarded a patent for the \\"invention of improvements in obtaining motive power.\\"London Gazette, December 18, 1857 london-gazette.co.uk, accessed 3 October 2009 On 28 February 1859 he applied for a patent for the \\"improvements in machinery, or apparatus for cutting, shaping, punching, and compressing metals.\\"London Gazette, March 29, 1859. london-gazette.co.uk, accessed 3 October 2009 In 1860 he patented a method of preheating combustion air; his patent was granted for the invention of \\"improvements in steam engines and boilers, and in the apparatus connected therewith\\".London Gazette, December 14, 1860 london-gazette.co.uk, accessed 4 October 2009 In 1862 he decided to construct main boilers and engines to his own design and started manufacturing in his first factory on Scotland Street in Glasgow's Tradeston district.History of Howden & Co. scottisharchitecture.com, accessed 28 September 2009 A breakthrough came in 1863 when he introduced a furnace mechanical draught system which used a steam turbine driven axial flow fan. The Lusitania after her maiden voyage in 1907; she was one of a number of notable liners that used the Howden forced draught system. Howden is chiefly remembered as the inventor of the Howden forced draught system, which forced heated waste gases into the combustion chamber by means of a fan and ductwork and which appeared in the 1880s. This system dramatically reduced the amount of coal used in ships' boilers. Howden patented this device in 1882 as the 'Howden System of Forced Draught' and during the 1880s more than 1000 boilers were converted to this specification or constructed to Howden's patent. The first vessel to use the system was the New York City, built in 1885. Amongst the liners to use the Howden system in their boilers were the Lusitania and Mauretania, the fastest liners in the world when they were built. Howden's original Glasgow factory being too small for his expanding operation, he had a new, larger one designed by Nisbet Sinclair at 195 Scotland Street, down the road from his original factory. This opened in 1898 and featured overhead cranes, handling equipment and central-heating (a rarity at the time). As a result of an overflowing order book, the factory was enlarged, first in 1904, and again in 1912, to a design by Bryden & Robertson. As of 2009, this redbrick factory – \\"one of the last remaining Victorian heavy engineering works in Glasgow\\", and the place where the tunnel boring machines used in the excavation of the Channel Tunnel were made – lies empty. The Mauretania in World War I In the 1900s Howden designed a fully enclosed high-speed marine steam engine. This was later modified for use in land-based systems as the Howden-Zoelly steam turbine. At the onset of the First World War, a year after Howden's death, the Admiralty ruled that all ships were to be fitted with Howden \\"blowers\\" so that they could outrun U-boats. Amongst the projects that Howden worked on were assisting the St Helena Whaling Company, quarrying marble in Greece and working on the design of a recoilless gun for the Admiralty. Howden was the last surviving founder member of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, founded in 1857. Although he was a lifelong Liberal, he took no part in politics or public life. ==Bibliography== *Munn, C.

On January 1, 1984, Pacific Northwest Bell was split from AT&T; as ordered in the settlement of United States v. AT&T; and became a subsidiary of the newly formed Regional Bell Operating Company U S WEST, Inc. Pacific Northwest Bell became defunct when U S WEST consolidated its three main subsidiaries, forming U S WEST Communications, Inc. on January 1, 1991. U S WEST merged with Qwest Communications International Inc. in 2000, and the US WEST brand was replaced by the Qwest brand. Qwest Communications merged with Louisiana-based CenturyLink in 2011, and the Qwest brand was replaced by the CenturyLink brand. ==History== ===Sunset Telephone & Telegraph Company === On March 7, 1883, the Sunset Telephone-Telegraph Company opened for business with 90 subscribers. This first office was in rented space in the Western Union Telegraph office. Weeks later the company moved into its own building at the corner of Second Avenue and Cherry Street. In 1899 the original company was reincorporated as the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Company and continued under that name until 1917 when the Sunset Company (which had grown to provide service throughout Washington and northern Idaho) merged with the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. === Pacific Telephone & Telegraph and Pacific Northwest Bell === Telephones began to crop up all over Oregon, Washington and northern Idaho. The first Seattle-Tacoma to Portland toll line was built in 1893. Assorted independent telephone companies set up competitive business throughout Oregon and Washington. With competition both the Bell and independent companies found it hard to do business and make money. Under the leadership of J. P. Morgan, the nation's most powerful banker, the Bell companies around the country began to buy out their major competitors. By 1924 The Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company had acquired most of the independents' property along the Pacific Coast. Headquartered in San Francisco, the Bell operating company served customers in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and northern Idaho. On July 1, 1961, AT&T; split off Pacific Telephone and Telegraph's operations in the Pacific Northwest as Pacific Northwest Bell. Its service territory included Oregon, Washington and northern Idaho (Southern Idaho was served by Mountain Bell). The new company's first major job was to build the world's most advanced telephone service to serve the Seattle World's Fair which was scheduled to open in less than ten months (April 21, 1962.) This was accomplished. ===AT&T; breakup=== A Pacific Northwest Bell logo used between 1984-1988 On January 1, 1984, as part of the breakup of AT&T;, Pacific Northwest Bell, Mountain Bell and Northwestern Bell became part of U S WEST. The company continued to use the logo it adopted in 1969 but also used a variation which included the tagline \\"A U S WEST Company\\". In 1988, all three of U S WEST's operating companies began doing business as U S WEST Communications. However, the three companies remained legally separate until January 1, 1991, when U S West merged its operating companies into Mountain Bell. On the same day, Mountain Bell changed its name to U S WEST Communications. The Pacific Northwest region went from having been a part of Pacific Bell before 1961 to becoming a part of Mountain Bell. The name is still a registered federal trademark and the domain pacificnorthwestbell.com is also active and points to the website CenturyLink.

At 10.30 a.m. the ship was attacked by the Japanese submarine I-37, under the command of Lieutenant- Commander Nakagawa Hajime. The submarine first fired two torpedoes. These were spotted, and the ship took evasive action, so that one torpedo passed astern, but the second hit the ship in the engine room, killing most of the crew there. The survivors abandoned ship, as I-37 surfaced and shelled and finally torpedoed the ship, sinking her in position . I-37 took the ship's captain, Walter Hill, as a prisoner. It then moved off and opened fire with machine guns on the lifeboats. For the next two hours it circled, firing indiscriminately at the lifeboats and men in the water before finally moving off. Fourteen men were killed and another five mortally wounded. The thirty- eight survivors were adrift for 37 days before finally being rescued by the British cargo liner MV Delane. Captain Hill was held as a prisoner at Penang until the end of the war.

According to the 2011 UK census, Harpham parish had a population of 303, a decline on the 2001 UK census figure of 318. Three Roman mosaics were found near Harpham in 1905, and three more were discovered in 1950. The first three are now in the Hull and East Riding Museum. They are simply patterned. One represented a rectangular maze, one of only five examples known in Roman mosaics in Britain.

The church is dedicated to him and was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The Well of St John, the local well, is named after him and is believed by many to have healing powers. The well is designated as a Grade II listed building. In 1823 Harpham was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Dickering. The St Quintin family were Lords of Harpham.

Soon afterwards, Bell took a position as an assistant counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF), crafting legal strategies at the forefront of the battle to undo racist laws and segregation in schools. At the LDF, he worked alongside other prominent civil-rights attorneys such as Thurgood Marshall, Robert L. Carter and Constance Baker Motley. Bell was assigned to Mississippi.

It just seems that unless > something's pushed, unless you litigate, nothing happens.\\" In 1967, Bell was appointed to the law faculty of the University of Southern California as executive director of the Western Center on Law and Poverty. ==Academic career== ===USC Law School=== Bell's first law faculty position, beginning in 1967, was at the USC Gould School of Law of the University of Southern California where he succeeded Martin Levine as executive director of the new Western Center on Law and Poverty. Among his notable cases was a class action suit against the Los Angeles Police Department on behalf of the city's black residents. During Bell's directorship, the Western Center's work was recognized in 1971 with a trophy bestowed by the Community Relations Conference of Southern California. ===Harvard Law School=== In the 1970s, with the help of protests from black Harvard Law School students for a minority faculty member, Bell was hired to teach there. At Harvard, Bell established a new course in civil rights law, published a celebrated case book, Race, Racism and American Law, and produced a steady stream of law review articles. ===Protests over faculty diversity=== In 1980, he started a five-year tenure as dean of the University of Oregon School of Law, interrupted by his resignation after the university refused to hire an Asian-American woman he had chosen to join the faculty. Returning to Harvard in 1986, after a year- long stint at Stanford University, Bell staged a five-day sit-in in his office to protest the school's failure to grant tenure to two professors on staff, both of whose work promoted critical race theory. The sit-in was widely supported by students, but divided the faculty, as Harvard administrators claimed the professors were denied tenure for substandard scholarship and teaching. In 1990, Harvard Law School had 60 tenured professors. Three of these were black men, and five of them were women, but there were no African- American women among them- a dearth Bell decided to protest with an unpaid leave of absence. Students supported the move which critics found \\"counterproductive,\\" while Harvard administrators cited a lack of qualified candidates, defending that they had taken great strides in the previous decade to bring women and black people onto the faculty. The story of his protest is detailed in his book Confronting Authority. Bell's protest at Harvard stirred angry criticism by opposing Harvard Law faculty who called him \\"a media manipulator who unfairly attacked the school,\\" noting that other people had accused him of \\"depriv[ing] students of an education while he makes money on the lecture circuit.\\" Bell took his leave of absence and accepted a visiting professorship at NYU Law, starting in 1991. After two years, Harvard had still not hired any minority women, and Bell requested an extension of his leave, which the school refused, thereby ending his tenure. Later in 1998, Harvard Law hired civil rights attorney and U.S. assistant attorney general nominee Lani Guinier, who became the law school's first black female tenured professor. In March 2012, five months after his death, Bell became the target of conservative media, including Breitbart and Sean Hannity, in an exposé of President Barack Obama. The controversy focused on a 1990 video of Obama praising Bell at a protest by Harvard Law School students over the perceived lack of diversity in the school's faculty. Bell's widow stated that Bell and Obama had \\"very little contact\\" after Obama's law school graduation. She said that as far as she remembered, \\"He never had contact with the president as president.\\" An examination of Senior Lecturer Obama's syllabus for his course on race and law at the University of Chicago revealed significant differences between Obama's perspective and that of Derrick Bell, even as Obama drew on major writings of critical race theory.Stacey Gahagan and Alfred L. Brophy, Reading Professor Obama: Race and the American Constitutional Tradition ===NYU School of Law=== Bell's visiting professorship at New York University began in 1991. After his two-year leave of absence, his position at Harvard ended and he remained at NYU where he continued to write and lecture on issues of race and civil rights. == Teaching == Less is written about Bell's teaching than his scholarship, but he was also a passionate and creative law teacher.Vinay Harpalani, Tribute to Professor Derrick Bell, http://professorderrickbell.com/tributes/vinay-harpalani/ He taught primarily classes in constitutional law at NYU Law. Bell rejected the conventional law school pedagogy of the Socratic method, preferring a more student-centered approach. Students argued hypothetical and real pending cases in his classes in mock appellate argument format, and they also wrote appellate briefs and wrote and discussed short op-ed papers on the cases. They were evaluated based on these writings, rather than on a final exam. Bell implemented this seminar- style format even in a large constitutional law class of 75 or more students. To do so, he hired one recent graduate to serve as the Derrick Bell Fellow and assist him. His courses also employed a number of student Teaching Assistants who had taken his course previously, to assist current students in preparing for their oral arguments. Additionally, Professor Bell took many other measures to \\"humanize the law school experience.\\" He would have food and drink for the students during the break in the middle of every class, and he would occasionally have students sing a class song, or have them sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to a fellow student or TA. The final class in constitutional law would be a talent show where students would perform skits, songs and poetry about various constitutional law topics.Vinay Harpalani, From Roach Powder to Radical Humanism: Professor Derrick Bell's \\"Critical\\" Constitutional Pedagogy, 36 SEATTLE UNIV. L. REV. xxiii (2013). Part of symposium, \\"In Memory of Professor Derrick Bell.\\"; available https://ssrn.com/abstract=2220270 Professor Bell was well known for his kindness to students. Media often missed the fact that even conservative white male students liked him personally, because he encouraged and invited them to challenge his views and gave them space to do so in his classes. Some even became his Teaching Assistants. Professor Bell once surprised his students in a Constitutional Law Seminar by speaking in favor of a conservative white Christian male's argument for school vouchers, going so far as to criticize the tenure system which he said made professors too eager to embrace and support the status quo. Professor Bell gave his pointed opinions on many issues in class, but he did not expect anyone to accept those views uncritically. This critical engagement, combined with his goal of \\"humanizing the law school experience\\" is best characterized as Professor Bell's \\"radical humanism.\\" Vinay Harpalani, Professor Derrick Bell: \\"Radical Humanist\\", 464 BLACK COMMENTATOR (March 22, 2012), http://www.blackcommentator.com/464/464_bell_harpalani_guest_share.html == Scholarship == Bell is arguably the most influential source of thought critical of traditional civil rights discourse. Bell's critique represented a challenge to the dominant liberal and conservative position on civil rights, race and the law. He employed three major arguments in his analyses of racial patterns in American law: constitutional contradiction, the interest convergence principle, and the price of racial remedies. His book Race, Racism and American Law, now in its sixth edition, has been continually in print since 1973 and is considered foundational in the field of Critical Race Theory. Following the Brown v. Board of Education decision, and its apparent lack of progress for black students, Bell grew interested in studying racial struggles within the education system. During the 70s, he studied and wrote about the effects of desegregation. He noted that desegregation did not undo the injustices set by segregation in the first place but, instead, created a whole new set of problems for black students attending predominantly white schools. The aftermath of Brown was a great disappointment as it produced detrimental repercussions for negroes who remained to be seen as inferior to white students. Bell concluded, therefore, that the focus for American educational systems should not be on national integration but, rather, should be on improving the quality of education provided for black students. His early work on education contributed to his creation of critical race theory. Bell and other legal scholars began using the phrase \\"critical race theory\\" (CRT) in the 1970s as a takeoff on \\"critical legal theory\\", a branch of legal scholarship that challenges the validity of concepts such as rationality, objective truth, and judicial neutrality. Critical legal theory was itself a takeoff on critical theory, a philosophical framework with roots in Marxist thought. Bell continued writing about critical race theory after accepting a teaching position at Harvard University. He worked alongside lawyers, activists, and legal scholars across the country. Much of his legal scholarship was influenced by his experience both as a black man and as a civil rights attorney. Writing in a narrative style, Bell contributed to the intellectual discussions on race. According to Bell, his purpose in writing was to examine the racial issues within the context of their economic and social and political dimensions from a legal standpoint. Bell's critical race theory was eventually branched into more theories describing the hardships of other races as well, such as AsianCrit (Asian), FemCrit (Women), LatCrit (Latino), TribalCrit (American Indian), and WhiteCrit (White). His theories were based on the following propositions: * First, racism is ordinary, not aberrational. * Second, white-over-color ascendancy serves important purposes, both psychic and material, for the dominant group. * Third, \\"social construction\\" thesis holds that race and races are products of social thought and relations. * Fourth, how a dominant society racializes different minority groups at different times, in response to shifting needs such as the labor market. * Fifth, intersectionality and anti-essentialism is the idea that each race has its own origins and ever-evolving history. * Sixth, voice-of-color thesis holds that because of different histories and experiences to white counterparts', matters that the whites are unlikely to know can be conveyed. CRT has also led to the study of microaggressions, Paradigmatic kinship, the historical origins and shifting paradigmatic vision of CRT, and how in depth legal studies show law serves the interests of the powerful groups in society. Microaggressions are subtle insults (verbal, nonverbal, and/or visual) directed toward people of color, often automatically or unconsciously. For instance, in The Constitutional Contradiction, Bell argued that the framers of the Constitution chose the rewards of property over justice. With regard to the interest convergence, he maintains that \\"whites will promote racial advances for blacks only when they also promote white self-interest.\\" Finally, in The Price of Racial Remedies, Bell argues that whites will not support civil rights policies that may threaten white social status. Similar themes can be found in another well-known piece entitled, \\"Who's Afraid of Critical Race Theory?\\" from 1995. His 2002 book, Ethical Ambition, encourages a life of ethical behavior, including \\"a good job well done, giving credit to others, standing up for what you believe in, voluntarily returning lost valuables, choosing what feels right over what might feel good right now\\". In addition to his writings, Bell was also a revered and accomplished teacher. His constitutional law courses took a critical but comprehensive student-centered approach, and he was well known for his kindness towards students.Vinay Harpalani, From Roach Powder to Radical Humanism: Professor Derrick Bell's \\"Critical\\" Constitutional Pedagogy, 36 SEATTLE U. L. REV. (forthcoming 2013). Available https://ssrn.com/abstract=2220270 ==Science fiction== Bell also wrote science fiction short stories, including \\"The Space Traders\\", a story in which white Americans trade black Americans to space aliens in order to pay off the national debt and receive advanced technology such as environmental decontaminants and alternatives to fossil fuels. His story demonstrated that whites act to protect their own white self-interest. Bell explained \\"[It's] better [to] risk the unknown in space than face the certainty of racial discrimination here at home.\\" The story was adapted for television in 1994 by director Reginald Hudlin and writer Trey Ellis. It aired on HBO as the leading segment of a three-part anthology entitled, Cosmic Slop, which focused on Black science fiction.Cosmic Slop (1994) entry on IMDB.com == Death == On October 5, 2011, Bell died from carcinoid cancer at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, at the age of 80. \\"'Stand Up, Speak Out,' Derrick Bell Told Law Students National Public Radio October 7, 2011.

His surname was altered from 'Ward' to 'Warde' for the stage. In the late 1870s he partnered with his friend actor Maurice Barrymore and the two agreed to tour plays around the United States particularly the play Diplomacy. Warde would have one section of the country while Barrymore and his company toured the other. For a time the venture was very successful. Warde had two notable film achievements, one being the \\"discovery\\" of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and persuading him to move from Denver to join Warde's New York City actors troupe. Fairbanks then made his Broadway debut in 1902. The second achievement was as the star of Richard III (1912), based on the play by William Shakespeare. This 55-minute film was re- discovered in 1996 by a private film collector who donated it to the American Film Institute archive. The film is thought to be the earliest surviving American feature film. In 1916 Warde filmed another Shakespearean tragedy, King Lear, for the Thanhouser company. This film also exists.King Lear silentera.com website In 1917 he appeared in a Pathe film Under False Colors with an up-and-coming beauty named Jeanne Eagels.PICTORIAL HISTORY OF THE SILENT FILM by Daniel Blum c. 1953 pgs. 98 & 136 Another of his films was A Lover's Oath (filmed in 1921 and premiered four years later), opposite Ramon Novarro, in which he portrayed Omar Khayyám. It is regarded as a lost film. Warde also recorded an early sound film Frederick Warde Reads Poem, A Sunset Reverie (1921) which was made using the short-lived sound-on-disc Phono-Kinema process. Though Warde lived until 1935 he saw no need to come out of retirement to appear in legitimate sound motion pictures. ==Filmography== *Richard III (1912) - Richard, Duke of Gloucester, afterward Richard III * Silas Marner (1916) - Silas Marner *King Lear (1916) - King Lear * The Vicar of Wakefield (1917) - Vicar of Wakefield *Hinton's Double (1917) - Joshua Stevens / John Evart Hinton * The Fires of Youth (1917) - Iron Hearted Pemberton *Under False Colors (1917) - John Colton *The Heart of Ezra Greer (1917) - Ezra Greer *Rich Man, Poor Man (1918) - John K.

It was formerly a minimum security boot camp (correctional) known as Camp Cassidy Lake for male and female probationers. The facility is a part of the Michigan Department of Corrections. As of May 1, 2009, SAI is no longer referred to as a \\"boot camp (correctional)\\". It is a full service Michigan Prisoner ReEntry Initiative (MPRI) In-Reach Correctional Facility. ==History== Under the administrative control of the Cooper Street Correctional Facility, the Special Alternative Incarceration program (SAI) began in 1988 as an alternative to prison for male probationers convicted of certain crimes and selected by courts. In 1992 the program was expanded to include both male and female prisoners and probationers. State law precludes participation if convicted of a number of primarily assaultive crimes. In January 2014, a Special Alternative Incarceration program was started at the Huron Valley Women's Facility where all female offenders are now housed. ==Program== Phase I of the program involves a highly disciplined regimen of 90 days, consisting of military-style exercise, meaningful work assignments and other programming, including secondary education and substance-abuse treatment. Phase II involves intensive supervision in the community, usually in a residential \\"halfway house\\" setting. Phase III of the program involves supervision of offenders similar to the way in which probationers are supervised. Phase I and III are mandatory, and Phase II is determined by assessing a particular offender's need for residential placement. The goal of the program is to keep selected lower-risk probationers from going to prison and to take qualified prisoners out of the traditional prison setting and place them into a more cost- effective management setting. The program has proven to be cost-effective and successful in keeping graduates out of prison. The military discipline portion of the program is designed to break down street-wise attitudes so staff can teach positive values and attitudes. Offenders take classes in job-seeking skills, substance-abuse awareness and anger management. They are also enrolled in General Educational Development preparation and Adult Basic Education. They perform a variety of tasks, including conservation work, recycling, parks maintenance and snow removal near senior housing. The SAI program includes an intensive post-release program and may include Phase II, which is placement for up to 120 days in a residential setting or on electronic monitoring. For prisoners, Phase III includes a parole for 18 months or for the balance of the minimum sentence, whichever is longer. The first four months of parole are under intensive supervision, which can include daily supervision, including nights and weekends, if needed. While in post release, offenders are expected to work or go to school at least 30 hours per week. They must submit to a drug test when requested and participate in any counseling, treatment programming or training, as directed by the agent. ==Staffing== Because of the rigorous nature of the SAI program and the extent to which the success of the program is dependent upon the performance of staff, it is imperative that staff, particularly custody staff, be carefully selected and appropriately trained and that their performance be carefully evaluated. To achieve these objectives, the SAI program has developed entry-level physical conditioning standards for new corrections officers and obtained the approval of the Michigan Corrections Officers Training Council (MCOTC) to implement them. All uniformed custody staff must complete a three-week SAI drill instructor training program. Instructional materials used in this training are published in instructional manuals in pocketbook format to facilitate staff reference. The performance evaluation process for SAI staff has also been formalized, with each staff member receiving a written performance review. ==See also== * List of Michigan state prisons ==References== Category:Chelsea, Michigan Category:Prisons in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Washtenaw County, Michigan Category:1988 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Special Alternative Incarceration Facility"},{"id":"2570986","text":"WGMS was a radio station in Washington, D.C. that maintained a classical music format from 1946 to 2007. Last owned by Bonneville International, it was known on air for many years as Classical 103.5. It last broadcast on 104.1 MHz from a transmitter in Waldorf, Maryland, with a repeater signal broadcast from Braddock Heights, Maryland, on 103.9 MHz under the call sign of WGYS. The WGMS call letters are today in use by public radio station WETA-FM's repeater in Hagerstown, Maryland, having been donated by Bonneville as part of an agreement between both stations made public the same day WGMS signed off. ==History== ===Early history=== The station went on air on December 29, 1946, under the call sign of WQQW at 570 kHz on the AM band. It added an FM signal, at 103.5 MHz, on September 18, 1948. It changed its call letters in 1951 to WGMS, which stood for \\"Washington's Good Music Station\\" (that slogan had been used on the station several years before). According to the station's website, WGMS \\"was the first FM signal in the marketplace and holds the record for the longest consecutive broadcast in the same format.\\" WGMS was at one time owned by RKO General Radio, which also owned top 40 stations in New York City (WXLO- FM), Boston (WRKO), Los Angeles (KHJ), Memphis (WHBQ), and Detroit (CKLW). In the 1970s, to comply with new FCC regulations limiting simulcasting, RKO prepared to change the format of WGMS-AM to top 40. A public outcry in support of the classical format forestalled the change, and the United States Congress authorized the stations to simulcast their programming full-time, as an exemption from Federal Communications Commission regulations mandating separate programming on AM and FM outlets owned by a single entity. In 1988, both WGMS AM & FM were sold off to Washington, D.C., venture capitalists Steven and Mitchell Rales and John VerStandig. The Rales Brothers later bought out VerStandig and converted WGMS AM into the first frequency for WTEM, a sports-talk station, on May 24, 1992. WTEM moved to 980 AM in 1998 as the result of a format swap between that station and business talk station WWRC, which itself now resides at 1260 AM. The 570 kHz frequency now belongs to Salem Communications, which uses it for news/talk station WWRC. During WGMS's tenure at 103.5 FM, its antenna and engineering facility were located on The American University Tower. ===2006 frequency change=== On January 4, 2006, Bonneville and the Washington Post announced that the frequencies then used by WTOP -- 1500 kHz and 107.7 MHz -- would be reassigned to a new station, WTWP, to be known on air as \\"Washington Post Radio.\\" WTOP would move to 103.5 MHz, the frequency then used by classical music station WGMS; in turn, WGMS would move to 104.1 and 103.9 MHz, displacing contemporary music station WWZZ (Z104). At noon that day, WGMS and WTOP shifted frequencies, and Z104 shut down. The change in frequency left WGMS with a weaker signal in the Washington area. At 103.5 MHz, it had broadcast at a strength of 44,000 watts; its new transmitter at 104.1 MHz broadcast at 20,000 watts from southern Prince George's County, well away from the center of the metropolitan area. Its repeater signal, at 103.9 MHz, had a strength of only 350 watts. (Coincidentally, the 103.9 signal in Braddock Heights, Maryland, had also once been a CHR station known as \\"Z104,\\" under the WZYQ calls.) ===Attempted sale=== On December 8, 2006, The Washington Post reported a preliminary agreement by Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to buy WGMS and convert it to a sports talk format, adding its frequency to the Triple X ESPN Radio network. Had the deal gone through, Washington, D.C., would have been left without a classical-music station as a result of the earlier 2005 switch of WETA to a public-radio news and talk format. Washington-based XM Satellite Radio attempted to capitalize on the development, purchasing advertisements in The Washington Post billing itself as the new home of classical music in the region. Snyder eventually withdrew from the purchase agreement, citing \\"a change in the radio climate\\" and hopes that \\"a better signal will soon become available in the market.\\" News accounts suggested that a comment to the Post from an unnamed Bonneville executive, who said Snyder had offered \\"50 percent more than [WGMS] was worth,\\" had stalled the negotiations. ===2007 format change=== The Snyder offer led Bonneville executives to rethink their commitment to classical music on WGMS, with sports talk or popular music being the most likely formats considered as its replacement. Public outcry among the area’s classical music listeners over this possibility led the board of public radio station WETA (FM) to vote to approve a return to classical programming should Bonneville decide to end classical on WGMS. (WETA had carried classical music and NPR programming until February 2005, when it switched exclusively to a news-and-talk format.) On January 22, 2007, at 3 p.m. EST, WGMS ceased operations. The final classical selection played on the station was the closing chorus, \\"With Tears of Grief,\\" from Bach's St. Matthew Passion. Longtime program director Jim Allison made the announcement of the station's ceasing, but also announced at the same time that Bonneville had reached a deal with WETA that returned the latter station to a classical format. WETA assumed the classical format just five hours later, at 8 p.m. EST. WETA hired Jim Allison as its new program director, and Bonneville donated its 15,000-disc WGMS music library to WETA. Bonneville also gave WETA the right to use the WGMS callsign; WETA adopted it for its repeater station in Hagerstown, Maryland, previously known as WETH. The two stations struck an unusual public/commercial cross-promotion agreement, under which WETA would promote Bonneville's news/talk stations WTOP-FM and WTWP, and Bonneville's stations would, in turn, promote classical programming on WETA. The on-air talent of WGMS was terminated, while WETA released several talk show hosts and longtime Saturday-night folk music host Mary Cliff. The Washington Post reported that some of the displaced hosts from each station might be hired by either WETA or Bonneville. On January 30, WETA reported that WGMS afternoon announcer John Chester was hired for the 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. shift. The programming changes meant that WETA converted to a format consisting of classical music 24 hours per day and seven days per week, dropping all long-form NPR and BBC programming such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and A Prairie Home Companion in the process. (Most of the cancelled programming already aired on, or moved to, WAMU.) Hourly NPR newscasts remain during the daytime, as well as a simulcast of WETA-TV-produced The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer in the 7 p.m. hour, broadcast on radio for the benefit of commuters unable to arrive home in time to view the television airing. Bonneville switched the 104.1 MHz frequency to an \\"adult hits\\" format under the callsign WXGG, known on air as George 104.1 (now WPRS-FM, a gospel format). ==Digital radio programing== In addition to its regular FM signal, WGMS used digital subchannels of 104.1 and 103.9 to carry \\"Viva La Voce,\\" an all-vocal classical music station, as well as a high-definition version of WGMS. WGMS also broadcast \\"long-form\\" classical music on a digital subchannel of its former frequency, 103.5-FM. According to the site of the Viva La Voce digital subchannel of WGMS, Viva La Voce has ceased operations. Viva La Voce is now carried full-time on WETA-FM HD-2. == External links == * The old WGMS website from archive.org * The end of WGMS classical programming (audio) * * Category:Classical music radio stations in the United States Category:Peabody Award winners Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:RKO General GMS Category:Radio stations established in 1946 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2007 Category:1946 establishments in Washington, D.C.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1899 to 1914, as a member of the Conservative Party. Argue was born in Ireland, and received a grammar school education. He worked as a farmer after moving in Manitoba, and served for fifteen years as a local reeve and councillor. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1899 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Thomas Dickey by seventy-seven votes in the Avondale constituency. The Conservatives won this election, and Argue served in the legislature as a government backbencher. He was re-elected in the campaigns of 1903, 1907 and 1910, and did not seek re-election in 1914. He later moved to Vancouver, where he died in 1927. His son, James O.

Neville Robinson was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge, England, and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read Physics. Robinson initially worked as a civil servant at the Services Electronic Research Laboratory (SERL) in Baldock, Hertfordshire, under the director Robert Sutton. He then moved to the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University to undertake a DPhil doctorate degree in low temperature physics, as a Nuffield Research Fellow (1950–54). With Jim Daniels and Michael Grace, he produced an example of nuclear orientation for the first time. Then in 1951, in the first nuclear cooling experiment, he produced the lowest temperature ever achieved until then at only ten millionths of a degree Kelvin above absolute zero. Robinson was an English Electric Research Fellow from 1955–59. He was a Faculty Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford from 1958 to 1961, immediately followed by becoming a founding Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford where he stayed until his retirement in 1992. He was also a Senior Research Officer at Oxford University during 1959 to 1992, working at the Clarendon Laboratory. During his career, he visited Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, United States, three times while on sabbatical leave (during 1954–55, 1965–66, and 1973–74). In 1973, Robinson published the book Macroscopic Electromagnetism, a standard text. His paper Microwave shot noise and minimum noise factor was awarded the Clerk Maxwell Prize in 1954 by the British Institution of Radio Engineers. Importantly, he invented the Robinson oscillator in the field of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which now forms the underlying basis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems used in many hospitals. ==Family== Robinson married Daphne Coulthard in 1952. They had one son, the author Andrew Robinson and two daughters.

The original brick, Federal-style house was constructed c. 1825 by the Dresser family, who sold it to William and Elizabeth Doane of New York City as a summer home in 1875. They doubled its size by adding a shingle-style ell, and also remodeled its interior. It was donated to the public by the Doanes' daughter, Vipont Merwin, who was born in the house in 1878 and died there in 1965. The property was acquired by Historic New England in 1966, whereupon it became a museum. The house currently reflects furnishings and a lifestyle of the late 19th century, with period antiques and items collected during world travel. ==See also== * Historic New England * List of historic houses in Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1825 Category:Federal architecture in Massachusetts Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Museums in Stockbridge, Massachusetts Category:Houses in Berkshire County, Massachusetts Category:Historic New England ","title":"Merwin House (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)"},{"id":"2571003","text":"San Benedetto in Perillis is a town and comune in the province of L'Aquila, Abruzzo, central Italy.

It was the primary water supply for Athens from 1931, when it became operational, until 1959. In 1959 water from Lake Yliki became available, and water from Mornos Reservoir became available in 1981. The area of the lake at the height of the spillway of the dam is 2.45 square kilometres, the maximum depth is 54 m, the lake concentrates water from a drainage basin of 118 square kilometres with an average runoff of 14,400,000 m³ per year in an average rainfall of 580 mm per year, the average inbound volume is 12,000,000 m³ per year and the maximum reservoir capacity is 41,000,000 m³ (effective volume 34,000,000 m³). The dam has a maximum height (from foundation to crest) of 54 m, a maximum width of 28 m at the base and 4.5 m at the crest. Its length is 285 m. The crest is 227 m above sea level, the toe is 173 m above sea level, and the spillway is 223 m above sea level. The spillway disgorges 520 m³/s. The dam is constructed from concrete and is a gravity dam. It is unique worldwide because its external cladding of white pentelikon marble is the same marble used in construction of the Parthenon and the other buildings in the Acropolis. The dam was constructed by the American firm ULEN (which had, in a BOT type contract, the ownership of the water supply company of Athens until 1974). It was constructed to meet the increased water demand caused by the rapid population increase in the Athens area following the huge influx of refugees from Asia Minor during and after the end of Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). The construction lasted from 1926 to 1929.

Mackintosh served as mayor of Ottawa from 1879–1881, represented Ottawa City as a Liberal-Conservative in the House of Commons of Canada from 1882 to 1887, and from 1890 to 1893, and served as Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories from 1893 to 1898.Dave Mullington \\"Chain of Office: Biographic Sketches of Ottawa's Mayors (1847-1948)\\" (Renfrew, Ontario: General Store Publishing House, 2005) ==Parentage and aristocratic connexions== He was born in London, Canada West on May 13, 1843,Perry, Powell 2006, pg. 295 the son of Captain William Mackintosh, of Wicklow, Ireland, an Irish-born officer posted to Canada with the British Army's Ordnance Department, who later served as County Engineer for Middlesex County, Ontario. Mackintosh's paternal grandfather was Captain Duncan Mackintosh, a Scotsman who had been sent to Ireland with the British Army's Highland regiment during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. After the Rebellion, he bought an estate in County Wicklow, and in 1802, married, at Dublin, Alicia Weldon, who is variously described as being the daughter of Lady Weldon, and a niece of the Earl of Dysart, though which ones are meant is not specified. C.H. Mackintosh's mother was Leonora Sophia (d. 1891), daughter of Col. Dickinson, of Jamaica, British West Indies. Through the maternal line, Mackintosh claimed to be close kin to Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore, one of whose sisters was called Leonora, and one of whose half- aunts, Elizabeth Raffles, married William Carter, Esq., of Jamaica. Paternally, he claimed to be a near relation of the essayist and politician, the Right Honourable Sir James Mackintosh, who was member of the Kellachie branch of the Inverness-shire-based Clan Mackintosh, part of the Scottish Highlands Chattan Confederation. In addition to C.H. Mackintosh's grand, if vague, ties to the ruling class, there is occasional confusion with another Mackintosh author, Charles Henry Mackintosh (1820–1896), a prolific Plymouth Brethren author and evangelist, who was known principally by the initials, C. H. M., which happen to coincide with those of the present subject. Details in this second man's biography indicate that the elder and younger C. H. Mackintoshes were possibly uncle and nephew, or, at least, related (see References). At any rate, in nineteenth century colonial Canada, these exalted family connexions in Britain and the empire may have played a rôle in fostering Mackintosh's ambitions, and aiding him in his later advancement. Coupled with his innate talents, they may also have served to mark him in Conservative party political circles where, in 1893, Canada's Prime Minister Sir John Thompson clearly viewed him as the more suitable vice-regal candidate over rival fellow Tory, Nicholas Flood Davin, whose own chagrin at Mackintosh's appointment is well documented. ==Education, journalism, and public career== ===Training and journalism=== Educated at Galt Grammar School and Caradoc Academy, he first began the study of law but instead, in 1862, entered the trade of journalism. He first served as city editor of the London Free Press, later acting as city editor of the Hamilton Times. He edited the Parkhill Gazette, and served as managing editor of the Chicago Journal of Commerce. During his time in Strathroy, Ontario, he was editor and proprietor of the Strathroy Dispatch. In 1873, he was also elected to the town council of Strathroy, Ontario, at a time when this was apparently not prohibited as a conflict of interest in an era of openly partisan journalism. In 1874, he acquired the Ottawa Daily Citizen, serving as its owner and editor-in-chief from 1874 to 1892. He was owner and editor of the Canadian Parliamentary Companion from 1877 to 1882. On 6 August 1875, he won the gold and silver medals offered by the St. Patrick's Society during the O'Connell centenary at Major's Hill Park in Ottawa for a prize poem entitled, The Irish Liberator.[Canadian Illustrated News 28 08 1875 vol.XII, no. 9, 136 Library & Archives Canada 3682 Canadian Illustrated News\\" He was also president of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, Ottawa, in 1879. ===Public life=== He served as chairman for the Dominion Exhibition in 1879, and as president of the Agricultural Association in 1881. After only one year, 1873, on the Strathroy town council, he served as 13th Mayor of Ottawa from 1879 to 1881. Elected as a Conservative, he was returned as a Member of Parliament for the riding of Ottawa City in the House of Commons of Canada from 1882 to 1887 and again from 1890 to 1893. He was unsuccessful in contesting the constituency of Russell, Ontario in the 1887 Dominion election. He was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories in 1893, serving in that capacity until his resignation in 1898. During his tenure of the territorial viceregal office, he promoted a great Territorial Exhibition which was opened by His Excellency the Earl of Aberdeen, Governor General of the Dominion of Canada at Regina, district of Assiniboia, N.W.T., on 30 July 1895. For these services he was presented with an oil portrait of himself in August 1895. Following his vice- regency, he contested unsuccessfully the provincial seat of Rossland, British Columbia in 1900, and the riding of Kootenay, British Columbia in the Dominion general elections of 1900 and 1904, all in the Conservative or Liberal- Conservative interest. ===Later career=== In 1898, he became Canadian manager of the British American Mining Company, Rossland, British Columbia, later becoming a broker and financial agent in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1898, he sold the Le Roi mining property. In 1901, on behalf of the miners of British Columbia, he presented two unusual gold nuggets to King Edward VII and, his wife, Queen Alexandra. ==Character== The Montreal Gazette described him as \\"a tactful, capable and experienced public man\\", while the Toronto Telegram declared him to be \\"warm hearted, amiable and altogether likeable\\". ==Interests and affiliations== He was a life director of the Carleton County Protestant Home for the Aged in Ottawa, Ontario. In politics, he was a Liberal-Conservative, being noted as \\"an imperialist of no uncertain sound\\", and served as vice-president of the British Empire League in Canada. In religion, he was an Anglican. He was a member of two gentleman's clubs, the Union Club, Victoria, British Columbia, and of the Vancouver Club, Vancouver, British Columbia. ==Publications== He was author of the Liberal-Conservative Handbook (1876), and wrote a prize essay entitled Potential Resources of British Columbia (1908). For the Canadian Magazine, he wrote various articles including one entitled, British America's Golden Gateway to the Orient. ==Family and death== Gertrude Mackintosh by William James Topley in a costume she wore in February 1896 at a Fancy Dress Ball given at Ottawa by the Earl and Countess of Aberdeen Mackintosh married in April 1868, Gertrude Niles Cook (d. 1925), daughter of Timothy Cook, J.P., of Strathroy, Ontario, and his wife, Harriet Terry, the daughter of Dr William Terry, ex-M.P.P., Niagara, Ontario, and granddaughter of Parshall Terry, M.H.A., a United Empire Loyalist, and member of the 1st Parliament of Upper Canada. Mrs Mackintosh was born at Strathroy, Ontario, and educated at a convent at London, Ontario. While wife of the mayor of Ottawa, in 1879, she assisted at the opening of the first Dominion Exhibition. Later, she assisted at the opening of the great North-West Exhibition, held in Regina in 1895. She served as vice-president in the Territories for the National Council of Women. The couple had two sons and seven daughters. The eldest daughter, Gertrude, married Sandford Hall Fleming, eldest son of Sir Sandford Fleming, the inventor of Standard Time, while another daughter, Marion, divorced wife of Alfred Louis Castellain, became, secretly, in 1906, the wife of Sir Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, the man her father had appointed as first premier of the Northwest Territories in 1897. Of the sons: the elder, Edward Compton Mackintosh, died of a fever, on 28 January 1901, at Pretoria, while he was serving as a private in the Canadian contingent with Lord Strathcona's Horse fighting in the Second Boer War. The younger, Charles St Lawrence Mackintosh, who had served as his father's personal secretary and aide-de-camp when he was N.W.T. lieutenant governor, first married Eileen White of Quebec City, granddaughter of Sir Hugh Allan, in 1899. They had a son, Charles Allan Mackintosh, born in 1901. Divorced in 1906, he remarried, in 1908, to Kate Totten Putnam (d.1919), and was married for the last time, in 1927, to Lillie Tupper Cameron, whose mother was the eldest child of Canadian Conservative Prime Minister Sir Charles Tupper, 1st Baronet. The Hon. C. H. Mackintosh died in 1931 and was buried in Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa, Ontario, alongside his wife who had predeceased him in 1925. == Archives == There is a Charles Herbert Mackintosh fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

Although the original intention was to promote physique contests in the United Kingdom, the popularity of the Mr Universe contest, and later Ms Universe contest, drew interest from competitors around the world. Today NABBA International maintains affiliations with around 60 countries. ==History== The history of NABBA as an organisation can be traced back to 1898 when an American entrepreneur, Bernarr Macfadden, and an English cycling enthusiast, Hopton Hadley, teamed up to promote what would become the earliest physical culture magazine. The original title of the magazine is debatable, however in 1898 Macfadden sold his share to Hadley and it quickly became known as Health & Strength magazine. Health & Strength Magazine served as the official magazine of NABBA for many years before being sold. The current Health & Strength publication utilises the name but bears little resemblance to the original magazine. In 1906 the Health & Strength League was formed to promote physical culture and within a few years it boasted thousands of members across the United Kingdom. By the 1920s the Health & Strength League had begun organising physique contests, which were a precursor to modern bodybuilding contests. In 1930 the Health & Strength League hosted the Mr. Britain contest with William T Coggins as the inaugural winner. Since the mid-1950s the Mr. Britain contest has been promoted by the NABBA UK. In 1948 following the first Mr. Universe contest, won by John Grimek, the Health & Strength League made plans for form a separate governing association dedicated to bodybuilding. In late 1949 these plans would come to fruition and when the Mr. Universe contest was next held in 1950 it would be the NABBA Mr. Universe contest. In 1955 Oscar Heidenstam, a former Mr. Britain winner and Mr. Universe competitor and a long-standing member of the Health & Strength League, became the General Secretary of NABBA and continued in this position for many years. As competitors from outside of the UK wanted to compete in the Mr. Universe contest, other countries affiliated and over time NABBA International was formed as the world governing organisation. The World Amateur Bodybuilding Association was directly affiliated with NABBA between 1977 and 1983, part of the reason for the formation of NABBA International as an independent body in 1984. Oscar Heidenstam was elected Chairman of NABBA UK in 1980 and subsequently became President of NABBA International upon its formation. Following Heidenstam's death in 1991, NABBA International was separated into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere jurisdictions however it was soon reunited as a single world body with Ivan Dunbar of NABBA Northern Ireland as the International World President. When Dunbar died in 2009, Graeme Lancefield, President of NABBA Australia, was elected as the NABBA International World President until 2017. In 2017, Eddy Ellwood was elected President of NABBA International with former Chair and Honorary Life Councillor, Bryan Robinson, as the Vice President of NABBA International. The NABBA UK Council continues to govern bodybuilding within the UK and also promotes the Universe Championships each year in England. Jim Charles was elected Chair of the NABBA UK Council in 2014 and remains in this position as of 2019. Dozens of countries are affiliated to NABBA International including Australia, Austria, Brazil, the Republic of Ireland, USA, Germany, Italy, Ukraine, Korea, China, Israel, New Zealand, Iran, Lebanon, Greece, Cyprus and Canada. The name NABBA by itself however usually refers to the NABBA UK. ==Competitions== Each country affiliated with NABBA International holds an annual National Championships, usually prior to the World Championships or Universe Championships. In most cases these events are a qualifier for athletes seeking to travel internationally to compete.

James Baird (1802 in Old Monkland, Lanarkshire – 1876 in Cambusdoon) was a Scottish industrialist. He was the founder of the Baird Trust. ==Life== He was born in the run-down farm of Kirkwood, near Old Monklands. He was the fourth of the eight sons (and two daughters) of Alexander Baird and Jean Moffat. After a farming beginning, he was inspired by the industrial revolution to begin to sink mine-shafts on the farm to dig for coal. At this stage, the company of William Baird & Co was formed. The family later set up the huge ironworks, Bairds of Gartsherrie. James focussed upon the iron processing industry. Despite claims that it might damage the furnaces, from 1837 all furnaces were turned off on Sundays. This meant not only that it was a day of rest, but the whole atmosphere literally changed in the towns and villages. By 1864, he had grown his blast furnaces to nearly fifty, producing 300,000 tons of iron annually, and employing 10,000 people. Throughout his life, he acquired land in Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Fife, all for mining purposes. As the first Scot to introduce the chain-driven coal-cutters his companies had major advantages over his rivals who still dug by hand. Much of his money was returned to the community in terms of school- building and church-building. From 1851 to 1857, he was an elected Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for the Falkirk Burghs. His brother William had had this seat just four years before. In 1857 he purchased the Knoydart estate as a quiet country retreat. Baird was, while anti-union, very interested to give his workers education. He also donated £500,000 to support churches. He died at his Ayrshire estate of Cambusdoon (formerly known as Greenfield), which he had acquired in 1852. ==Baird Trust== Baird founded the Baird Trust, a charitable organization aimed at helping to fund church projects and spreading the word of the gospel.

His family immigrated to Israel a year after his birth, settling in Netivot. Mazuz served his compulsory military service in the IDF Armor Corps, and then studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning his law degree in 1980 specializing in public and administrative law. During his studies, he interned for one year in the Supreme Court with judges Shlomo Asher and Hadassa Ben-Itto and for a year in the State Attorney's Office High Court of Justice Department with attorneys Michal Shaked and Shlomo Tzur. After graduating and receiving his law license in 1981, he immediately joined the State Attorney's Office as a lawyer, working in the Criminal, Civil, and High Court of Justice Departments until 1994. During this time he was also teaching public and administrative law at the Hebrew University. From 1991 to 1995, he served as a legal adviser of the Ministry of Justice for Israel's negotiations with Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. He was appointed Deputy Attorney General in 1994, serving for ten years. In January 2004, Mazuz was appointed Attorney General. At the time of the appointment, he was seen as a career civil servant with little political or criminal-law experience. However, the circumstances of his appointment drew considerable interest because Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his sons were under investigation by the Attorney General's Office for campaign-finance irregularities relating to his 1999 campaign for leadership of the Likud party. When Mazuz's predecessor Elyakim Rubinstein resigned to accept appointment to the Supreme Court, Mazuz was chosen by Justice Minister Yosef Lapid; his selection and confirmation were carried out without the involvement of Sharon or vice-premier Ehud Olmert (also a target of the campaign-finance investigation) who both abstained in order to avoid a conflict of interest. Upon taking office, Mazuz said he would vigorously pursue the case against Sharon, earning him contrasts in the media with Rubinstein, who had been accused of moving too slowly on the matter. In the summer of 2005, he secured the indictment of Ariel Sharon's son Omri on corruption charges, but decided not to charge Ariel Sharon himself and his other son, Gilad. Mazuz adopted a hardline legal approach towards demonstrators opposing the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. While stating that measures will be taken against violent demonstrators, and that detained protestors would not be given a collective pardon, he also forbade a demonstration in the town of Sderot. After the successful and relatively peaceful completion of the disengagement, Mazuz said that it was freedom of demonstration which prevented the operation from escalating into a violent one. Mazuz faced harsh criticism following his decision, given in January 2005, according to which Israeli Arabs are allowed to buy lands owned by the Jewish National Fund. Some have accused Mazuz of incompliance with Israel's image as a Jewish state. Mazuz has come under criticism from settler groups for allowing Israeli police to employ violence against demonstrators in the evacuation of the settlement of Amona. On November 10, 2014, Mazuz was sworn in as a justice on Israel's Supreme Court. A resident of Jerusalem, he is married with two children. ==References== * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli people of Tunisian-Jewish descent Category:Israeli jurists Category:Israeli civil servants Category:Attorneys General of Israel Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:People from Djerba Category:Tunisian emigrants to Israel Category:Judges of the Supreme Court of Israel Category:People from Southern District (Israel) ","title":"Menachem Mazuz"},{"id":"2571078","text":"José F.F.

He portrayed Michael Connelly, a young man with cerebral palsy, in Inside I'm Dancing, and played Dominic Rook in the popular BBC Three comedy-drama series Being Human. He has had roles in numerous television programs including Luther and The Bletchley Circle. ==Personal life== Robertson grew up in the small village of Vidlin in the Shetland Islands of Scotland, with his two sisters. In his childhood, Robertson battled and overcame severe dyslexia. Before pursuing an acting career, he worked as an odd-job man in his village. Growing up, he was close to the Shetland poet Rhoda Bulter. He stated that she was the trigger for him pursuing a career in performing by telling him old Shetland tales. Roberston attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Whilst there he met his wife, actress Charlotte Allam. He is also a member of Aya Theatre and has starred in their adaptation of George Orwell's Burmese Days as Flory. He currently lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and daughter. ==Career== Robertson's first major film role came in 2004 when he starred alongside fellow Scottish actor James McAvoy in Inside I'm Dancing. He then went on to play a small part in the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven as an Angelic Priest. Following this, he had a big role in the 2005 French war film Joyeux Noel in which he played Jonathan, a young man whose brother was shot dead during WW1. Robertson then went on to play characters in numerous TV dramas, including Luther, where he played both of the Millberry twins, a murderous duo who decided their victim's fate on the roll of a die. Robertson then played Dominic Rook, a government leader whose department protects the world from supernaturals in series 5 of the British supernatural drama Being Human. He later worked on series 2 of Utopia, a British conspiracy thriller for Channel 4 where he played the role of Terrence. ===Shetland=== Robertson returned to his home in Shetland to film the TV series of the same name, where he starred as Constable Sandy Wilson in the BBC One adaptation of the popular Ann Cleeves book series. The show was criticised for its lack of Shetland accents, with Robertson being the only main cast member born and brought up on the islands. However, the series attracted over 6 million viewers and a second series was commissioned featuring, alongside Douglas Henshall and Robertson, actors Brian Cox, Julie Graham and Alex Norton, with Robertson's character now as a detective. Robertson stated to Digital Spy that his portrayal of Constable Wilson was a \\"nice break from playing killers and creeps\\". A third series, telling a single story, aired in 2016. Robertson returned as Detective Wilson for the fourth series which was broadcast in early 2018, and then in the fifth series which was broadcast in early 2019. ==Filmography== ===Film=== *Inside I'm Dancing (2004) (also released under the title Rory O'Shea Was Here) as Michael Connolly *Kingdom of Heaven (2005) as the Angelic Priest *Joyeux Noël (2005) as Jonathan *True North (2006) as The Cook * Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) as Francis Throckmorton *Neds (2010) as Mr Bonetti *5 Days of War (2011) as Davit Kezerashvili *The Somnambulists (2012) as Man 12 *T2 Trainspotting (2017) as Francis Begbie's lawyer *Tell It To the Bees (2018) as Jim ===TV=== * E=mc² (2005) as Michael Faraday * He Kills Coppers (2008) as Tony Meehan * Tess of the d'Urbervilles (2008) as Cuthbert Clare * Shameless (2009) as Padraig Maguire, deceased father of Paddy Maguire seen in a nightmare * Red Riding (2009) as Sergeant Bob Fraser * \\"Hustle\\" (2009) * Ashes to Ashes (2010) as Paul Thordy * Luther (2011) as Robert/Nicholas Millberry * Parade's End as Colonel Bill Williams, CO (2012) * Being Human (2012-Guest, 2013-Regular) as Dominic Rook * The Bletchley Circle (2012) as Malcolm Crowley * Shetland (2013–present) as Police Constable Sandy Wilson * New Tricks (2013) as Tim Belgrade * Utopia (2014) as Terrence * In the Flesh (2014) as John Weston * Doctor Who (2015) as Richard Pritchard * Harlots (2017) as Robert Oswald * Vera (2018) as Tom ===Stage=== *King Lear (2002) as Kent (Royal Shakespeare Company Academy) *The Seagull (2003) as Konstantin Gavrilovich Treplyov (Royal Exchange, Manchester) *Antony and Cleopatra as Octavian (Royal Exchange, Manchester) *The Tempest (2007) as Ariel (Royal Exchange, Manchester) *Ghosts (2009) as Oswald Alving (Citizens Theatre) ==References== ==External links== * *Shetlopedia.com – Steven Robertson page Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Shetland Category:People educated at Anderson High School, Lerwick Category:Scottish male film actors Category:Scottish male stage actors Category:Scottish male television actors Category:Alumni of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama Category:British male film actors Category:21st-century Scottish male actors ","title":"Steven Robertson"},{"id":"2571084","text":"Gnaeus Egnatius (fl. second century BC) was a Roman senator who gave his name to the Via Egnatia. ==Biography== Gnaeus Egnatius, the son of Gaius Egnatius, was a plebeian and a member of the tribe Stellatina.

He fronted shows such as MasterChef, MasterChef USA, Hell's Kitchen, and his own series, Rhodes Around Britain. As well as owning several restaurants, Rhodes also had his own line of cookware and bread mixes. Rhodes went on to feature in the ITV1 programme Saturday Cooks, as well as the UKTV Food show Local Food Hero. ==Early years== Rhodes was born in Camberwell, South London in 1960, to Gordon and Jean (née Ferris) Rhodes. He moved with his family to Gillingham, Kent, where he went to The Howard School in Rainham. He then attended catering college in Thanet where he met his wife Jennie. ==Career== His first job was at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel. He was hit by a transit van in Amsterdam leaving him with serious injuries. He then toured Europe in various jobs before becoming sous chef at the Reform Club, Pall Mall and then on to the Michelin-starred Capital Hotel in Knightsbridge where he worked under Brian Turner. Rhodes became the head chef at the Castle Hotel, Taunton in Somerset. He retained the hotel's Michelin star at the age of 26. In 1990, Rhodes returned to London with his family to become head chef at The Greenhouse restaurant in Mayfair. The menu became known for reviving British classics, including faggots, fishcakes, braised oxtails and bread and butter pudding. He was awarded a Michelin star for The Greenhouse in January 1996. In 1997 he opened his first restaurant, City Rhodes, and in 1998 Rhodes in the Square, both in London with global contract catering company Sodexo. This partnership expanded into the brasseries Rhodes & Co in Manchester, Edinburgh and Crawley. In 2003, following the closure of restaurants City Rhodes and Rhodes in the Square, he opened Rhodes Twenty Four in one of London's tallest buildings, Tower 42. Rhodes described his hopes for the restaurant on its launch: \\"If we never get a Michelin star here, I will be very disappointed, but what I really want is customers.\\" It won a Michelin star in 2005, which it retained as one of Rhodes' two Michelin-starred restaurants in London until its closure in 2014. Rhodes also owned Arcadian Rhodes on the P&O; superliner MS Arcadia, Rhodes W1 at The Cumberland Hotel in London, and Rhodes Calabash at The Calabash Hotel in Grenada. He was also a contributor to the BBC Good Food magazine. His first TV appearance was at the age of 27, courtesy of TV chef Glynn Christian on Hot Chefs. This led to the BBC series Rhodes Around Britain in 1994 and Gary's Rhodes' Perfect Christmas in 1998. In 1999, Rhodes presented a BBC TV series Gary Rhodes' New British Classics, reintroducing classic British cuisine, and published a book of the same name. For two seasons, in 2000 and 2001, Rhodes hosted the original MasterChef USA on PBS. Rhodes starred in the television series Rhodes Across India, with apprentices Bushra Akram, Scott Davis and Kalwant Sahota, and, in 2008, Rhodes Across China, which explored Chinese cuisine, with sous chefs Melissa Syers and Teresa Tsang. Rhodes appeared in a commercial tie-in with Tate & Lyle in the late 1990s, and his recipes endorsed sugar and treacle products accordingly; his name was printed on every Tate & Lyle sugar sachet across the country. Rhodes was associated with a Cooking in Schools campaign with Flora UK and appeared in television adverts for Flora margarine, some of which featured him \\"driving a van topped with a giant styrofoam crumpet\\" which were banned. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 17 June 2006. In the same year he competed, representing the South of England, in the BBC's Great British Menu, but lost to Atul Kochhar. Rhodes appeared on the BBC Two spoof game show Shooting Stars, during which hosts Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer asked him to \\"represent fire through the medium of dance\\". He also competed, with professional partner Karen Hardy, in the sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing which began on 20 September 2008, and finished in 14th place. In 2011, Rhodes moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He headed Rhodes Mezzanine, later Rhodes W1 Dubai, at the Grosvenor House Hotel, and another restaurant Rhodes Twenty10 at Le Royal Méridien Beach Resort & Spa. In 2013 he opened his first restaurant in Abu Dhabi, Rhodes 44 at The St. Regis Hotel. Rhodes was a supporter of Manchester United FC. ==Death== Rhodes died in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on 26 November 2019; he was aged 59. Rock Oyster Media and Goldfinch TV said in a statement to the PA news agency that Rhodes was taken ill very suddenly at home, during a break in filming a new television series, and died a short time afterwards. It was later confirmed by Rhodes' family that his death was a result of a subdural haematoma, normally associated with a brain injury. Many fellow celebrity chefs paid tribute, including Marcus Wareing, Aldo Zilli, Ainsley Harriott, Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver, the latter saying he was \\"a massive inspiration to me as a young chef\\", adding that he \\"reimagined modern British cuisine with elegance and fun\\". Tom Kerridge described Rhodes as \\"one of the greatest British chefs who almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\\". ==Restaurants== *Rhodes W1 (formerly Rhodes Mezzanine) – Grosvenor House Hotel, Dubai. *Rhodes Calabash – The Calabash Hotel, Grenada. *Rhodes Twenty10 – Le Royal Méridien Beach Resort & Spa, Dubai. *Rhodes Twenty Four ( Michelin star) – Tower 42, London (closed in 2014). *Rhodes 44 – The St. Regis Hotel, Abu Dhabi (closed in 2014). *Rhodes W1 ( Michelin star) – The Cumberland Hotel, London (closed in 2012). *Rhodes W1 Brasserie – The Cumberland Hotel, London (closed in 2012). *Arcadian Rhodes – aboard the P&O; liner MS Arcadia (replaced in 2011). *Oriana Rhodes – aboard the P&O; liner MS Oriana (replaced in 2011). *Rhodes South – Christchurch Harbour Hotel, Christchurch (closed in 2010). *Kings Rhodes – Kings Arms Hotel, Christchurch (closed in 2009). *Rhodes D7 – Dublin (closed in 2009). *Rhodes in the Square ( Michelin star) – London (closed in 2003). *City Rhodes ( Michelin star) – London (closed in 2003). *Rhodes & Co – Golden Tulip Hotel, Manchester (closed in 2003). *Rhodes & Co – Jenners Department Store, Edinburgh (closed in 2002). *Rhodes & Co – Arora Hotel Gatwick, Crawley (closed in 2002 or 2003). *Rhodes @ the Dome – Plymouth Hoe, Plymouth (involvement ended in 2016). ==References== ==External links== * Official website. * Gary Rhodes at the British Film Institute. * .

Having joined King Charles I at Nottingham in 1642, he fought at the Battle of Edgehill, at the Battle of Newbury and elsewhere during the English Civil War; in 1644, just after the Battle of Marston Moor, the Scots Parliament declared he had forfeited his earldom, and, following the lines laid down when this was regranted in 1642, it was given to John Lindsay, 1st Earl of Lindsay. Ludovic was taken prisoner at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1644, following the seven month Siege of Newcastle, and was condemned to death, but the sentence was not carried out, and in 1645 he was released by Montrose, under whom he served until the surrender of the King at Newark-on-Trent. Later he was in Ireland and in Spain and he died, probably in France, in 1652.

The Sisters of Loretto credited St. Joseph with its construction. It has been the subject of legend, and the circumstances surrounding its construction and its builder were considered miraculous by the Sisters of Loretto.History of the Loretto Chapel ==History== The chapel was commissioned by the Sisters of Loretto for their girls' school, Loretto Academy, in 1873. Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy had brought in two French architects, Antoine Mouly and his son Projectus, to work on the St. Francis Cathedral project, and suggested that the Sisters could make use of their services on the side to build a much-needed chapel for the academy. Projectus ended up being the main architect for the project, basing his Gothic Revival design—complete with spires, buttresses, and stained glass windows imported from France via the Santa Fe Trail—on the famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. The chapel was built from locally quarried sandstone and took five years to complete, being officially consecrated in 1878. Loretto Chapel was used on a daily basis by the students and nuns of Loretto Academy until the school closed in 1968. Afterwards, it became a privately owned museum and wedding venue, while the rest of the Academy campus was demolished. ==Staircase== ===Description=== Loretto Chapel is best known for its \\"miraculous\\" spiral staircase, which rises to the choir loft while making two full turns, all without the support of a newel or central pole. The staircase is built mostly out of wood and is held together by wooden pegs and glue rather than nails or other hardware. The inner stringer consists of seven wooden segments joined together with glue, while the longer outer stringer has nine segments. The exact wood used to build the staircase is unknown, although it has been confirmed to be a type of spruce, probably non-native to New Mexico. The handrails were added later, in 1887. The staircase does not actually stand by itself: Joe Nickell identified as supports the inner wood stringer as well as an iron bracket attached to a column. Apart from any claims of its miraculous nature, the staircase has been described as a remarkable feat of woodworking. According to a Washington Post column by Tim Carter: > \\"It's a magnificent work of art that humbles me as a master carpenter. To > create a staircase like this using modern tools would be a feat. It's mind- > boggling to think about constructing such a marvel with crude hand tools, no > electricity and minimal resources.\\" According to another professional carpenter, who was interviewed by Ben Radford for his book Mysterious New Mexico: > \\"The execution is just incredible. The theory of how to do it, to bend it > around in a two-turn spiral, that's some difficult arithmetic there.\\" ===History=== The staircase was built sometime between 1877 and 1881. By this point the chapel was substantially complete but still lacking access to the choir loft, possibly due to the unexpected death of the architect, Projectus Mouly, in 1879. According to the version of events passed down by the Sisters of Loretto, multiple builders were consulted but were not able to find a workable solution due to the confined quarters. In response, the nuns prayed for nine straight days to St. Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters. On the last day of the novena, a mysterious stranger appeared and offered to build the staircase. He worked in seclusion using only a few simple hand tools and disappeared afterwards without the Sisters learning his identity. More fantastical versions of the story have the work taking place overnight, while according to others it took six to eight months. In any event, the finished staircase was an impressive work of carpentry, seeming to defy physics as it ascended without any obvious means of support. The Sisters of Loretto viewed its construction as a miracle and believed that the mysterious builder must have been St. Joseph himself. As the story spread, the staircase became one of Santa Fe's most famous tourist attractions. The staircase as originally built lacked handrails and was reportedly so frightening to descend that some of the nuns and students did so on their hands and knees. Eventually, railings were added in 1887 by another craftsman, Phillip August Hesch. The stairs have been mostly closed to the public since the chapel became a privately-run museum in the 1960s. ===Physics=== One of the supposedly miraculous aspects of the staircase is that it lacks the newel or central pole usually used to support and stabilize a spiral staircase, and therefore the means of supporting the weight is not obvious. In reality, the staircase is supported by its stringers just like a conventional (straight) staircase, although in this case each stringer is twisted into a helix. Observers have also noted that the inside stringer has such a tight radius that it is able to function similarly to a straight center support. According to an analysis by a professional carpenter in Mysterious New Mexico, the assembly of the stringers from overlapping segments joined by wood glue creates a laminate that is actually stronger than the wood alone. Additionally, the use of wooden pegs rather than nails prevents degradation of the joints due to compression set as the wood swells against the nails due to changes in humidity or temperature. Although the staircase as built lacked any external bracing, an iron support bracket was added in 1887 at the same time as the railings. This may have been intended to limit the degree of vertical travel arising from the helical shape, which effectively makes the staircase behave as a giant coil spring and is part of the reason spiral staircases usually have a central support. Even after this modification, users of the staircase reported \\"a certain amount of springiness\\". Nevertheless, it was able to hold a significant amount of weight, as attested by a photo taken around 1959 of at least twelve choir members posing on the steps. ===Identity of the builder=== In the early 2000s, research by amateur historian Mary Jean Cook identified the probable builder of the staircase as François-Jean \\"Frank\\" or \\"Frenchy\\" Rochas (1843–1894), a reclusive rancher and occasional carpenter who came to New Mexico from France around the 1870s. A key piece of evidence was a short article in the Santa Fe New Mexican describing his death by murder in 1895, which noted: > \\"He was a Frenchman, and was favorably known in Santa Fe as an expert worker > in wood. He build [sic] the handsome stair-case in the Loretto chapel and at > St. Vincent sanitarium.\\" Cook also found an entry in the Sisters' logbook stating that Rochas had been paid US$150 () for \\"wood\\" in 1881, confirming that he had done some type of carpentry work for them. At the time of his death, Rochas reportedly owned an extensive set of carpentry tools including: > \\"five saws, a saw clamp and set, nine planes, nineteen moulding planes, two > squares, five gauges, six chisels, two gouges, a draw knife, a brace, three > augers, ten auger bits, a reamer, two clamps, and a pair of trammel points > (for drawing large circles)\\" ===Similar stairs=== Although the design of the Loretto stairs is highly unusual, other spiral staircases without center supports are known to exist. One example can be found at the Old Washoe Club in Virginia City, Nevada, which also dates to the 1870s. This staircase was described by Ripley's Believe It or Not! as \\"the longest of its kind without a supporting pole\\", although it has fewer turns than the Loretto staircase. Further afield, another staircase is in the Gdańsk Town Hall in Poland, which was reported to the New Mexican in 1944 by a government official named Bonnie Foster. The paper wrote: > \\"It is tall, spiral, and without steel nails, but the wood is different. It > is in the town hall, of the 14th to the 16th century. How it was > constructed, and whether there is a miracle story back of it, Mrs. Foster > could not say. But she declared it is strikingly like St. Joseph's in > design.\\" == Loretto Academy == Loretto Academy was founded in 1853 and continued to operate until 1968. Afterward, the previously all-male St. Michael's High School turned co-ed in order to accommodate the Academy's female students. Born in Santa Fe in 1917 (1917–2005), Mary Frances Hill (née Julian) attended the Loretto Academy from 1920 until 1935 and she is believed to have attended the Academy longer than any other student and she is also believed to have climbed the miraculous staircase more times than anyone else as a result of having been a member of the Academy's choir. ==In popular culture== The story was the subject of the 1998 television film The Staircase starring Barbara Hershey and William Petersen.The Staircase (IMDB) The case was investigated and subsequently re-enacted in the Unsolved Mysteries episode \\"Miracle Staircase\\". Young-adult author Ann Rinaldi based her book The Staircase on the Loretto Chapel. ==See also== * List of churches in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe == References == ==Bibliography== == External links == * Loretto Chapel home page * Engineering miracle or just good carpentry? * Sisters of Loretto song by Kate Vargas * Loretto Staircase at Snopes Category:Sisters of Loretto Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe Category:Churches completed in 1872 Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States Category:Museums in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:Religious museums in the United States Category:Former Roman Catholic church buildings in New Mexico Category:Wedding chapels in the United States Category:Roman Catholic chapels in the United States Category:Roman Catholic churches in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:Gothic Revival architecture in New Mexico ","title":"Loretto Chapel"},{"id":"2571147","text":"John Cramer may refer to: * John Cramer (announcer) (born 1955), American television announcer * John Cramer (representative) (1779–1870), US Representative from New York * John Cramer (priest) (1793–1848), English classical scholar and geographer * John G.

In 1688 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in governor Soop's regiment in Riga; in 1693 he was transferred to young prince Charles's Life Guards regiment in Stockholm. When the Great Northern War broke out after the prince was crowned as Charles XII, Schlippenbach raised a regiment of dragoons in Livonia, of which he became the colonel. When Charles broke winter camp at Dorpat (present-day Tartu) and headed towards Riga in early 1701, Schlippenbach was left behind to defend the Livonian border. He won the battle of Rauge on 5 September 1701 and was subsequently promoted to major general, but was then defeated by a large Russian force under Boris Sheremetev at Erastfer on 30 December the same year and at Sagnitz and Hummelshof on 19 July 1702. In 1703 he had to transfer a good part of his forces to reinforce Lewenhaupt's in Kurland.

He is a frequent guest on TV news shows. Bastardi is an outspoken denier of human-induced global warming who is at odds with the scientific consensus. ==Biography== Bastardi was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He spent his childhood moving frequently, first to Texas in 1960, then to Somers Point, New Jersey in 1965. He enrolled at Penn State University, where he was a member of the varsity wrestling team. He graduated with a Bachelor's degree in meteorology in 1978. In 1992 Bastardi married Jessica Jane Strunck, also a Penn State graduate. They have a son Garrett (born 1996) and a daughter Jessica (born 1998). In his free time, Bastardi enjoys bodybuilding, and has won the NABBA American Bodybuilding Championships. Bastardi worked for AccuWeather from 1978 until February 2011. He joined WeatherBell Analytics LLC as Chief Forecaster in March 2011. ==His work== Bastardi's forecasts were previously offered free to the public on AccuWeather's main site. However, in the early 2000s, AccuWeather launched its \\"professional site,\\" and his forecasts were made available to paying subscribers only. He also forecasts for corporate clients. Despite his recent intensified focus on private forecasting, Bastardi frequently appears on cable news channels, such as CNN and Fox News, during storms. Bastardi produced several weather analysis videos, including \\"Bastardi's Big Dog\\" and \\"Long Ranger\\". His Long Ranger video features his thoughts on long-range trends. In addition to his videos, Bastardi contributed to official AccuWeather press releases, such as annual winter forecasts. Bastardi wrote a column that summarized his views in the videos. Bastardi sometimes contributed columns several times a day when a storm is approaching. He maintains that he has not taken a day off since 2002, including \\"Christmas and Easter.\\" Bastardi is currently a Chief Forecaster at WeatherBell Analytics LLC. At WeatherBell Analytics he provides frequently updated blog postings and videos on the weather through WeatherBell Premium, as well as services for commercial clients. ==Forecasting style and accuracy== Bastardi prefers to make definitive, rather than probabilistic, predictions: \\"The weather [is] an opponent that never quits, and the best you really can get is a tie with it.\\" He has been critical of National Weather Service forecasts: On October 25, 2011, Bastardi and colleague Joe D'Aleo correctly forecasted the Halloween nor'easter. In October 2012, Bastardi correctly predicted as early as October 22 that Hurricane Sandy would form in the western Caribbean and make landfall on the Jersey Shore, over a full week before Sandy made landfall on October 30. He was consistent with his forecast despite the constant changes in forecasts from weather models and other meteorologists claiming that his idea of a Jersey landfall would fail to come to fruition. ==Stance on global warming== Bastardi is an outspoken denier of human-induced global warming. He has written a book describing his views, which are sharply at odds with the scientific consensus on the topic. Among Bastardi's positions that are at odds with the science: he has asserted that the world was warmer in the 1930s than today, that the human contribution of carbon dioxide is too small to have any effect, and that warming is caused by sunspots and exchange with warmer oceans. He argues in his columns that extreme weather events occur naturally and that there is not enough evidence to state that such events are unusual. In 2011, Bastardi wrote that, as he had predicted three years earlier, global average temperature was falling, and by 2030 would return to levels seen in the late 1970s due to the \\"triple-crown of cooling\\" comprising oceanic temperature cycles, solar radiation cycles, and volcanic activity. Bastardi asserts that the changes due to carbon dioxide are tiny compared to other factors so it cannot cause global warming.Bastardi, The Climate Chronicles, pp. 22–23 He writes \\"In the entire geological history of the planet, there has been no known linkage between CO2 and temperatures.\\"Bastardi, The Climate Chronicles, p. 27 Bastardi also states that carbon dioxide cannot cause global warming because this would violate the first law of thermodynamics. He has further explained: > CO2 cannot cause global warming. I'll tell you why. It doesn't mix well with > the atmosphere, for one. For two, its specific gravity is 1 1/2 times that > of the rest of the atmosphere. It heats and cools much quicker. Its > radiative processes are much different. So it cannot -- it literally cannot > cause global warming. --- Joe Bastardi, Fox Business, March 9, 2012. Physicist Richard A. Muller states that Bastardi's explanation of CO2 is \\"completely wrong\\" and \\"even skeptics of global warming, if they know physics, would disagree with him.\\" Bastardi and science popularizer Bill Nye have clashed over climate change. In 2010 they debated on Fox TV. In 2015–2016 Bastardi and Nye publicly challenged each other with predictions of mean global surface temperature in the near term. ==ReferencesFacebook page * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American television meteorologists Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:People from Providence, Rhode Island Category:People from Somers Point, New Jersey ","title":"Joe Bastardi"},{"id":"2571156","text":"Coal River may refer to: ;Rivers *Coal River (Canada), in Yukon and British Columbia *Coal River (Fiordland), in New Zealand *Coal River (Canterbury), in New Zealand *Coal River (West Virginia), in the United States *Coal River (Tasmania), in Australia ;Other *Coal River (book), a 2008 nonfiction book about mountaintop removal mining in the United States *Coal River was the early name for the Australian settlement which became Newcastle, New South Wales ","title":"Coal River"},{"id":"2571196","text":"Vincent Matthew Sarich (December 13, 1934October 27, 2012) was an American anthropologist. He was Professor Emeritus in anthropology at University of California, Berkeley. Sarich and his PhD advisor, Allan Wilson, used molecular data to estimate that humans and chimpanzees have a common ancestor just four to five million years ago. Their paper on their finding was published in 1967. At the time, scientists considered the common ancestor to live ten to 30 million years ago, and their revised estimate has become well accepted. Sarich generated controversy with his support for analyzing human behavior and populations in evolutionary terms. ==Early life and education== Born in Chicago, he received a bachelor of science in chemistry from Illinois Institute of Technology and his masters and doctorate in anthropology from University of California, Berkeley, where he was supervised by Sherwood Washburn. He was a member of the Department of Anthropology at Stanford from 1967 to 1981, and taught at UC Berkeley from 1966 through 1994. As a doctoral student, and along with his PhD supervisor Allan Wilson, Sarich measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions of blood serum albumin between pairs of creatures, including humans and African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas). The strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an Immunological Distance, which was in turn proportional to the number of amino acid differences between homologous proteins in different species. Sarich and Wilson showed that the pattern of differences between modern species could only be explained if the molecular change along different lineages had in fact accumulated approximately equally (i.e., where a type of 'molecular clock'). This method they called the relative rate test, and it showed that one could empirically test whether the molecular change was constant simply by looking at the pattern of differences between modern forms of the molecule. By constructing a calibration curve of the I.D. of species' pairs with best- attested divergence times in the fossil record, the data could be used as a molecular clock to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records. ==Career== In their 1967 paper Immunological time scale for hominid evolution in Science, Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago, at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Their logic first involved showing empirically that the albumins of several Old World Monkey (Cercopithecoidea) species was equally different from human albumin and chimpanzee albumin (within experimental error). This constituted a relative rate test of molecular change, and showed that both human and chimpanzee albumin lineages must have accumulated approximately equal amounts of change since their common ancestor (else one would be more different from the outgroup monkeys than the other), thereby providing direct empirical evidence of an approximate molecular clock for this molecule. This same pattern (i.e., equal distance between any two species and a more distantly related 'outgroup' species) held for all the empirical comparisons they made among primate species (within experimental error). Further work on additional molecules (for example, transferrin and hemoglobin) showed that these had also evolved in an approximate clocklike pattern in different Primate lineages. Phylogenetic trees based on these pattern of species differences were then constructed, though these could only indicate relative branch points, because the molecular differences - though having been shown by the relative rate test to have evolved approximately clocklike over millions of years - could not by themselves indicate how fast or slow the clock was (i.e., how many changes had occurred per unit of time). For this, Sarich and Wilson used the most well- established fossil evidence (In particular: no primates of modern aspect had been found prior to the K-T boundary, ~65 million years ago) to calibrate the tree's branch points. This work on a variety of molecules (and confirmed by modern DNA differences) consistently suggested a recent (~5 million year old) common ancestry with the African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas). Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably Lucy, and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably Ramapithecus, showed these younger estimates to be likely correct and have validated the pattern implied initially by Sarich and Wilson's albumin data. Empirical demonstrations that the molecular clock principle held among large groups of organisms (through application of the relative rate test) revolutionized the study of molecular evolution. Sarich's later work on race strengthened his reputation as a controversial figure. He applied his earlier work to racial differentiation, which he saw as subgroupings below the level of species. He also argued that the smaller the amount of time required to create a given number of morphological difference, the more selectively significant the differences would necessarily be. Sarich was a proponent of sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and that racial differences were real and represented evolved geographic populational differences (on average), which often caused him to be the subject of controversy by activists at Berkeley. In 1994, Sarich was a signatory of a collective statement titled Mainstream Science on Intelligence,Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. Wall Street Journal, p A18. written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal. Sarich also wrote a defense of The Bell Curve. After retirement from Berkeley, he occasionally lectured in anthropology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand for a number of years. At the time of his death he was living in Seattle with his daughter, her partner, and grandson. ==Criticism== Some of Sarich's teachings were criticized by some students and faculty, who argued they believed they were not based in science, and his critics said some of his statements were demeaning to women, nonwhites and homosexuals. Other students defended him against these charges, however, and defended his teaching. In an interview with The New York Times, Sarich agreed with his critics, who stated that there was little or no scientific basis for his claims about homosexuality, or on the relationship that he was then teaching of brain size to intelligence. He told the Times there seems to be a correlation but \\"there is not a lot of evidence to support that theory because there isn't a lot of research done on the subject.\\" With respect to his discussions on homosexuality, he told the Times \\"I have to admit that there isn't a lot of foundation behind that. In discussions it was clear that my students had more experience and were more heartfelt about the homosexual issues, and I had to agree with them.\\" ==Bibliography== *Sarich VM, Wilson AC.

Miyamoto graduated from Waseda University in 1983, and joined his father's electric power conglomerate, Den-Yu-Sha as a programmer in their software division. After transforming the games division from a group of generalist programmers into specialists working together on a common project, the group was spun out into its own company in 1986. Miyamoto served as president of the company until 1991, though he remained a major shareholder in the company. ==Biography== ===Square=== Miyamoto graduated from Waseda University in 1983, but he was not interested in joining his father's electric power conglomerate, Den-Yu-Sha, instead pondering a career in women's clothing manufacturing. He started his career developing computer games in the software division of Den-Yu-Sha at Yokohama. At the time, game development in Japan was usually conducted by only one programmer. Miyamoto recognized that it would be more efficient to have graphic designers, programmers, and professional story writers working together on common projects. To recruit for this new organizational structure, Miyamoto opened an Internet café-like salon in Yokohama and offered jobs to those who demonstrated exceptional programming skills. This strategy discovered Hisashi Suzuki, who would go on to become CEO of Square, and he in turn recruited Hironobu Sakaguchi, the eventual creator of Final Fantasy. In 1986, Miyamoto spun Square out from Den-Yu-Sha to become an independent company with a focus on making games for the Famicom video game system in Japan. He stepped down as president of Square in 1991. ===Square Enix Merger=== During the discussion of the merger of Square and Enix in 2002, his approval of the merger was essential because of his major stake in Square. Initially, the ratio of Square shares was to be 1 to .81 shares of Enix, which Miyamoto objected to. When the merger went through, 1 share of Square resulted in 0.85 shares of Enix. Miyamoto made 5 million shares, or 9% of the company, available for purchase in the summer of 2002, but still retained 31.04% ownership. He is as of March 31, 2018 the tenth largest shareholder of Square Enix. ==References== Category:Square (video game company) Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese businesspeople Category:Square Enix people ","title":"Masafumi Miyamoto"},{"id":"2571239","text":"Pennsylvania Route 940 (PA 940) is a Pennsylvania highway located in the sparsely developed Pocono Mountains. It runs from PA 309 in Hazleton to PA 191 in Paradise Valley. Large segments of PA 940 are located in densely forested areas. The route heads northeast through Luzerne County from Hazleton, passing through Freeland and coming to an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) in White Haven. From here, PA 940 turns east and runs a short distance north of I-80, coming to an interchange with both I-80 and I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) in northern Carbon County. The route continues through Monroe County and passes through Pocono Pines before it has an interchange with I-380 and becomes a short freeway. After the freeway ends, PA 940 passes through Mount Pocono prior to continuing to its eastern terminus. PA 940 was first designated in 1928 between White Haven and PA 115 in Blakeslee. The road between Blakeslee and Pocono Summit was part of PA 115 while PA 615 was designated between PA 115 in Pocono Summit and PA 90 (now PA 390) west of Paradise Valley. PA 940 was extended east to U.S. Route 611 (US 611) in Swiftwater in 1935, replacing a portion of PA 115. PA 615 was decommissioned in 1946. PA 940 was extended west to US 309 in Hazleton by 1950. PA 196 was designated onto the roadway between Mount Pocono and Paradise Valley in 1956. PA 940 was moved to its current alignment between Pocono Summit and Paradise Valley in 1964 after the roadway in Pocono Summit was upgraded to a short freeway; the route replaced PA 196 between Mount Pocono and Paradise Valley while PA 314 was designated along the former PA 940 between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater. ==Route description== ===Luzerne County=== PA 940 begins at an intersection with PA 309 and 22nd Street at the northern border of the city of Hazleton in Luzerne County, heading northeast as a two-lane undivided road into Hazle Township. The road passes a mix of homes and businesses to the east of Church Hill Mall and curves north, running through wooded areas, heading between commercial development to the west and a coal mine to the east. The route turns east onto Main Street, passing through the residential community of Harleigh and curving northeast. PA 940 heads through forested areas with some homes and curves back to the east, running a short distance to the north of a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line and a coal mine. The road passes through the communities of Ebervale and Oakdale before it becomes lined with homes as it runs through the community of Japan. Here, the route turns to the north and heads into forests, curving northwest and running through the residential community of Drifton. PA 940 curves northeast and passes through the community of Youngstown before it crosses into Foster Township, running through a mix of forests and homes. PA 940 westbound past the I-80 interchange in White Haven The route passes through industrial areas before it reaches the residential community of Woodside and quickly turns east onto Hazle Street and then north onto Centre Street. The road heads into the borough of Freeland and passes homes before heading into the commercial downtown. Here, PA 940 turns east onto South Street and runs past residences and commercial establishments, becoming the border between Freeland to the north and Foster Township to the south before fully entering Foster Township. The road heads northeast into forested areas with occasional residential and commercial development, with the name becoming Foster Avenue. The route continues through rural areas and curves to the east, passing to the north of the Hickory Hills residential development. PA 940 runs through more forests with some development and makes a turn to the north and enters the borough of White Haven, where the name becomes Church Street. The road widens to a four- lane divided highway and comes to an interchange with I-80 at exit 273. Past this interchange, the route becomes a two-lane undivided road again and passes homes and a few businesses, coming to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 437 in the center of White Haven. Here, PA 437 continues north on Church Street and PA 940 turns east onto Berwick Street, running past more residences. The road crosses the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Lehigh Division line and passes businesses and industrial development before coming to a bridge over the Lehigh River. ===Carbon and Monroe counties=== After crossing the Lehigh River, PA 940 enters Carbon County and the borough of East Side. After crossing the river, the route makes a turn to the north to become River Street, then curves to the east to become State Street, heading through wooded residential areas. The road continues east through forested areas with occasional homes and businesses. At the eastern border of East Side, PA 940 intersects the western terminus of PA 534, which provides access to Hickory Run State Park. Past this intersection, the route enters Kidder Township and becomes an unnamed road, heading through dense forests in the Pocono Mountains region, passing to the south of a residential development. The road heads into business areas and comes to a junction with I-80 to the south and I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) at the Pocono interchange to the north at two trumpet interchanges that meet at PA 940 with traffic lights. From here, the route heads northeast and passes under I-476, heading into forests and passing through the community of Leonardsville, with the Pocono Mountain Lake Estates residential development to the northwest. PA 940 curves east and continues through forested land as it passes to the south of the Jack Frost Ski Resort and comes to an intersection with Moseywood Road, which heads south as a private toll road to provide access to Lake Harmony. Farther east, the road curves northeast and comes to a bridge over Tobyhanna Creek. PA 940 west in Pocono Pines After crossing the Tobyhanna Creek, PA 940 enters Tobyhanna Township in Monroe County. The route passes through forests with some homes and businesses and reaches the community of Blakeslee, where it crosses PA 115 in a commercial area. Past this intersection, the road heads through forested areas and residential development, passing to the southeast of the Green Wood Acres private development before heading through the community of Camelot Forest, where it passes near homes and a few businesses. PA 940 continues through forests with some homes and businesses, passing to the southeast of the Blakeslee Estates and Forest Glen developments and to the northwest of the Pocono Lake Preserve development. In the community of Locust Lakes Village, the road bends to the east and continues through dense forest with some homes, passing to the north of the Wagners Forest Park private development. Farther east, the route turns southeast and crosses Tobyhanna Creek to the north of Pocono Lake. PA 940 curves to the northeast and reaches the community of Pocono Pines, where it comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 423. Past this intersection, the road runs along the southern shore of Lake Naomi as it continues through a mix of forests and homes. The route continues through rural land with residential development and passes to the south of Stillwater Lake. PA 940 curves southeast and runs near a few homes and businesses before it widens to a four-lane divided highway and comes to an interchange with I-380 at exit 3. East of I-380, PA 940 becomes a four-lane freeway, heading northeast through forests with some commercial development to the northwest. The freeway comes to an interchange with the western terminus of PA 314 to the south of the community of Pocono Summit. Immediately after this interchange, the route comes to a bridge over a Delaware–Lackawanna Railroad line. The freeway ends and PA 940 becomes a four- lane at-grade divided highway called Pocono Summit Road, crossing into Coolbaugh Township. The road heads north into business areas and curves northeast, entering the borough of Mount Pocono. The route passes a few shopping centers before it runs between a golf course to the north and homes and businesses to the south, coming to an intersection with PA 611 and the southern terminus of PA 196. At this point, PA 940 heads south for a short concurrency with PA 611 on four-lane divided Pocono Boulevard before splitting east onto an unnamed two-lane undivided road. The route passes to the north of a shopping center before heading into forested areas. The road becomes the border between Paradise Township to the north and Mount Pocono to the south before passing under the Delaware–Lackawanna Railroad line and fully entering Paradise Township. PA 940 runs through more dense forests, passing a few homes and businesses before it reaches a junction with the southern terminus of PA 390. The route continues east through forested areas with some homes and comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA 191 in the community of Paradise Valley, where the road heads southeast as part of PA 191. ==History== The former alignment of PA 940 in Pocono Lake When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 940 became Legislative Route 169 east of Blakeslee, while the road between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater became a part of Legislative Route 171. The highway was designated as part of PA 15 from Blakeslee to Pocono Summit in 1927. In 1928, PA 940 was designated along an unpaved road between White Haven and PA 115 in Blakeslee. PA 115 replaced the PA 15 designation between Blakeslee and Pocono Summit and the road between PA 115 in Pocono Summit and PA 90 (now PA 390) west of Paradise Valley was designated as PA 615. At this time, PA 115 between Blakeslee and Pocono Summit and all of PA 615 was paved. By 1930, the unnumbered road between Hazleton and White Haven was paved. In April 1935, the eastern terminus of PA 940 was extended from Blakeslee to US 611 in Swiftwater, replacing this section of PA 115. By 1940, the road was paved between White Haven and Blakeslee. In 1946, PA 615 was decommissioned and the segment went unnumbered. By 1950, PA 940 was extended west from White Haven to US 309 in Hazleton. In 1956, the segment from Mount Pocono to Paradise Valley was designated as an extension of PA 196. PA 940 near Pocono Summit was upgraded to a freeway in 1964; as a result the PA 196 designation between Mount Pocono and Paradise Valley was removed and PA 940 was rerouted and extended to an intersection with PA 191 in Paradise Valley. The former alignment of PA 940 between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater became the western portion of PA 314. ==Major intersections== ==PA 940 Truck== See also: Pennsylvania Route 423 Truck Pennsylvania Route 940 Truck (PA 940 Truck) was a truck route of PA 940 that bypassed a weight-restricted bridge over the Tobyhanna Creek at Pocono Lake in Tobyhanna Township, on which trucks over 30 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route followed PA 115, I-80, and I-380. It was signed in 2013, but it was decommissioned in 2016 following a bridge repair. ==See also== * * ==References== 940 Category:Transportation in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Carbon County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:Pocono Mountains Category:Limited- access roads in Pennsylvania ","title":"Pennsylvania Route 940"},{"id":"2571253","text":"Ostrovica may refer to: * Ostrovica, Croatia, village in Croatia, near Benkovac, in Lišane Ostrovičke municipality ** Ostrovica Fortress, a castle in Croatia * Ostrovica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, village in Bosnia, near Kulen Vakuf ** Ostrovica Castle, a castle in Bosnia and Herzegovina * Ostrovica (Niška Banja), village in Serbia, near Niš * Ostrovica (Rudnik), a castle in Serbia * Ostrovica, Hrpelje-Kozina, village in Slovenia * Oštrovica, village in Croatia, near Delnice ","title":"Ostrovica"},{"id":"2571261","text":"Lothaire Bluteau (born 14 April 1957) is a Canadian actor.

His 1961 Impulse! album The Blues and the Abstract Truth (1960) is regarded as one of the most significant recordings of its era. The centerpiece of the album is the definitive version of Nelson's composition, \\"Stolen Moments\\". Other important recordings from the early 1960s are More Blues and the Abstract Truth and Sound Pieces, both also on Impulse!. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Oliver Nelson was born into a musical family in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. His brother was a saxophonist who played with Cootie Williams in the 1940s, and his sister sang and played piano. Nelson began learning to play the piano when he was six and started on the saxophone at eleven. Beginning in 1947 he played in \\"territory\\" bands in and around Saint Louis before joining the Louis Jordan band where he stayed from 1950 to 1951, playing alto saxophone and arranging.Joe Goldberg, \\"Focus on Oliver Nelson\\" – Down Beat magazine, February 15, 1962 Vol. 29, No. 4. page 17.Phil Woods, Reflections in E-flat – Saxophone Journal, September/October 1995 page 62. In 1952, Nelson underwent military service in the Marines playing woodwinds in the 3rd Division band in Japan and Korea. It was in Japan that Nelson attended a concert by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and heard Maurice Ravel's Mother Goose Suite and Paul Hindemith's Symphony in E Flat. Nelson later recalled that this \\"'was the first time that I had heard really modern music for back in St. Louis I hadn't even known that Negroes were allowed to go to concerts. I realized everything didn't have to sound like Beethoven or Brahms ... . It was then that I decided to become a composer'\\". Nelson returned to Missouri to study music composition and theory at Washington and Lincoln Universities, graduating with a master's degree in 1958. Nelson also studied with composers Elliott Carter, Robert Wykes and George Tremblay. While back in his hometown of St. Louis, he met and married Eileen Mitchell; the couple had a son, Oliver Nelson Jr., but soon divorced. After graduation, Nelson married St. Louis native Audrey McEwen, a union which lasted until his death and produced a son, Nyles. After completing his degree Nelson moved to New York City, playing with Erskine Hawkins and Wild Bill Davis, and working as the house arranger for the Apollo Theater in Harlem. He also played on the West Coast briefly with the Louie Bellson big band in 1959, and in the same year began recording for Prestige Records as the leader of various small groups. From 1960 to 1961, he briefly played with Count Basie and Duke Ellington, and then joined the Quincy Jones big band playing tenor saxophone, both in the U.S. and on tour in Europe. ===Breakthrough and afterwards=== After six albums as leader between 1959 and 1961 for the Prestige label, Nelson's big breakthrough came with The Blues and the Abstract Truth, an album recorded for Impulse! also featuring Eric Dolphy, Roy Haynes and Freddie Hubbard, which made his name as a composer and arranger. Subsequently, he recorded a number of notable big-band albums including Afro-American Sketches and Full Nelson. Nelson worked as an arranger on large ensemble albums for Thelonious Monk, Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins, Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis, Johnny Hodges, Wes Montgomery, Buddy Rich, Jimmy Smith, Billy Taylor, Stanley Turrentine, Irene Reid, and Gene Ammons. The music Sonny Rollins wrote for Alfie (1966), a film made in Great Britain, was arranged by Nelson for Rollins's Impulse! album of the same name. He also led all-star big bands in various live performances between 1966 and 1975. Nelson continued to perform as a soloist during this period, now focusing primarily on soprano saxophone. In 1967, Nelson moved to Los Angeles to be near the television and movie industry and began composing background music for television and films. Television projects included Ironside, Night Gallery, Columbo, The Six Million Dollar Man and Longstreet. Films scored by Nelson include Death of a Gunfighter (1969), Skullduggery (1970), Dial Hot Line (1970), Zig Zag (1970) and The Alpha Caper (1973). He also arranged Gato Barbieri's music for Last Tango in Paris (1972). During this time he also arranged and produced albums for pop stars such as Nancy Wilson, James Brown, the Temptations, and Diana Ross. Along with his big-band appearances (in Berlin, Montreux, New York, and Los Angeles), he led a small group that included John Klemmer, Ernie Watts, Freddie Hill, and Frank Strozier in a US State Department-sponsored tour of West Africa in 1969. Less well-known is the fact that Nelson composed several symphonic works, and was also deeply involved in jazz education, returning to his alma mater, Washington University, in the summer of 1969 to lead a five-week-long clinic that also featured such guest performers as Phil Woods, Mel Lewis, Thad Jones, Sir Roland Hanna, and Ron Carter. Among the student participants at the Washington University Summer Jazz Institute were saxophonists Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, and Hamiet Bluiett, who later co-founded the World Saxophone Quartet with David Murray. Nelson's book of jazz practice exercises, Patterns for Improvisation, was published in 1966 and remains highly regarded to this day. Nelson died of a heart attack on October 28, 1975 at the age of 43. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Oliver Nelson among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire. == Discography == ==References== ==External links== * *[ Oliver Nelson] – AllMusic biography by Scott Yanow *Oliver Nelson – brief introduction from the Jazz Files *Oliver Nelson – introduction from Impulse!

Since it positions John as superior to Jesus, the criterion of embarrassment has been used to argue for the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. The criterion of embarrassment is a type of critical analysis in which an account likely to be embarrassing to its author is presumed to be true as the author would have no reason to invent an account which might embarrass him. Certain Biblical scholars have used this as a metric for assessing whether the New Testament's accounts of Jesus' actions and words are historically probable.Catherine M. Murphy, The Historical Jesus For Dummies, For Dummies Pub., 2007. p 14 The criterion of embarrassment is also used as an argument by those who say that the Torah is the word of God; the Jews in the Torah are often described in very critical, very unflattering terms. The criterion of embarrassment is one point listed in the Criteria of Authenticity used by academics, the others being the criterion of dissimilarity, criterion of language and environment, criterion of coherence, and the criterion of multiple attestation. ==History== The criterion of embarrassment is a long-standing tool of New Testament research. The phrase was used by John P. Meier in his 1991 book A Marginal Jew; he attributed it to Edward Schillebeeckx (1914–2009), who does not appear to have actually used the term. The earliest use of the approach was possibly by Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel in the Encyclopaedia Biblica (1899).Stanley E. Porter, Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research (Continuum, 2004) pages 106–7. ==Examples== The assumption of the criterion of embarrassment is that the early church would hardly have gone out of its way to create or falsify historical material that embarrassed its author or weakened its position in arguments with opponents. Rather, embarrassing material coming from Jesus would be either suppressed or softened in later stages of the Gospel tradition. This criterion is rarely used by itself, and is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the criterion of dissimilarity and the criterion of multiple attestation, along with the historical method. The crucifixion of Jesus is an example of an event that meets the criterion of embarrassment. This method of execution was considered the most shameful and degrading in the Roman world, and advocates of the criterion claim this method of execution is therefore the least likely to have been invented by the followers of Jesus.Guy Davenport and Benjamin Urrutia, The Logia of Yeshua, Washington, DC 1996.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew, Yale University Press, 2009N. S.Gill, Discussion of the Historical Jesus ==Limitations== The criterion of embarrassment has its limitations and is almost always used in concert with the other criteria. One limitation to the criterion of embarrassment is that clear-cut cases of such embarrassment are few. A full portrait of Jesus could never be based on so little data. Clearly, context is important, as what might be considered as embarrassing in one era and social context may not have been so in another. Embarrassing details may be included as an alternative to an even more embarrassing account of the same event. As a hypothetical example, Saint Peter's denial of Jesus could have been a substitution for an even greater misdeed of Peter.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew, Yale University Press, 2009. p 170 An example of the second point is found in the stories of the Infancy Gospels. In one account from the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a very young Jesus is said to have used his supernatural powers first to strike dead, and then revive, a playmate who had accidentally bumped into him. If this tradition had been accepted as worthy of inclusion at some key juncture in the formation of the Christian Bible (and hence integrated in one way or another among the canonical Gospels), arguably many modern Christians would find it quite embarrassing—especially strict believers in biblical inerrancy. But as is suggested by the existence of this early non-canonical pericope, it must not have been embarrassing to some early Christians.Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium, Oxford, 1999. pp 90–91.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Doubleday, 1991. v. 1, pp 174–175, 317Stanley E. Porter, The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals Sheffield Academic Press, 2000.Gerd Thiessen & Dagmar Winter. The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria, Westminster John Knox Press, 2002. A further limitation is the possibility that what could be classed as embarrassing could also be an intentionally created account designed to provoke a reaction. For instance, Saint Peter's denial of Jesus could have been written as an example of the consequences of denial. : \\"Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.\\" A still further limitation is the fact that of all the criteria to evaluate authenticity, the criterion of embarrassment may be the most easily forged. A person who knows that having extra witnesses will bolster their credibility still has a lot of hard and uncertain work to do before they will have those witnesses on their side. A person who knows that including embarrassing details will make them more believable need do no more work than invent some embarrassing details. ==See also== * Criterion of dissimilarity * Criterion of multiple attestation * Lectio difficilior potior * Declaration against interest ==References== ==Further reading== *Meier, John P., A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: p. 168–171. ==External links== * The Criterion of Embarrassment and Jesus' Baptism by John Category:Historiography Category:Biblical criticism Category:1899 introductions ","title":"Criterion of embarrassment"},{"id":"2571276","text":"Computational genomics (often referred to as Computational Genetics) refers to the use of computational and statistical analysis to decipher biology from genome sequences and related data, including both DNA and RNA sequence as well as other \\"post-genomic\\" data (i.e., experimental data obtained with technologies that require the genome sequence, such as genomic DNA microarrays). These, in combination with computational and statistical approaches to understanding the function of the genes and statistical association analysis, this field is also often referred to as Computational and Statistical Genetics/genomics. As such, computational genomics may be regarded as a subset of bioinformatics and computational biology, but with a focus on using whole genomes (rather than individual genes) to understand the principles of how the DNA of a species controls its biology at the molecular level and beyond. With the current abundance of massive biological datasets, computational studies have become one of the most important means to biological discovery.Computational Genomics and Proteomics at MIT ==History== The roots of computational genomics are shared with those of bioinformatics. During the 1960s, Margaret Dayhoff and others at the National Biomedical Research Foundation assembled databases of homologous protein sequences for evolutionary study. Their research developed a phylogenetic tree that determined the evolutionary changes that were required for a particular protein to change into another protein based on the underlying amino acid sequences. This led them to create a scoring matrix that assessed the likelihood of one protein being related to another. Beginning in the 1980s, databases of genome sequences began to be recorded, but this presented new challenges in the form of searching and comparing the databases of gene information. Unlike text-searching algorithms that are used on websites such as Google or Wikipedia, searching for sections of genetic similarity requires one to find strings that are not simply identical, but similar. This led to the development of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which is a dynamic programming algorithm for comparing sets of amino acid sequences with each other by using scoring matrices derived from the earlier research by Dayhoff. Later, the BLAST algorithm was developed for performing fast, optimized searches of gene sequence databases. BLAST and its derivatives are probably the most widely used algorithms for this purpose. The emergence of the phrase \\"computational genomics\\" coincides with the availability of complete sequenced genomes in the mid-to-late 1990s. The first meeting of the Annual Conference on Computational Genomics was organized by scientists from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in 1998, providing a forum for this speciality and effectively distinguishing this area of science from the more general fields of Genomics or Computational Biology. The first use of this term in scientific literature, according to MEDLINE abstracts, was just one year earlier in Nucleic Acids Research. The final Computational Genomics conference was held in 2006, featuring a keynote talk by Nobel Laureate Barry Marshall, co- discoverer of the link between Helicobacter pylori and stomach ulcers. As of 2014, the leading conferences in the field include Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) and Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB). The development of computer-assisted mathematics (using products such as Mathematica or Matlab) has helped engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists to start operating in this domain, and a public collection of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to gene expression analysis. This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining. It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while students fluent in both topics start being formed in the multiple courses created in the past few years. ==Contributions of computational genomics research to biology== Contributions of computational genomics research to biology include: * proposing cellular signalling networks * proposing mechanisms of genome evolution * predict precise locations of all human genes using comparative genomics techniques with several mammalian and vertebrate species * predict conserved genomic regions that are related to early embryonic development * discover potential links between repeated sequence motifs and tissue-specific gene expression * measure regions of genomes that have undergone unusually rapid evolution == See also == *Bioinformatics *Computational biology *Genomics *Microarray *BLAST *Computational epigenetics == References== == External links == * Harvard Extension School Biophysics 101, Genomics and Computational Biology, http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~bphys101/info/syllabus.html * University of Bristol course in Computational Genomics, http://www.computational- genomics.net/ Category:Bioinformatics Category:Omics Category:Genomics Category:Computational fields of study ","title":"Computational genomics"},{"id":"2571278","text":"Pennsylvania Route 191 (PA 191) is a -long state highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The route, a major non-freeway corridor connecting the Lehigh Valley to The Poconos in eastern Pennsylvania, is designated from U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Brodhead to the New York state line over the Delaware River at Hancock, New York. Commissioned on April 17, 1961, the route replaced the PA 12 and PA 90 numbers that were in place from the late 1920s to the 1960s. From 1961 to 1976, PA 191 was routed south of US 22 through Bethlehem and terminated at PA 309 in Center Valley. PA 378 replaced the designation from Center Valley to the Lehigh River crossing in Bethlehem. ==Route description== ===Northampton County=== PA 191 passes through the woods of Washington Township PA 191 begins at an interchange with the US 22 freeway in Bethlehem Township, Northampton County in the Lehigh Valley, where the road continues south as Nazareth Pike to the city of Bethlehem, where it becomes Linden Street.

The route continues through rural areas, turning west and then north. PA 191 heads north through dense forests and reaches the community of Equinunk, where it turns northwest and crosses the Equinunk Creek into Buckingham Township. At this point, the Delaware River begins to follow the road to the northeast as it continues northwest through forests. The route and the river curve to the west and then to the north, with the route passing through the community of Dillontown. PA 191 continues to wind north along the west bank of the Delaware River through forests, passing through Stockport. Farther north, the road turns northwest and reaches an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 370. Following this, PA 191 curves northeast near homes and businesses and comes to its northern terminus at the New York border on the Hancock Bridge over the West Branch Delaware River, where the road continues as South Pennsylvania Avenue into the village of Hancock and provides access to NY 97. ==History== 1942 map of Stroudsburg showing PA 191 as PA 90. In the 1920s and 1930s, the first 191 number was designated from the Baltimore Pike in Clifton Heights to Penrose Avenue in southwest Philadelphia. The first state highway numbers to be assigned on the modern PA 191 were Pennsylvania Route 12 and Pennsylvania Route 90. PA 90 was designated from Stroudsburg to the New York-Pennsylvania border. The section from Center Valley to Stockertown was designated as part of PA 12 (which then went north to Wind Gap and Saylorsburg). From the 1920s to the 1940s, the designation between Stockertown and Stroudsburg had no signed traffic route. When both routes were commissioned, several spurs were as well. For Route 90, the following spurs were assigned in The Poconos region: Pennsylvania Routes 190, 290, 390, 490, 590, and 690. For Route 12, the following spurs were assigned in The Poconos and Lehigh Valley regions: Pennsylvania Routes 212, 312, 412, 512, 612, and 712. In April 1935, PA 12 was extended north to US 611 in Bartonsville, filling a gap between Snydersville and Bartonsville. By 1950, PA 90 was extended south to Easton, including the highway between Stroudsburg and Stockertown. On April 17, 1961, PA 191 was commissioned from the New York state line to U.S. Route 309 in Center Valley. The route replaced PA 12 south of Stockertown (the rest would be superseded by the Route 33 freeway) and PA 90 north of Stockertown (the rest remained part of Route 115 until 1972). In Bethlehem, PA 191 was designated onto Wyandotte Street, crossed the Lehigh River, went onto Main Street, turned onto Elizabeth Avenue, and turned onto Linden Street or Nazareth-Bethlehem Pike north of the city. PA 191 was designated to replace PA 12 and PA 90 in order to provide a continuous route between Center Valley and the New York border as well as to reduce confusion with I-90 in the northwest part of the state. By 1970, when Pennsylvania Route 378 was commissioned, PA 191 moved designations slightly in Bethlehem. Southbound 191 came from Nazareth, as Linden Street, and in Bethlehem, it turned west onto Union Boulevard. After it passed underneath I-378, the route turned south onto 3rd Avenue then onto the I-378 freeway. I-378 terminated at the bridge that crosses the Lehigh River and it continued as PA 191 (Wyandotte Street). By 1976, PA 191 was truncated to end at its current location and Pennsylvania Route 378 (formerly I-378) replaced its former routing from the Lehigh River bridge to Pennsylvania Route 309 in Center Valley. ==Major intersections== ==PA 191 Truck== Pennsylvania Route 191 Truck was a route that followed PA 248, PA 33, and the exit slip-ramps at the PA 33-PA 191 interchange. It was signed in 2014. Signs were removed and PA 191 Truck was decommissioned in 2016. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Pennsylvania Highways: PA 151 - 200 *PA State Route 191 Ends *PA Routes 191-200 - Central PA/MD Routes 191 Category:Transportation in Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Wayne County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Pike County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Northampton County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Pennsylvania Route 191"},{"id":"2571279","text":"{ } USS Young (DD-580), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy of that name. She was the first to be named for Rear Admiral Lucien Young (1852-1912). Young was laid down on 7 May 1942 at Orange, Texas, by the Consolidated Steel Corp.. The ship was launched on 15 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. J. M. Schelling and commissioned on 31 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander George B. Madden in command. ==Service history== === 1943 === Following a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, USS Young briefly operated out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. During that assignment, she formed part of the escort for the battleship when Iowa carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt across the Atlantic on the first leg of his journey to the Teheran Conference of November 1943. In the midst of that voyage, the destroyer received orders instructing her to head for the Pacific theater. She transited the Panama Canal on 24 November and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet. She arrived in Pearl Harbor early in December and received orders assigning her to the small U.S. 9th Fleet in the northmost Pacific Ocean. USS Young remained at Pearl Harbor for several weeks, and she then headed for the Aleutian Islands, where she arrived in mid-January 1944. === 1944 === The arrival of USS Young in Alaskan waters, however, came some three months after the Aleutians campaign ended. Her duties for the next eight months, therefore, consisted of escort and patrol missions spiced with an occasional bombardment of Japanese installations in the Kuril Islands. She was an element of Rear Admiral Wilder D. Baker's striking force on 2 February 1944 when that unit conducted the first bombardment of Japanese home territory in the Kurils. She twice returned to those islands in June, shelling Matsuwa on the 13th and Paramushiro on the 26th. Otherwise, her only enemy during the first eight months of 1944 proved to be the foul Aleutians weather. During September, she returned to the United States for an overhaul. Upon completing repairs, the destroyer departed San Francisco Bay on 6 October, bound for the western Pacific. Reporting in at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands late in the month, she received orders to join the escort of a supply convoy bound for the newly invaded Philippines. She reached Leyte Island on 18 November in the midst of an enemy air attack on the invasion fleet. She and her colleagues in the convoy screen combined to splash three of the attacking aircraft. On 19 December, Young departed Leyte with 10 other destroyers in the screen of the first Mindoro resupply echelon. The unit came under enemy air attack early in the morning of the 21st but encountered no concerted air opposition until near dusk. At about 17:18, a raid of five kamikazes broke through the combat air patrol, and three of the suicide planes succeeded in their missions, hitting LST-460, LST-479, and the Liberty ship SS Juan de Fuca. Both LSTs had to be abandoned, but Juan de Fuca continued on and reached Mindoro safely with the convoy on 22 December. During the return voyage, enemy planes returned to harass the convoy but failed to inflict damage. During the approach to and the retirement from Mindoro, Young claimed a total of five unassisted splashes and two assists. === 1945 === USS Youngs first amphibious assault came during the invasion of Luzon in January 1945. During the main landing on 9 January, she served as a unit of the screen for the landing craft of Attack Group \\"Baker\\" and covered part of the landings at Lingayen Gulf itself. The assault went off practically unopposed, in an example of the new Japanese tactics of fighting an amphibious force inland with conventional infantry tactics rather than trying to smash the landing at the beach. Since the American troops encountered no real resistance until they had advanced inland well beyond the range of destroyer guns, Young and her accompanying warships had little to do at Lingayen Gulf. That pattern repeated itself at Zambales later in the month when Young, in reconnoitering the landing area, encountered a small boat embarking a Filipino guerrilla lieutenant who informed the destroyer that the area had already been secured by his forces. The Zambales landing went off without a shot being fired. During operations around Subic and Manila Bays, the warship joined in destroying two Japanese suicide boats sent in from Corregidor to break up the Mariveles occupation force on 14 February. Two days later, she participated in the reduction and capture of the source of those boats--Corregidor. She bombarded \\"The Rock\\" before the assault and then helped silence enemy batteries on Caballo Island when they opened up on the landing craft. Later that morning, she threaded her way through mine-infested waters to provide gunfire support for the troops taking the island fortress. During the following weeks, USS Young conducted patrols out of Subic Bay. In April, she supported one of the U.S. Army's landings on Mindanao, but that operation, thanks to strong Moro guerrilla activity, proved to be another walkover. She continued her patrol operations in the Philippines until the end of the third week in May at which time she received orders to return to the United States for repairs. Steaming via Eniwetok Atoll and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she arrived in San Francisco Bay on 12 June and began a 47-day overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Late in July, USS Young completed her post-overhaul trials and, early in August, she headed back toward Pearl Harbor. However, by the time of her arrival, hostilities had already ceased. Instead of continuing westwards, she began operations in the Hawaiian Islands area as escort and plane guard for the aircraft carrier . On 25 September, she departed Hawaii in company with various units of the U.S. 3rd Fleet en route to the East Coast for the 1945 Navy Day celebration. On 27 October, Young arrived in New York City, where President Harry Truman reviewed the assembled ships. Young remained in New York until 1 November when she steamed towards Charleston, South Carolina, where she was placed in reserve on 31 January 1946. Finally decommissioned sometime in January 1947, the destroyer remained in reserve until 1 May 1968, at which time her name was stricken from the Navy list. On 6 March 1970, USS Young was sunk as a target off the mid-Atlantic coast. USS Young earned five battle stars during World War II. == References == * == External links == * navsource.org: USS Young * hazegray.org: USS Young Young (DD-580) Category:Ships built in Orange, Texas Category:1942 ships Young (DD-580) Category:Maritime incidents in November 1944 Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Maritime incidents in 1970 ","title":"USS Young (DD-580)"},{"id":"2571284","text":"Ricochet is an action-adventure game, originally written for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron home computers, published by Superior Software in 1989.

The object of the game is to retrieve five hourglasses from diverse scenarios to restore the flow of time. It features elements of both platform and puzzle games. The puzzles are mostly logical (keys unlock doors, gold placates a burglar), though there are exceptions. While the game shares many elements made popular in earlier Superior arcade adventures such as Citadel, it has a unique feel due to the movement of the main character. The player controls a creature named \\"SPRAT\\" (Small Partially Robotic Alien Time- traveller), depicted as a red sphere wearing sunglasses. SPRAT moves by rolling but can only do so along level ground or down slopes. There are ladders to climb but many platforms require a special movement to be reached. By holding 'down' (SPRAT squashes himself) to build up potential energy, then releasing, SPRAT can bounce at either a 45 or 90 degree angle. ==Legacy== Ricochet is one of a range of 1980s Superior games that was re-released for Microsoft Windows by Superior Interactive, with new graphics and added levels. ==External links== *Superior Software Category:1989 video games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Superior Software games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games scored by Rob Hubbard Category:Windows games ","title":"Ricochet (1989 video game)"},{"id":"2571287","text":"\\"Brian the Bachelor\\" is the seventh episode from the fourth season of Family Guy. It originally broadcast on June 26, 2005 and was written by Mark Hentemann and directed by Dan Povenmire. The episode sees Brian becoming a contestant on The Bachelorette and falling in love with the bachelorette, only to be let down by her ignoring him off–camera. Meanwhile, Chris discovers his pimple, \\"Doug,\\" can talk, and the pair cause mischief across the city. Overall, the episode was received with positive comments by critics and news sources. ==Plot== Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland to a bar to get him to meet some women, as he's still reeling from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn't work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to audition for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him down, Peter removes Cleveland's clothes and then his own. The producers see this and later on, Brian goes to them and explains that Peter was simply trying to help Cleveland and goes on to explain how Cleveland's been kind of lonely ever since he and his wife got divorced and figures that he's just confused about what he really wants in a relationship. After meeting Brian, they recruit him to be a contestant. Brian's unsure about this and tries convincing them to recruit Cleveland, but he ultimately decides to join the show, primarily for the free food and drinks (especially the martinis), but ends up falling in love with the reality starlet, Brooke Roberts. Quagmire and Brian are the final two contestants on The Bachelorette. Brooke's visits to the Griffin house is catastrophic, but Brooke admits that it wasn't nearly as bad as the dinner she had with Quagmire and his mom. Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke wishes Brian good luck and that it was nice \\"working with him,\\" revealing the show really is scripted, as Brian initially thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. In the end, Brian feels upset and humiliated about becoming the very thing he mocked before. Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on his face which he names \\"Doug.\\" Lois worries about Chris, as Doug, who can talk, tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint on the wall of the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, deciding to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman's, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort's entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian's family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke's shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman's Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out. ==Production== Mark Hentemann wrote the episode. When this episode was being produced, The Bachelorette was a bigger and more prolific program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well at the time of this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version. During Cleveland's audition for The Bachelorette, an unused scene was created that showed both Peter and Cleveland naked, with Peter sitting on top of Cleveland and bouncing up and down, as if he and Cleveland were engaging in anal sex, but broadcasting standards prohibited the scene. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comments in the DVD commentary that Walter Murphy, who composes much of the music for Family Guy, goes back and forth from standard Family Guy music to Bachelorette-style music during the episode. During the sequence where Brian and Brooke are talking in the barn, originally, the two horses in the background were intended to begin mating, but the sketch was never used. Nancy Cartwright, voice actor of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons, and Michael Bell, voice actor of Chaz Finster on Rugrats, provided their voices for the Snorks reference. The name of Quagmire's cat was originally \\"Pussy\\", but broadcasting standards objected. The episode was originally to feature a sequence showing Chris breaking entry into Goldman's Pharmacy in order to destroy the acne medication wearing a Balaclava, but the scene was never shown. The promo features Quagmire in a limo finding the girl of his dreams, but the scene was also cut. ==Cultural references== According to the commentary from the DVD, Chris' talking pimple is a reference to Little Shop of Horrors. Chris shown waving his shirt above his head and being watched by Herbert through the window is a reference to 1978 comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House. He-Man from the Masters of the Universe media franchise is shown at the ranch during Brian's time on The Bachelorette. Chris mentions The Snorks to his zit in the scene were he spaypaints the mini mart. The sequence of Peter and Lois at Mort Goldman's pharmacy after the store vandalism is a reference to Fast Times at Ridgemont High, with Jeff Spicoli coming out of the restroom. Brian's phone call to Brooke after she selects him as a final contestant makes references to the Billy Vera song At This Moment. Disney CEO Michael Eisner is featured after Brooke reveals that \\"it's just TV\\". He comes out to give Brian a \\"consolation prize\\", which turns out to be a bill for the Bachelorette mansion. ==Reception== As the most-watched Fox program that night, this episode had an audience of 7.29 million. In a positive review of the episode in Family Guy, Volume 3, Dan MacIntosh of PopMatters praised the performance of Chris: > \\"Chris' best scenes occur during \\"Brian The Bachelor\\", where he is shown > developing an unlikely friendship with one of his facial zits.\\" By contrast, Family Guy, Volume 3, included a negative review by Francis Rizzo III (aka Turdboy) of DVD Talk: > \\"Among the more frustrating trends in the series is its willingness to > stretch an unfunny joke to its very limits. When Stewie berated Brian for > not finishing his novel for nearly two minutes, not once, but twice, in > \\"Brian the Bachelor\\", it tested my patience severely, and didn't even make > me smile.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:Family Guy (season 4) episodes Category:2005 American television episodes ","title":"Brian the Bachelor"},{"id":"2571290","text":"Joseph Allen Frear Jr. (March 7, 1903 – January 15, 1993) was an American businessman and politician. A Democrat, he served as a United States Senator from Delaware from 1949 to 1961. ==Early life== J. Allen Frear was born on a farm near Rising Sun, in Kent County, Delaware, to Joseph Allen and Clara (née Lowber) Frear. His mother died in 1922, and his father subsequently married her brother's daughter. Frear was a distant relative of Robert Freer, who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. One of three children, he received his early education at local public schools, and graduated from Caesar Rodney High School in 1920. Frear studied at the University of Delaware in Newark, where he received a bachelor of science degree in agriculture in 1924. Following his graduation, he became operator of three farms and president of a retail business that distributed milk, fuel, farm machinery, and fertilizer. He served as commissioner of Delaware State College in Dover (1936–1941) and of the Delaware Old Age Welfare Commission (1938–1948). Also interested in banking, he was director (1938–1946) and chairman of the board (1946–1948) of the Federal Land Bank in Baltimore, Maryland. During World War II, he served as a major in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946. From 1947 to 1951, he was president of Kent General Hospital in Dover. ==Political career== Frear was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948, defeating incumbent Republican Senator C. Douglass Buck in a close race. During this term, he served in the Democratic majority in the 81st and 82nd Congresses, and the Democratic minority in the 83rd Congress. He was again elected to the U.S. Senate in 1954, defeating Republican Representative Herbert B. Warburton by a wider than expected margin. During this term, he again served with the Democratic majority in the 84th, 85th, and 86th Congresses. Frear did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, while not voting on the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Frear narrowly lost his bid for a third term in 1960 to Republican Governor J. Caleb Boggs. In all, he served from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961. After leaving the Senate he was appointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1961 until 1963 and resumed his former business and banking pursuits. ==Death and legacy== Frear died at Dover and is buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery at Camden, Delaware. The J. Allen Frear Federal Building at 300 South New Street in Dover is named in his honor. There is also an Allen Frear Elementary School in Camden. {class= style=\\"width: 94%\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" align=\\"center\\" -bgcolor=#cccccc !colspan=7 style=\\"background: #ccccff;\\" Public Offices - !

For example, the Unicode characters U+8AAA 說 and U+8AAC 説 are Z-variants. The notion of Z-variance is only applicable to the “CJKV scripts”—Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese—and is a subtopic of Han unification. ==Differences on the Z-axis== The Unicode philosophy of code point allocation for CJK languages is organized along three “axes.” The X-axis represents differences in semantics; for example, the Latin capital A (U+0041 A) and the Greek capital alpha (U+0391 Α) are represented by two distinct code points in Unicode, and might be termed “X-variants” (though this term is not common). The Y-axis represents significant differences in appearance though not in semantics; for example, the traditional Chinese character māo “cat” (U+8C93 貓) and the simplified Chinese character (U+732B 猫) are Y-variants. The Z-axis represents minor typographical differences. For example, the Chinese characters (U+838A 莊) and (U+8358 荘) are Z-variants, as are (U+8AAA 說) and (U+8AAC 説). The glossary at Unicode.org defines “Z-variant” as “Two CJK unified ideographs with identical semantics and unifiable shapes,” where “unifiable” is taken in the sense of Han unification. Thus, were Han unification perfectly successful, Z-variants would not exist. They exist in Unicode because it was deemed useful to be able to “round-trip” documents between Unicode and other CJK encodings such as Big5 and CCCII. For example, the character 莊 has CCCII encoding 21552D, while its Z-variant 荘 has CCCII encoding 2D552D. Therefore, these two variants were given distinct Unicode code points, so that converting a CCCII document to Unicode and back would be a lossless operation. ==Confusion== There is some confusion over the exact definition of “Z-variant.” For example, in an Internet draft (of RFC 3743) dated 2002, one finds bù “no” (U+4E0D 不) and (U+F967 不) described as “font variants,” the term “Z-variant” being apparently reserved for interlanguage pairs such as the Mandarin Chinese tù “rabbit” (U+5154 兔) and the Japanese to “rabbit” (U+514E 兎). However, the Unicode Consortium's Unihan database treats both pairs as Z-variants. ==See also== *Backward compatibility ==References== Category:Character encoding Category:Unicode Category:Computer-related introductions in 1991 ","title":"Z-variant"},{"id":"2571293","text":"{ } USS Robinson (DD-562), a Fletcher-class destroyer, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Captain Isaiah Robinson (died c. 1781), who served in the Continental Navy. ==Operational history== Robinson was laid down on 12 August 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Wash.; launched 28 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Howard M. Sayers; and commissioned 31 January 1944, Commander Elonzo B. Grantham, Jr., in command. After shakedown out of San Diego, Robinson, departed Seattle 12 April for Hawaii. Arriving at Pearl Harbor 21 April, she trained until getting underway on 29 May with Task Force 52 (TF 52), headed for Eniwetok and the Marianas. ===World War II=== ==== Marianas campaign ==== On the morning of 15 June, Robinson opened fire in the battle of Saipan and her first salvo set off a large explosion, followed by an oil fire. She then silenced four enemy batteries which had been firing on Marines on the southernmost landing beaches, \\"Beach Yellow One\\". She then scored a direct hit on an enemy pillbox on Tinian. The destroyer joined the screen of battleship Tennessee (BB-43), at nightfall and in 2 hours fought off five enemy aircraft. She then teamed with destroyers Selfridge (DD-357) and Albert W. Grant (DD-649) in the screen of cruiser Birmingham (CL-62) off the western coast of Tinian, delivering harassing fire throughout the night. Robinson off the Puget Sound Navy Yard, 8 April 1944. She is wearing Camouflage Measure 32, Design 13D. At daybreak 16 June, Robinson resumed fire support to the Marines on the southernmost invasion beaches of Saipan. During the morning, she silenced all but one stubborn gun of an enemy artillery emplacement and her fire assisted in turning back enemy tanks. Toward noon, she began safeguarding the transports off Saipan. At nightfall, she turned to call-fire duty off \\"Beach Green One\\". Throughout the night of 16 June and into the morning of the 17th, Robinson illuminated and fired upon counterattacking Japanese tank divisions twice driving them back from the beachhead. That afternoon, she took fire support station, then spent the night and the next 5 days, protecting troop transports off Saipan. Retiring to Eniwetok with empty transports 26 June, she returned to Saipan on 6 July in the escort screen of a reinforcement convoy. Robinson took antisubmarine patrol station northwest of Saipan that day and closed the shore at night to provide illumination fire and send salvos into enemy troops east of Marpi Point. She shifted her fire to the west, to Tanapag Harbor the following morning and during the afternoon, rescued 17 Marines from a reef north of the harbor where they had been isolated by one of the biggest banzai attacks of the war. Robinson served on antisubmarine patrol off Saipan, in the ocean area northwest of Maniagassa Island, until 20 July, then got underway with Overton (APD-23) to escort 11 LCTs which arrived off Guam the next morning. She resumed fire support off Saipan that evening. On 22 July Robinson shifted her fire to Tinian, hitting caves where the enemy had dug in. She bombarded the western shore of Tinian 25 and 26 July; and, after gunfire support on the 29th, she guarded the minesweepers in Asiga Bay. Departing Tinian on 31 July, she escorted the hospital transport ship, Tryon (APH-1) to Eniwetok; then steamed independently to Nouméa, New Caledonia, where she arrived 9 August. ==== Peleliu ==== Robinson cleared Nouméa on 22 August and touched at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands, to rejoin other ships of her division, then arrived at Purvis Bay of Florida, Solomon Islands on the 26th. She stood out from Purvis Bay on 6 September, with Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's bombardment group, and arrived off Peleliu Island, on the morning of the 12th for pre-invasion bombardment. During the Battle of Peleliu, Robinson wiped out enemy machine gun emplacements and tumbled snipers out of trees as she blasted enemy troop concentrations near \\"White\\" and \\"Orange\\" beaches. At various times, she assisted in screening cruisers (CA-28) and Portland (CA-33) and battleships Idaho (BB-42) and (BB-41). She also raked the beach area during the daylight hours to cover underwater demolition teams, and she carried out call fire missions on enemy troops and gun batteries. On 22 September, she knocked out all guns in her area and disabled two groups of enemy tanks. She continued to hit emplacements, troop areas and supply dumps until the early morning of 24 September 1944 when she teamed with Heywood L. Edwards (DD-663) in destroying enemy barges attempting to land troops and supplies on the north shore. That evening she screened cruiser Louisville to Kossol Passage. She spent the night of 26 September providing illumination and harassing fire on the north end of Angaur Island. She gave the same treatment to Ngesebus Island the next night and bombarded the beaches south of Ngesebus airfields during the day of the 28th. She spent the night of 28–29 September delivering night illumination fire on the northwest corner of Angaur and entered Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands, 1 October. ==== Philippines campaign ==== Robinson cleared Seeadler Harbor on the 12th, and headed for the Philippine Islands. On 17 October 1944, she joined the Dinagat Attack Group. With light cruisers Denver (CL-58) and Columbia (CL-56), and three other destroyers, Robinson supported the Dinagat Attack Group and set course for Dinagat and the three smaller islands, Calicoan, Suluan, and Homonhon, which divided the two entrances to Leyte Gulf and were suspected of harboring enemy search radar. To put these enemy warning stations out of action, the attack group arrived off the islands at daybreak of 17 October. Cruiser Denver had the honor of firing the opening gun for the liberation of Leyte at 08:00 and Company D of the 6th Rangers was landed on Suluan Island some 20 minutes later—the first Americans to \\"return\\" to the Philippines. Robinson escorted the Ranger unit to Dinagat Island where they made an unopposed landing. She then covered minesweepers in Leyte Gulf until their retirement on the morning of 19 October. Her guns raked the invasion beaches ahead of the troops landing on Leyte, 20 October 1944, and she delivered illumination fire over the eastern shore of Leyte throughout the night. On 22 October, she rescued a downed American fighter pilot. On 24 October Robinson destroyed enemy installations on the slope of Catmon Hill, Leyte. At 17:10 on 24 October, Robinson was relieved from fire support duties and joined a screen for five cruisers on the left flank of the northern entrance to Surigao Strait. The destroyers were divided into three attack sections and severely mauled the attacking Japanese. By early morning 25 October, the enemy was limping off in retreat, having lost two battleships, two destroyers and a cruiser. Robinson made rendezvous with the destroyers of section 3 to the north of Hibuson Island after her torpedo attack, and vainly attempted to rescue the many Japanese survivors who refused all efforts to save them. At 07:58, 25 October, Robinson joined other destroyers and cruisers in anticipation of meeting enemy surface and air units retiring from the fierce action with the escort carriers off the east coast of Samar. She cruised east of Leyte until 29 October to cover shipping in and near Leyte Gulf. She assisted in fighting off enemy air raids and escorted the bomb-damaged Killen (DD-593) to her anchorage in San Pedro Bay on 1 November. She was temporarily detached from the task group on 4 November for picket duty in Surigao Strait and rejoined the bombardment group on 13 November as it set course for Manus. She teamed with Bryant (DD-665) to shoot down an enemy plane which approached the formation on the 16th, and entered Seeadler Harbor on the 21st. Robinson stood out of Seeadler Harbor on 28 November for Leyte Gulf where on 1 December she was detached from Destroyer Division 112 (DesDiv 112) of Destroyer Squadron 56 (DesRon 56) and reported to Destroyer Squadron 22 for duty. The next day she got underway in the screen of battleships and cruisers for Kossol Passage, where she teamed with 14 other destroyers in the screen of six escort carriers, seven cruisers, and three battleships, acting as distant cover for troop convoys bound for the assault on Mindoro, Philippine Islands. She assisted in driving off enemy aircraft as she guarded the escort carriers from 13 to 15 December. The troops hit the beach at Mindoro on the 15th and Robinson returned to Seeadler Harbor with the task group on the 23d. On 31 December Robinson and the five other destroyers of DesRon 22 sailed from Seeadler Harbor in the screen for Transport Group \\"Able\\" of the Lingayen Attack Force, carrying the 27th Infantry Division for the initial landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, in the Philippines. Robinson screened northwest of the transport area on the morning of 9 January 1945 as the first waves of amphibious assault troops landed. She anchored in the transport area that night and survived a pre-dawn attack by a Japanese suicide boat. The underwater explosions temporarily put her sonar equipment out of commission but did no other serious damage. At daybreak, Robinson's gunners fought off a diving kamikaze suicide plane and knocked it down in a spinning ball of flame. At dusk she opened fire on another suicide plane diving at a highspeed transport. That enemy missed its target and crashed into the sea. Robinson returned to Leyte Gulf with the empty transports on the 15th. She got underway from San Pedro Bay on 18 January to escort the attack transport Comet (APA-166) to Humboldt Bay, Hollandia, New Guinea, and returned on 3 February escorting Wright (AG-79). After installation of fighter-director radio equipment, she cleared port with Harmon (DE-678) and Greenwood (DE-679) in the screen for amphibious command ship Blue Ridge (AGC-2) and three transports; and headed for Lingayen Gulf where she performed patrol duty. She returned to San Pedro Bay with the empty troopship on 26 February, and sailed the next day with Bancroft (DD-598), escorting Rear Adm. Forrest B. Royal's amphibious command ship, Rocky Mount (AGC-3) which reached Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, on 1 March. That same day, Robinson put to sea in the screen for Task Group 78.1 (TG 78.1). The American ships arrived off the Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao early in the morning of 10 March, and Robinson took station off Coldera Point as troops stormed ashore under the cover of a rocket barrage. During the night, she teamed with McCalla (DD-488) for gunfire support, knocking out an enemy gun emplacement and hitting enemy pillboxes inland. On the 16th, she bombarded Isabela City, Basilan Island, creating a diversion while Army troops landed at Kulibato Point to the east. Assisted by spotting aircraft, she shelled a wharf and the area of suspected enemy underground trenches. On the evening of 18 March, she responded to the request of shore fire-control parties by blasting a Japanese troop concentration of about 150 men in the Gumularang River Valley of Basilan Island, giving support to American Army and guerilla troops. She anchored off the Santa Cruz Bank from 20 to 24 March. Robinson joined Task Group 78.2 at Mangarin Bay on 10 April 1945 and sailed 4 days later. She rescued two Marine aviators from the sea on the 16th. The next day, the task group entered Polloc Harbor of Mindanao and Army troops were landed for the assault against the Malabang-Parang-Catobato area of Mindanao. Robinson returned to Mangarin Bay with the empty shipping on 24 April and sailed the next day escorting a convoy carrying reinforcements to Polloc Harbor. She cleared that port on 28 April escorting oiler Winooski (AO-38) via Tawi Tawi, Sulu Archipelago, Philippine Islands, to Muara Batagao, Tarakan, Borneo. She reached her destination on 2 May, the day after the initial assault on Tarakan, and bombarded an enemy-defended ridge north of the airfield and a supply road junction. She got underway from Tarakan Island on 8 May, escorting amphibious ships to the Netherlands East Indies, arriving at Morotai 2 days later. ==== Borneo ==== On 4 June, Robinson sailed with Task Group 78.1 which arrived in Brunei Bay, British Northwest Borneo on 10 June. The landing was unopposed and Robinson joined the antisubmarine screen for Nashville (CL-43) and Phoenix (CL-46) en route to Tawi Tawi. She then sailed with Philip (DD-498) and arrived at Morotai, 20 June. She again stood out to sea on 26 June in the screen for amphibious ships which landed troops on the beach at Balikpapan, Borneo, on the morning of 1 July 1945. She conducted antisubmarine and picket patrol off Balikpapan until 15 July and returned to Morotai with one echelon of the empty troopships on the 19th. Three days later she teamed with (DD-466) to escort small craft to San Pedro Bay, arriving on the 25th. Robinson departed San Pedro Bay on 5 August 1945, and arrived at Ulithi, 7 August 1945. She took radar picket station some 50 miles from Ulithi from 10 to 13 August. Three days later she sailed escorting troopship Admiral Benson (AP-120) to San Pedro Bay; then continued on alone to Subic Bay, Luzon, where she arrived on the 21st. ==== China ==== Robinson in January 1946 On 3 September she put to sea with the Yangtze River Patrol Force under Rear Adm. C. Turner Joy, but broke off from the main body to head for Okinawa and arrived in Buckner Bay on the morning of 5 September. That same day Captain Campbell was designated commander of the newly organized Minesweeper Task Group 73.2 with Robinson as flagship. She put to sea with six minesweepers on the night of 5 September; and, 2 days later, the task unit began minesweeping operations in the approaches to and the entrance of the Yangtze. These lasted until December. On the 12th Robinson sailed from Shanghai for the United States and reached San Diego on 30 December. Robinson, with Waller, Saufley (DD-465), Philip, and Renshaw (DD-499) was assigned to the newly formed Destroyer Division 301 of Destroyer Squadron 30 at San Diego. She cleared San Diego on 12 January 1946 and arrived at Brooklyn, N.Y., on the 26th. She cleared port on 4 March, and entered the Charleston Navy Yard on the 7th for inactivation overhaul, and decommissioned on 12 June 1946. ===Cold War=== ==== 1951 – 1954 ==== Robinson remained in reserve until recommissioned at the Charleston Naval Shipyard on 3 August 1951. She was assigned to Destroyer Division 321 and on 9 September became the flagship of Destroyer Squadron 32. After sea trials off Charleston, S.C., she arrived at Norfolk, Va. on 2 December for shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay and off the Virginia Capes. She got underway from Norfolk on 10 January 1952 for maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea and returned on 6 March for squadron tactics and plane guard exercises with Saipan (CVL-48) and Midway (CVB-41) off the Virginia Capes. She subsequently operated off the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until getting underway from Norfolk on 29 June 1953 for 6 months in the western Pacific. The destroyer transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 3 August 1953. Robinson performed plane guard duty with Carrier Task Force 77 off the coast of Korea, participated in hunter-killer exercises off Kobe, Japan, escorted Point Cruz (CVE-119) to Inchon, Korea, patrolled off the east coast of Korea, and visited Pusan, Asau Wan and Tsushima. Robinson then returned home via the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean, reaching Norfolk on 6 February 1954. After operations along the Atlantic coast, Robinson made a midshipman practice cruise with battleship Missouri (BB-63) visiting Vigo, Spain, and Le Havre, France, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before returning to Norfolk on 3 August. ==== 1955 – 1958 ==== After operations off the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean, Robinson was again bound for the Mediterranean in company with Destroyer Squadrons 8 and 32 on 5 November 1955. She visited such Mediterranean ports as Rhodes, Greece; and Beirut, Lebanon; before steaming for Greenwich, England; Antwerp, Belgium; Bremerhaven, Germany; and Edinburgh, Scotland. After independent operations in waters to the north of the Shetland Islands, she arrived at Derry, Northern Ireland on 27 January for antisubmarine warfare and convoy exercises with British warships. This duty terminated 13 February 1956 and Robinson returned to Norfolk on the 22d for antisubmarine operations in the Virginia Capes, and shore bombardment practice at Bloodsworth Island. Early in June 1956, Robinson embarked midshipmen at Annapolis and cleared Norfolk on 5 June for a midshipman cruise. After exercise \\"Coppersmith\\" with units of the Danish Navy, she visited Copenhagen until the 26th, then set course for Chatham, England. She visited Guantanamo Bay before debarking the midshipmen at Annapolis and returning to Norfolk on 1 August. Robinson cleared Norfolk with Destroyer Squadron 32 on 22 October 1957 and touched at Bermuda before arrival at Gibraltar on 31 October. She put to sea the next day in company with Ross (DD-563) for the Persian Gulf, visiting Piraeus, Greece, and touching at Port Said on 7 November before transit of the Suez Canal for visits to Aden, Arabia; and Massawa, Eritrea. She arrived at Karachi, Pakistan, 25 November 1957. Based at the last named port, she participated in Operation Crescent with Navy warships of Pakistan, Turkey, Great Britain, and Iran. She got underway from Karachi, Pakistan, on 11 December, steamed by way of Massawa, and transited the Suez Canal on the 19th for maneuvers with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She sailed from Gibraltar on the 16th and arrived at Norfolk on 5 March 1958. ==== 1958 – 1964 ==== Robinson departed Norfolk again on 9 June 1958 on a midshipmen training cruise to A Coruña, Galicia (Spain); Gothenburg, Sweden; and Hamburg, Germany, before debarking the midshipmen at Annapolis on 4 and 5 August. After 7 months of operations from Norfolk, on 8 April 1959, Robinson was assigned to Reserve Destroyer Squadron 4, Destroyer Flotilla 4, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and began a new career training reservists. On 1 July, the destroyer sailed for Charleston, her new homeport where she operated for the next 5 years. Robinson decommissioned at Norfolk on 1 April 1964 and was berthed there with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974. The ship was sunk as target off Puerto Rico 13 April 1982. ==Honors== Robinson received eight battle stars for World War II service. ==In popular culture== The Robinson appeared in the movie \\"Away All Boats\\", accurately depicting the Fletcher destroyer class's antisubmarine role in the Pacific Theater by dropping live depth charges. == See also == *See USS Robinson for other ships of the same name. == References == * == External links == * navsource.org: USS Robinson * hazegray.org: USS Robinson Category:Ships built in Seattle Category:1943 ships Category:Fletcher-class destroyers of the United States Navy Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Maritime incidents in 1982 ","title":"USS Robinson (DD-562)"},{"id":"2571294","text":"Closely Watched Trains () is a 1966 Czechoslovak film directed by Jiří Menzel and is one of the best-known products of the Czechoslovak New Wave. It was released in the United Kingdom as Closely Observed Trains. It is a coming-of- age story about a young man working at a train station in German-occupied Czechoslovakia during World War II. The film is based on a 1965 novel by Bohumil Hrabal. It was produced by Barrandov Studios and filmed on location in Central Bohemia. Released outside Czechoslovakia during 1967, it won the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 40th Academy Awards in 1968. ==Plot== The young Miloš Hrma, who speaks with misplaced pride of his family of misfits and malingerers, is engaged as a newly trained station guard in a small railway station during the Second World War and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He admires himself in his new uniform, and looks forward, like his prematurely retired railwayman father, to avoiding real work. The sometimes pompous stationmaster is an enthusiastic pigeon-breeder with a kind wife, but is envious of the train dispatcher Hubička's success with women. Miloš holds an as-yet platonic love for the pretty, young conductor Máša. The experienced Hubička presses for details of their relationship and realizes that Miloš is still a virgin. The idyll of the railway station is periodically disturbed by the arrival of the councillor, Zedníček, a Nazi collaborator, who spouts propaganda at the staff without success. At her initiative, Máša spends the night with Miloš, but in his youthful excitability he ejaculates prematurely before achieving penetration and then is unable to perform sexually; and the next day, despairing, he attempts suicide. He is saved, and a young doctor explains to him that ejaculatio praecox is normal at Miloš's age. The doctor recommends Miloš to \\"think of something else\\" (at which point Miloš volunteers an interest in football), and to seek the assistance of an experienced woman. During the nightshift, Hubička flirts with the young telegraphist, Zdenička, and imprints her thighs and buttocks with the office's rubber stamps. Her mother sees the stamps and complains to Hubička's superiors, and the ensuing scandal helps to frustrate the stationmaster's ambition of being promoted to inspector. The Germans and their collaborators are on edge, since their trains are being attacked by the partisans. A glamorous Resistance agent (a circus artist in peacetime), code-named Viktoria Freie, delivers a time bomb to Hubička for use in blowing up a large ammunition train. At Hubička's request, the \\"experienced\\" Viktoria also helps Miloš to resolve his sexual problem. The next day, at the crucial moment when the ammunition train is approaching, Hubička is caught up in a farcical disciplinary hearing, overseen by Zedníček, over his rubber-stamping of Zdenička's backside. In Hubička's place, Miloš, liberated by his experience with Viktoria from his former passivity, takes the time bomb and drops it from a semaphore gantry, that extends transversely above the tracks, onto the train. A machine-gunner on the train, spotting Miloš, sprays him with bullets, and his body falls onto the train. With the Nazi collaborator Zedníček winding up the disciplinary hearing, dismissing the Czech people as \\"nothing but laughing hyenas\\" (a phrase actually employed by the senior Nazi official Reinhard HeydrichHames, Peter. The Czechoslovak New Wave. Second Edition, 2005, London and New York, Wallflower Press.), the implicit retort to his jibe comes in the form of a huge series of explosions that destroys the train. Now Hubička and the other railwaymen are indeed laughing — to express their joy at the blow to the Nazi occupiers — and it is left to a wistful Máša to pick up Miloš's uniform cap, hurled across the station by the power of the blast. ==Cast== Loděnice where the film was shot * Václav Neckář as Miloš Hrma * Vlastimil Brodský as councilor Zedníček * Jitka Bendová as conductor Máša * Josef Somr as train dispatcher Hubička * Libuše Havelková as stationmaster's wife * Vladimír Valenta as stationmaster * Jitka Zelenohorská as telegraphist Zdenička * Naďa Urbánková as Viktoria Freie * Jiří Menzel as Doctor Brabec ==Production== The film is based on a 1965 novel of the same name by the noted Czech author Bohumil Hrabal, whose work Jiří Menzel had already begun to adapt in 1965 in the short The Death of Mr. Balthazar, a segment from the anthology film of Hrabal stories Pearls from the Deep. Barrandov Studios first offered the film project to the more experienced directors Evald Schorm and Vera Chytilova, neither of whom saw a way to adapt the book to film,Hames. before offering it to Menzel as his feature-film debut. Menzel and Hrabal worked together closely on the script, making a number of modifications to the novel. Menzel's first choice for the lead role of Miloš was Vladimír Pucholt, who however was occupied filming Jiří Krejčík's Svatba jako řemen. At one point Menzel considered playing the role himself, but concluded that at almost 28 he was too old. Fifteen non-professional actors were tested, before the wife of Ladislav Fikar (a poet and publisher) came up with the suggestion of the pop singer Václav Neckář. Menzel has related that he himself took on the cameo role of the doctor only at the last minute after the actor originally cast failed to show up for shooting. Filming began in late February and lasted until the end of April 1966. Locations were used in and around the station building in Loděnice. The association between Menzel and Hrabal was to continue. They collaborated on the script of the long-banned film Larks on a String, filmed in 1969 but not released until 1990. ==Reception== The film premiered in Czechoslovakia on 18 November 1966. Release outside Czechoslovakia took place in the following year. ===Critical response=== Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called Closely Watched Trains \\"as expert and moving in its way as was Jan Kadár's and Elmar Klos's The Shop on Main Street or Milos Forman's Loves of a Blonde,\\" two roughly contemporary films from Czechoslovakia. Crowther wrote: > What it appears Mr. Menzel is aiming at all through his film is just a > wonderfully sly, sardonic picture of the embarrassments of a youth coming of > age in a peculiarly innocent yet worldly provincial environment. ... The > charm of his film is in the quietness and slyness of his earthy comedy, the > wonderful finesse of understatements, the wise and humorous understanding of > primal sex. And it is in the brilliance with which he counterpoints the > casual affairs of his country characters with the realness, the urgency and > significance of those passing trains. Varietys reviewer wrote: > The 28-year-old Jiri Menzel registers a remarkable directorial debut. His > sense for witty situations is as impressive as his adroit handling of the > players. A special word of praise must go to Bohumil Hrabal, the creator of > the literary original; the many amusing gags and imaginative situations are > primarily his. The cast is composed of wonderful types down the line. In his study of the Czechoslovak New Wave, Peter Hames places the film in a broader context, connecting it inter alia to the most famous anti-hero of Czech literature, Jaroslav Hašek's The Good Soldier Švejk, a fictional World War 1 soldier whose artful evasion of duty and undermining of authority are sometimes held to epitomize characteristic Czech qualities: > In its attitudes, if not its form, Closely Observed Trains is the Czech film > that comes closest to the humour and satire of The Good Soldier Švejk, not > least because it is prepared to include the reality of the war as a > necessary aspect of its comic vision. The attack on ideological dogmatism, > bureaucracy and anachronistic moral values undoubtedly strikes wider targets > than the period of Nazi Occupation. However, it would be wrong to reduce the > film to a coded reflection on contemporary Czech society: the attitudes and > ideas derive from the same conditions that originally inspired Hašek. > Insofar as these conditions recur, under the Nazi Occupation or elsewhere, > the response will be the same. ==Awards and honors== The film won several international awards: * The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, awarded in 1968 for films released in 1967\\"Closely Watched Trains\\" Wins Foreign Language Film: 1968 Oscars * The Grand Prize at the 1966 Mannheim-Heidelberg International Filmfestival * A nomination for the 1968 BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Best Soundtrack * A nomination for the 1968 DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures * A nomination for the 1967 Golden Globe for Best Foreign- Language Foreign Film ==See also== * Czechoslovak New Wave * List of submissions to the 40th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Czechoslovakia submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Hames, Peter.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 29 May 1984. ==Plot== The episode begins with a man playing chess against Death. After losing to the man, Death declares \\"Bollocks to this!\\" and attacks the man with his scythe. The horror movie-themed opening credits are followed by Mike, Rick, Vyvyan and Neil carrying a coffin through a local cemetery (except Mike, who has his hand up but is not touching the coffin). The coffin is brought to a freshly-dug grave where a passing woman asks a spade-holding Neil if he digs graves, to which Neil replies, \\"Yeah, they're all right.\\" After encountering a drunken vicar and two gravediggers, the episode then takes a flashback to events leading up to the burial. It is bath night, and while Neil jumps into the muddy bathwater used in the three others' previous baths (inadvertently finding his long-lost bicycle in the process), Rick locks himself in his room and gets on his bed for a sneaky read of Cosmopolitan - only to nearly get cut in half by Vyvyan's cleverly placed circular saw. Mike and Vyvyan spend the time trying to set up the new video recorder they have secured, in order to watch a video nasty. A scene-stealing postman then arrives to deliver a human-shaped package from the Transvaal. After falling out of the bathroom window and having his bedroom boarded up, Neil arrives downstairs wearing a dress he found in Rick's room (with Rick's name tagged in the back). Neil briefly gets the video machine to work by plugging it - but suffers a sustained electric shock in the process - and the group is shown a commercial for a women's pain reliever set in Hell. After the video stops working once again, the package delivered earlier has opened. This turns out to be a vampire, who claims he is really just a driving instructor from Johannesburg. The vampire chases the boys, but stops to use the toilet. Locked in the toilet, the vampire's driving instructor ruse fails when he incorrectly answers Vyvyan's Highway Code question about what to do when crossing a humpback bridge. When the four realise that vampires only attack virgins, it leads to them all unconvincingly denying their sexual purity. But when the vampire returns downstairs, he is hit by sunlight streaming through the window (as he still has his wristwatch set to South African time) - and he is placed inside a dual-purpose sofa-coffin. The scene flash-forwards back to the graveyard, where Mike realises it is half-past nine. The vampire then comes out from the coffin and reveals himself to be Harry the Bastard, an employee from Rumbelows from whom they rented the video machine. Harry announces that their deadline for returning the machine has just elapsed and they now owe him £500 in late fees. As the closing line of the episode, the entire gang at the grave site turn to the camera and say, \\"Well, what a complete bastard!\\" The closing credits play over Death and the man from the chess match (who is now a ghost) arguing at a golf hole. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). Alexei Sayle starred as the South African vampire-slash-driving instructor. Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones makes a cameo as a drunken vicar and comedy duo Hale & Pace appear as a pair of gravediggers that the lads tell their story to. Arnold Brown appears as the man in the opening scene playing chess against Death. Dawn French and Helen Atkinson-Wood appear in the pain reliever commercial set in Hell. ==Cultural references== The opening scene of a man playing chess with Death is a homage to the best known scene in Ingmar Bergman's film, The Seventh Seal (1957). At the grave site when the vicar says ’Ashes to ashes’, Rick responds with ‘Funk to funky, we all know Major Tom's a junkie’, referencing lyrics from the David Bowie song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\". Later in the episode, Rick proclaims to Neil that the bathroom is free ‘unlike the country’ and refers to Britain as a ‘Thatcherite Junta’. Rick also appears to gain sexual gratification from looking at a copy of Cosmopolitan. Alexei Sayle's character - in a monologue about being a Marxist comedian - complains that while his comrades are selling the Socialist Worker, he has to sell the TV Times. Sayle continues his monologue to reassure his comrades that he has not ‘sold out’, then proceeds to do an advertisement for Pot Noodle. The episode also features punk band The Damned, performing Nasty, a song written especially for the episode. After being told to shut up by Vyvyan, the postman responds, \\"Little squirt! Does one advert, and he thinks he's Dustin Hoffman!\\" This is a reference to Adrian Edmondson appearing as a Vyvyan-like character in a commercial for National Westminster Bank at about this time. ==References== * Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1984 British television episodes Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Nasty (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2571311","text":"{ } USS Melvin (DD-680), a Fletcher-class destroyer, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Lieutenant, junior grade John T. Melvin (1887–1917). Melvin was laid down on 6 July 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, in Kearny, N.J.; launched on 17 October 1943, sponsored by Miss Gertrude C. Bailey, grandniece of Lieutenant Melvin; and commissioned on 24 November 1943, with Commander Warner R. Edsall in command. ==Service history== ===1944=== Following shakedown off Bermuda, Melvin sailed for the Pacific on 1 February 1944. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 4 March, she got underway for Majuro five days later and for the next month conducted antisubmarine patrols and participated in the blockade of enemy-held atolls in the Marshall Islands, returning to Pearl Harbor on 2 May. There, she underwent intensive fire support training and 31 May departed with Task Group 52.17 (TG 52.17) for Saipan. Approaching that island on the night of 13/14 June, she sank . A few hours later, while steaming off northern Saipan, she again attacked an enemy vessel, this time a merchantman, which burned brightly for a few hours before sinking. For the next 23 days, she provided counter-battery fire, conducted antisubmarine patrols, damaging an enemy submarine on the 17th, served as call fire ship for Marines on the beach, escorted ships from Eniwetok, and participated in the bombardment of Tinian. On 8 July, Melvin sailed for Eniwetok, where on the 18th, she sailed in the screen of the transports carrying troops to Guam, off the coast of which she screened transports and oilers from 22 July to 7 August. After preparations at Guadalcanal, from 8–21 September she took part in the capture and occupation of the southern Palau Islands, then joined TG 33.19 for the unopposed occupation of Ulithi. After escorting LSTs to Hollandia, she arrived at Manus Island to stage for the invasion of Leyte, Philippines. Now with TG 79.11, Melvin sailed on 11 October toward the Philippines in the screen of the landing craft to be used in the assault on Dulag. Soon after midnight on 20 October, she entered Leyte Gulf and took up her assigned screening station between Dinagat and Hibuson Islands, carrying out similar screening patrols for the next 4 days. In the early hours of the 25th, she joined in the torpedo attack by Destroyer Squadron 54 (DesRon 54), which opened the Battle of Surigao Strait. Assigned with and to the Eastern Attack Group, Melvin began launching torpedoes soon after 0300, scoring hits on , which reportedly exploded and eventually sank at about 0338. (Other reports, including from a survivor of the Fusō Battle of Surigao Strait, report rolling and sinking in about 40 minutes. Large fires from spilled crude burned on the surface). Following their attack, the destroyers retired up the Dinagat coast to Hibuson, from where they witnessed the deadly barrage from Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's battle line. ===1945=== Within 48 hours, Melvin was en route to Hollandia, and escorting resupply convoys to the Philippines into December, when she returned to the Solomon Islands to rehearse for the assault on Luzon. She stood out of Purvis Bay, Florida Island on 25 December, escorting transports to Manus and then on to Lingayen Gulf. She arrived with her charges on 11 January 1945, and provided illumination and fire support as well as screening services. Continuing to cover the landings until the 15th, she met Japanese kamikazes, as swimmers, in boats, and in planes, with equal determination. From Luzon, Melvin sailed south to Leyte, then to the Carolines and a new assignment, screening the Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38/58). Steaming north with that force on 10 February, Melvin guarded the flattops as their planes raided Honshū and then provided direct air cover for the Iwo Jima campaign. On the 21st, she aided in her fight against fires and enemy planes, splashing three, and then escorted her to Eniwetok for repairs. By mid-March, she had rejoined the fast carriers at Ulithi, sailing northwest with them on the 14th to prepare the way for the Okinawa campaign. For the next 61 days, Melvin remained at sea, guarding the carriers, providing fire support for the troops embattled after 1 April, and patrolling on picket station. After a brief respite at Ulithi in mid-May, she returned to the Ryukyu Islands on the 24th for raids on enemy installations in those islands and on Kyūshū. Mid-June brought another brief respite from the war while the destroyer was docked in San Pedro Bay. She was underway again on 1 July as the carriers steamed north for their last deployment against Japan. In the next month and a half, the force operated off the enemy's homeland, shelling and bombing industrial and military centers on Honshū and Hokkaidō. Melvin remained with the aircraft carriers until 10 August, when she sailed north to join TF 92 in an anti-shipping sweep and bombardment of Paramushiro. With that mission completed on the 12th, she sailed east to Adak, Alaska, where she received word of the Japanese surrender, and new orders to return to Japan for occupation duty with minesweepers off northern Honshū. On 12 October, she departed for the United States, arriving at San Francisco on 4 November. At San Diego on 31 May 1946, she was decommissioned and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet. ===1951-1954=== Melvin recommissioned on 26 February 1951 and sailed on 1 June for Newport, R.I. to join the Atlantic Fleet's DesRon 24 and bolster the 2nd and 6th Fleets so that they could spare destroyers for the U.N. effort in South Korea. For 2½ years, she cruised off the US east coast and in the Caribbean Sea, deploying to the Mediterranean Sea from 22 April to 8 October 1952 and 22 April to 6 June 1953. On 13 January 1954, she again decommissioned and joined the Reserve Fleet at Charleston, South Carolina. She remained berthed there until 1960, when she was reassigned to the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Melvin was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1974. She was sold on 14 August 1975 and broken up for scrap. ==Awards== Melvin received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

Both parts of the single were later included on James Brown's 1968 album A Soulful Christmas and on his 1969 album sharing the title of the song. The song became an unofficial anthem of the Black Power movement. \\"Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud\\" was Brown's first recording to feature trombonist Fred Wesley. ==Lyrics== In the song, Brown addresses the prejudice towards blacks in America, and the need for black empowerment. He proclaims that \\"we demands a chance to do things for ourself/we're tired of beating our head against the wall/and workin' for someone else\\". The song's call-and-response chorus is performed by a group of young children, who respond to Brown's command of \\"Say it loud\\" with \\"I'm black and I'm proud!\\" The song was recorded in a Los Angeles area suburb with about 30 young people from the Watts and Compton areas. The lyrics \\"We've been 'buked and we've been scorned/We've been treated bad, talked about as sure as you're born\\" in the first verse of the song paraphrase the spiritual \\"I've Been 'Buked\\". Several other Brown singles from the same era as \\"Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud\\", notably \\"I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself)\\", explored similar themes of black empowerment and self- reliance. The song's opening exhortation, \\"With your bad self\\", is an example of linguistic reappropriation, and added a new entry to Brown's long list of nicknames: \\"His Bad Self.\\" ==Recognitions== The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included \\"Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud\\" in their 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2004 it was ranked number 305 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. It inspired the title of a VH1 television special and box set, Say It Loud! A Celebration of Black Music in America. \\"'Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud' was a record that really convinced me to say I was black instead of a negro,\\" remarked Public Enemy's Chuck D. \\"Back then black folks were called negroes, but James said you can say it loud: that being black is a great thing instead of something you have to apologise for.\\"Mojo, March 2002 However in direct response to the song's message, Willie Cobbs wryly observed that Brown was a millionaire by that point, as Cobbs retort was \\"Sing It Low - I'm Black and I'm Poor\\". ==Personnel== * James Brown – lead vocal * Unknown children's chorusLeeds, Alan, and Harry Weinger (1991). \\"Star Time: Song by Song\\".

In May 1231 Frederick II's son Henry, King of Germany, issued the grant under pressure from the German secular princes during his rebellion against his father. The terms were very similar to those conceded to the ecclesiastical princes or bishops in the Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis at the time of the Henry's coronation (in 1220), conferring similar rights. Frederick II confirmed the grant in May 1232. In this law, the Emperor relinquished a number of important Royal rights (\\"Regalia\\") to the secular princes. Among other things, they received the rights to mint coins and levy tolls in the German part of the Holy Roman Empire. In particular, however, Frederick granted them the right of approval over any legislation proposed in future by the Emperor. The decreeing of this law together with the previous Confoederatio made the power and influence of the territorial princes in relation to the Empire and the towns extraordinarily great. Frederick's aim was to leave his Empire north of the Alps secure under the direct rule of the princes, allowing him to concentrate his efforts on the southern part of the Empire. This rule of the land by the princes was nevertheless secured at the expense of the centralised power of the monarchy. == External links == * Version of 1231: Edition in MGH, Constitutiones II, pp. 418–20 *Version of 1232: Edition in MGH, Constitutiones II, pp. 211–13 ==Sources== *Zippelius, Reinhold.

In her autobiography she described him as being refined, soft-spoken, and a sensitive young man, not hardened by politics although he too then belonged to the left circle.\\" Hede Massing, This Deception: KBG Targets America (1951) page 37 Julian Gumperz was an assistant at the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung) at Frankfurt am Main in Germany, one of the lesser known communist proponents of the Frankfurt School. His work there focused on economics. Gumperz married Hede Eisler (born Hedwig Thune, later Hede Massing) in 1927, but the marriage did not last. In the summer of 1922, he attended the Institute's \\"Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche\\" (First Marxist Week) in Ilmenau, Thuringia. Among the participants at the week-long session were Georg Lukács, Karl Korsch, Richard Sorge, Friedrich Pollock, Karl August Wittfogel, Bela Fogarasi, Karl Schmuckle, and Konstantin Zetkin, the younger of the two sons of socialist leader and feminist Clara Zetkin. In 1933, due to political persecution in Germany, the institute sent Gumperz to the U.S. to explore the situation. Gumperz had been a student of Pollock’s since 1929 and a Communist Party member, but he gave it all up and became a stockbroker. He worked as a publicist and translator and later wrote an anti-communist book. Gumperz returned to Germany with a favorable report, assuring Max Horkheimer and the others that the Institute’s endowment, which still brought in about $30,000 a year, would be enough to guarantee survival in depression era America. == Publicist == For a time, Gumperz was the editor of the Communist newspaper Die Rote Fahne. In 1919 Gumperz and Karl Otten founded the Berlin monthly publication Der Gegner (\\"The Opponent\\"). It was published between April 1919 and 1922 by Gumperz with Wieland Herzfelde. One of a series of small German periodicals published in Berlin following World War I (Jedermann sein eigner Fussball, Die Pleite and Der Blutige Ernst), which followed on the heels of the German review Der Dada. Frequent banning orders compelled a constant change of title. With art by George Grosz, Der Gegner decried an art with no relevance to the working class and which ignored revolutionary action. The communist uprising in Berlin in 1918, crushed by the government, had given rise to these satirical, radical, and political reviews. In 1947, he and Karl Volk co-authored a book, Pattern for World Revolution, writing under the pseudonym \\"Ypsilon\\".Mario Kessler, See footnote 163 Ossip K.

Seaman. The film is loosely based on the 1950 British film of the same name by J. B. Priestley. The film stars Queen Latifah as Georgia, a humble department store assistant who is told that she has a rare brain condition and only has a few weeks to live. She promptly decides to spend her remaining funds on a luxury holiday in Europe before she dies. Price and Seaman wanted John Candy for the main role but, after Candy's death, Latifah's agent suggested a new version starring her. Produced by Robert Zemeckis' ImageMovers, the film was released by Paramount Pictures on January 13, 2006. The film was a box-office bomb, having grossed $43.3 million against a budget of $45 million and received mixed reviews from critics, though Latifah's performance was universally praised for her charm and humor. ==Plot== The film begins during the Christmas holiday season with Georgia Byrd, an employee in the cookware department at Kragen's Department Store in New Orleans. Georgia is a shy, unassuming woman who longs to cook professionally, and who records her dreams of a better life in a scrapbook labeled \\"Possibilities\\". While flirting with a co-worker named Sean Williams, Georgia bumps her head on a kitchen cabinet door and is taken to the store's health center for a CAT scan. There, she is told by company physician Dr. Gupta that she has several brain tumors resulting from a rare neurological disorder called Lampington's disease. Since her HMO plan will not cover the exorbitant cost of an operation, Georgia resigns herself to the fact she has only a few weeks to live, quits her job, liquidates her assets and sets off on a dream vacation at the deluxe Grandhotel Pupp in the spa city of Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic. Free of inhibitions and determined to live life to the fullest, Georgia checks into the Presidential Suite, buys a designer wardrobe in expensive boutiques, makes extensive use of the hotel's spa facilities, attempts snowboarding and BASE jumping off a dam, enjoys succulent meals prepared by world-renowned Chef Didier, and wins a small fortune playing roulette in the casino. Georgia impresses the hotel's staff, with the exception of cantankerous guest services manager Miss Gunther, with her naive manner and forthright kindness, and mingles with some of the other guests, including Matthew Kragen, a self-help guru and coincidentally the owner of the store where she works; his assistant/mistress Ms. Burns; pandering Senator Dillings from her home state of Louisiana; and prominent Congressman Stewart. Kragen is skeptical about Georgia's origins and suspects her of trying to sabotage his business, but the rest are charmed by her free spirit. When Kragen bribes Miss Gunther to dig up information about Georgia's background, she goes through her hotel suite and finds a letter Georgia has written providing instructions for the disposal of her remains after her death. Miss Gunther is moved by the letter and realizes Georgia's self-confidence and sunny optimism have touched everyone who has met her since her arrival. She confesses to Georgia she snooped through her belongings and found the letter and urges her to return home and spend her last days with those she loves. Georgia takes Miss Gunther's advice and heads for the airport, only to discover an avalanche has blocked the road. Unbeknownst to her, Sean—having learned of Georgia's diagnosis and ready to acknowledge his feelings for her—is in a taxi on the other side of the snowdrift, trying to reach her at the hotel. Georgia returns to the hotel, and Sean leaves his taxi behind and begins to hike across the snow on foot. At a New Year's Eve party that evening, Kragen exposes Georgia as a low-level saleswoman in one of his stores. Georgia tells them that Kragen is right and reveals that she is going to die. Kragen's colleagues, disgusted by his insensitivity, embrace her and abandon him. Dejected and embarrassed, Kragen goes to an upper floor of the hotel and sits on the ledge, contemplating ending his life. Georgia tries to persuade him to come down, suggesting if he were nicer and less driven and greedy, he would be a happier person. Sean arrives at the hotel just in time and joins Georgia and Kragen on the ledge. In the lobby, Miss Gunther finds a fax from Dr. Gupta, in which he tells Georgia she was misdiagnosed due to X-rays generated by a broken, outdated CAT scanner. Miss Gunther rushes up to the ledge to announce the good news. Georgia and Sean return to New Orleans where they later get married and open a restaurant, which is visited by Chef Didier and Georgia's long-time inspiration Emeril Lagasse. An epilogue sequence shows that Georgia changed her Book of Possibilities into the Book of Realities, and her friends all lived better lives; Ms. Burns went to business school and opened a spa, Ms. Gunther opened a detective agency, and Dr. Gupta and Matthew Kragen joined a spiritual retreat after Gupta quit his job and Kragen's ex-wife won a large settlement in their divorce leaving him broke. ==Cast== * Queen Latifah as Georgia Byrd * LL Cool J as Sean Williams * Timothy Hutton as Matthew Kragen * Giancarlo Esposito as Senator Dillings * Alicia Witt as Ms. Burns * Gérard Depardieu as Chef Didier * Jane Adams as Rochelle * Susan Kellermann as Ms. Gunther * Ranjit Chowdhry as Dr. Gupta * Michael Nouri as Congressman Stewart * Jascha Washington as Darius * Matt Ross as Mr. Adamian * Emeril Lagasse as Himself * Smokey Robinson as Himself ==Production== In the original 1950 film, the leading character of George Bird was played by Alec Guinness. Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman updated the story for John Candy, with Carl Reiner directing, but the project was shelved after the actor's death in 1994. Years later, Queen Latifah's agent read their script and suggested they revise it for her. The gourmet cuisine seen throughout the film was prepared by chefs from the Food Network, and recipes for many of the dishes, including Lobster Salad in Potato Leek Nests, Duck Hash on Toasted Baguette, Spiced Lamb Shanks with Blood Orange Relish, Roasted Quail with Brioche and Chorizo Stuffing, Risotto Barolo with Roasted Vegetables, Bananas Foster and Poulet Tchoupitoulas, were available on the network's website. In one scene, Georgia watches footage from Emeril Live to help her prepare a chicken. As part of the film's promotion, Queen Latifah appeared as a guest on Lagasse's show. The film opened on 2,514 screens in the US, earning $12,806,188 and ranking number two in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $38,399,961 in the US and $4,943,287 in foreign markets for a worldwide box office total of $43,343,248. ==Reception== Queen Latifah was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture. The aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 56% based on 120 reviews, and an average rating of 5.78/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Although Queen Latifah's bountiful life-affirming spirit permeates the film, director Wayne Wang is unable to revive this remake with any real flair.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film \\"takes advantage of the great good nature and warmth of Queen Latifah, and uses it to transform a creaky old formula into a comedy that is just plain lovable. To describe the plot is to miss the point, because this plot could have been made into countless movies not as funny and charming as this one ... All depends on the Queen, who has been known to go over the top on occasion, but in this film finds all the right notes and dances to them delightfully. It is good to attend to important cinema like Syriana and Munich, but on occasion we must be open to movies that have more modest ambitions: They only want to amuse us, warm us, and make us feel good. Last Holiday plays like a hug.\\" Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle stated, \\"Latifah's latest vehicle inexorably marches toward an ending you can see coming from the first reel ... This harmless bit of fluff lacks the element of surprise but is not without random charming moments supplied by its incandescent star.\\" Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film three out of four stars and described Queen Latifah as \\"soft, bold and very funny, infusing this otherwise predictable movie with a contagious charm.\\" She added, \\"While this is not exactly a profound film, and the message is hardly new, it's testament to this movie's joyous energy that it doesn't matter in the least. We may know exactly where we're going, but the journey is so much fun, all but the most peevish audience members will find it impossible to complain.\\" Janet K. Keeler of the St. Petersburg Times graded the film B- and commented, \\"Strong performances by Latifah, LL Cool J and Depardieu, who is strangely but perfectly cast, save Last Holiday from irrelevance. Latifah is more than the funny girl with attitude we've seen in Bringing Down the House, Taxi and Beauty Shop. She's got the goods to play the leading lady, and a sexy one at that. Latifah's performance here isn't as good as her Oscar-nominated turn in Chicago, but it shows off more range and a subtler touch than subsequent movies.\\" ==References* Category:2006 films Category:2000s Christmas comedy-drama films Category:2006 romantic comedy-drama films Category:African-American comedy films Category:African-American drama films Category:African-American romance films Category:American Christmas comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American remakes of British films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:Films about death Category:Films about vacationing Category:Films directed by Wayne Wang Category:Films produced by Laurence Mark Category:Films scored by George Fenton Category:Films set in department stores Category:Films set in hotels Category:Films set in New Orleans Category:Films set in the Czech Republic Category:Films shot in Austria Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Price and Peter S.

He was educated in private schools. “Born in Montreal in 1859, Peuchen what is the son of German immigrant parents. His father has been a railroad contractor in South America and his grandfather had managed the London, Brighton and Midland Railway. In 1871 he moved to Toronto....” from Titanic, the Canadian Story by Alan Hustak (1998). In 1888, he entered military life and became a lieutenant of The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. Peuchen moved up the ranks, and in 1911, was marshalling officer at the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary. In 1897, Peuchen perfected plans for extracting useful chemicals from coarse hardwoods and waste woods, the principal products being acetic acid, acetate of lime, acetone, methanol, and formaldehyde. The acids were used by dyeing industries, formaldehyde was used by wheat growers in Canada, and acetone was used to manufacture high explosives like cordite. Peuchen subsequently became president of Standard Chemical, Iron & Lumber Company of Canada, Ltd. The company had many plants and facilities in Canada, as well as refineries located in Canada (Montreal), France, (Germany), and the UK (London). Because some company facilities were located abroad, Peuchen often traveled to Europe by ship. Peuchen owned a yacht named Vreda which crossed the Atlantic under its own canvas. For a time, he was Vice-Commodore and Rear-Commodore of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. ==Titanic== Peuchen boarded Titanic at Southampton, on April 10, 1912, as a first-class passenger on his 40th transatlantic voyage. He reportedly was concerned that Captain Smith was in command, because he thought Smith was a poor commander and too old. On the night Titanic sank, one of the lifeboat ropes got tangled and almost fell onto another lifeboat, Captain Smith and Second Officer Lightoller asked if anyone knew anything about seamanship, Peuchen stepped forward saying he was a yachtsman. He climbed down the rope and untied it and fell into Lifeboat No. 6. Peuchen was the only male passenger that Lightoller would allow into a lifeboat that night. He later claimed he did not realize Titanic was doomed until he viewed the ship from the lifeboat. Because Peuchen was a military officer, he came under scrutiny for allowing Hichens to prevent the boat's occupants from going back for survivors and for tolerating the verbal abuse Hichens reportedly gave. Peuchen was also criticized for exaggerating his own role and for not recognizing the pivotal role Margaret (Mrs J J) Brown played in leading the lifeboat's occupants in rowing and in raising morale. It is possible that Peuchen, as a yachtsman, may have thought that second-guessing an officer in charge would encourage mutiny. Peuchen publicly blasted Captain Smith and the crew of Titanic, criticizing their seamanship as substandard; however, his official testimony at the United States Senate inquiry into the disaster was tempered somewhat from interviews he gave in the days after the rescue. In 1987, Peuchen's wallet was recovered from the area around the remains of Titanic; streetcar tickets, a traveler's cheque, and his calling card were found inside. ==Later years== In Toronto, Peuchen was deemed a coward, largely because of his self-serving attitude, and speculation gathered that his expected promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel in The Queen's Own Rifles would not be awarded. Despite the publicity, the promotion was made on May 21, 1912; he also received the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. When World War I began, Peuchen retired from Standard Chemical to command the Home Battalion of the Queen's Own Rifles. In later years Peuchen's social standing in Canadian society had slipped greatly, as a man who survived both the sinking of Titanic and World War I. He made bad investments and lost much of his finances during the 1920s. He died in Toronto on December 7, 1929 in his 71st year. His body was buried in Toronto's Mount Pleasant cemetery. ==Portrayals== *Robert Ayres in A Night to Remember (1958 film) ==References== ==External links== *Middletown, Jesse Edgar.

Written by Brown and Johnny Terry, with music arrangement by Belford \\"Sinky\\" Hendricks, and released as a single on Federal Records in 1956, it reached No. 6 on the R&B; charts. The group's debut recording and first chart hit, it has come to be recognized as their signature song. ==Background== In 1952, James Brown was released from a youth detention center in Toccoa, Georgia after Bobby Byrd and his family sponsored him. Brown's warden agreed to the release on the condition that Brown not return to Augusta. After his release, Brown briefly pursued a career in sports before starting his musical career as a gospel vocalist with the group the Ever-Ready Gospel Singers. When a member of Bobby Byrd's vocal group, the Avons, died in 1954, Byrd asked Brown to join his group. A year later, after performing as the Five Royals, they became the Flames, playing all over Georgia and South Carolina. According to Etta James, Brown and his group came up with the idea for their first song, because Brown \\"used to carry around an old tattered napkin with him, because Little Richard had written the words, 'please, please, please' on it and James was determined to make a song out of it\\".Merlis, Bob; Seay, Davin; James, Etta (1997), p. foreword. Heart and Soul – A Celebration of Black Music Style in America 1930–1975. ==Reception== \\"Please, Please, Please\\" was released on March 4, 1956. Though it sold slowly at first, the record reached the top ten of the R&B; charts by late summer, eventually peaking at No. 6, selling between one and three million copies.White, Cliff (1991). Discography. In Star Time (p. 55) [CD liner notes]. London: Polydor Records. In 2011, \\"Please, Please, Please\\" was ranked No. 143 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". ==Live performances== The initial performances of the song were subpar though the group itself was received well. It took a number of years until the Flames developed a routine for the performance. Starting in 1959, Brown would perform the song to the point of feigned exhaustion, when he would drop to his knees and collapse on the stage. Meanwhile, a fellow Flame (sometimes Bobby Byrd and at other times Bobby Bennett) would drop either a blanket or big towel around Brown's back and help him offstage. Before completely exiting, Brown would rip the towel off and return to his microphone, adding to the excitement of his audience. Influenced by Little Richard and professional wrestler Gorgeous George, who both wore capes, Brown began wearing capes in his act. ==Personnel== * James Brown – lead vocal with the Flames: * Bobby Byrd – background vocals * Johnny Terry – background vocals * Sylvester Keels – background vocals * Nash Knox – background vocals * Nafloyd Scott – guitar plus: * Wilbert \\"Lee Diamond\\" Smith – tenor saxophone * Ray Felder – tenor saxophone * Lucas \\"Fats\\" Gonder – piano * Clarence Mack – bass * Edison Gore – drumsLeeds, Alan, and Harry Weinger (1991). \\"Star Time: Song by Song\\".

Brown also re-recorded the song several times later in his career. On his 1972 album Get on the Good Foot, he did an upbeat long version, which lasted over twelve minutes. 1974's Hell included a salsa version of the song that featured Brown speaking in Spanish. For Brown's 1976 album Hot, he recorded a more solemn, ballad rendition, which featured male background vocalists in the quiet storm style of Barry White's music. Ike & Tina Turner released a live version of \\"Please, Please, Please\\" as single on Kent Records, which was included on their 1964 album Ike & Tina Turner Revue Live. They also performed the song on The Big T.N.T Show in 1965. After their resurgence on the charts, Kent reissued the single in 1970. It reached No. 45 on Record World's R&B; chart.

The name is in distinction to Upper Brittany, the eastern part of Brittany, which is of a predominantly Romance culture. In colours, Lower Brittany, where the Breton language is spoken; in grey Upper Brittany, associated with the Gallo language. ==History== ===Naming=== The words \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\" in the names of Upper and Lower Brittany refer to the relative positions of the capital. In the case of Brittany, Nantes and Rennes have both been the capital of the ancient province called Brittany. Other French regions are also divided into Lower (Bas or Basse) and Upper (Haut or Haute) parts - for example Lower Normandy, Basse-Lorraine, and Bas-Poitou. However, the French word \\"bas\\" is often understood as carrying negative connotations, implying \\"inferior in status\\". The Breton name of Lower Brittany, \\"Breizh Izel\\", is used in many Breton songs sung in French of the 19th and 20th centuries, perhaps because the Breton word \\"Izel\\" has no such negative connotations. ===Line between Upper and Lower Brittany=== Having been based on linguistic areas, the dividing line corresponds very roughly to administrative borders. It had already been established by the 14th century and has changed only slightly since, hand in hand with the pushing back of the Breton language. In 1588, the historian Bertrand d'Argentré defined the border as running from the outskirts of Binic southwards down to Guérande, leaving the communes of Loudéac, Josselin, and Malestroit in Upper Brittany. In 1886, Paul Sébillot moved the frontier deeper into what had been Breton speaking territory, the line then running from Plouha to Batz-sur-Mer. Maps in the 17th century favour the latter. ==See also== *Bro Gwened (Vennetais) *Cornouaille *Culture of France *Enclos paroissial *French architecture *History of France *Religion in France ==References== ==External links== In French *Carte de 1695, présentant la limite *À la recherche de la frontière Présentation du livre de Fañch Broudic Category:Geography of Brittany Category:Breton culture Category:History of Brittany Category:Breton language ","title":"Lower Brittany"},{"id":"2571377","text":"Nello Cristianini (born 1968) is a Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol. ==Education== Cristianini holds a degree in Physics from the University of Trieste, a Master in Computational Intelligence from the University of London and a PhD from the University of Bristol.

It can be caused by physical invasion or compression by a pathological process or by thrombosis within the vein itself. It can also occur during pregnancy. Pregnancy leads to high venous pressure in the lower limbs, decreased blood return to the heart, decreased cardiac output due to obstruction of the inferior vena cava, sudden rise in venous pressure which can lead to placental separation, and a decrease in kidney function. All of these issues can arise from lying in the supine position during late pregnancy which can cause compression of the inferior vena cava by the uterus. Symptoms of late pregnancy inferior vena cava syndrome consist of intense pain in the right hand side, muscle twitching, hypotension, and fluid retention. ==Signs and symptoms== IVCS presents with a wide variety of signs and symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose clinically. *Edema of the lower extremities (peripheral edema), caused by an increase in the venous blood pressure. *Tachycardia. This is caused by the decreased preload, decreased cardiac output, and leads to increased frequency. *In pregnant women, signs of fetal hypoxia and distress may be seen in the cardiotocography. This is caused by decreased perfusion of the uterus, resulting in hypoxemia of the fetus. *Supine hypotensive syndrome ==Causes== *Obstruction by deep vein thrombosis or tumors (most commonly renal cell carcinoma) *Compression through external pressure by neighbouring structures or tumors, either by significantly compressing the vein or by promoting thrombosis by causing turbulence by disturbing the blood flow. This is quite common during the third trimester of pregnancy when the uterus compresses the vein in the right side position. *Iatrogenic causes may be suspected in patients with a medical history of liver transplantion, vascular catheters, dialysis and other invasive procedures in the vicinity *Budd-Chiari syndrome ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis can be made clinically by observing the patient when in the right sided position where you can see multiple dilated veins over abdomen due to collaterals. Ultrasound with Doppler flow measurement may be used to assess the IVC and circulatory system. ==Treatment== Treatment will vary depending on the cause of the vena cava compression or interruption. Often, treatment includes positional changes, avoidance of supine positioning, especially on the right side. In pregnancy, definitive management of the IVCS is to deliver the baby. In other conditions, medical or surgical treatment to remove or relieve the offending structure will relieve symptoms. ==Frequency== Epidemiological data is elusive owing to the wide variety of clinical presentation. In the U.S., incidence is estimated to be at 5-10 cases per 100,000 per year. Minor compression of the inferior vena cava during pregnancy is a relatively common occurrence. It is seen most commonly when women lie on their back or right side. 90% of women lying in the supine position during pregnancy experience some form of inferior vena cava syndrome; however, not all of the women display symptoms. ==References== == External links == Category:Vascular diseases Category:Paraneoplastic syndromes Category:Syndromes affecting the cardiovascular system ","title":"Inferior vena cava syndrome"},{"id":"2571392","text":"Sir William Nosworthy (18 October 1867 – 26 September 1946) was a New Zealand politician.

When Massey died in 1925, Nosworthy gained the more important role of Minister of Finance in the interim government of Francis Bell. Nosworthy contested the leadership race to succeed Massey, but was defeated by Gordon Coates. He continued to serve as Minister of Finance until the following year, when he was given the External Affairs portfolio instead (1926–1928). He held this position until his retirement from politics in 1928.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Vols 211-219 (1926-1928).

Campbell (25 December 1859 - October 24, 1914) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Conservative from 1899 to 1914, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin. Campbell was a barrister, and ran a practice in Winnipeg. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election, and lost to Liberal Peter McIntyre by 280 votes in Winnipeg North. He sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in November 1893, as a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada. Campbell stood in by-election for the riding of Winnipeg, after Hugh John Macdonald's resignation from the house. He lost to Liberal candidate Joseph Martin. Campbell was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1899 election, defeating Liberal incumbent Stewart Mulvey by 188 votes in the constituency of Morris. The Conservatives won the election, and Campbell was named as a minister without portfolio in Macdonald's government on January 10, 1900. He was promoted to Attorney General on October 9 of the same year. In this period of Canadian history, newly appointed ministers were required to resign their legislative seats to seek a new mandate from their electors. These by- elections were usually mere formalities, and many ministers were returned without opposition. Campbell faced a challenge from Liberal Matthew Laurie, and defeated him by 278 votes on October 29, 1900. This by-election occurred on the same day that Roblin replaced Macdonald as premier. The new premier kept Campbell as his Attorney General, and also appointed him as Municipal Commissioner from October 29 to December 20, 1900. Campbell was re-elected in the elections of 1903, 1907 and 1910, retaining his seat in 1907 by a single vote. He was named Minister of Education and Municipal Commissioner on October 11, 1911. He was later appointed Minister of Public Works. After Robert Rogers left the provincial legislature for federal politics, Campbell was seen as the second most important minister in Roblin's government. Campbell was stricken by a severe illness on February 15, 1913, the same day that the provincial legislature was scheduled to open. He traveled to Kingston, Jamaica to recover, but was afflicted with paralysis almost immediately after arriving. He resigned his ministry on November 3, 1913, and did not stand in the 1914 election. After unsuccessfully seeking medical care in the United States of America, Europe and Egypt, Campbell returned to Manitoba in summer 1914. He died shortly thereafter, at age 54. ==References== * Manitoba Historical Society biography * My Dear Campbell, article by W.

He was a member of the Democratic Party who served as U.S. Senator from Delaware. ==Early life and family== Hughes was born in Kent County, Delaware, near Felton, the son of Rebecca (Hurd) and Ebenezer Hughes. He attended the Collegiate Institute in Dover, taught school for a few years, studied law, and was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1890. Along with his law practice, he was engaged in agricultural pursuits and banking. ==Political career== Hughes served as the Delaware Secretary of State from 1897 until 1901. He ran for governor of Delaware in 1916 but was defeated by Republican John G. Townsend, Jr., a businessman from Selbyville, Delaware. Twenty years later, in 1936 he was elected to the U. S. Senate, defeating incumbent Republican U. S. Senator Daniel O. Hastings. During this term, he served with the Democratic majority in the 75th, 76th, and 77th Congress. Hughes lost his bid for a second term in 1942, losing the Democratic Party nomination to E. Ennalls Berl. In all, he served from January 3, 1937, until January 2, 1943, during the administration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After completing his term in the Senate, he returned to the practice of law. All the while, from 1905 until his death, he was a director of the Farmers' Bank of Delaware. ==Death and legacy== Hughes was married to Caroline Taylor. Their great-granddaughter is actress Perrey Reeves. Hughes died at Lewes and is buried in the Lakeside Methodist Episcopal Cemetery at Dover. His home, Wheel of Fortune, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==Almanac== Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 5 June 1984. ==Plot== The episode begins with opening credits and setting which parodies the popular American soap opera Dallas. As a greedy owner of a fictional Texas oil company, Neil signs over oil wells and gives away billions of dollars to the entire public. This philanthropy initially disappoints Rick, who portrays an American client, but he later concurs with Neil's altruism. Meanwhile, Neil is woken from this beautiful dream by Vyvyan, who angrily yells to the Sunday bellringers outside to be quiet. Rick wakes up next to a young, but unknown woman, fully clothed. His initial shock and confusion is tempered by his realisation that he can boast about a sexual conquest to the others. His housemates are doubtful. Vyvyan is repulsed by the notion of a woman fancying Rick and is also jealous. Neil wants details, which Rick barely manages to make up. Mike is offended as he's \\"supposed to be the one who gets the girls\\". Mike attempts to seduce the girl in question, who calls herself Helen Mucus. When she reveals that she merely fell sleep in an empty bed, the others turn on Rick, with Vyvyan accusing him of still being a virgin, sparking hefty denials from Rick. This argument escalates into an increasingly violent confrontation between Vyvyan and Rick, which spreads around the house. Meanwhile, the radio reveals Helen is an escaped murderess, so she plans to kill the four, beginning with Mike. He mistakes her violence as rough foreplay. The appearance of a medieval knight sends the front door crashing on top of Helen. This confuses the quartet, who soon discover the house has gone through a time warp. Neil is concussed and kidnapped, along with Helen, by the knight who offers them as maidens to some Middle Ages hut-keepers. Having been thrown off the knight's horse, Neil regains consciousness and starts a conversation with the villagers, but their hut blows up from a howitzer, poorly aimed by Vyvyan at Rick. Neil is chased back to the house after being accused of sorcery, and, with Rick promising to have a T-shirt confirming his virginity printed, the four quickly check the television to see if programming has been altered by their time loop. They watch a fictional programme Medieval Torture Hour. Rick, Neil, and Mike panic about the time warp, asking what they are going to do, to which Vyvyan responds: \\"Oh, who cares?\\", which begins when the closing credit roll. During the credits, the boys settle down to a game of cards, while around them, all of the episode's characters enter the house. As a stinger, Neil gets hit on the head with a giant bone by one of the peasants, which only seems to annoy Neil. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). Alexei Sayle starred as a medieval jester and a cheese shop customer. Jennifer Saunders plays the murderess Helen Mucus, while Helen Lederer plays the female sidekick of the jester's show and Robbie Coltrane portrays a one-eyed pirate radio DJ Captain Blood. Hale and Pace play peasants. This episode also features Paul Merton (credited under his real name, Paul Martin) as one of three yokels. It was his first television appearance.

All trains serving the station are operated by West Midlands Trains. The station is unstaffed and is about half a mile to the east of the village. Hartlebury is the least-used station in Worcestershire. ==Details and history== Hartlebury station was opened by the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway in 1852, and from 1862 it served as the starting point of the Severn Valley Railway, which ran to Shrewsbury in Shropshire, a distance of 40 miles. Through passenger trains over this route ended in September 1963, but local workings to Stourport-on-Severn & continued until January 1970 and coal trains to the power station at Stourport until 1979. The branch has since been lifted, though its formation can still be seen. The original station had an overbridge and canopies but these were removed in the 1960s, during a period of rationalisation on the railways, and crossing the platforms must now be done via the road. As the old station building is now a pub/restaurant, waiting passengers are provided with bus shelter-style structures to shelter from the elements. Due to the station having short platforms longer trains cannot stop here. After being used by a marine engineering company, the old station building is currently being redeveloped as a micro-brewery, pub and restaurant. There is a level crossing at the north end of the station, formerly operated by Hartlebury Station Box (to the north of the crossing) but now worked remotely from the West Midlands Signalling Centre at Saltley. Hartlebury Station Box was an example of the second signal box design from McKenzie & Holland of Worcester, and became operational in 1876. A further signal box, Hartlebury Junction, previously existed at the junction of the Severn Valley line, but was demolished after the closure of the line rendered the box redundant. ==Services== Up until the December 2013 timetable change the service from the station to both Birmingham and Worcester was limited, especially outside of the morning and evening peak periods. From 9 December 2013 however, the station has an hourly service in each direction between 06:40 and 20:07 Mondays to Saturdays. A few additional later evening trains also call at Hartlebury after this time.

It was written and directed by Perry, who also played three characters, including Madea. It was released on February 24, 2006, nearly one year following its predecessor, Diary of a Mad Black Woman. The independent film was produced by Lionsgate. ==Plot== After Madea (Tyler Perry) violates the terms of her house arrest (which she was subjected to in the previous film), the judge orders her to take in a rebellious foster child named Nikki (Keke Palmer) in order to avoid jail. At first, Madea and Nikki clash due to the latter's bad attitude and disrespect, stemming from her poor life up to this point, including an absent father, a mother in jail, and a slew of uncaring foster homes. However, Madea tells her that the only way to really overcome her poor life is to work to do and be better than the people who have let and put her down. Nikki takes Madea's words to heart and gradually reforms her behavior over the course of the film. Lisa Breaux (Rochelle Aytes), one of Madea's nieces, is engaged to Carlos Armstrong (Blair Underwood), an abusive and controlling investment banker. While she desperately wants to get out of the engagement, her conniving gold-digging mother, Victoria (Lynn Whitfield), urges her to go through with the wedding, telling Lisa to avoid doing things that make Carlos angry. Vanessa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson), the other of Madea's nieces, who lives with her, has two children fathered by two different men, neither of whom are involved in their children's lives; Victoria regularly degrades Vanessa for this, even referring to her grandchildren as \\"bastards\\". Vanessa is successfully, though through some struggle, wooed by poetry-spouting bus driver Frankie Henderson (Boris Kodjoe), who is the single father of a young son, and has a passion for painting. As much as Vanessa likes Frankie, she is emotionally closed off and has a difficult time trusting him. Lisa eventually leaves Carlos with the intention of calling off the wedding, temporarily moving in with Madea. Carlos, eager to move forward with the wedding, dispatches Victoria to bring Lisa back to him. Victoria confronts Carlos about the abuse, suggesting that insecurity about his masculinity is causing him to act out and that he needs counseling. Carlos counters this by suggesting that Victoria is controlling every aspect of her daughter's life because she wants to make up for all of the shortcomings in her own. It is then revealed that Victoria, with Carlos's assistance, has stolen from Lisa's trust fund over the years, leaving virtually no money left, and is now encouraging Lisa to marry Carlos in order to keep up her livelihood. Carlos makes it clear to Victoria that he will not bail her out unless the wedding goes forward. Victoria goes to Madea's house to fetch Lisa, only to end up in a passionate argument with Vanessa, who has become aware of Carlos's abuse and is eager to protect her sister. During the confrontation, Vanessa reveals a shocking secret to her younger sister: Victoria allowed her second husband, Lisa's father, to rape Vanessa in order to keep him in the marriage. Vanessa states that the sexual abuse occurred on a regular basis after that, which as a result, left her closed off emotionally and unable to trust the men in her life, including Frankie. Even more shockingly, Victoria makes no attempt to deny Vanessa's accusations. Instead, she rationalizes her actions, telling her daughters that they would have been destitute if Lisa's father had left, and that after going through a previous divorce with Vanessa's father and working two jobs to support the family afterwards, she was tired of struggling and felt that she deserved better. She also reveals that her own mother, a prostitute and drug addict, regularly traded her for \\"ten dollars and a fix\\", essentially almost mirroring what she'd done with Vanessa and Lisa's father. Victoria then states that she would not allow Vanessa to ruin her happiness, and that she would not apologize for the choices she'd made. She then turns on a horrified Lisa, demanding that Lisa begin taking care of her financially as she made sure that Lisa had the best of everything while she was growing up. Vanessa then derides Victoria for constantly controlling her and Lisa as her punching bag and puppet respectively, and how it has left her a mess; she vows not to let the pain and suffering her mother has subjected her to over the years hold her back any longer, and to break their family's tragic cycle by embracing the true love that she has found with Frankie and being a better mother to her own children. Victoria then leaves and later lies to Lisa, telling her that Carlos has agreed to counseling. Lisa eventually returns to Carlos and resumes her wedding plans. At the family reunion, held at the home of ninety-six-year-old Aunt Ruby (Georgia Allen), Vanessa and Victoria get into another verbal confrontation, which eventually turns into a physical fight after Victoria insults Vanessa about her relationship with Frankie in front of the family. The fight is broken up when Myrtle (Cicely Tyson), Madea's daughter-in-law, and Aunt May (Maya Angelou) gather the family members to an old shack the family's ancestors grew up in. They, along with some of the older members of the family, express appellation and disappointment at how the family has turned out, and Myrtle gives a long speech persuading them to act better to each other and to themselves. On the day of Lisa's wedding, Madea tells her that it is time for her to stand up against Carlos and fight back. When he arrives at Madea's house, he asks that he and Lisa be alone. Madea asks Carlos if he'd like something to eat, and tells Lisa to give him some grits on the stove, noting to her that they're hot. When Madea leaves the house with Nikki, Carlos brutally slaps Lisa in the face, but then, in retaliation, she throws the pot of hot grits in his face, scalding him badly, and then beats him with a frying pan, as Madea listens outside with laughter. She then takes off her engagement ring and throws it at an injured Carlos before leaving. At the church, Lisa announces to the guests that Carlos had been beating her every day since they first got engaged and that the wedding is off. Frankie then asks Vanessa to marry him. She says yes, and they're married at the church instead. At the reception, Victoria tells Vanessa that she and Frankie are a beautiful couple and they hug, signifying the first steps in a possible reconciliation. ==Cast== * Tyler Perry as Brian, Joe, and Mabel \\"Madea\\" Simmons * Blair Underwood as Carlos Armstrong * Lynn Whitfield as Victoria Breaux * Boris Kodjoe as Frankie Henderson * Lisa Arrindell Anderson as Vanessa * Maya Angelou as Aunt May * Rochelle Aytes as Lisa Breaux * Jenifer Lewis as Milay Jenay Lori * Keke Palmer as Nikki Grady * Tangi Miller as Donna * Henry Simmons as Isaac * Cicely Tyson as Aunt Myrtle * Johnny Gill as Wedding singer * Cassi Davis as Aunt Sarah * Georgia Allen as Aunt Ruby * Nicholas Ortiz as Himself * Judge Mablean Ephriam (cameo) as Herself * David Wiebers as Wedding Musician (trumpet) * China Anne McClain as Tamara ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack was released by Motown Records on February 21, 2006. ==Release and reception== ===Box office=== Madea's Family Reunion was budgeted at $6 million and opened at #1 in its opening weekend (2/24-26) with $30,030,661 and eventually grossed $63,257,940 in North America with an additional $50,939 internationally, tying $63,308,879 worldwide after 9 weeks in theaters.

On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 25%, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 4.41/10. The site's consensus reads \\"Tyler Perry's Madea's Family Reunion is sincere in its positive intentions, but leaves something to be desired as a film.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 45% based on reviews from 18 critics.

It may be reported with the results of an electrolyte panel, which is often performed as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. The anion gap is the difference between certain measured cations (positively charged ions) and the measured anions (negatively charged ions) in serum, plasma, or urine. The magnitude of this difference (i.e., \\"gap\\") in the serum is often calculated in medicine when attempting to identify the cause of metabolic acidosis, a lower than normal pH in the blood. If the gap is greater than normal, then high anion gap metabolic acidosis is diagnosed. The term \\"anion gap\\" usually implies \\"serum anion gap\\", but the urine anion gap is also a clinically useful measure. ==Calculation== The anion gap is a calculated measure. This means that it is not directly measured by a specific lab test; rather, it is computed with a formula that uses the results of several individual lab tests, each of which measures the concentration of a specific anion or cation. The concentrations are expressed in units of milliequivalents/liter (mEq/L) or in millimoles/litre (mmol/L). ===With potassium=== The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the serum concentrations of chloride and bicarbonate (anions) from the concentrations of sodium and potassium (cations): : = ([Na+] + [K+]) − ([Cl−] + [HCO]) = 20 mEq/L ===Without potassium=== Because potassium concentrations are very low, they usually have little effect on the calculated gap. Therefore, omission of potassium has become widely accepted. This leaves the following equation: : = [Na+] - ([Cl−] + [HCO]) Normal AG = 8-16 mEq/L Expressed in words, the equation is: : Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) :: which is logically equivalent to: : Anion Gap = (the most prevalent cation) minus (the sum of the most prevalent anions) (Bicarbonate may also be referred to as \\"total CO2\\" or \\"carbon dioxide\\".) ==Uses== Calculating the anion gap is clinically useful because it helps in the differential diagnosis of a number of disease states. The total number of cations (positive ions) should be equal to the total number of anions (negative ions), so that the overall electrical charge is neutral. However, routine tests do not measure all types of ions. The anion gap is representative of how many ions are not accounted for by the lab measurements used in the calculation. These \\"unmeasured\\" ions are mostly anions, which is why the value is called the \\"anion gap.\\" By definition, only the cations sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) and the anions chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO) are used to calculate the anion gap. (As discussed above, potassium may or may not be used, depending on the specific lab.) The cations calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) are also commonly measured, but they aren't used to calculate the anion gap. Anions that are generally considered \\"unmeasured\\" include a few normally occurring serum proteins, and some pathological proteins (e.g., paraproteins found in multiple myeloma). Similarly, tests do often measure the anion phosphate (PO) specifically, but it isn't used to calculate that \\"gap,\\" even if it is measured. Commonly 'unmeasured' anions include sulfates and a number of serum proteins. In normal health there are more measurable cations than measurable anions in the serum; therefore, the anion gap is usually positive. Because we know that plasma is electro-neutral (uncharged), we can conclude that the anion gap calculation represents the concentration of unmeasured anions. The anion gap varies in response to changes in the concentrations of the above-mentioned serum components that contribute to the acid-base balance. ==Normal value ranges== Different labs use different formulae and procedures to calculate the anion gap, so the reference range (or \\"normal\\" range) from one lab isn't directly interchangeable with the range from another. The reference range provided by the particular lab that performed the testing should always be used to interpret the results. Also, some healthy people may have values outside of the \\"normal\\" range provided by any lab. Modern analyzers use ion-selective electrodes which give a normal anion gap as <11 mEq/L. Therefore, according to the new classification system, a high anion gap is anything above 11 mEq/L and a normal anion gap is often defined as being within the prediction interval of 3–11 mEq/L, with an average estimated at 6 mEq/L. In the past, methods for the measurement of the anion gap consisted of colorimetry for [HCO] and [Cl−] as well as flame photometry for [Na+] and [K+]. Thus normal reference values ranged from 8 to 16 mEq/L plasma when not including [K+] and from 10 to 20 mEq/L plasma when including [K+]. Some specific sources use 15 and 8–16 mEq/L. ==Interpretation and causes== Anion gap can be classified as either high, normal or, in rare cases, low. Laboratory errors need to be ruled out whenever anion gap calculations lead to results that do not fit the clinical picture. Methods used to determine the concentrations of some of the ions used to calculate the anion gap may be susceptible to very specific errors. For example, if the blood sample is not processed immediately after it is collected, continued cellular metabolism by leukocytes (also known as white blood cells) may result in an increase in the HCO concentration, and result in a corresponding mild reduction in the anion gap. In many situations, alterations in renal function (even if mild, e.g., as that caused by dehydration in a patient with diarrhea) may modify the anion gap that may be expected to arise in a particular pathological condition. A high anion gap indicates that, usually due to disease or intoxication, there are elevated concentrations of anions like lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, PO, and SO in the blood. These anions are not part of the anion-gap calculation and there is a secondary loss of HCO (a buffer) without a concurrent increase in Cl−. Thus, the presence of a high anion gap should result in a search for conditions that lead to an excess of these anions. ===High anion gap=== The anion gap is affected by changes in unmeasured ions. In uncontrolled diabetes, there is an increase in ketoacids due to metabolism of ketones. Raised levels of acid bind to bicarbonate to form carbon dioxide through the Henderson- Hasselbalch equation resulting in metabolic acidosis. In these conditions, bicarbonate concentrations decrease by acting as a buffer against the increased presence of acids (as a result of the underlying condition). The bicarbonate is consumed by the unmeasured cation(H+) (via its action as a buffer) resulting in a high anion gap. Causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA): *Lactic acidosis *Ketoacidosis **Diabetic ketoacidosis **Alcohol abuse *Toxins: **Methanol **Ethylene glycol **Propylene glycol **Lactic acid **Uremia **Aspirin **Phenformin (no longer on market in U.S. since 1978 due to severe lactic acidosis, but still a problem globally. \\"Old metformin\\") **Iron **Isoniazid **Cyanide, coupled with elevated venous oxygenation *Kidney failure, causes high anion gap acidosis by decreased acid excretion and decreased HCO reabsorption. Accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, urate, and hippurate accounts for the high anion gap. Note: a useful mnemonic to remember this is MUDPILES - Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection, Lactic Acidosis, Ethylene Glycol and Salicylates ===Normal anion gap=== In patients with a normal anion gap the drop in HCO is the primary pathology. Since there is only one other major buffering anion, it must be compensated for almost completely by an increase in Cl−. This is therefore also known as hyperchloremic acidosis. The HCO lost is replaced by a chloride anion, and thus there is a normal anion gap. *Gastrointestinal loss of HCO (i.e., diarrhea) (note: vomiting causes hypochloraemic alkalosis) *Kidney loss of HCO (i.e., proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) also known as type 2 RTA) *Kidney dysfunction (i.e., distal renal tubular acidosis also known as type 1 RTA) *Renal hypoaldosterone (i.e., renal tubular acidosis also known as type IV RTA) characterized by elevated serum potassium. ::There are three types. ::1. Low Renin may be due to diabetic nephropathy or NSAIDS (and others causes). ::2. Low aldosterone may be due to adrenal disorders or ACE inhibitors. ::3. Low response to aldosterone maybe due to potassium sparing diuretics, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or diabetes (and other causes). *Ingestions **Ammonium chloride and acetazolamide, ifosfamide. **Hyperalimentation fluids (i.e., total parenteral nutrition) *Some cases of ketoacidosis, particularly during rehydration with Na+ containing IV solutions. * Alcohol (such as ethanol) can cause a high anion gap acidosis in some patients, but a mixed picture in others due to concurrent metabolic alkalosis. *Mineralocorticoid deficiency (Addison's disease) Note: a useful mnemonic to remember this is FUSEDCARS - fistula (pancreatic), uretero-enterostomy, saline administration, endocrine (hyperparathyroidism), diarrhea, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide), ammonium chloride, renal tubular acidosis, spironolactone. ===Low anion gap=== A low anion gap is frequently caused by hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is a negatively charged protein and its loss from the serum results in the retention of other negatively charged ions such as chloride and bicarbonate. As bicarbonate and chloride anions are used to calculate the anion gap, there is a subsequent decrease in the gap. The anion gap is sometimes reduced in multiple myeloma, where there is an increase in plasma IgG (paraproteinaemia). ==Correcting the anion gap for the albumin concentration== The calculated value of the anion gap should always be adjusted for variations in the serum albumin concentration. For example, in cases of hypoalbuminemia the calculated value of the anion gap should be increased by 2.3 to 2.5 mEq/L per each 1 g/dL decrease in serum albumin concentration (refer to Sample calculations, below). Common conditions that reduce serum albumin in the clinical setting are hemorrhage, nephrotic syndrome, intestinal obstruction and liver cirrhosis. Hypoalbuminemia is common in critically ill patients. Hypoalbuminemia can mask a mild elevation of the anion gap, resulting in failure to detect an accumulation of unmeasured anions. Therefore, it is important to correct the calculated value of the anion gap for the concentration of albumin, particularly in critically ill patients. Corrections can be made for the albumin concentration using the Figge-Jabor-Kazda-Fencl equation to give an accurate anion gap calculation as exemplified below. ===Sample calculations=== Given the following data from a patient with severe hypoalbuminemia suffering from postoperative multiple organ failure, calculate the anion gap and the albumin-corrected anion gap. Data: * [Na+] = 137 mEq/L; * [Cl−] = 102 mEq/L; * [HCO] = 24 mEq/L; * [Normal Albumin] = 4.4 g/dL; * [Observed Albumin] = 0.6 g/dL. Calculations: * Anion Gap = [Na+] - ([Cl−] + [HCO]) = 137 - (102 + 24) = 11 mEq/L. * Albumin- Corrected Anion Gap = Anion Gap + 2.5 x ([Normal Albumin] - [Observed Albumin]) = 11 + 2.5 x (4.4 - 0.6) = 20.5 mEq/L. In this example, the albumin- corrected anion gap reveals the presence of a significant quantity of unmeasured anions. == See also == * Osmol gap * Delta ratio ==References== ==External links== *Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders *Anion Gap Calculator (includes a correction for the albumin concentration) *Metabolic acidosis by Merck *More information about the Figge-Jabor-Kazda- Fencl equation Category:Acid–base disturbances Category:Electrolyte disturbances Category:Medical mnemonics ","title":"Anion gap"},{"id":"2571435","text":"Live at Cardiff Castle is a DVD released by Welsh Rock trio, Stereophonics.

They are sometimes collectively referred to as Lucas auks after the scientist who described the first species, Frederic Augustus Lucas. They had evolved along somewhat similar lines as the great auk, their North Atlantic ecological counterpart, but their decidedly stubbier wings were in some aspects more convergent with penguins. Skull of Miomancalla howardi compared with the skull of Pinguinus impennis Compared with the subarctic great auk, they were also smaller (see also: Bergmann's Rule): Praemancalla species have been estimated to have weighed about 3 kg. Most Mancalla forms weighed somewhat less (about 2.4 kg), with M. milleri being a smaller (1.65 kg) and M. emlongi a much larger bird (3.8 kg) than the rest. The last species thus stood around 55–60 cm high in life. The largest species, Miomancalla howardi, was the largest charadriiforme of all time.Smith, N. 2015. Evolution of body mass in the Pan-Alcidae (Aves, Charadriiformes): the effects of combining neontological and paleontological data. Paleobiology. doi: 10.1017/pab.2015.24 ==Evolution and classification== In a 2011 paper, N. Adam Smith published a review and revision of the Mancallinae. Smith defined Mancallinae as the clade containing Mancalla, Miomancalla, their common ancestor and all its descendants. A summary of his results follows. *Pan- Alcidae Smith, 2011 **Mancallinae L.Miller, 1946 ***Mancalla Lucas, 1901 ****Mancalla californiensis Lucas, 1901 ****Mancalla cedrosensis Howard, 1971 ****Mancalla lucasi Smith, 2011 ****Mancalla vegrandis Smith, 2011 ***Miomancalla Smith, 2011 ****Miomancalla howardi (Smith, 2011) ****Miomancalla wetmorei (Howard, 1976) The following species could not be identified as unquestionable mancallines, and have been assigned to Pan- Alcidae incertae sedis. They may be mancallines, or more closely related to true auks. *Alcodes ulnulus Howard, 1968 *Mancalla diegensis Miller, 1937 *Mancalla milleri Howard, 1970 The following species could not be differentiated from other recognized species of mancallines (see above), and have been assigned to Mancallinae incertae sedis. *Mancalla emlongi Olson, 1981 *Praemancalla lagunensis Howard, 1966 The mancallines probably evolved from proto-puffins, which must have been birds not dissimilar to the rhinoceros auklet. Accordingly, their status as a subfamily has been questioned as this would make the Alcinae (true auks) paraphyletic. However, the mancallines were a very distinct and unique evolutionary lineage and are thus usually retained as a subfamily. They must have diverged from flying ancestors during the mid-Miocene, roughly 15 mya. Alcodes is known from a single ulna found in Late Miocene (Clarendonian, 9–12 mya) deposits at Laguna Hills, California. While assignment of such a fragmentary fossil is always problematical, the ulna is a fairly distinctive bone and that of Alcodes is quite peculiar. However, it is more allied with the Mancallines as a matter of convenience; additional material would be needed to confirm this relationship. From the bone's measurements, it seems probable that this species was flightless and judging from its age, it either represents an earlier development parallelling Mancalla, or a third lineage of flightless auks. Praemancalla is known from Clarendonian to Early Pliocene remains. It is similar to Mancalla, but less extreme in its adaptations and it is quite possibly that the latter genus evolved from one of the 2 known species. Mancalla was a common species throughout the Pliocene, appearing in the Hemphillian stage of the Late Miocene (5–9 mya), and spreading in the Pliocene, with 4 species apparently coexisting at one time on the coast of southern California. As with many marine birds, the mancalline auks were much affected by the extinction crisis in the late Pliocene oceans. This coincided with the diversification of marine mammals, but may ultimately have been caused by increased supernova activity in the vicinity of the solar system. Despite their apparent awkwardness, they seem to have been quite well adapted for flightless birds, with the fossil record suggesting that the last remnants did not disappear until the Early Pleistocene (c. 7 mya), some time after the ecological changes had passed their peak. == References == Category:Auks Category:Extinct flightless birds Category:Neogene birds Category:Bird subfamilies ","title":"Mancallinae"},{"id":"2571472","text":"{ } USS Aylwin (DD-355) was a Farragut-class destroyer, and the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Lieutenant John Cushing Aylwin (1778–1812). ==Construction and commissioning== Aylwin was laid down on 23 September 1933 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard, launched on 10 July 1934, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth M. Farley, the 11-year-old daughter of Postmaster General James Farley, and commissioned on 1 March 1935, with Commander Clarence Gulbranson in command. ==1935–1941== ===1935=== Following builders' trials late in March, and fitting out, the destroyer shifted to the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, to load eight torpedo warheads. At the end of further trials, she returned to Philadelphia on 8 May to prepare for shakedown. On 22 May, Aylwin sailed for a cruise that took her to European countries. She stopped at Port Leixoes (Oporto), Portugal, on 1 June and at Santander, Spain, on the 5th, before shifting to Cherbourg, France, on the 10th. Five days later, the Honorable Jesse I. Straus, the United States Ambassador to France, inspected the new destroyer. The warship next visited Bremen, Germany from 19 to 24 June, before sailing for Gothenburg, Sweden, and a five-day visit. Then, after getting underway for Belgium on the 29th, she reached Brussels late on 2 July and there received her only royal visit when, on the morning of the 8th, King Leopold III and Queen Astrid came on board for an hour's inspection. The ship visited Dover, England, before heading homeward on 15 July. She reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the 22d, received post- shakedown repairs, and conducted further trials that lasted until 1 October, when she put to sea to join the Fleet. She fell in with her sister ship the next day, and the two ships reached Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the 5th, where Aylwin unloaded a cargo of light freight. After transiting the Panama Canal on 7 October, she paused briefly at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, before sailing on the 10th for a plane-guard station off Champerico, Guatemala, to provide a directional bearing along the projected track of the experimental flying boat XP3Y-1, the prototype of the PBY Catalina. Aylwin reached her assigned position on 13 October and, the next morning, began laying smoke to serve as marker for the plane. The destroyer's lookouts sighted the plane at 12:38, and it passed directly overhead seven minutes later. Ultimately, the XP3Y-1 reached San Francisco Bay on 15 October, having set a new international distance record for seaplane flights—3,281.402 statute miles (5,280.905 km). The destroyer rejoined Hull the next day; and the two ships steamed into San Diego, California harbor on the 19th. After a visit to Stockton, California, from 26 to 29 October, Aylwin began her peacetime duty with the Fleet, operating off the coast of southern California in flotilla tactics, torpedo attacks, short range battle practices, and sound training runs with the submarines and . ===1936=== On 10 February 1936, Aylwin departed San Diego and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on the following day for repairs and alterations. She ran her post-repair trials on 3 April. Following brief operations off Pyramid Cove, San Clemente Island, Aylwin sailed for the Canal Zone on 27 April to participate in Fleet Problem XVII, a five-phased evolution. The problem pitted the Battle Force against a submarine-augmented Scouting Force. As the opposing forces engaged off the west coast of Central America near the Panama Canal, Aylwin conducted simulated gun attacks on \\"enemy\\" destroyers and torpedo attacks on the \\"enemy\\" battle line. She anchored off Balboa on 9 May, refueled the following day, and resumed her participation in the fleet problem on the 16th as part of the \\"Green\\" fleet. After the exercises, Aylwin sailed to Peru and arrived at Callao on the morning of 28 May. That day, Rear Admiral Sinclair Gannon, Commander, Destroyers, Scouting Force, broke his flag in Aylwin. Winding up her Peruvian visit on 2 June, she got underway for California, but paused in Panama Bay from 6 to 8 June before continuing on to San Diego. Aylwin reached her home port on the morning of 16 June and moored alongside . That afternoon, Rear Admiral Gannon transferred his flag to the destroyer tender. On 6 July, Aylwin got underway for the Pacific Northwest and reached Port Angeles, Washington, on the 9th. She sailed thence via the inland passage to Alaska and arrived at Cordova on the 13th. Following a subsequent visit to Kodiak, a return call at Port Angeles, and tender upkeep there alongside Dobbin, the destroyer conducted sound tracking exercises at Admiralty Bay, Port Townsend, Washington. She visited Portland, Oregon, from 5 to 10 August before heading home where she arrived on the 13th. A week later, she got underway for tactical exercises in company with and ; but they soon commenced looking for the overdue San Diego-based tuna boat SS San Juaquin, last reported in their vicinity. The Coast Guard cutter Takoe joined the search on 21 August, and the cutter Aurora began the next day. On the 23d, Aylwin and the other ships, sailing in a scouting line, searched for the overdue full-rigged ship Pacific Queen. Although they did not find either vessel, it seems that neither was lost, since both appeared on merchant vessel registers for some years thereafter. In fact, the latter—bearing her original name, Balclutha—serves as a floating museum berthed in San Francisco, California. Aylwin operated in the southern California area until sailing on 16 April 1937 for the Hawaiian Islands to participate in Fleet Problem XVIII. Forming up with the \\"Hilo Detachment\\" on the 21st, Aylwin conducted a mock bombardment of Hilo, Hawaii before deploying to screen and as they covered a simulated landing. Putting into Pearl Harbor on 25 April, Aylwin got underway on 4 May as part of the \\"White\\" Force. Rated as \\"damaged\\" in an initial phase of the action on 8 May, Aylwin shaped course to rendezvous with \\"friendly\\" units that morning and drove off two \\"strafing\\" attacks by \\"Black\\" planes en route. She sighted what appeared to be the \\"White\\" battle line at 06:40 and altered course to join, but discovered that the ships were, in fact, counted as \\"out of action.\\" Thus now virtually \\"alone\\", Aylwin came about and headed for Lahaina, Hawaii. The beleaguered ship found no solace en route, however, for she spotted three fast minelayers closing from six miles away, and after identifying them as \\"enemy\\", went to general quarters at 07:30, \\"opening fire\\" three minutes later. However, the umpires quickly declared her hors de combat so she joined her \\"out of action\\" consorts soon thereafter. Aylwin returned to San Diego on 28 May 1937 and, after two weeks of upkeep alongside , resumed her training schedule. During the last days of June, she operated in company with as that ship conducted battle practice off Santa Barbara Island in company with the radio-controlled, high-speed target ship . ===1938=== For the rest of 1937 and the winter months of early 1938, Aylwin maintained what had become standard routine, alternating periods in port for upkeep with time training at sea in the southern California operating area. From 6 to 9 January 1938, she participated in the search for a lost patrol plane from Patrol Squadron 7 (VP-7). After firing antiaircraft practices in early February, the ship proceeded to the Destroyer Base, San Diego, for her yearly hull inspection in the floating drydock USS ARD-1 and then proceeded to the Mare Island Navy Yard for a brief overhaul. Following those repairs, Aylwin arrived at San Diego on the 6th, just in time to participate in Fleet Problem XIX. The \\"Black\\" Fleet put to sea from San Diego at 03:25 on 15 March. As part of the \\"White\\" Fleet, Aylwin got underway at 1640 and soon joined the remainder of Destroyer Flotilla 1 and the aircraft carrier . Searching for the enemy \\"main body\\" on the 17th, she fell in with , , and on the following morning. That afternoon, the cruisers made contact, attacked, and retired under cover of a smoke screen. Aylwin regained sight of the \\"enemy\\" and took up a position a safe distance astern to trail them through the 19th. After fueling from on the 20th, the destroyer conducted exercises in subsequent phases of Fleet Problem XIX until supporting a mock landing at Lahaina; at the outset, she lay-to between the islands of Molokai, Lanai, and Maui before standing in toward the \\"beachhead\\" to support the landing of troops. She conducted a brief minesweeping drill before refueling from and then anchoring at Lahaina Roads for a brief respite. From 4 to 8 April, Aylwin again was underway participating in further exercises before putting into Pearl Harbor. When the fleet sortied on the morning of the 18th, she ranged ahead of the departing battleships alert for possible \\"submarine\\" activity. Ultimately, Aylwin participated in the closing phases of Fleet Problem XIX, which had been conducted in three separate phases, each a small fleet problem in itself. As in Fleet Problem XVII, the exercises also tested the ability of the fleet to seize and hold advanced bases, indicating the Navy's Pacific-minded planning. The destroyer returned to San Diego on 28 April and, on 9 May, resumed her coastwise training schedule. She underwent brief upkeep alongside Whitney before getting underway on 21 June for the Pacific Northwest and cruising along the coast through July, touching at such places as Port Angeles, Washington; Ketchikan, Territory of Alaska; Humpback Bay, Wrangell Narrows, Taku Inlet, Yakutat Bay, Sitka, Seattle; and finally, Portland, Oregon. She returned via San Francisco to San Diego in mid-August, underwent tender upkeep alongside Whitney, and conducted training off the southern California coast before getting underway on 26 September for Hawaii. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 2 October, Aylwin underwent repairs and alterations there through November. She arrived back at San Diego on 12 December and conducted training exercises off the South Coronados Island of Mexico before ending the year 1938 berthed in a destroyer nest in San Diego harbor. ===1939=== Four days into 1939, Aylwin got underway for Panama and reached Balboa on 13 January. After transiting the Panama Canal the next day, she operated out of Gonaïves, Haiti; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, before getting underway on the 13th for her initial station during Fleet Problem XX. These exercises took place in the Caribbean and arrayed the Battle Force against the Scouting Force. After fueling from on 17 February, Aylwin operated with and which acted as a raiding force during one phase of the problem. Ultimately, the \\"battle\\" reached its conclusion, the fleet battle. The forces then all retired to Culebra Bay, Puerto Rico, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt reviewed them from the deck of Houston on the last day of February. After visiting Cienfuegos and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Aylwin operated briefly out of Gonaïves before returning to Guantanamo on 31 March. She got underway on 8 April for Yorktown, Virginia, and, en route north, acted as plane guard for Lexington. Aylwin reached Yorktown on 12 April, but the Fleet's visit to that area was soon cut short by orders to return to the Pacific. Underway at 04:04 on 20 April, Aylwin took station with the rest of her division around the carriers. She planeguarded for en route to Panama; transited the Canal on 29 April; and, after tarrying briefly at Balboa, got underway for San Diego on 2 May. Reaching her home port on the 12th, the destroyer operated off southern California before entering the Mare Island Navy Yard on 18 June for repairs and alterations lasting until 8 October. She got underway on the morning of 11 October, bound once more for Hawaii. The Navy formed a \\"Hawaiian Detachment\\" under Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews and based it at Pearl Harbor—a step foreshadowing the basing of the entire Fleet there the following spring. Aylwin arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 October 1939 and, over the next few months, alternated periods in port at \\"Pearl\\" with varied exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. ===1940=== In the spring of 1940, Aylwin, as a unit of the \\"maroon\\" fleet, participated in Fleet Problem XXI, the last pre-war fleet problem. Indicative of the Fleet's security-mindedness at that time, Aylwin alternated with other destroyers conducting \\"security patrols\\" off the port of Honolulu and off Pearl Harbor's entrance during the course of the evolutions, investigating all vessels sighted, including small fishing craft. Detachments from the Fleet were rotated back to the west coast at intervals. Aylwin thus returned briefly to the west coast during the summer of 1940, reaching San Diego on 9 July before shifting to the Mare Island Navy Yard on the 14th. She underwent repairs and alterations there until 22 September before returning, via San Diego, to Pearl Harbor on 21 October. ===1941=== From that port, Aylwin maintained her normal routine into the critical year 1941. On 7 February 1941, she put to sea and, after rendezvousing with aircraft carrier Enterprise and sister destroyer , headed back to the west coast for a brief visit. They arrived at San Diego on 13 February, but turned around again two days later and rejoined Enterprise—which was ferrying a shipment of the latest Army fighter aircraft to Hawaii. The three ships reached Oahu on 21 February. On 17 March, Aylwin left Pearl Harbor for off-shore patrol and exercises. Two days later, the ship conducted a two-hour night tactical exercise on a dark, moonless night, commencing at 20:00. At its conclusion, all destroyers were directed to proceed to a rendezvous astern of the fleet's center. At 22:51, Aylwin turned on her running and fighting lights and sighted a ship materializing out of the murk on her port bow. Aylwin maintained her course and speed until backing emergency full at 23:03. At that point, the other ship, Farragut, loomed on a collision course and also backed to avoid contact. Shortly after 23:04, Farraguts bow sliced into Aylwins port side at a 90-degree angle, causing extensive damage for about 23 frames and nearly severing Aylwin's bow. A fire immediately blazed up as high as Aylwin's masthead, illuminating the two ships and quickly spread aft through the wardroom and into the area occupied by the ships officers' cabins. Aylwin's electrical installation burned with intense heat until controlled at 0140 on the 20th. Fire parties from Dale, , , and all contributed men to help contain the blaze; and a party from Indianapolis joined the one from Philadelphia in assessing the damage and making temporary repairs. attempted to tow Aylwin back to Pearl Harbor but the cable parted. soon picked up the damaged destroyer and towed her to port stern first. Following extensive repairs in drydock, Aylwin resumed her operations in the Hawaiian waters. After conducting her last peacetime training late in November, she moored to buoy X-14 at 13:47 on the 28th, and remained there into the first week of December. ==World War II== As Aylwin lay moored in a nest with her squadron mates on the morning of 7 December 1941, one small boiler was in operation to provide enough power for auxiliary services on board. Approximately half of her men were enjoying leave and liberty that weekend. At 07:55 that Sunday morning, shortly before morning colors, the sound of airplane engines surprised Aylwin's men and countless other sailors. At that time, Japanese planes torpedoed the target ship moored to a quay off Ford Island. Three minutes later, Aylwin returned fire. At 08:00, the \\"black gang\\" lit fires under two boilers, cutting them in on her main steam line within 15 minutes. At 08:29, Commander, Destroyers Battle Force directed his ships to get underway. At about 08:50, a Japanese plane dropped a bomb that exploded some 75 yards off Aylwin's starboard bow. Eight minutes later, Aylwin, leaving her stern wire and anchor chain behind, headed for the channel and the open sea. The destroyer, manned by 50% of her crew under the direction of four ensigns—the senior officer, Ensign Stanley B. Caplan, USNR, had served at sea for only some eight months—proceeded out of Pearl Harbor, stripping ship for war and simultaneously maintaining a \\"continuous fire.\\" Her machine gunners claimed to have downed at least three aircraft; but, in the light of the tremendous volume of antiaircraft fire from all ships, her \\"kills\\" cannot be proven conclusively. As Aylwin raced out to sea, those men topside who chanced to look astern beheld a curious sight; her captain, Lt. Comdr. Robert H. Rodgers, and other officers, in a motor launch about 1,000 yards off the entrance buoys. Nevertheless, in view of ComDesRon 1's instructions, Aylwin could not slow down, but instead headed out to sea for patrol duty, leaving most of her officers orphans on board the old flushdecker . A little less than a half hour later, Aylwin investigated a reported submarine sighting, but found nothing. During the patrol, the destroyer vibrated abnormally because of a screw damaged soon after she got underway when a bomb explosion near her starboard quarter threw her stern into a buoy. Late on the afternoon of 8 December, Aylwin followed the Enterprise task force into Pearl Harbor and picked up Rodgers and the division commander, Comdr. R. S. Riggs, on the way into the channel. The next day, Aylwin got underway and conducted antisubmarine patrols in sector 2, off the entrance to Pearl Harbor. She made a sound contact on 10 December. After going to general quarters, she dropped a five-charge pattern, but with no confirmed damage. Entering Pearl Harbor again on the 11th, Aylwin underwent repairs to her damaged propeller. On 12 December, after the smoke over Oahu had cleared, Comdr. Rodgers heaped praise on his abbreviated crew for their actions in the first flush of war: \\"The conduct of the personnel was magnificent.... Every man more than did his job and was eager to fight.\\" Of Ensign Caplan, Rodgers wrote, \\"The conduct (of this man) ... in superbly taking command for 36 hours during war operations of the severest type is a most amazing and outstanding achievement.\\" Aylwin sortied as part of the Lexington task force headed to relieve Wake Island on 14 December. Along with the heavy cruisers Chicago and Portland and the destroyer , she took station ahead of Lexington. The next day, destroyers Dewey and Worden, the cruiser Indianapolis, and the oiler Neosho joined the force. Two Japanese carriers had joined the forces attacking Wake. This move prompted cancellation of the relief attempt. Wake fell on 23 December. After investigating several suspected submarine contacts en route, Aylwin covered the arrival of TF 11 at Pearl Harbor three days after Christmas. On the last day of 1941, Aylwin sortied from Pearl Harbor in the screen of a convoy taking evacuees from the Hawaiian Islands to the west coast where she served five days into 1942. ===1942=== Aylwin then underwent repairs and alterations in the Mare Island Navy Yard until 10 January, receiving new 20-millimeter machine guns to increase her close-in antiaircraft capability. Two days later, she sailed with to escort the liners President Coolidge, President Monroe, and Mariposa to San Francisco. Underway again on the 17th, Aylwin and Perkins escorted a convoy consisting of Neosho, , , and back to Oahu where they arrived on the 25th. On the last day of January, the destroyer sortied with TF 11, formed around Lexington, and performed plane-guard duties for that carrier as she moved southwestward toward New Guinea. After accidentally firing a live torpedo in Hull's direction during surface attack maneuvers on 13 February, Aylwin warned her sister ship by blinker, enabling the latter to sheer away out of danger. Aylwin followed the errant \\"fish\\" at 28 knots until it sank at the end of a normal run. Three days later, the ANZAC command cruiser force—Chicago, HMNZS Leander, , and , screened by and Perkins—pulled into sight. As the destroyers formed a circular screen, the heavy ships hove to and transferred officers for a conference. Shortly thereafter, TF 11 reformed and assumed a northwesterly course toward Bougainville Island and the Bismarck Archipelago. Before a raid against the key Japanese base at Rabaul could be launched, Japanese reconnaissance planes discovered the task force. Accordingly, 17 land-based Mitsubishi G4M bombers set out from Rabaul, New Britain. Lexingtons radar picked up the incoming bombers at 10:30, and the task force increased speed to 21 knots. During the defense of the carrier, Lt. Edward H. \\"Butch\\" O'Hare reportedly downed five or six enemy planes in about as many minutes. While Lexingtons F4F Wildcats were fighting above, the ships' gunners were firing antiaircraft guns. Aylwins spotters noted one enemy bomber falling in flames after bursts from their ship had exploded in its vicinity. Then, when a second wave attempted to breach the screen of the task force, Aylwin's 20-millimeter guns downed an enemy bomber attempting to crash into the stern of nearby . The remaining bombers returned to Rabaul. No ship in the Lexington formation was damaged. However, since it had been discovered, the American force retired from the area. Aylwin soon left TF 11 to escort the fleet oiler to Pago Pago, Samoa, and then back to Pearl Harbor, reaching port on 8 March. Two days later, Aylwin began screening the 18 ships of convoy 4072 from Honolulu to San Francisco Bay where they arrived on 22 March. Following repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard, she sortied on the 31st as part of the screen for Hawaii-bound convoy 2054. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 12 April, Aylwin returned to sea on the 15th with TF 11\\\\. En route to the South Pacific on the 18th, Lexington flew off a squadron of 14 Marine Brewster F2A-3's (the reconstituted VMF-211) to Palmyra Island. Meanwhile, intelligence reported a substantial enemy movement toward New Guinea and Australia, probably aimed at strategic Port Moresby. Accordingly, on 26 April, Lexington and her screen received orders to rendezvous with Task Force 17 (TF17) on 1 May. When they met that morning, the two forces came under the latter's commander, Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, in Yorktown. Aylwin was assigned to Lexington's plane guard. On 7 May, Aylwin received word that an enemy force of two carriers and four cruisers was some 200 miles distant. At 09:55, Aylwin observed Lexington launch fighters and torpedo planes for the attack. Shortly thereafter, Yorktown's aircraft also took to the air. On the 8th, Aylwin had been at general quarters since 0844 and, when enemy planes were reported closing two hours later, took station between the heavy cruisers Chester and , 3,000 yards from Yorktown. She maintained that position during the ensuing battle, conforming her movements to those of Yorktown. Yorktown was damaged, as was Lexington, the latter fatally. After an SBD-3 of Scouting Squadron 5 (VS-5) ditched near Aylwin, the destroyer altered course to pick up the pilot, Ens. J. H. Jorgenson, USNR, and his rear-seat man, Radioman 3d Class A. W. Brunetti. The task force retired from the scene of battle toward the Tonga Islands. While alongside New Orleans to refuel two days later, Aylwin rigged breeches buoys forward and aft, and took on board 37 officers and 92 enlisted men from Lexington and one Yorktown pilot, Lt. (jg.) E. S. McCuskey, of VF-2, who would later become an \\"ace\\" in the Battle of Midway. The destroyer cast off and resumed her screening duties. On the morning of 15 May, Aylwin drew alongside Yorktown, and transferred charts of the Tonga Islands to the carrier. Less than an hour later, while the carrier's planes flew protective cover, TF 17 entered Nukualofa Harbor, Tongatapu, where Aylwin transferred her passengers to Portland while fueling from the heavy cruiser. She then served as channel entrance guard until relieved by the following day. In turn relieving on the morning of the 17th, Aylwin patrolled off the entrance to the harbor during the sortie of TF 17 from Nukualofa and then joined in escorting transport —carrying Lexington survivors gathered from all rescue ships of the task force—on the first leg of her voyage back to the west coast of the United States. Later that day, after Burnett suffered an engine casualty, Aylwin remained with the transport until she completed the repairs. Six days later, TF 17 reached Pearl Harbor. The following day, 28 May, Aylwin got underway to sortie in the screen of Enterprise and as those carriers proceeded to waters north of Midway await a Japanese armada. On 4 June, she participated in the Battle of Midway. On 11 June, Aylwin broke off from Hawaii-bound TF 16 to escort oiler northward toward the Aleutian Islands to fuel the warships of TF 8\\\\. Over the next five days, the two ships proceeded through foggy and rainy weather until meeting and on 16 June. Aylwin screened while the older \\"flush- deckers\\" fueled from Kaskaskia. The following day, Aylwin joined TF 8 which included heavy cruiser , three light cruisers, and six destroyers. But for two escort runs to Women's Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska, she worked with that task force until getting underway on 10 July to escort Kaskaskia back to the Hawaiian Islands. On the 13th, the oiler transferred her remaining fuel to and the two ships reached Oahu four days later. The destroyer spent the remainder of July in the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard undergoing repairs. Aylwin completed her post-repair trials and then departed Pearl Harbor on 2 August to screen the escort carrier which had embarked the marine air units earmarked to operate from the airfield on Guadalcanal after its capture. On 7 August, as Aylwin and her charge headed across the Pacific, the marines of the 1st Marine Division went ashore on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu. On the 8th, a Japanese cruiser force destroyed four Allied heavy cruisers and damaged a fifth in the Battle of Savo Island. That news, combined with the withdrawal of the three carriers supporting Operation Watchtower, prompted orders on the 10th for Aylwin and her charge to put into Suva, Fiji, to fuel and there await further instructions. Aylwin and Long Island reached Suva on 13 August, covered on the last leg of their voyage by a PBY flying boat. The \\"further orders\\" came soon enough, directing the destroyer and the carrier to the New Hebrides. They arrived at Vila Harbor, Efate, during the forenoon watch on 17 August. Reaching Mele Bay, Efate, on the 17th, the ships soon received their new sailing directions. On the following afternoon, Aylwin, , and got underway to screen Long Island during the carrier's passage to Guadalcanal. Two days later, the squadron arrived back at Efate, where replenished Aylwin. Over the ensuing days, the destroyer conducted offshore patrols at Efate before receiving orders on 30 August to escort Long Island to Espiritu Santo to embark survivors of the sunken destroyer —which had struck a mine. After refueling at Pago Pago, Samoa, on 6 September, Aylwin met , , and off Canton Island on 11 September and screened the latter as that transport disembarked troops there. Forming TG 15.4, Aylwin and Conyngham shepherded Wharton, via Suva, toward Nouméa before Aylwin was directed on the 18th to proceed to Tongatapu to join for duty and to escort that torpedo-damaged battleship back to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Late on the afternoon of the 30th, she and Dale safely reached Hawaiian waters with their charge; and Aylwin moored alongside for upkeep. Aylwin spent most of October training in Hawaiian waters and then escorted a convoy to Espiritu Santo which she reached on 7 November. Because of Japanese submarine activity in the Santa Cruz Islands, Aylwin arrived at Vanikoro Island on the 10th to protect . After protecting that seaplane tender, four days later, she escorted Ballard to Vanua Levu to pick up sick Army coastwatchers before returning to Espiritu Santo for fuel from the oiler . During a brief patrol out of Espiritu Santo, Aylwin developed trouble in her steering engine. Once repaired, the ship conducted channel entrance patrols there, before joining in planeguarding between 19 and 22 November. After reaching Nouméa, Aylwin escorted the damaged battleship from Tongatapu before refueling at Bora Bora, in the Society Islands, on 1 December. The destroyer then steamed to California, and underwent repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard into the new year. She departed San Francisco on 8 January 1943, bound for Alaska in company with and Dale, and arrived at Dutch Harbor five days later. Over the next three months, Aylwin conducted escort missions in the Aleutians. ===1943=== Shifting southward, she then worked with Nassau during flight training before shifting north to Dutch Harbor to take part in the invasion of Attu. The landings commenced on 11 May 1943. Some two months later, Aylwin shelled antiaircraft gun positions on Kiska on the night of 8 and 9 July. The destroyer made two passes at that island. She subsequently bombarded the enemy's main camp on Kiska on the evening of 2 August, unaware that shortly before—on 28 July—the Japanese had evacuated their entire force. Departing Adak on 31 August, Aylwin steamed to San Francisco and remained in the Bay area through mid-October. Leaving the west coast on the 19th, the destroyer served as part of the screen for the escort carriers , , and as they sailed toward the New Hebrides and arrived at Espiritu Santo on 5 November. From mid- November through the first week of December 1943, Aylwin screened carriers Sangamon and Suwannee during the operations to capture the Gilbert Islands. Detached on 8 December, she joined in escorting to Pearl Harbor where they arrived on the 14th. She then helped to screen that battleship along with Tennessee and Colorado to San Francisco which they reached four days before Christmas. ===1944=== Following repairs at Alameda, California, Aylwin picked up a convoy of tank landing ships and motor minesweepers at San Diego to escort to Hawaii. After tarrying at Kauai between 16 and 20 January 1944, she moved on to the Marshall Islands, reaching Kwajalein on the last day of the month. But for a run to Majuro and back between 8 and 11 February, she served there until shifting to Eniwetok on the 21st to join , MacDonough, and Monaghan in delivering fire support that night on Parry Island. The destroyer then reported to Commander, Southern Screen, for duty. Steaming back to Kwajalein on 26 February, Aylwin patrolled off Eniwetok and Majuro through mid-March as mop-up operations continued at those places. She was assigned next to TG 58.2, including , , , and . On 30 March, the Fast Carrier Task Force commenced intensive bombing of Japanese airfields, shipping, fleet servicing facilities, and other installations in the Carolines, continuing the raids until 1 April. Aylwin helped to drive off planes during the approach of the carriers on the 29th and 30th and, at 13:43 on the latter day, sighted a damaged Curtiss SB2C \\"Helldiver\\" from Bunker Hill air group ditch a short way off. The destroyer altered course and soon thereafter picked up the pilot and his radioman. Returning to Majuro to replenish, Aylwin sortied once more on 13 April in the screen of Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery's TG 58.2, bound for waters off New Guinea to support Army landings at Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay, and Humboldt Bay, from 21 April through the 24th. Aylwin returned to Majuro on 4 May for tender repairs alongside which ended on the 21st. After screening Bunker Hill and Cabot during training in late May and early June, the veteran destroyer departed Majuro on 6 June bound for the Marianas Islands in company with TF 58\\\\. On the 12th, the planes from the carriers bombed air facilities and coast defenses in the Marianas and damaged two Japanese convoys. On the 13th, Aylwin was part of the Northern Bombardment Unit (TU 58.7.2) which shelled defense positions on the northern coast of Saipan and also served in the antisubmarine screen for the battleships and South Dakota. When the shelling ended at 17:15, she rejoined the carriers and guarded them as they refueled the next day. During that operation, the destroyer received orders to rescue a pair of Bunker Hill aviators and, less than an hour later, picked up Ens. G. W. Snediker, USNR, and Aviation Radioman 3d Class R. E. Lincoln, USNR. The destroyer made another rescue on the 16th while covering the cruiser bombardment of Guam when a plane piloted by Ens. F. P. Kleffner, USNR, crashed 1800 yards astern. On the 17th, Aylwin was ordered to help screen the transports, and she missed the Battle of the Philippine Sea on the 19th and 20th which almost wiped out Japanese carrier-based aviation. Aylwin next proceeded to Eniwetok where she arrived on 28 June for a fortnight's upkeep. Aylwin screened and as those cruisers shelled installations on Guam on 18 and 19 July before taking part in a bombardment of the northern shores of the island, concentrating her fire on Japanese defensive positions near Asan Beach. At the outset of the mission, Dewey and two LCI's provided harassing fire into that area. and Dewey stood in close to the beach, lying close to Adelup Point and covered the night beach obstruction demolition work of underwater demolition teams (UDTs), screened to seaward by Aylwin, Dale, and . Aylwin relieved Dewey on station on 21 July, off Asan Beach. Dale in turn relieved Aylwin on station. Relieved at 05:30, Aylwin and her colleagues retired to the transport screen northwest of Orote Point and Agana Bay. On 25 and 26 July, the destroyer screened a cruiser bombardment of Rota Island and departed the area on the 30th, bound for Eniwetok on the first leg of a voyage home. Aylwin stopped at Pearl Harbor from 9 to 11 August and reached Bremerton, Washington, on the 17th for an overhaul. Aylwin then went down the coast with and Farragut, reached San Pedro on 10 October, and set out for Hawaii the next day. Aylwin then trained in Hawaiian waters until 11 November, when she sailed for the western Pacific in company with , , and three destroyers. She reached Ulithi on 21 November and operated between there and the Philippines into the first week of December 1944. On 10 December, Aylwin—flagship of Commander TG 30.8 (a replenishment group), Captain Jasper Acuff—left Ulithi as the 3rd Fleet put to sea. Three days later, Aylwin rendezvoused with TF 38 and, upon completion of fueling operations early the following afternoon, cleared the area. On the morning of the 17th, TG 30.8 joined TF 38 and again commenced fueling. However, the weather soon began growing worse as a typhoon came into the Philippine Sea. After Aylwin rolled 70 degrees to port for the first time, her engines were ordered to be stopped. At 12:45, Machinists Mate 1st Class Theodore Sarenski was swept overboard; followed 10 minutes later by the chief engineer, Lt. E. R. Rendahl, USNR. Neither was rescued. A leak in the engine room at 19:30 drew all pumps into action. Aylwin survived the typhoon, but other ships had not fared so well. The storm claimed Hull, Monaghan, and , each with heavy loss of life. Her flooding under control, Aylwin arrived at Ulithi three days before Christmas. There, she received repairs alongside that lasted into January 1945. While at Ulithi, Aylwin conducted a brief patrol of the harbor after an explosion in —believed to have been caused by a submarine torpedo—but found no evidence of submarine activity. ===1945=== The destroyer continued her operations as screen for replenishment groups into February 1945. As part of the screen of TG 50.8, she—together with , , , , and reached Iwo Jima on 21 February. She then began protecting the transports. On 23 February, Aylwin was assigned to TF 54, the fire support group, and relieved . By that time, marines had occupied the southern section of Iwo Jima and were advancing to the north. On 23 and 24 February, Aylwin engaged in the Battle of Iwo Jima, before she left on the 25th for a fueling rendezvous en route back to Ulithi where she arrived on the 28th. During the first phase of the invasion of Okinawa, Aylwin operated between Kerama Retto and Ulithi. In early April, she endured her second typhoon on 5 June 1945. Aylwin rendezvoused with the storm-damaged which had lost her bow in the storm. She subsequently searched unsuccessfully for the damaged warship's severed bow before putting into Apra Harbor, Guam, on 10 June for repairs. On 6 July, she got underway to return to the Carolines and reached Ulithi on the next. She sortied on the 10th as an escort for Convoy UOK-39 and safely saw her 41 charges to Okinawa. After returning to Ulithi with another convoy, Aylwin began steaming off the anchorage on picket station B-6 at 16:40 on 3 August. The next morning, she received orders to search for survivors of the torpedoed Indianapolis. The destroyer located and examined three bodies, removing all identification materials and fingerprinting them before burying them at sea. Underway again on 13 August, Aylwin escorted a convoy of troopships to the Marianas, reaching Apra Harbor on 14 August. When Japan surrendered the following day, Aylwin was at Apra Harbor. Three days later, the destroyers got underway for the Hawaiian Islands, in company with MacDonough and , and reached Pearl Harbor soon thereafter. On 27 August, Aylwin embarked passengers and, the following day, sailed for the California coast. The veteran destroyer disembarked her passengers at San Diego and, after tarrying there from 3 to 11 September, got underway for Panama and the east coast of the United States. ==Decommissioning== Transiting the canal for the last time on 20 September, Aylwin reached New York City on 25 September. Decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 16 October 1945, Aylwin was struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1945. Stripped for disposal, her hulk was sold and delivered to George N. Nutman, Inc., of Brooklyn, N.Y. on 20 December 1946 and cut up for scrap by 2 September 1948. Aylwin received 13 battle stars for her World War II service. == References == == External links == * history.navy.mil: USS Aylwin * navsource.org: USS Aylwin * hazegray.org: USS Aylwin * historynet.com: Interview with Burdick Brittin Category:Farragut-class destroyers (1934) Category:World War II destroyers of the United States Category:Ships built in Philadelphia Category:Ships present during the attack on Pearl Harbor Category:Ships of the Aleutian Islands campaign Category:1934 ships ","title":"USS Aylwin (DD-355)"},{"id":"2571477","text":"Madea's Class Reunion is a 2003 play, directed, written by, and starring Tyler Perry. The live performance that was released on DVD was taped in Detroit. The play stars David Mann as Leroy Brown, Tamela Mann as Cora and Chandra Currelley as Emma. ==Plot== Tyler Perry's outrageous and tough granny character, Madea, is traveling to the Pandora Hotel, the venue for her 50-year class reunion. Running afoul of the law, Madea still manages to teach valuable lessons amidst the comedy and chaos, addressing the importance of forgiveness and the value of friendship. In addition to Madea, the insane bellboy/bartender, \\"Dr.\\" Willie Leroy Jones (new character played by Perry), is causing ruckus in the already rowdy hotel before she even arrives. Willie is suffering from an unknown number of Mental illnesses claiming at times to be on lithium, Prozac, and Xanax and is likely criminally insane as he mentions a probation officer. Madea, her daughter Cora, and her colorful crazy neighbor and classmate, Mr. Brown (whose wife from the previous play, Mattie, died from Alzheimer's complications and was cremated) help married couple Corey and Trina Jeffrey (Terrell Carter, Pamela Taylor) come to terms with infidelity. A woman Stephanie (Cheryl \\"Pepsii\\" Riley) hurt by years of sexual and chemical torment must give up prostituting herself with her abusive husband (D'Wayne Gardner), and reconcile with her tired elderly mother Emma (Chandra Currelley-Young) who was fired by the evil manager of the Pandora, Anne (Chantel Christopher), who is having an affair with her son's father (Anselmo Gordon) who is married to Cora's friend Diana (Judy Peterson), who is too reliant on her man. While all of this takes place Madea enters with her usual flair and quickly cuts through all the lies and secrets and forces everyone to see their situations in a new light giving aid and advice to all. They save the Jeffrey's marriage through the timely interruption of a would be affair with Anne by forcing the woman away and reminding the husband that he stilled loved his wife. Madea convinces Stephanie to break free of her husband and in so doing gain her independence, her self-respect, and a measure of revenge for all the years of abuse. In so doing Stephanie also reconciles with her mother healing their bond. Throughout Madea battles Anne and during a visit to the spa with Diana reveals the relationship between Anne and Diana's husband. Diana confronts Anne and is shocked to learned she has given the man a child and in response she kicks her husband out of her life and turns her life over to God. In the finale we learn that Emma, a long time employee of the hotel, had spoken to the owner about her previous termination by Anne only to be reminded that her previous purchase of stocks in the company to keep it afloat during a financial crisis had blossomed proving her with an impressive fortune. Citing her cruel treatment of employees and her less than satisfying contact with customers Emma fires Anne much to everyone's delight. Before leaving Madea reveals that Mr. Brown is actually Cora's father much to Cora's then despair. Everyone is shown repairing their relationships as the play ends with a powerful and grateful appeal from the cast to Christ for his aid and his goodness. ==Cast== * Madea and Dr. Willie Leroy Jones - Tyler Perry * Emma - Chandra Currelley * Stephanie - Cheryl Pepsii Riley Brooklyn New York October 18 * Mr. Brown - David Mann * Diana - Judy Peterson Vero Beach Florida October 26 * Cora - Tamela J.

It has an area of 1.62 hectares. The site was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 25 September 1992. ==Site Description== This site contains an unusually large and intact valley fen, supporting rich marsh vegetation of a type known only at two other sites in Devon and which is now nationally scarce. The fen occupies a single field at an altitude of 40 m, through which runs a small stream called Nanny's Water, which is a tributary of the River Coly. Its soils consist of deep waterlogged peaty loam above Triassic mudstones, with Cretaceous Greensand on the valley sides above. During winter it periodically floods. ==Vegetation== The vegetation is mainly of a mosaic of yellow iris Iris pseudacorus, branched bur-reed Sparganium erectum and rushes Juncus spp., while greater tussock-sedge Carex paniculata is locally dominant. Other conspicuous plants include meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria, marsh- marigold Caltha palustris, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, watermint Mentha aquatica and southern marsh-orchid Dactylorhiza praetermissa. Also present are four species which are local in Devon: wood club-rush Scirpus sylvaticus, marsh valerian Valeriana dioica, fen bedstraw Galium uliginosum and common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris. The stream is bordered for most of its length by alder Alnus glutinosa, with a ground flora dominated by ramsons Allium ursinum. ==Other biodiversity interest== Brown trout Salmo trutta fario and eel Anguilla anguilla are known to occur in Nanny's Water. The site supports a varied reptile fauna, including grass snake Natrix natrix and adder Vipera berus. It also supports a number of bird species including water rail, which rarely breeds in Devon but has been recorded during the summer at this site. During the winter snipe and woodcock commonly feed within the fen, and grey heron and barn owl occur.

During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 70th and 71st Congress. He was elected in his own right to a full term as U. S. Senator, in 1930, defeating Democrat Thomas F. Bayard, Jr., a former U. S. Senator. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 72nd Congress, but was in the minority during the 73rd and 74th Congress. Hastings lost his bid for a second full term in 1936 to Democrat James H. Hughes, a lawyer from Dover, Delaware.

Their sound uses elements from rock and roll, punk, glam, garage rock and new wave styles of music. They call their style \\"rocket roll\\". The band is known for throwing sudden, unexpected shows at places where they are not invited. They often play in front of existing concerts where crowds have already gathered. They gained notoriety in 2003 for sneaking into the Warped Tour, following the tour in their own vehicle and performing at each stop for several weeks. The Phenomenauts perform under a space and science fiction persona. Each band member uses a stage name and dress in uniform. Most of the band's songs revolve around science, space, robots, and the future. The band has even decorated their vehicles to match their theme. Their live shows often feature special effects like clouds of smoke or lasers, and they are known to shoot toilet paper into the crowd and set their drum cymbals on fire. The Phenomenauts also use their music to promote science education and learning. They have played and promoted events such as the Bay Area Science Festival and the March for Science. In 2015 they released the album I'm With Neil, a tribute to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and the public radio program Science Friday. ==History== ===Band formation and Rockets And Robots (2000–02)=== The Phenomenauts were formed in 2000 in Oakland, California, which the band refers to as \\"Earth's capital\\". They were formed from the band Space Patrol, a 1980s cover band that played on homemade instruments. Space Patrol members included Commander Angel Nova, Corporal JoeBot, and Major Jimmy Boom. The trio added bass player Captain Chreehos and formed The Phenomenauts—a name which means \\"to pilot an unusual experience\\". In 2002 The Phenomenauts released their first album, Rockets And Robots. It was self- published on their own label, Arlington Lab Recordings. The album was well received \\"by radio stations and audiences surrounding the Bay Area\\". It rose on the music charts on local college stations such as KSSU in Sacramento and KALX in Berkeley. Rockets and Robots was also reviewed favorably in local music publications; for instance, Zero Magazine wrote, \\"What separates this East Bay foursome from all the other bands of this type is their sense of humor and songwriting craft\\". Band manager Colonel Reehotch explained that recording the first album was \\"a process [of] 'Delusional Exploration'. Rockets and Robots was an experiment to take the Phenomenauts rock show ... and translate it to your mind. So that if you had never seen the band before and listened to the album you could paint the picture of the show in your imagination\\". Later in 2002 The Phenomenauts won two awards. They were chosen as California's Best Live Band by the East Bay Express, and called the Best Lifestyle Music artist by SF Weekly. After touring to support their debut album, the band signed with Springman Records. \\"After a year of touring up and down the Bay ... Avi [the] owner of Springman Records ... saw us at the Gilman. He said, ‘You guys are something I want to be a part of’. ... It was one of our best ideas to work together\\". In the spring of 2003, Rockets and Robots was remastered and re-issued on Springman Records. ===Expansion and mini-albums (2002–04)=== synthesizer. This added an extra layer of sound to their music. Leading up to their second full-length album The Phenomenauts released two smaller works. These releases, in turn, were preceded by the band adding a fifth member to their lineup—Professor Greg Arius playing synthesizer. This gave the group an \\"extra layer\\" and type of sound. Then in 2003 the band released Mission Transmission, a 7\\" vinyl containing two new songs. To celebrate The Phenomenauts went on their first European tour in November 2003 with fellow punk/rockabilly band Demented Are Go. This was followed by their second mini-album Pre-Entry in 2004. Pre-Entry had live versions of the two Transmission songs as well as three new ones. ===Re-Entry (2004)=== The Phenomenauts released their second full-length album Re-Entry later in 2004. \\"With the new record ... the band felt really comfortable about the vision and going into the studio. We didn't worry so much about [making] a movie this time as we did trying to capture the energy of the songs\\". Shortly after releasing Re-Entry, the Phenomenauts were a finalist for the \\"Not So Silent Night\\" concert held by San Francisco radio station Live 105. Discussing their music-making process, the band noted that trying out songs live before they were recorded \\"enabled the band to sort through their best material, and eliminate any excess fat\\". While it had been two years since their previous album release, the band was \\"glad [they had] waited until [they] had enough 'A' material\\". Both Pre-Entry and Re-Entry were engineered by Chris Dugan at Nu-Tone Studios, who later went on to win a Grammy as an audio engineer for Green Day. Through heavy touring and promotion the album charted at #10 on the College Media Journal (CMJ) Top 25. The band also played and interviewed on G4 TV's Screen Savers’ Live Music Fridays to promote the album. In late 2005 the Phenomenauts lineup changed, with Corporal JoeBot departing the band. He was replaced by a new member who went by the name Corporal JoeBot 2.0. Then in late 2006 the band released a music video for the Re-Entry song \\"Mission\\". The video appeared on the front page of both YouTube and MySpace, receiving more than 430,000 combined views. ===For All Mankind (2008)=== The Phenomenauts released their third full-length album For All Mankind in 2008, on Springman Records imprint Silver Sprocket. The band said the album was \\"inspired by new wave and 70's punk\\", and \\"serves as a call to arms to defenders of science and honor across the galaxy\\". The album contained the track \\"Science And Honor\\", which explained the band's motto and philosophy. At release the physical copies of the album were sold with extra items, including a die-cast metal pin, a 24-page color booklet, and a package that folded out to make a rocket ship. The band explained that they added these items to give fans an extra reason to purchase the album: \\"The biggest negative right now is that CDs just don't sell. Vinyl actually is selling more than CDs, because it's got some extra flavor to it. It has something people want to hold in their hand. [We added the items] for that reason. ... I think it's people wanting to reach out and touch a piece of the band—to hold something they have created, [it] gets them a little closer\\". The album was reviewed favorably in local publications such as East Bay Express, which wrote, \\"The Phenomenauts come roaring out of the gate at warp speed on their third album\\". To promote the album The Phenomenauts went on two tours. The first was a United States national tour with The A.K.A.s. They followed up with an international tour across the U.S. and Canada with San Francisco band The Re-Volts. The band also collaborated with Emmy Award winning writer Rich Fogel and Eisner Award winning artist Erica Henderson to create an animated music video for the song \\"Infinite Frontier\\". In February 2009 The Phenomenauts lineup changed again, with JoeBot 2.0 and Captain Chreehos leaving. Two new members took their place: Leftenant AR-7 on guitar and vocals, and Deck Chief Nick Wayzar playing bass. === Electric Sheep (2010) === In 2010 The Phenomenauts released the digital-only mini-album Electric Sheep, containing four new songs. The album featured AR7's first songwriting and singing with the band. The band departed on their second European tour, \\"Operation: Europe!\\", to promote the album after release. Between Electric Sheep and their next album the band changed bass players. Nick Wayzar was replaced by Chief Engineer Atom Bomb, playing the Stand-Down Bass. ===Escape Velocity (2013–present)=== The Phenomenauts designed new uniforms for the Escape Velocity album launch. Left to right: Atom Bomb, Ripley Clipse, and Angel Nova. In 2013 the Phenomenauts ran an online fundraiser for their next album, to raise money for studio time and to cover a tour. Fans could bid to vote on naming the album, or on other items such as playing laser tag or bowling with the band. The album was released in 2014 with the title Escape Velocity, an album they hoped \\"encourages people to break free of their own limitations\\". The band described the album sound as a departure from their previous albums. Rather than focusing on one style or theme, Escape Velocity was a combination of \\"second half of the 20th century Rock and Roll\\". It combined many different sounds including 50s Rock and Roll, 60s Soul music, 70s glam, and early 80s punk rock. Nova said \\"musically, it's more diverse than anything we’ve ever recorded\\". The Phenomenauts used the album launch to visually rebrand. Atom Bomb designed a new logo, and Nova designed new uniforms. A Huffington Post reviewer said that Escape Velocity stepped away from the \\"pure rockabilly music\\" of the band's previous albums. They felt the work had a \\"more polished ... clean ... and futuristic style\\" in songs like \\"Infinity Plus One\\", but kept \\"fast hooks\\" and was \\"right at home at a ... sock hop\\" with songs like \\"Rocket Soul\\". A For The Love Of Punk reviewer noted \\"[it] reminds me of a modern, punk rock Chuck Berry that’s about science\\". The band went on their third European tour at the end of 2014 to promote the album, playing in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. In 2015 Ripley Clipse joined the band playing keyboard, taking over from Professor Arius. Starting in 2015 the Escape Velocity song \\"Theme for Oakland\\" was used as the official after-game celebration song for the Oakland Athletics. The song was used again in 2017 in a series of commercials promoting the Athletics and the city. In February 2020, The Phenomenauts issued a statement on the band's Facebook page, announcing the firing of Angel Nova from the group, stating, \\"We recently learned that a member of our band has violated these principles. So as a band, we’ve made the decision to move forward without Angel Nova. We do not condone his actions and find them completely unacceptable. We respect the privacy of those involved - their stories are not ours to tell, so we would like to focus on what we can do moving forward. We are thankful to the brave people who have come forward to tell their stories and we’ll continue to support survivors of sexual and emotional abuse.\\" While not specifically mentioning what allegations led to Nova's removal, the band encouraged fans to support anti-sexual abuse and anti-domestic violence support organizations. ==Commando performances== The Phenomenauts earned a reputation for \\"staging commando performances\\" at venues where they were not booked, and were often unwelcome. They played \\"on the sidewalk in front of the venue\\" after a show at The Fillmore, and had shows \\"cut short by security guards\\" after sneaking backstage at the 2003 California Music Awards. \\"Security couldn’t figure out how to unplug us cause we brought our own power source. ... Eventually, between songs they asked us to stop but they were kind of powerless\\". The band frequently staged performances in front of other venues, where crowds had already gathered: ===Sneaking into the Warped Tour=== The band gained notoriety in 2002 and 2003 for sneaking onto the Warped Tour. In 2002 they \\"found an open gate in the back, hid behind a dumpster and then quickly set up in front of the stage and started playing\\". In San Francisco \\"a security guard told them to get a move on. However, while loading their gear—in full 'uniform'—into the group's 'space van', another security guard ... assumed they were supposed to be there ... [and] kindly directed them to the official artist entrance\\". In Portland 2003 they drove their tour van into the backstage area \\"and cooked breakfast for the technical crew\\", including \\"the people that actually make the passes\\". Once they had laminated all-access, photo-ID passes the Phenomenauts followed the tour from city to city in their own vehicle. They set up their own gear each time and played sets for another six full weeks. The Phenomenauts were officially invited back to play on the Warped Tour in 2004, with a press release that read \\"The Phenomenauts have been announced as the official Breakfast Band for this years Vans Warped Tour\\". A Philadelphia Inquirer review of the tour called The Phenomenauts \\"one of the best performances\\", saying they \\"played a swinging amalgam of dusty garage rock and new wave\\". The band declined an offer to join Warped Tour again in 2005. Instead they played with The Aquabats and the Epoxies on the \\"Teenage Pajamas from Outer Space Tour\\". The band noted that playing the Warped Tour led to many introductions and collaborations with other artists. Through contacts from the Warped Tour, they opened for Les Claypool of Primus at his 2005 New Year's Eve show, and worked with children's author Sandra Boynton on the album Dog Train. ==Theatrics and theme== Corporal Joebot 2.0 sports the \\"Therimatic Helmerator\\" - a helmet with a wireless theremin. The helmet is worn as part of the band's science and robot theme.The Phenomenauts perform under a space and science fiction persona, and are fully committed to their theme. Each band member uses a stage name. They wear uniforms. They call their shows \\"missions\\" and their fans \\"cadets\\". They even wear uniforms when not performing, considering themselves to be \\"always on duty\\". Each live show begins with the band's signature launch status check. Commander Nova instructs \\"Give me a go, no-go to Rock\\", and the band makes sure that all equipment (and the audience) are working. Once the show is declared \\"Cleared to rock\\" the band kicks off a 10-second launch countdown and leaps into the first song. ===Live shows=== Ripley Clipse demonstrates use of the Streamerator 2000 - a custom-built, motorized toilet paper launcher. It is one of the gadgets used during live shows. The Phenomenauts gained praise for their stylized live shows and performances. The San Francisco Chronicle said \\"it is live where the Phenomenauts truly excel\\", and a Huffington Post reviewer noted they had \\"a live show that explodes on the stage\\". Thrasher Magazine said The Phenomenauts \\"put on one of the best live shows you'll ever see\\". Colonel Reehotch, the band's Mission Operations Specialist commented that \\"The Phenomenauts really are at their visual best on a big stage\\". During performances the band wears uniforms of their own design and uses custom-made \\"Phenoma-gadgets\\". This includes items such as the \\"Theramatic Helmerator\\" - a helmet with a wireless theremin that sounds like \\"old Star Trek episodes\\". The \\"Streamerator\\", created by Professor Greg Arius, blows rolls of toilet paper into the crowd. They blast clouds of carbon dioxide and use inflatable models of Earth. They have been known to use dry-ice blasts and set cymbals on fire. The band believes their special effects, act, and devices are an integral part of the show. \\"It’s important to us\\", explained Leftenant AR-7, \\"because we want to just blow the lid off of every place we play. We want to give the most entertaining show — visually and aurally — that we can\\". Drummer Jimmy Boom noted \\"[We're] trying to encompass it all. We're not just audio. We're not just visual. We try to say hi to the crowd. The best effects are the ones that actually touch the crowd - when they can feel the cold of the . We're trying to hit as many senses as possible\\". Ronen Kauffman from the Issue Oriented podcast commented that The Phenomenauts were \\"revisiting the rift between performer and audience, and helping to break that down\\". In 2008 Professor Arius' \\"Streamerator 2000\\" was featured in Issue 8 of Make magazine. The band Green Day borrowed the device for their 21st Century Breakdown tour in 2009. ===Phenomenaut vehicles=== The Phenomabomber - The Phenomenauts customized their vehicles to match their space and science fiction theme. The Phenomenauts have customized their own fleet of vehicles to match their science fiction theme. It started with a car, which the band nicknamed \\"The Phenomenator\\". The vehicles are covered with electronic gadgets such as remote controls, stereo components, and computer parts, all spray-painted silver. The trend continued with their first tour van, which they named \\"The Phenomabomber\\". Nova was inspired to create his own space-themed vehicle by watching Mystery Science Theater 3000. \\"I noticed one night ... [that] stuff was just glued on and painted the same color, and it just made it look spacey. So I ... did it [to my car] and it looked really cool. Everyone was driving around staring at the PhenomaBomber, and I realized if I had a band name on there it would be a moving billboard\\". The Phenomenaut vehicles even made impressions on interviewers, with Frank Meyer from G4 TV noting \\"It [isn't] everyday that a metallic space-van pulls up ... and five guys dressed in space suits pile out\\". ===Command Center=== When they are not touring the Phenomenauts hang out at their personal top-secret \\"Command Center\\". The Command Center is a large converted warehouse located in the industrial heart of Oakland. The Command Center serves as home, rehearsal den, and performance space. It has a musical stage for performing and sub-stage hot tub. The band also uses it to host regular parties. To create the Command Center the band \\"set up their own rehearsal studio, completely transforming a typical storage area [and decorating it] to look like outer space\\". Then they began hosting parties \\"to showcase their unusual music and worldview\\". Commander Nova explains: \\"it's not easy to break into San Francisco when you've never played anywhere. ... We didn't feel like starting from scratch, so we ... made the place all nice and had shows here. And before long, there were 200 people seeing us. And then we stepped out, and we already had a draw\\". JoeBot expands: \\"It’s one of the only venues in (the Bay Area) that can get an audience from San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, which is an odd thing. ... We must be on to something to have all these people show up\\". The Command Center was featured in a three-page spread in Punk Rock Confidential, and appears in the independent feature film Punk Rock Holocaust. == Musical style == The Phenomenauts combine the music styles of many genres, including punk, new wave, garage rock, psychobilly and doo-wop. Their songs contain fast drum beats and guitar riffs, often combined with doo-wop style lyric repetition or callback. Commander Nova describes the formation of the band's style as taking all of their favorite styles of music, \\"cramm[ing] them all in and launch[ing] it straight into orbit. Also, we put a little more get up and go into it. ... [A] higher punk-to-rock ratio\\". Reviewers have described the band as everything from \\"mixes the mantra-style punk of The Clash with the lovable lunacy of Devo\\" to combining \\"upbeat, happy, dance vibrations\\" with a thrash that \\"sound[s] like they brought it back ... from the future\\". A Zero Magazine reviewer called out the song \\"Mission\\" as \\"an excellent example of the Phenomenauts’ versatility\\". \\"Mission\\" covers several music styles, \\"with a big punk chorus of 'Oh, Oh,' the thumping stand-up bass..., keyboard and a ‘50s style guitar twang\\". But the reaction from the band is that they've created a style all their own. \\"We find it fascinating when people call us a punk band, or a rockabilly band, or a ska band. We fit into all categories and none of them. We have roots in punk and new wave and all the other things we listen to, but we're our own thing\\". Regardless of the tune, the Phenomenauts' songs deal with the subjects of science, outer space, and robots. \\"We’re trying to take smartness and nerdiness and jam it together with cool and sexy and have ... all of those things happening at the same time\\". The band truly believes in the topics both on and off the stage. The members are interested in science, astronomy, technology and humanity. The band believes that using a theme of space and the future allows them more freedom to write about present- day issues. The song \\"Earth Is The Best\\" calls for inspiration and caring about the planet. \\"The Tale Of Europa\\" considers how isolated cultures might react to new visitors and traditions. Corporal JoeBot attests that the Phenomenauts' music can help push forward ideas and make the world a better place. \\"A lot of bigger music industry corporations want a watered down, formulaic, non-confrontational musical direction. There’s no challenge. I believe that can change, and that we can make a difference\\". === Creative process === When creating their music The Phenomenauts consider themselves a working democracy: \\"All songs were communally written and arranged\\". In an interview Nova stated \\"different people come in with different song ideas, and then we all collaborate\\". For the album Escape Velocity, bassist Atom Bomb noted \\"For instance, one week we gave ourselves a homework assignment. We had to each bring in a new song to the next practice\\". ==Promoting science and learning== The Phenomenauts' motto is \\"Science and Honor\\". The phrase was captured in the song \\"Science And Honor\\" on their 2008 album For All Mankind. But the words are \\"more than just a nifty catchphrase\\" says Commander Angel Nova. \\"'Science and Honor' has become a genuine way of life. Science is the search for truth, without any kind of agenda, ... and honor is honesty and integrity. ... So, honest search for truth and don't be a jerk, what more do you need to live by? It's something that I actually honestly believe in\\". The band has done several shows and releases promoting science and learning. Nova said \\"it is especially great when we can trick someone into learning something\\". In 2011 they played at the Sacramento Freethought Day, an event \\"encouraging ... science and the First Amendment\\". In 2014 they played the Bay Area Science Festival. In 2017 the Phenomenauts played at the March for Science in Las Vegas and an event at the Chabot Space and Science Center. In 2008 The Phenomenauts were invited on a tour of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. The visit included meetings with astronauts, scientists, and \\"hands-on experience with space station parts\\" and training facilities. They also ran a seven-stop \\"Large Hadron Collider\\" tour around the Western United States to celebrate the completion of the Large Hadron Collider. ===I'm With Neil video and album=== In 2012 the Phenomenauts released the music video \\"I'm With Neil\\", an homage to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. The band said the video was \\"chock-full of the scientist’s best media appearances ... to encourage our fans to love him too\\". Tyson said he was \\"simultaneously flattered and weirded out\\". In 2015 the Phenomenauts released a new recording of \\"I'm with Neil\\" on a two-song album of the same name. The album was released as a collectable 7\\" EP, paying tribute to Tyson and the public radio program Science Friday for \\"science, education, exploration, and progress\\". The band decided to make the release because \\"We're all excited and inspired by science, [and] by the prospect of using that knowledge to make tomorrow better than today. ... It is one of the best ways to inspire everyone to work toward a better future\\". The band donates a portion of the proceeds to the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, an educational non-profit where Tyson is a member of the board of trustees. ==Tours== The Phenomenauts have toured with many bands, including The Slackers, The Aquabats, and The Epoxies. They have travelled across the United States on several headlining tours with support from acts like The A.K.A.'s, Teenage Bottlerocket and Kepi Ghoulie. They have played at San Diego Comic-Con, San Francisco Comic-Con, several years at the Maker Faire in 2006 and 2010, as well as the KerPunk Music Festival in London, England. Bay Area Punk rated the Phenomenauts the \\"#3 most prolific Bay Area punk band\\" for performing at least 239 shows in the Bay Area alone from 2000 to 2014. ==Other works== ===Comic books=== In 2011 Silver Sprocket published the Phenomenauts comic book Adventures in the Third Dimension!. The comic was written by Emmy winner Rich Fogel, with art by Eisner winner Erica Henderson, as well as Mitch Clem, Nation of Amanda, Nicholas Kole, Claire Hummel, Stephen R. Buell, and Chris Wisnia. The 48 page comic contains five short stories about the Phenomenauts' adventures. It also has articles such as a word search and \\"Get To Know Your Phenomenauts\\" biography. The comic was used to promote the mini-album Electric Sheep. Each comic was sold with a collectible colored vinyl EP containing two Electric Sheep songs, as well as a digital download code. In 2015 a six-page Phenomenauts mini-comic, Ghost Ship, was produced by Alice Hill and Johnny Dalton. ===Video game=== The Phenomenauts video game Space Flight was released in 2006. The player pilots The Phenomenator and shoots alien ships.In 2006 the Phenomenauts video game Space Flight was released by Smiley Crew Productions. Space Flight is a 2D, horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up. It was written in Flash. Programming and voice acting were done by Noah Wilson, with art direction and design by Katie Horn. In Space Flight the player pilots the Phenomenauts' vehicle The Phenomenator. They move around the screen to collect power-ups and avoid explosive space mines. The player must shoot obstacles such as asteroids and enemy ships. Space Flight features a \\"Story Mode\\", where players navigate through 10 \\"missions\\" and defeat powerful boss characters. It also offers a \\"Marathon Mode\\" with endless play, where players work to attain a high score. While running Space Flight plays music from The Phenomenauts' album Re-Entry. The game was awarded \\"Daily 3rd Place\\" on Newgrounds on May 4, 2006. ==Discography== *Rockets And Robots (2002, CD, 8-Track, Arlington Lab Recordings / 2003, CD, Springman Records) *Mission Transmission (2003, 7\\", Springman Records) – two live songs, later re-released on Re-Entry and Electric Sheep *Pre-Entry (2004, EP-CD, Springman Records) – five songs, two live.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 12 June 1984. The episode features the song \\"Our House\\", performed by Madness, the only band to appear on the show twice. ==Plot== All four flatmates are ill in bed, although Rick and Mike seem to faking illness with Vyvyan trying to ease the suffering with vodka, which he later uses to blow up Rick's bedroom, in the form of a Molotov cocktail, to stop Rick complaining. Neil's sneezing fit prompts Vyvyan to send Mike out to get a cure. Vyvyan takes drastic emergency action, involving the use of Rick's laundry bag, and some extreme acupuncture, using six-inch nails. Vyvyan also tries to get Neil to sneeze outside by pushing him through the bedroom window. Neil's snot splatters all over a man's face who is standing in the street. The man's reaction throwing a brick toward the four's house, ends up smashing through the window of a neighbouring house, thus beginning a cycle of violence which results in a street riot, also sucking in musical act, Madness, during the performance of their song, \\"Our House\\". Brian Damage Balowski escapes from his police guard after they are called in to deal with the trouble, and takes the quartet hostage. Usefully, Brian Damage eventually cures Neil's sneezing with a timely headbutt. Just as the four's doom seems sealed, Neil reveals that his parents had arranged to come for tea within a few minutes. A major clean-up operation - with Brian Damage doing his bit, helpfully polishing his shotgun - follows, before Neil's parents knock at the door as the riot continues surround them. Neil's parents complains that the show should be more age appropriate, in the manner of a classic sitcom like The Good Life, at which point, Vyvyan angrily makes a vehement articulate outburst against The Good Life after ripping apart the show's title page. Suddenly, the quartet go into a whole new sitcom involving the cultivation of plants in their backyard. Rick ends up supposedly killing Neil with a spade after he drones on too long about the cycle of plant life, and later buries him in special, grow-anything compost. This causes three Neils to appear from the soil. Taunted by his conscience for killing Neil while he slept in his bed that night, Rick has a nightmare in which he is tried by judge Mike and prosecutor Vyvyan at court, who suggests Rick to be executed, at which point, some girls shows up and wishes that the \\"People's Poet\\" will not die. But first, the girls are going to strip naked for Rick. Rick's conscience wakes him up for having a wet dream when he is supposed to be feeling guilty for killing Neil. Rick runs downstairs to the living room and tearfully wishes that he could see Neil again, and the three Neils come into the house, which spooks Rick. Just as Vyvyan and Mike joins Rick, the back wall of the house opens up, and Neil's parents and Brian Damage head up a large staircase, milking the audience's applause during the show's closing credits. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), Rick (Rik Mayall), (Nigel Planer), and Mike (Christopher Ryan). Alexei Sayle starred as escaped convict Brian Damage Balowski. Brian Oulton and Peggy Thorpe-Bates guest starred as Neil's parents. ==References== ==External links== *Sick at the British Film Institute * Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1984 British television episodes Category:Madness (band) Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Sick (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2571504","text":"The Adolph Coors Foundation was founded in 1975 with funds from the Adolph Coors Jr. Trust.

Goss played her first game of cricket at the age of 11 for South Perth, scoring 36 not out and taking 0 for 15. In the 1985-86 season, at the age of 17, she made her debut for Western Australia. Goss played with Western Australia until 1995-96 when she moved to Victoria. Goss returned to play with WA in 1999-2000. Goss was first selected in the Australian women's side for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand in January 1987. Although having already established herself as a genuine fast bowler and a brilliant all-rounder at interstate level, it was not until the following Rose Bowl in January 1988 that she first produced an outstanding performance at international level. In the third match of the series in Wellington, Goss guided Australia to victory with an unbeaten 96, an innings that remained her highest One Day International score. Goss scored 1099 ODI runs at an average of 29.70 including 7 fifties and took 64 wickets at an average of 19.15, her best bowling being 4 for 10 against Ireland in Christchurch during the 2000 World Cup. Goss played in four World Cups for Australia, playing when Australia won the final in 1988, then again in their unsuccessful defence in 1993, as a squad member when Australia regained the trophy in 1997 and finally as a member of the Australian side that lost the 2000 final to New Zealand, her final match for Australia. Goss's performances at Test level were not as impressive, averaging just 23.33 with a highest score of 48 and taking 20 wickets at an average of 25.55. She was also named Player of the Series in the 1995-96 Australian Women's Cricket Championship and again in the 1996-97 Women's National Cricket League. Despite her record in women's cricket, Goss's most famous cricketing appearance was in the Bradman Foundation charity match in Sydney in December 1994. Having been called into the Bradman XI side when rugby league player Paul Vautin withdrew due to illness, Goss scored 29 before taking 2 for 60 from her ten overs, including the wicket of Brian Lara who had broken the records for Highest Test Innings and Highest First-Class Innings earlier in the year.Zoe Goss, the woman who dimissed (sic) the great Brian Lara Perth Sunday Times, 18 December 2010 After finishing her international career, Goss later went on to play for Tuart Hill Cricket Club in the WACA Women's Competition. ==ReferencesCareer profile at Southern Stars Category:Australia women Test cricketers Category:Australia women One Day International cricketers Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Sportswomen from Western Australia Category:Cricketers from Perth, Western Australia Category:Western Fury cricketers Category:Australian cricket coaches Category:Victorian Spirit cricketers ","title":"Zoe Goss"},{"id":"2571511","text":"El Porvenir (Spanish: \\"The Future\\") is a municipio (municipality) and township in the Mexican state of Chiapas.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 21, 1993. In the episode, Selma decides to have a baby, inspired by her late aunt's wish that she not spend her life alone. She experiences what life with children is like by taking Bart and Lisa to the Duff Gardens amusement park, which does not go as planned. The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Carlos Baeza. ==Plot== After watching an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died and they will be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys advises Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination. When the day comes for Homer to take Bart and Lisa to Duff Gardens, he falls ill from food poisoning after eating a hoagie that became spoiled days, if not weeks earlier after he took it home from a company picnic. In an attempt to give Selma a taste of motherhood, Marge nominates her to take the kids to Duff Gardens while she stays home to look after Homer. When the trio arrives at Duff Gardens, Bart and Lisa wear Selma out, especially when they go on the Little Land of Duff ride and Bart dares Lisa to drink the \\"water,\\" but she's unsure. After a round of chicken clucks and \\"Quit it!\\"s Selma intervenes, shouting at Bart to be quiet and ordering Lisa to drink the water. When Lisa takes a sip, she hallucinates, grows violent and goes totally nuts, and wanders away from the ride, tripping out to the parade music. While Selma is looking for Lisa, Bart gets on a roller coaster called The Barrel Roll and ends up having to be rescued after the car stops in the center of one of the inversions. Lisa is soon found swimming nude in the Fermentarium by some workers and is returned to Selma as Lisa proclaims \\"I am the Lizard Queen!\\" Selma is then given pills by a man she assumes is a doctor, who informs her he isn't. After Bart and Lisa return home, Selma decides she can live without children for now and adopts Jub-Jub, Gladys' pet iguana. ==Production== Writer David Stern said he wanted to go back to a \\"Patty and Selma episode\\", because it was sustained so well when he wrote \\"Principal Charming\\". He thought it was important to \\"keep these characters (Patty and Selma) alive.\\" The animators had trouble with the size of the characters' pupils during the season. In this episode, they are noticeably larger. When the family watches the video will, Julie Kavner did five voices in the scene. When Great Aunt Gladys shows off her collection of potato chips, the scene was inspired by Myrtle Young, who appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. During an interview with David Letterman, Young said she was working in quality control at a potato chip factory, and collected potato chips that looked like, amongst other things, famous people. The scene where Homer ate a chip is a reference to the Johnny Carson appearance, where, whilst Young was looking away, Johnny ate a chip from a separate bowl (not of the collection), Young, thinking Johnny had ate a chip from her collection, was shocked, before Johnny cleared up the misunderstanding. Jub-Jub made his debut appearance in this episode; the name of the iguana Jub-Jub came from Conan O'Brien. Though research is usually done when real languages are used on the show, the foreign language heard on Selma's ham radio is fictional. ==Cultural references== The episode title is a take on the 1982 film Sophie's Choice. Marge's flashback of her and her sisters swimming in a lake is based on The Prince of Tides. The singers at Duff Gardens, Hooray for Everything, are a parody of the musical group Up with People. The group is seen performing a kid-friendly version of the Lou Reed song \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\". Homer and Bart start to sing \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" from The Wizard of Oz. The poem that Great Aunt Gladys reads at the start of her video will is \\"The Road Not Taken\\" by Robert Frost. Duff Gardens is a parody of Busch Gardens, originally developed as a marketing vehicle for the Anheuser-Busch brewing company. The song and ride that Bart, Lisa, and Selma go on, with animatronic kids from all over the world singing is a parody of the song \\"It's a Small World\\". The Duff Gardens parade is a parody of Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade. as Lisa's hallucination where she sees Selma after drinking the water on the ride is based on the work of artist Ralph Steadman, particularly in the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. When Lisa says \\"I am the Lizard Queen!\\", it is a tribute to Jim Morrison's poem \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\". After acquiring Jub-Jub, Selma sings \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\", a reference to the season four finale of the sitcom Murphy Brown, in which reporter Murphy Brown sings the song after giving birth to her baby. ==Reception== \\"Selma's Choice\\" finished 27th in the weekly ratings for the week of January 18–24, 1993 with a Nielsen rating of 14.2. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said, \\"A nice episode for Selma and good for Marge and Homer as well. But it's the kids who provide the highlights in this one, with their antics at Duff Gardens.\\" The author of Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation, Chris Turner said it \\"Fills in with the usual grab bag of great gags\\" and \\"The episode had some crowd-pleasing moments.\\" He went on to say, \\"The last few minutes of the show played out to continuous laughter [in the pub he was watching it in]\\". ==References== ;Bibliography * * ==External links== *\\"Selma's Choice\\" at The Simpsons.com * * *\\"Selma's Choice\\", at TV.com Category:The Simpsons (season 4) episodes Category:1993 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in amusement parks Category:Television episodes about funerals Category:Disney parodies ","title":"Selma's Choice"},{"id":"2571541","text":"Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All by Myself is a 1999 play directed by, written by, and starring Tyler Perry.

Madea didn't like Anthony at all. Madea just got home from the hospital because she is diabetic. Another person Madea is helping out is Bobby Mitchell (Tyga Graham), a total stranger who just got out of doing 12 years in prison for possession of drug paraphernalia – even though, according to him, it was his two older brothers and since he was the youngest they told him to say it was his and he did. Bobby is Madea's handyman and usually cuts her grass and both Madea and Vianne really think he is attractive. Vianne doesn’t want to admit it. Vianne sister, Maylee (Donna Stewart)’s fourteen-year-old daughter, Keisha (Elaine O'Neal), is also staying with Madea. When Maylee was very young about Keisha's age, her mother wanted money for drugs. So her mother put her in a room with a guy who paid to do whatever he wanted to Maylee. As a result, Maylee got pregnant and had Keisha. Keisha resents her mother because of the way she acts and has never been there for her. When Maylee shows up to Keisha's school wearing a mini-skirt, Keisha is embarrassed. Later, Maylee comes to Madea’s house with a new car bought by Anthony Griffin, and announces her upcoming marriage to Vianne's ex-husband! Keisha is still resentful towards her mother. When her mother tries to help with her homework, Anthony calls and Maylee runs to him. (Motherless Child) Cora Simmons (Tamela Mann), Madea's daughter, arrives and announces she is staying with her mother. She mentions she is just staying for the weekend, as she lives out of town. Keisha confides in her Aunt Cora and tells her the kids at school bully her except one kid, Kelly. Madea's next door neighbor, Leroy S. Brown (David Mann), whom everyone calls Mr. Brown brings in Madea's mail. Mr. Brown says hi to Cora, who he hasn't seen in a long time. Madea thinks that Anthony cheated on Vianne because there is no way they would have gotten engaged that fast. Vianne agrees. While everyone is getting ready to eat over at Madea's house, Bobby is taking a shower and has to run downstairs to get the soap. First Bobby and Vianne flirt with each other and then Madea tries to flirt with him but he won't buy it. Madea can tell Vianne likes Bobby. Mr. Brown comes back over to eat at Madea's house and brings a dish to share. Everyone has a little fun before supper. (Old Time Mix) Madea puts in her two cents.

She pulls a knife on Anthony freaking everyone out. Everyone tries to calm Vianne down and make her feel better, but nothing seems to work except when Cora talks to her. Bobby continues to flirt with Vianne, and he tells her his story of how he got put in prison. While walking upstairs, Vianne tells Bobby she's not ready for a relationship.(Let Me Hold You) ===Act Two=== Maylee gets a call from the school nurse about Keisha. Anthony tells Maylee that she either must choose him or her daughter, not both because he says she is an out of control teenager. When Keisha arrives home Maylee tells her to put her stuff down and they are going to go to the clinic because Keisha is pregnant from Kelly (one of her friends), but Kelly and Maylee want her to have an abortion. Cora tries to stop her, but Maylee won't have it. Maylee tells Cora about the man Maylee's mother let do whatever she wanted to her, the end result Keisha. Maylee forces Keisha out of the house and Cora is left alone praying for Keisha. (Grace) Madea gets a call from an Eric Jones offering Bobby a job and when Bobby and Vianne come back from a date, Madea relays the message. When Maylee and Keisha get back from the clinic, Madea has already heard about the abortion from Cora and gets mad at both Keisha for getting pregnant, and Maylee for suggesting an abortion. Vianne tries to get Maylee to understand that Anthony doesn't love her. He's only marrying her to get back at Vianne. Maylee doesn't believe Vianne; however Madea does. Bobby tells everyone that he got offered a job in California as Head Foreman, but he's reluctant to accept. Vianne and Bobby force Madea to go upstairs as they talk about their future. Bobby wants marriage and kids, etc., but Vianne doesn't want that right now. As they talk, the doorbell rings and it is Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown is mad at Madea for giving his dog sleeping pills. Madea lies about it but finally comes clean. Mr. Brown thought it was because she wanted him. But he later finds out its because the dog wouldn't stop barking. Vianne and Bobby call the vet. They battle it out in a friendly manner. ===Act Three=== The next day, Bobby packs his bags to move to California. Anthony tries to turn Bobby against Vianne by saying all she'll do is sleep and eat. Bobby tells Anthony Vianne never loved him. Anthony tells Bobby that he either moves away to California because if he stays here; then Anthony will call his probation officer and get him sent back to prison. Anthony also tells Bobby that he went to school with Bobby's probation officer. Police sirens are heard and Madea runs inside the house. Apparently Madea and Maylee were getting their nails done at a nail salon, when one of the employees begins talking about Madea. The employee calls Madea Godzilla, so she shoots up the nail salon and runs like hell back home. Maylee comes back from back from nail salon angry at Madea for what she did. Bobby debates whether to stay or go to California. Vianne tells him to follow his heart. Bobby realizes he really wants to stay with Vianne even though she's not ready for a relationship right now. However, Bobby still walks out the door and heads for California. Madea tells Vianne that she needs to go after her man. Then, after a few minutes of hesitation, Vianne decides to go chase Bobby down before he leaves. However, as soon as Vianne opens the door, Bobby is standing right there. He had never left. Bobby comes inside and proposes to Vianne. Under Madea's direction, Vianne says yes! Before Vianne drives Madea to a casino, Madea makes sure Maylee doesn't try to steal Bobby away, or try to make a play on him. The ladies leave. Maylee congratulates Bobby even though she is jealous of Vianne. Cora doesn't understand why and finally gets Maylee to see the brighter side. Finally, Maylee and Keisha make up and hug. (It’s Gonna Be Hallelujah) Later that day, Maylee brings Anthony's bag downstairs and she tells him that he is going be driving home alone because she is leaving him. After Anthony leaves, Maylee apologizes to everyone for everything. (Lord I’m Sorry) Cora reminds Maylee to always be there for her daughter. (Talkin’ Properrr/Bye Baby ) And with that Bobby and Vianne get married, Mr. Browns dog survives, and as for Madea, she's still alive. ==Original Cast== * Tyler Perry as Madea * Kisha Grandy as Vianne * Tyga Graham as Bobby * Tosha Moore as Maylee * Carl Pertile as Anthony * Tamela Mann as Cora Simmons * David Mann as Mr. Brown ==2002 Film Cast== *Tyler Perry as Madea *Kisha Grandy as Vianne *Tyga Graham as Bobby *Donna Stewart as Maylee *Carl Pertile as Anthony *Elaine O'Neale as Keisha * *Tamela Mann as Cora Simmons *David Mann as Mr. Brown *The character, Keisha, was a new character added to the show for the taped version in 2002. ==Musical numbers== ===Original production=== *\\"Gospel Medley\\" - Company *\\"Bye Baby\\" - Vianne *\\"Let Me Hold You\\" - Bobby *\\"Hallelujah\\" - Cora *\\"Lord, I'm Sorry\\" - Maylee *\\"Bye Baby (Reprise)\\" - Maylee ===Taped 2002 performance=== *\\"Motherless Child\\" – Keisha *\\"Angels Watching Over Me / There's a Leak in This Old Building\\" – Brown, Maylee, Vianne, Cora and Company *\\"Lord, I'm Sorry\\" – Vianne *\\"Let Me Hold You\\" – Bobby *\\"In the Name of Jesus\\" – Cora *\\"Hallelujah\\" – Cora *\\"God Is the Answer\\" - Company ==Film Adaptation== A film adaptation titled I Can Do Bad All By Myself, was released on September 11, 2009.

In the , Agnes Water had a population of 2,210 people. ==Geography== Agnes Water is in Central Queensland approximately south-east of the Bruce Highway, Queensland's major coastal route. It is accessed via the main road called Round Hill Road. It is 90 minutes south of Gladstone, and 90 minutes north of Bundaberg on the Discovery Coast. Agnes Water is the closest access point to the southern Great Barrier Reef. It is a neighbouring town of the Town of 1770. ==History== Prior to European settlement Agnes Water was home to the Meerooni tribe who form the southern part of the Gurang nation. The town of Agnes Water takes its name from pastoral holding first leased by Daniel Clowes in 1883, which he named after the coastal schooner Agnes, which was lost at sea in the area. The schooner left Bustard Head on 15 June 1873, en route from Mackay to Brisbane. Daniel Clowes remained there until his death in 1891. The gravestones of Clowes and his wife are near the present township. There was saw milling in the locality in the 1890s and the wide beach was a popular venue, particularly as buggies could be driven onto the beach. It became a holiday destination, and weekend residences were built, notably on Round Hill where the Town of 1770 was officially named in 1936. However, the town was regarded as somewhat remote, and it was not until the road into the town was completely sealed in the mid 1990s that development really took off. Agnes Water State School was opened on 29 January 1990. The current Agnes Water Public Library opened in 2011 and had a minor refurbishment in 2016. In , the population of Agnes Water was 1,814. Discovery Christian College opened in 2015. Goora Gan Steiner School opened in January 2017. In 2018 Agnes Water became the first cryptocurrency town. Shops, hotels accept cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and NEM. ==Population== thumb In the , Agnes Water had a population of 1814. This figure is made up of 942 males and 872 females with a median age of 41. The town's most common ancestries are English (32.4%), Australian (29.6%), Scottish (8.6%), Irish (7.8%) and German (4.8%). ==Religion== The area of Agnes Water has two local churches - the Agnes Water Baptist Church and the Catholic Church. Both are located on Bicentennial Dve, a short drive from the centre of the area. Census data from 2011 shows that 32.3% of the population do not identify with a religion while 19.6% list Anglican as their religion, followed by Catholicism (16.1%). ==Education== Agnes Water State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 1 Donohue Drive ().

The officer-in-charge Brett Schultz has served the Agnes Community for over ten years. ==Beaches and fishing== The main beach is long, running from Round Hill in the north down to Agnes Water. The beach is relatively straight and faces east-north-east. Most of the beach is backed by a low dune and natural vegetation. At the southern Agnes Water end there is an extensive foreshore reserve, including a camping reserve. The beach usually receives waves averaging about one metre, which combine with the medium sand to build a moderately steep high tide beach, with a continuous bar exposed at low tide. During and following higher swell, up to 30 rip channels are cut across the lower section of the bar and an outer bar forms along the central and northern sections of the beach. The rip channels will persist for some weeks during lower wave conditions. As well as the surf beach, Agnes Water is intersected by rocky headlands and has a stream behind the coastline. A relatively safe beach in the southern patrolled area. == Region Highlights == Agnes Water is predominantly a tourist region that relies on the constant flow of visitors including families that visit the area in peak school holiday seasons and grey nomads that add to the local population in the months from May to September each year. The bulk of local businesses are built around typical town needs and servicing the demands of visitors, with operators such as 1770 LARC! Tours and Scooteroos. Agnes Water has a significantly high proportion of hospitality services per capita to meet the demand of local visitors.

He was a founding member of The La De Das, the leader of Kevin Borich Express, and a founding member of The Party Boys, as well as a session musician for numerous acts. Borich wrote \\"Gonna See My Baby Tonight\\" for The La De Das, which became a top 10 hit in 1971 on the Australian singles chart. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. He performed at some of Australia's biggest rock events including the 1972 Sunbury Pop Festival and the late 1970s Rockarena tours with 60,000 people, featuring Fleetwood Mac, Santana and The Little River Band. He played in two New Year's Eve celebrations at the Sydney Opera House with 70,000 people as well as support shows for international acts including Elton John, Status Quo, Jeff Beck and Buddy Guy. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane has described Borich as \\"one of the most celebrated guitar players in the history of Australian rock. He also remains an underrated songwriter, and his live reputation has rarely been reflected in record sales\\". His son Lucius Borich joined Kevin Borich Express as a drummer and was later a member of Sydney-based progressive rock band Cog. ==Early years== Kevin Borich was born in 1948 in Huapai north west of Auckland on New Zealand's North Island. He attended secondary school at Rutherford High School (Te Atatū) in Te Atatū, a suburb of Auckland. In 1961, at the age of 12, Borich recorded a private single on Astor Records with sisters Judi and Sue Donaldson (later as New Zealand duo The Chicks). As a guitarist, Borich formed The Mergers in late 1963 with fellow students Brett Neilsen on drums and Trevor Wilson on bass guitar. Initially they performed covers of The Shadows' material as an instrumental band after school and on week-ends. Borich is of Croatian descent. ==1964–1975: The La De Das== With the addition of vocalist/rhythm guitarist Phil Key, The Mergers with Borich on lead guitar/vocals, Neilsen on drums/vocals and Wilson on bass guitar, were eventually renamed as The La De Das in 1964 in Auckland, New Zealand. In June 1965 they recorded their debut single, \\"Little Girl\\", and later that year added Bruce Howard on keyboards. From 1966 to 1967 they had five New Zealand top 10 hits, \\"How is the Air Up There?\\", \\"On Top of the World\\", \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"All Purpose Low\\" and \\"Rosalie\\". By 1968 they were based in Sydney and recorded their concept album, The Happy Prince, in 1969 on EMI. Line-up changes occurred, with Borich and Key joined by Peter Roberts on bass guitar and Keith Barber on drums by 1971's Australian Kent Music Report top 10 hit single, \\"Gonna See My Baby Tonight\\". It had been written by Borich, who had established a reputation as \\"Australia's guitar hero supremo\\" and regularly performed \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" using Jimi Hendrix' interpretation of the Bob Dylan song to close The La De Das' live set. In late January 1972, they appeared at the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival and featured on the subsequent double album, Sunbury, released in October by EMI/HMV. The La De Das recorded further albums and singles and despite critical acclaim had little chart success. Only Borich remained throughout until he disbanded the group in 1975. After The La De Das, Borich toured with John Paul Young & the Allstars for some months before forming a new band. ==1976–1989: Kevin Borich Express to The Party Boys== Kevin Borich Express was formed in early 1976 by Borich on lead guitar, lead vocals and occasional flute with Harry Brus on bass guitar (ex-Blackfeather) and Barry Harvey on drums (Wild Cherries, Chain). They recorded a track, \\"The End of Me\\", before Brus and Harvey were soon replaced by Reuben San Fiansco on bass guitar and Gil Matthews on drums. Subsequent line-ups were typically a three piece with a succession of bass guitarists and drummers. They released their debut single, \\"Goin' Somewhere\\", in October using Fiansco, and John Annas on drums (Wendy Saddington Band). Following in March 1977 was their debut album, Celebration! with Annas, and Tim Partridge on bass guitar (Mighty Kong, The Johnny Rocco Band). The album was favoured by critics and peaked in the top 30 on the Australian albums charts. In early 1977, Borich supported the tour by UK rock guitarist Jeff Beck. Mid-1977 saw the release of the band's follow-up album Lonely One. This was followed in October by supporting the Rockarena tour with Fleetwood Mac, Santana and Little River Band; Borich was invited on-stage to jam with Carlos Santana. In May 1978, the band toured the US in support of Australian heavy rockers AC/DC, with Annas, Paul Christie on bass guitar and keyboard player Tim Shafer (Gary Wright Band). This line-up recorded No Turning Back which was released in March 1979. By mid-year, Partridge had returned with both Christie and Shafer departing, and together with Annas, Borich recorded Live!, using the 2JJ mobile studio equipment over performances in Melbourne and Wollongong. Live! contains one of the most incendiary and atmospheric versions of \\"Little Red Rooster\\" ever recorded, along with a number of Borich standards. In July, Kevin Borich Express appeared on Renée Geyer's album Blues License. A European tour by Kevin Borich Express resulted in a compilation album being released in Germany. After the tour, John Watson (Heavy Division) replaced Annas on drums and the band recorded Angel's Hand in November 1979. Similar line-up changes continued into the early 1980s with Michael Deep replacing Partridge in April 1980. This line-up collaborated with solo artist Dutch Tilders to record Blues Had a Baby and They Called It Rock'n'Roll in 1981 on RCA Records. Kerry Jacobsen (Dragon) replaced Watson on drums for the Shy Boys Shy Girls mini-LP in late 1981. By mid-1982, Annas returned on drums, with Steve Balbi on bass guitar, and Andy Cowan on keyboards. Later that year, Borich on guitar joined The Party Boys which was formed by previous band member Paul Christie (now ex- Mondo Rock) on bass guitar, drums and backing vocals, Harvey James (Sherbet) on guitar and Graham Bidstrup (The Angels) on drums. Initially a side-project, The Party Boys, had top 10 success with singles \\"He's Gonna Step on You Again\\" (#1, 1987) and \\"Hold Your Head Up\\" (#7, 1987), and albums Live at Several 21sts (#9, 1983) and The Party Boys (#1, 1987). Consequently, Kevin Borich Express output and touring was reduced during the 1980s. In 1989, Borich left The Party Boys and appeared in Jimmy Barnes band for the 1990 Two Fires tour. Borich won 'Best Guitarist' at the 1977 and 1978 Australian Rock Music Awards. ==1990–present== Borich continues to perform at Australian and international events, in 2011 featuring long time friend Harry Brus on bass and his son Lucius Borich on drums. This lineup released a double CD and DVD under the banner Borich X Borich Live at the Basement. Borich still utilises a spectrum of Australia's best musicians at different times, including John Annas returning on drums with Ian Lees on bass guitar (ex-Moving Pictures), and with two former members John Watson and Harry Brus. He released the CD/DVD package of Live at the Big Kahuna in 1995. A studio album was released in 1998, Heart Starter, with Lucius Borich of Cog on drums and Ben Rosen on bass guitar touring to promote it. Over the 15 years since, Borich has continued to perform the Australian tour circuit and festivals with various line-ups, and released albums Nomad and Borich X Borich, recorded live at Circular Quay's The Basement. His latest studio album is Totem. Borich won the Heritage Award at the 1999 Australian Blues Music Festival and was inducted into the Australian Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2003. ==Cultural influences== Australian band TISM, on their 1990 album Hot Dogma, have tracks called \\"Kevin Borich Expressionism\\" Parts 1, 2 and 4. On the Collected Recordings 1986-1993 Box Set there is a track called \\"Kevin Borich Expressionism\\". Kevin Borich Express playing at Mountain Rock 3 ==Private life== Borich has been married twice and has six children, the youngest three with his second wife Melissa Borich. He was diagnosed with Nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in May 2005 and undertook radiation and chemotherapies. The treatments resulted in the loss of his salivary glands and some hearing. ==Discography== ===Albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  AUS - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Celebration (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: March 1977 * Label: Image (ILP757)  align=\\"center\\"  28 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Lonely One  * Released: November 1977 * Label: Image (ILP 778)  align=\\"center\\"  51 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  No Turning Back (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: March 1979 * Label: Mercury (6357 059)  align=\\"center\\"  48 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Live (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: 1979 * Label: Image/Mushroom (L 37139) * Note: Live album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Blues Had a Baby (as Borich 'n' Tilders)  * Released: November 1980 * Label: Eureka (E 113)  align=\\"center\\"  96 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Angel's Hand (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: December 1980 * Label: Image/Mushroom (L 37181)  align=\\"center\\"  92 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Shy Boys Shy Girls (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: 1982 * Label: Image/Mushroom (L-20008)  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Best of The Kevin Borich Express  * Released: 1988 * Note: Greatest hits album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Collection  * Released: 1992 * Label: KB (555-2) * Note: Greatest hits album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Live at the Big Kahuna  * Released: 1995 * Label: KB (666-2) * Note: Live album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Celebration  * Released: 1996 * Label: RAJON (R0091) * Note: Greatest hits album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Goin' Down Town  * Released: 1996 * Label: RAJON (CDR0790) * Note: Greatest hits album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Heartstarter (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: 1998 * Label: Kevin Borich (888-2)  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  One Night Jamm Live (as Kevin Borich Express)  * Released: 1999 * Label: Kevin Borich (999-2) * Note: Live album  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  'Nomad''  * Released: 2004 * Label: KB (CD0002)  align=\\"center\\"  - - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Live at the Basement (with Lucius Borich, Harry Brus)  * Released: 2009 * Label: SG Productions * Note: Live album  align=\\"center\\"  - - } ==References== ==External links== * Kevin Borich official website * Kevin Borich YouTube channel * Kevin Borich on Facebook * La De Das Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Australian blues guitarists Category:Australian male guitarists Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian people of Croatian descent Category:Australian people of New Zealand descent Category:New Zealand musicians Category:New Zealand people of Croatian descent Category:The Party Boys members Category:People educated at Rutherford College, Auckland ","title":"Kevin Borich"},{"id":"2571575","text":"Miraflores is the name of one of the three locks that form part of the Panama Canal, and the name of the small lake that separates these locks from the Pedro Miguel Locks upstream.

He was a four-time Olympic medallist and led a successful British team to victory in the Davis Cup. ==Biography== Dixon was born on 7 February 1873 in Grantham, Lincolnshire. At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London he won a bronze medal in the men's doubles event. In the 1912 Summer Olympics he won three medals in the indoor tennis events: gold in the mixed doubles, silver in men's singles and bronze in men's doubles. From 1929 to 1932 he represented the International Club of Great Britain against France at Queens and at Auteuil in 1932 and 1933. After retiring from tournaments, he coached juniors and umpired at Wimbledon, becoming President of the Umpire's Association. He died on 29 April 1939. ==Tennis tournaments== Dixon was born in 1873, the year that Major Walter Clopton Wingfield defined the first rules for lawn tennis. Dixon reached his first all comers final at Wimbledon in 1901, beating Harold Mahony before losing to Arthur Gore. A decade later, in 1911, Dixon reached the all comers final again, beating Major Ritchie and Max Decugis before losing to Herbert Roper Barrett. He won the doubles with Roper Barrett in 1912 and 1913. His career included victories in international tournaments overseas: * 1905 Ostend International tournament - won * 1908 Doubles at the Championship of Dieppe (Championnat de Diepper) - won partnering with M.J.G. Ritchie Championnat de Diepper, La Presse, p3, 3 August 1908 * 1911 Surrey Championship, defeating Anthony Wilding in four sets. Dixon was better known at the time for his many successes when representing Britain in the Davis Cup: starting in the 1909 Cup in Philadelphia, he led the British team to victory in the 1912 Cup in Australia.

These two guilds eventually merged with the consent of the Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1502, forming the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers. The guild standardised the craft and acted as a protector of the trade secrets. In 1599, the guild asked Parliament for protection, which was eventually granted in a bill of 1606, which granted the trade protection from outside competition such as plasterers. The Act legislated for a seven-year apprenticeship, and also barred plasterers from painting, unless apprenticed to a painter, with the penalty for such painting being a fine of £5. The Act also enshrined a maximum daily fee of 16 old pence for their labour. Enforcement of this Act by the Painter-Stainers Company was sought up until the early 19th century, with master painters gathering irregularly to decide the fees that a journeyman could charge, and also instigating an early version of a job centre in 1769, advertising in the London newspapers a \\"house of call\\" system to advertise for journeymen and also for journeymen to advertise for work. The guild's power in setting the fee a journeyman could charge was eventually overturned by law in 1827, and the period after this saw the guild's power diminish, along with that of the other guilds; the guilds were superseded by trade unions, with the Operative United Painters' Union forming sometime around 1831. In 1894, a national association formed, recreating itself in 1918 as the National Federation of Master Painters and Decorators of England and Wales, then changing its name once again to the British Decorators Association before merging, in 2002, with the Painting & Decorating Federation to form the Painting & Decorating Association. The Construction Industry Joint Council, a body formed of both unions and business organizations, today has responsibility for the setting of pay levels. ==Activities of the trade== A painter working on an exterior wall in Kolkata, 2010 Historically, the painter was responsible for the mixing of the paint; keeping a ready supply of pigments, oils, thinners and driers. The painter would use his experience to determine a suitable mixture depending on the nature of the job. In modern times, the painter is primarily responsible for preparation of the surface to be painted, such as patching holes in drywall, using masking tape and other protection on surfaces not to be painted, applying the paint and then cleaning up. Larger firms operating within the trade were generally capable of performing many painting or decoration services, from creating an accent wall to sign writing, to the gilding of objects or the finishing or refinishing of furniture. More recently, professional painters are responsible for all preparation prior to painting. All stucco or popcorn or texture scraping, sanding, wallpaper removal, caulking, drywall or wood repair, patching, stain removal, filling nail holes or any defects with plaster or putty, cleaning, taping, preparation and priming are considered to be done by the professional contracted painter. ==See also== *Accent wall *Adhesion testing *Coating *Painterwork *Painting and Decorating Contractors of America *Volatile organic compounds *Wallpaper *Popcorn ceiling ==References== Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Construction trades workers Category:Interior design Category:Paint and coatings industry Category:Painting ","title":"House painter and decorator"},{"id":"2571593","text":"Jared Eliot (November 7, 1685—April 22, 1763) was an American colonial minister, physician, agronomist and farmer. He was located in Guilford, Connecticut and wrote several articles on agriculture and animal husbandry as well as on the mineral qualities of Connecticut lands. He worked at the Yale Corporation (former name of the Yale University's board of trustees) from 1730 until 1763. Eliot was the eldest son of Joseph Eliot and his second wife, Mary Wyllys. The Eliots raised their family in Guilford (formerly known as Menunkatucket), which was settled by Europeans in 1639.Federal writers’ Project. Connecticut. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1938. Pg 92) Jared emulated his father and grandfather, who were also willing to help others; he stated, “I have learned many useful things from the lowest of the People, not only in Rank, but in Understanding too”.Grasso, Christopher. “The Experimental Philosophy of Farming: Jared Eliot and the Cultivation of Connecticut.” The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 50. No. 3. (July 1993): 502-528. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2947364 page 504 == Ancestry == The Eliot name was well known before Jared's birth. His grandfather, John Eliot of Roxbury, Massachusetts, was a missionary to the Massachusett and Wampanoag nations for 40 years, translating the Bible into the Natick language.True, page 185 Herbert Thomas, author of Jared Eliot, states that “(John) Eliot went quite beyond religious doctrine in dealing with the Indians and taught them hygiene and better living”.Thomas, Herbert. Jared Eliot (North Haven: The Shoe String Press, Inc.), 1967. Page 46 John's actions in attempting to help the Indians gave the Eliot name social status in the New England theocracy.True, 186 Jared's father, Joseph Eliot, was also a well-known figure in New England. He graduated from Harvard College in 1658, remaining in Guilford for the rest of his life as a minister at a nearby Congregational church. Joseph was also regarded as a \\"clerical physician\\", due to his interest in medicine. In 1700, there was considerable interest in establishing a college in Connecticut.Oviatt, Edwin. The Beginnings of Yale:1701-1726. New Haven/Yale University Press/1916. page 161 The ministers along the shore of Long Island Sound who originated plans for the college began to arrange a meeting of the ecclesiastical General Assembly. The Assembly agreed to meet in October and was asked to create a new charter (the previous charter had expired, along with the Massachusetts Bay Colony).Oviatt, 162 The college advocates stated their initial intentions by the sending of letters. The purpose of these letters was to seek advice “not only on the educational side, but on the highly important matter of the legality of a Connecticut-Colony-granted charter, and if that were to be legal, what should it contain”.Oviatt, 163 Joseph Eliot was among those chosen to devise the charter, including its “powers of conferring degrees as unobtrusive as possible”.“Yale University.” The Britannica. Vol XXVIII, New York: The Encyclopædia Britannica Company, 1911. Page 899. The Assembly felt that licensing the new college would not provoke animosity in England. Joseph's voice on behalf of Connecticut was significant to his fellow colonists until his unexpected, early death on May 24, 1694.Thoms, 52 ==Family== Jared's family tree – beginning with his grandfather John Eliot and his wife Hannah – is extensive, with several children from each marriage. John and Hannah Eliot had six children. Their first two children were named after them; Hannah was the firstborn, followed by John. Joseph was born on December 20, 1638. Next was Samuel (born June 22, 1641); however, he died shortly after receiving his advanced degree from Harvard in the 1660s. Aaron, the fifth-born, died at age 11. The youngest child was Benjamin; born in January 1647, he graduated from Harvard and became his father's assistant in teaching the Indians.Thoms, 49 Joseph was married twice, fathering children from both marriages (four from each). Joseph first married Sarah, daughter of William and Martha (Burton) Brenton of Rhode Island, in 1676. All of the children borne by Sarah were girls (Mehitabel, Ann, Jemima and Barsheba), and all four daughters married well. Joseph's second marriage was to Mary Wyllys, and Jared was the firstborn of the second marriage; his younger siblings were Mary, Rebecca and Abiel. Both Mary and Rebecca married several times – Mary four times; her last husband was Samuel Hooker of Farmington, Connecticut. Rebecca married three times; her last husband was Capt. William Dudley of North Guilford, Connecticut.Thoms, 53 Jared had a difficult childhood, since his father died when he was only eight years old.True, 186 Since Jared's father and grandfather had both been physicians, he took up the practice.Thoms, 53. Jared also became a minister, in accordance with his father's dying wish. He determined to live a successful life, to preserve his family's reputation; one of his goals was to “obtain a liberal education in ‘an academic course of studies’”. ==Early life and career== Abraham Pierson was a mentor for Eliot. Pierson had graduated from Harvard University in 1668, was ordained by his father Abraham Pierson, the elder, and became minister of the Killingworth Congregational Church in 1694. When he became minister at Killingworth, Pierson began teaching his first classes in the parsonage. He taught in a meeting-house in Killingworth in 1700;Oviatt, 235 this collegiate school is now part of Yale University. Since Pierson was an experienced minister he fell under the purview of the new charter of 1701 which stipulated that the college’s trustees were to be experienced ministers (preferably Congregationalists), residing in the colony.Britannica, 899-900 The charter also stated that the mission of the school was the “instruction of youth ‘in the arts and sciences,’ that they might be suitable for ‘public employment, both in church and civil state’”.“Yale University”, 899 Eliot was one of Pierson’s favorite (and best- known) students.Kelley, Brooks Mather. Yale: A History. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1999. page 16 Eliot graduated from the Collegiate School (later known as Yale College) in 1706. Due to Jared's intelligence and education, Pierson predicted that he (and Samuel Cooke, another student) would become Yale school trustees; Eliot did so in 1730.Levermore, Charles H. “Two Centuries and a Half in Guilford, Connecticut;” The New England Magazine, September 1889-February 1890. page 418.True, 190 In June 1707, Eliot was notified of Pierson’s death; he was ordained on the first of that month, fulfilling his father's wish for one of his sons to become a minister. In September, Jared became the third minister of the Killingworth church. When he assumed the position, the colonists promised that if he were to marry they would give him 60 loads of good firewood each winter.True, 188 Jared married Hannah Smithson (daughter of Samuel Smithson of Brayfield, England) the following winter,True 189 and was minister at the Killingworth church until his death. In addition to his ministerial duties, Eliot was a physician; he is quoted in an article by Rodney True that “it seems natural that the medical and ministerial professions should be thus combined”.True, 191 A physician and a minister would be able to heal a person's body, mind and soul; a person combining both professions was known as a \\"clerical physician\\", as his father had been. Jared entered the medical profession in 1706, when there were 30 towns in New England with populations over 20,000.Thoms, 24 His dual role is attested; “it should not be surprising that both great names in Connecticut medicine in the century spanning 1650-1750 belong to the cleric-physicians Gershom Bulkeley and Jared Eliot”.Thoms, 17 Eliot succeeded Bulkeley as a leader in Connecticut medicine, training about 50 students.Thoms, 20 Eliot's successor as a physician was his son-in-law Benjamin Gale, who received Jared's practice in the mid-1740s.Grasso, 504 Benjamin was also a skilled physician, with a good reputation, and promoted matters of public welfare. ==Essays Upon Field Husbandry== After transferring his medical practice to his son-in-law, Eliot wrote a series of essays on \\"field husbandry\\" (primarily agriculture). The first six concerned ways of improving agriculture; the seventh was about iron-making. The first six essays were collected under the title Essays Upon Field Husbandry. The first of the essays was published in 1748, with the following ones in 1749, 1751, 1753, 1754 and 1759. The last essay was delayed because of the French and Indian War.Thoms, 100 The essay on iron-making was published in 1763. The first three essays were published in New London, Connecticut; essays four and five were published in New York. The sixth agricultural essay was published in New Haven, Connecticut and the iron- making essay was again published in New York. The fact that the essays were published near his home enabled his neighbors and friends to share his accomplishments; “Jared is best seen as a thoughtful and convincing writer”.Thoms, 90 Jared wrote his essays in a flowing, easily understandable style, describing farming in the light of science. He added a religious overtone, asserting that his creatures were working for the “fulfillment of the kingdom”. Each essay had a different topic, ending with an appropriate Biblical verse. The first essay concerned land improvement, a concern throughout the colony. In it, Eliot described how land may be reclaimed for farming. Swamps abound with nutrient-rich soil. Draining part of the land (and diverting the water elsewhere) would improve agriculture; the drained land could support red clover, Indian corn, flax, hemp and watermelons without additional fertilizer.Thoms, 91 Eliot posits that sowing different types of grains – such as oats and peas, or summer wheat and barley – improved the crop of each. The second essay addressed food production in the colonies. Eliot maintained that contemporary crop use was unwise, and it was time to reevaluate agricultural principles. He contended that the underproduction of hay was leading to an over-dependence on corn as a feed for livestock, thereby driving up the price of corn. Eliot suggested fertilizing, to encourage hay production; “the scarcity and high price of hay and corn is so [evident]…that the necessary stock of the Country hath outgrown the meadows, so that there is not hay for such a stock as the present increased number of people really need”.Eliot, Jared. Essays Upon Field Husbandry In New England. New York: Columbia University Press, 1748-1762. Page 27. He also suggested that the present population had outgrown the food supply. The third essay concerned different species of crops, and its publication increased the variety of crops grown in the challenging New England climate. Eliot stressed that not only grains and grasses could be grown, but fruits and vegetables as well. Many types of grain should be grown, because each has a different purpose: flax, barley, wheat, maslin, colewort seed and rapeseed were mentioned.Eliot, 57 He explained the different uses of each, and how each contributes to the growth of the colonies. Grasses mentioned are hard grass, spire grass, \\"foreign artificial\\" grass and two English grasses: La Lauren and St. Foin.Eliot, 63 “As we ought to propagate various sorts of Grain and Grass, that so we may have the advantage of all sorts of Land and Seasons, so we should adapt out Tillage to the various sorts if Land which we Improve”. The fourth essay consisted of discussions of husbandry with other farmers and scientists. Eliot aimed to demonstrate to the colonists that improvements were needed by indicating how alternative techniques were effectively used elsewhere.Thoms, 96-97 Other farmers comment to Eliot about how the ideas from his previous essays have affected them; for example, seaweed, wet leaves and sea salt might be used for fertilizer.Eliot, 88 The fifth essay concerned problems with tillage (in this case, the land which is worked – by plowing, sowing and harvesting crops). Eliot adapted ideas which had been recently formulated by Jethro Tull, an English writer on tilling. Eliot took some of Tull's inventions and improved them; for example, there had been little improvement in Tull's plow (developed 23 years earlier in England).True, 206 Eliot attempted to improve Tull's machine, with the aid of President Clap (of Yale College) and Behoni Hillyard, a wheelwright in Killingworth.Thoms, 98 Eliot's plow was less expensive and easier to use than Tull's plow; however, when he tested his drill plow in the fields he discovered that the wheels did not work well in the rough, rigid soil.Grasso, 509 After many changes, he finally finished his version of the drill plow; some of his readers remained skeptical, fearing that “The drill plows would never come into general use”.Grasso, 510 The sixth essay took longer to write than the others, touching on the production of silk and mulberry bushes.True, 210 Eliot asserted that his essays reached as far as Great Britain, where his philosophy and ideas were also applied. He wrote, “When I first applied myself to the writing Essays upon Field-Husbandry, I did not expect those small Tracts, calculated to our soil, Meridian, and Climate, would ever extend farther than to a small Circle of Neighbors”.Eliot, 127 Since the essays had found a wider audience, he thought it would be wise to “apply ourselves to the raising silk”.Eliot, 133 He asked an anonymous farmer who had been growing silk in New England for years how he did so successfully. Eliot also inquired how the farmer profited from it. He explained the efforts of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce to establish silk-making in Connecticut, and speculated on which land in Connecticut (north or south) is better suited to the growth of silk. Medal awarded to Jared Eliot in 1762, by the London Institute, “for producing malleable iron from the American black sand.” Jared is discussed toward the end of this article on his grandfather. The seventh essay was not part of the Essays Upon Field Husbandry, but it concerned a new way to manufacture iron from a substance found in New England. This essay was entitled An Essay On The Invention or Art of Making Very Good, If Not The Best Iron, From Black Sea Sand. Eliot recounted how he experimented with \\"black sea sand\\" for use in iron-making. In 1744 Eliot's uncles, Aaron Eliot and Ichabod Miller, succeeded in making more than a half-ton of steel at the furnace in Sansbury. Since the only place to get steel-making materials was New York, there was a need to find sources closer to home. Jared revealed that he was part of a group of investigators who secured an ore bed at Sansbury (by a patent grant from the Great Assembly) to find something to make into iron. This essay concerned the experiments and findings from using black sea sand to make iron.Thoms, 101 Eliot's essays were not widely accepted in New England until the 19th century. However, some contemporaries recognized his efforts to improve farming practices.Grasso, 505 Among those he inspired were Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. Both men felt that Eliot's essays were an important contribution to the development of the colonies. These essays supported colonial interests and imperial designs involving communication with the other colonies and Britain. Eliot also attempted trade with other countries, but was unsuccessful before his death on April 22, 1763. In 1765 the Stamp Act was invoked by the British, and communication between the colonies and Britain became impossible.Grasso, 506 ==Legacy== Two years before his death, Eliot made his will. It stated, “I will and bequeath to the President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven, ten pounds of lawful money, the interest of which sum shall be applied to the use of the library, in buying books from time to time, according to their best skill”, this was the first Yale college library fund. He felt it was important to return something to the place that made him into the well-educated individual he was. Eliot's multifaceted life had a positive impact on the Connecticut colony. Eliot's house in Guilford, Connecticut, built in 1723, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. == References == Category:1685 births Category:1763 deaths Category:18th-century American physicians Category:People of colonial Connecticut Category:People from Guilford, Connecticut Category:Yale University alumni Category:Yale University administrators ","title":"Jared Eliot"},{"id":"2571631","text":"RASU or Rasu may refer to: * Joshua Rasu, a Vanuatuan cricketer * Monte Rasu, a mountain in Sardinia, Italy * Perumal Rasu, an Indian poet * Rangoon Arts and Sciences University, former name of University of Yangon, Myanmar * Rasu Jilani * Rasu Kami, a village in the Indian state of Tripura * Rasu Madhuravan, a Tamil film director ","title":"RASU"},{"id":"2571637","text":"WVOG (600 kHz, \\"Gospel 600\\") is an AM radio station in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In 1965, Waagenvord launched 98.5 WWOM-FM (now WYLD-FM), and in 1967, he added a TV station, channel 26 WWOM-TV (now WGNO). In the 1970s, the station's power increased to 1,000 watts, but it still was not authorized to broadcast at night. In 1974, the station was bought by F. W. Robbert, the current owner. He switched to a Christian radio format as WVOG.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-95 In the early 2010s, the station received authorization to broadcast at night, although with the low power of 31 watts. ==References== ==External links== *WVOG official website *FCC History Cards for WVOG WVOG Category:Gospel radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1953 Category:Christian radio stations in Louisiana ","title":"WVOG"},{"id":"2571640","text":"Sigrid Fick (née Frenckell; 28 March 1887 – 4 June 1979) was a Finnish-born tennis player who moved to Sweden in 1910.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall, and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson and Ed Bye. It was first aired on BBC2 on 19 June 1984. ==Plot== Outside shot of the victimised bank The quartet have taken their final exams and are enjoying the summertime, although Vyvyan is bored and begins to want violence and destruction. Rick suggests Botticelli to relieve the boredom, but his playing style proves too tedious and Vyvyan proposes cricket instead. In the living room, Rick is given the role of stumps and Vyvyan is bowler to Mike's batsman. The first shot knocks out Neil as he enters the room; the second involves Vyvyan not releasing the ball and running straight for Rick, clouting him on the head. Mike suggests that Vyvyan obtain The Ashes for winning, which he promptly tries to do by setting Rick on fire. Neil reveals it is his birthday, much to the indifference of the others. The four decide to watch the television, but the channels are all closing down, infuriating Vyvyan who kicks the TV to pieces. Rick then learns of his parents' sudden death from Mike, who thought it unimportant to mention earlier. Jerzei Balowski arrives to check on the house and its belongings, but on discovering several destroyed items, including the television, Jerzei evicts them all onto the street. The next morning, the four are seen living on the streets as John Otway performs his song \\"Body Talk\\", provoking Vyvyan to comment: \\"I'll bloody well make his body talk in a minute!\\". The four later receive their exam results from the postman, who has already read the letters and tells Rick that he \\"came bottom in the whole world\\", followed by Vyvyan, Mike, and Neil coming top out of the four. Mike then hatches a plan to rob a bank, using water pistols and Vyvyan's Ford Anglia as a getaway vehicle. They mess up their own robbery, but unwittingly take the proceeds from a separate ongoing one, and escape to Vyvyan's car, which he had parked in front of a lamppost. Vyvyan promptly crashes it into the lamppost. Inconsolable at crashing his car, he also reveals that his hamster SPG has died, as he was sleeping on the car's radiator when the car crashed. With the police sirens in the distance, Rick leaves to find a new getaway vehicle, and returns with an AEC Routemaster double-decker bus, which they drive away to freedom. As they sing songs and plan for their future, Rick suddenly shouts: \\"Look out, Cliff!\\", as the bus crashes into a Cliff Richard concert billboard and later immediately plunges over a cliff on the other side. The bus lands at the bottom of a quarry, and there is a pause until the lads remark: \\"Phew, that was close!\\", which is followed by the bus exploding into flames as the show comes to an end. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). The episode also features their landlord Jerzei Balowski (Alexei Sayle) for his only time during the second series, and for the third time in total. No explanation is given for how he survived being locked in Mike's room with man eating lions or reverted from being a homicidal ax-wielding maniac. A postman is played by Lenny Henry, while Jools Holland and Norman Lovett cameo as bank customers. Stephen Frost also makes an appearance, playing the bank manager. DJ Alan Freeman plays God while sitting at a radio mixing desk, for the second time in the series. ==References* Category:1984 British television episodes Category:British television series finales Category:Television episodes about theft Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2571655","text":"Johan Carl Kempe (8 December 1884 – 8 July 1967) was leader of the Swedish pulp and paper industry Mo och Domsjö AB (now Holmen Group) and involved in several other companies in the large economic sphere of the Kempe family. He was also a silver medalist in tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.Carl Kempe. Swedish Olympic Committee ==Biography== Carl Kempe was born at Jakobs församling in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of industrialist Frans Kempe (1847-1924) and Eva Charlotta Kempe ( Treffenberg). He finished secondary school at Norra Latin in Stockholm, studied at Uppsala University 1903–1905 and started to work for Mo och Domsjö in 1906. His father had been employed by the family company since 1875, became its managing director in 1884 and chairman of the board in 1908. During this period, the company expanded sharply and acquired other operations with sawmills and forest land. In 1903, the first pulp factory Mo och Domsjö opened in at Domsjö in Örnsköldsvik. During the first decades of the 20th century, pulp mills were established in Hörnefors and Husum. Carl Kempe had studied abroad and followed his father on business trips in foreign countries. He succeeded his father as CEO of Mo och Domsjö in 1917. The company he took over from his father had retained many traits of a traditional lumber producer. During the 1920s, technical advances in the wood industry had began and were carried out on a large scale. Chemical laboratories were established and extensive wood research was initiated. Through large investments in research and development, Carl Kempe was chiefly responsible for its transformation into a modern chemical industry. Kempe himself claimed that he spent his time at university in Uppsala mostly with playing tennis, attending dancing lessons and playing cards; the first of these pastimes, at least, led to his winning a tennis silver medal at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm in the men's indoor doubles event together with Gunnar Setterwall (1881-1928). Ekolsund Manor In 1917, Carl Kempe bought Ekolsund Manor at Enköping Municipality in Uppsala County. During the period 1928–1930, he had the southern lane restored and modernized according to drawings by actor, art director and architect Vilhelm Bryde (1888-1974). The estate was used as a residence for his family. He had shown an interest in Chinese art since the 1920s and filled the manor house with Chinese artifacts. Shortly before his death in 1967, Kempe left Ekolsund to the daughters of his second marriage. ==Personal life== Carl Kempe married Helfrid Ingeborg Margareta Hammarberg (1885-1975) in 1919. He was married in 1934 to Aagot Marianne Axell. He was the father of five children. He died during 1967 at Enköping in Uppsala County. ==See also== *Holmen (company) ==References== ==Bibliography== *Gunnar Unger, \\"Kempe, Johan Carl\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Vol. 21 (1975–1977), pp. 58–60. ==External links== *Holmen Group website Category:1884 births Category:1967 deaths Category:People from Stockholm Category:Swedish businesspeople Category:20th- century businesspeople Category:Swedish industrialists Category:Sportspeople from Stockholm Category:Swedish male tennis players Category:Olympic tennis players of Sweden Category:Tennis players at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for Sweden Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:Medalists at the 1912 Summer Olympics ","title":"Carl Kempe"},{"id":"2571685","text":"Emma Hardinge Britten Emma Hardinge Britten taken by William H. Mumler. Emma Hardinge Britten (2 May 1823 - 2 October 1899) was an English advocate for the early Modern Spiritualist Movement. Much of her life and work was recorded and published in her speeches and writing on the spiritual movement, and an incomplete autobiography was edited by her sister. She is remembered as a writer, orator, and practitioner of the movement. Her books, Modern American Spiritualism (1870) and Nineteenth Century Miracles (1884), are detailed accounts of the history of early modern spiritualism movement in America. ==Early years== Emma Floyd was born in London, England in 1823. Her father Ebenezer, who was a schoolteacher, died in 1834 when Emma was eleven years old. She grew up supporting herself and her family as a musician, trained as an opera singer and began a stage career. ==Career== She developed a reputation for apparent abilities as a spiritual medium during her early years. As a child, Emma had a habit of predicting the futures of people she encountered, relating to them what she had seen in visions, along with information about their deceased relatives of whom she had no prior knowledge. She also developed the amusing talent of preemptively playing songs on the piano, which her audience was thinking (to themselves!) of requesting. According to her autobiography, Emma's clairvoyant tendencies drew her into participation with a secret London occult society which used magnetics and clairvoyant techniques for experimental purposes. During this period, she was also exposed to sexism and economic discrimination through her involvement with a manipulative member of the society whom she later termed \\"a baffled sensualist.\\" Although there is little reliable information on this London occult group, it is suspected that Emma received the name Hardinge from this society, the surname she kept throughout her adult life. She came to America and while in New York City, she attended Spiritualist séances in the hopes of writing about the gullibility of Americans. During these séances, she begin to experience events from her dramatic childhood. Under the guidance of medium Ada Hoyt, these mystical experiences at séances led her to becoming a part of the Spiritualist movement. Emma was invited by the famous Spiritualist, Horace Day, to host spiritualist séances in the Society for the Diffusion of Spiritual Knowledge. She deepened her involvement in the Spiritualist movement as a \\"trance lecturer\\" and delivered speeches across the country. Lecture topics included \\"The Discovering of Spirits,\\" “The Philosophy of the Spirit Circle,\\" “Hades,\\" and \\"What Is the Basis of the Connection of the Natural and Spiritual Worlds?” Hardinge also became involved in the campaign efforts of 1864 in support of Abraham Lincoln's re-election. After delivering a highly successful lecture titled, \\"The Coming Man; or the Next President of the United States,\\" Emma was invited to continue her political work on a thirty- two lecture tour. Perhaps the culmination of her oratorical career was a speech delivered on 14 April 1865, as a response to President Lincoln's assassination only thirty-six hours prior. Her speech was widely acclaimed by the journalists of the age as her greatest achievement. Still, not all of her spiritual lectures were so well received. In 1866, The Saturday Review wrote a satirical critique of Hardinge's speeches, describing her style as \\"bloated eloquence\\" and her content as \\"bunkum.” As a chronicle of her active religious participation, Hardinge published the book Modern American Spiritualism (1870), a huge \\"encyclopedia\\" of the people and events associated with the early days of the movement. That same year, Emma married an ardent spiritualist, William Britten, from Boston. Emma continued to publish under the surname Hardinge, however, since her professional career was well- developed before this late-life marriage. In 1872, Emma attempted to start a magazine, The Western Star, however, after a series of devastating fires in Boston, her impoverished clients dropped their subscriptions. The magazine failed after only six issues. Emma then moved back to New York, where she became involved in theosophy. She was also one of six founding members of the Theosophical Society with Helena Blavatsky until they had a falling-out. She also edited a book called Art Magic or Mundane, Sub-Mundane and Super-Mundane Spiritism: A Treatise in Three parts and Twenty Three Sections on the subject of Theosophy. It was written anonymously and published in 1876 by 'the author' with the help of 'his [sic] highly esteemed English friend, Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten'. There remains a strange mystery regarding its authorship. In addition, in 1887 she founded The Two Worlds, a weekly Spiritualist newspaper. From 1878 to 1879, Emma and her husband worked as Spiritualist missionaries in Australia and New Zealand. After returning to New York, she wrote her greatest chronicle of the spiritualist age—Nineteenth Century Miracles (1884). Emma Hardinge died in Manchester, England in 1899. She is credited with defining the seven principles of Spiritualism which, with minor changes, are still in use today by the National Spiritualist Association of Churches in the United States and the Spiritualists' National Union in the United Kingdom. ==Publications== *Modern American Spiritualism (1870) *Nineteenth Century Miracles (1884) *The Place and Mission of Women: An Inspirational Discourse (1859) *Outline Of A Plan For A Self-Sustaining Institution For Homeless And Outcast Females (1858) *American and Her Destiny (1861) *The Wildfire Club (1861) *A Funeral Oration on Rev.

The FLS included Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The FLS disbanded after Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa in 1994. In April 1975, the Frontline States – then consisting of Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia – were formally recognised as an entity as a committee of the Assembly of the Heads of State of the Organisation of African Unity. They were joined by Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975) and Zimbabwe (1980) when those countries gained their independence. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere was the chairman until he retired in 1985. His successor was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda. The countries met regularly to coordinate their policies. Their mission was complicated by the fact that the economies of nearly all the FLS countries were dependent on South Africa, and many of their citizens worked there. Nevertheless, the FLS supported and sheltered groups opposed to white rule, not only in South Africa (the African National Congress), but also in Namibia (SWAPO), which was controlled by South Africa. These states provided asylum for exiled South African political activists and allowed the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to set up headquarters within their borders. The ANC was declared as the official representative of the South African People by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity whilst its headquarters was officially in Lusaka. Thousands of South African youth traveled to these states to receive training in sabotage and guerrilla warfare. The Frontline States suffered greatly for their opposition and became the target of South Africa's policy of regional destabilization; South Africa launched military incursions in Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique and supported rebel groups seeking to topple the regimes in Angola (UNITA) and Mozambique (RENAMO). American relations with the Frontline States reached their peak during the human rights push of the Carter administration. Under the Reagan administration's Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chester Crocker, the Frontline States were engaged diplomatically to reach landmark peace accords between South Africa, Mozambique, Angola (Lusaka Protocol), and Namibia (New York Accords). ==Other uses== The term \\"frontline states\\" is also used for countries bordering any area of crisis in the world.\\"World Day to Combat Desertification\\" (18 June 2014) AllAfrica.com, Washington ==See also== * Former Liberation Movements of Southern Africa ==References== Category:Organizations established in the 1960s Category:International organizations based in Africa Category:Former international organizations Category:Southern Africa ","title":"Frontline States"},{"id":"2571700","text":"Sulphatara or Solfatara is an Italian term for a volcanic vent that releases gaseous substances containing sulfur.

He played at the 1908 Summer Olympics and at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden where he won a bronze medal in the men's singles tournament. In 1912, he also reached the final at the World Hard Court Championships at Paris which he lost to his compatriot Otto Froitzheim. At Wimbledon, he reached his best result in 1913 where he advanced to the semifinals before being stopped by Stanley Doust. Besides tennis, Kreuzer also excelled at rugby. He won the German championships with his club SC 1880 Frankfurt in 1910, and played several caps for Germany. At the end of July 1914, he and Otto Froitzheim played the semifinal of the International Lawn Tennis Challenge at Pittsburgh against Australasia. When World War I broke out, the president of the local tennis club kept this from Froitzheim and Kreuzer as he didn't want to disrupt the match. The German team lost 0–5. On their way back to Germany, their Italian steamboat America was halted off Gibraltar by a British warship and they were placed in a prison in Gibraltar for several months before being sent to detention camps in England. While Kreuzer stayed at a camp near Leeds, officer Froitzheim was kept at Donnington Hall until the end of the war in 1918. In 1920 he won the International German Championships at the Rothenbaum club in Hamburg, defeating Louis Maria Heyden in the final in three straight sets. After he retired from playing tennis tournaments, Kreuzer settled at Wiesbaden, near his friend Froitzheim. He died there on 3 May 1968. ==References* Category:1887 births Category:1968 deaths Category:German male tennis players Category:Olympic tennis players of Germany Category:Tennis players at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Germany Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:Medalists at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:SC 1880 Frankfurt players Category:Sportspeople from Frankfurt ","title":"Oscar Kreuzer"},{"id":"2571718","text":"WQNO is a station based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The station is owned by Catholic Community Radio, Inc. and broadcasts at 690 kHz with a power level of 9,100 watts daytime and 2,100 watts nighttime. The station mostly runs Roman Catholic programming from EWTN radio. The facilities of the station, previously called WTIX, were severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August 2005. The station had the target date to resume broadcasting on December 1, and in November requested the new letters WIST. Other stations have used the WTIX letters in the years since 2005. On November 6, 2014 WQNO was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit to decrease day power to 9,100 watts and decrease night power to 2,100 watts. The permit expired on November 6, 2017.Application for Construction Permit for Commercial Broadcast Station - Federal Communications Commission ==History== WTIX, which was originally at 1450 until 1958, was a very successful Top 40 powerhouse throughout the 1960s and 1970s owned by Todd Storz's Mid-Continent Broadcasting Company. (The 690 facility had signed on in 1948 as WWEZ, owned by the Sky Broadcasting Service; when Storz bought 690, WTIX moved from the 1450 facility.) In 1954 WTIX was the first radio station to air a Top 40 radio show. The program director who developed the format was William L. Armstrong who later served as a U. S. Senator from Colorado. Generations of New Orleanians were familiar with their signature call jingle \\"WTIX, We Love You,\\" and the station was referred to as, \\"Fun-Lovin' WTIX, The Mighty 690!\\" Famed jockeys on The Mighty 690 during its heyday included The Real Robert Mitchell, Russell Glen \\"Buzz\\" Bennett, Ted Green, Deane Johnson, Marc Sommers, \\"Skinny\\" Tom Cheney, J. Andrew Michaels, Todd Bauer, Kathy Fischman, Larry Hamilton, Michael Green, Chuck Kirr, \\"Hot\\" Rod Glenn, Marty Maxwell, Terry Young, Bobby Reno, \\"King\\" Bob Walker, Marty \\"With the Party\\" Maxwell, \\"TK\\" Terry Knight, Ed Clancy and Don Anthony. (Hot Rod, Reno, Knight and Walker would later DJ for WTIX-FM.) In the 1970s, WTIX was a current based Top 40 format focusing on new music and going back only a couple years. By 1980, WTIX began to mix in more 1970s hits and some popular 1960s hits. They evolved into an adult leaning top 40 format at that point, which would be considered Hot AC today. By 1983, WTIX evolved into more of an adult contemporary format and was gold based by 1985. In the course of 1987, WTIX gradually dropped current product and 1980s music and attempted to switch to an all oldies format playing music mostly from 1964 to 1969 with a moderate amount of pre-1964 oldies and 1970s hits. WTIX's ratings were declining due to FM radio fast becoming the norm). In 1988, WTIX shifted to a hybrid Talk/Oldies format playing music during the day and weekends with talk at night. This would last until April 1988, when they began to slowly phase out the Oldies format in favor of All-Talk. The exception to the talk format was 4 hours each Sunday, which owner George Buck reserves for two of his passions, playing 2 hours of dixieland jazz and swing music, followed by two hours rebroadcasting transcriptions of old time radio shows, which Buck himself announced from a studio in his French Quarter home via a line to the station's main studio. Previous notable WTIX talk radio hosts include Ron Hunter, Robert Namer, and long time radio personality Keith Rush. At one time, in the 1980s, there was a weekly call-in talk show hosted by former professional wrestler Buck \\"Yellow Belly\\" Robley. The topics were about professional wrestling. In 2005, WTIX dropped their call letters taking the calls WIST. Than after 21 years as an All-Talk station, The Mighty 690 reverted to its musical roots by adopting an America's Greatest Music format on January 1, 2009, which was an oldies based format with some New Orleans music mixed in, though it still retained a Talk Block from Noon to 6:00 pm, Eric Asher (noon-3:00 p.m.) and Kaare Johnson (3:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.) (according to the official WIST website). The format lasted less than a year and ratings were very low still so WIST announced on December 28, 2009 that they were abandoning the America's Greatest Music format and bringing in Fox Sports Radio to go along with its local talk block that was then 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. WIST was also now the flagship for all Tulane athletics play-by-play. On December 8, 2012, WIST was sold to a Catholic Community Radio, Inc. They changed their format from sports talk to Roman Catholic religious programming and changed their call letters to WQNO on December 19, 2012. The station now runs Catholic programming from EWTN, Ave Maria, and Catholic Answers but also runs a number of local programs such as \\"Wake Up Louisiana\\", live mass from St. Louis Cathedral, a food/restaurant show \\"Around the Table\\", an apologetics program, and other local shows that feature south Louisiana Catholic culture. ==References*New Orleans Radio Shrine - WTIX And New Orleans Radio Thru The Years WQNO Category:Radio stations established in 1953 ","title":"WQNO"},{"id":"2571735","text":"Henry Albert Canet (17 April 1878 – 25 July 1930) was a male tennis player from France.

The Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Shorter Catechism have been adopted as doctrinal standards by a number of Reformed and Presbyterian Christian denominations. Following the approval of the Confession and catechisms by the Church of Scotland in 1648, printers in England and Scotland began publishing them with other religious documents in collections referred to as the Westminster Standards. In 1658 printers began including the full Scripture passages which are cited in the confessional documents. These collections became standardized in a 1728 edition, which follows a 1679 work published by Covenanters exiled in Holland and contains twenty-two documents including parliamentary acts related to the Assembly and devotional works. These collections were intended to serve as ecclesiastical manuals as well as comprehensive popular religious books. The 1728 form of the Standards continues to be printed by the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. In the nineteenth century, several churches separated from the Church of Scotland on the basis of the established church's departure from a list of documents similar to those found in standard collections of the Westminster Standards.

She is the most widely known diwata in Philippine mythology and was venerated in pre-colonial Philippines as a goddess known as Dayang Masalanta or Dian Masalanta who was invoked to stop deluges, storms, and earthquakes. Maria Makiling is the guardian spirit of the mountain, responsible for protecting its bounty and thus is also a benefactor for the townspeople who depend on the mountain's resources. In addition to being a guardian of the mountain, some legends also identify Laguna de Bay-and the fish caught from it-as part of her domain. She was sent by Bathala to aid the people of the area in their everyday life. It is often said that Mount Makiling resembles the profile of a woman, said to be Maria herself. This phenomenon is described as true from several different perspectives, so there is no single location associated with this claim. The mountain's various peaks are said to be Maria's face and two breasts, respectively, and her hair cascades downwards a gentle slope away from her body. Maria Makiling is a prominent example of the mountain goddesses motif in Philippine mythology, other prominent examples being Maria Sinukuan of Pampanga's Mount Arayat and Maria Cacao on Cebu's Mount Lantoy. ==Etymology== Legends do not clarify whether this spirit was named after the mountain or the mountain was named after her. The evolution of the name, however, presents some clues. ===\\"Maria\\" or \\"Dayang\\": \\"the lady\\"=== The name \\"Mariang Makiling\\" is the Spanish-Tagalog contraction of \\"Maria ng Makiling\\" (Maria of Makiling). The term is a Hispanicized evolution of an alternate name for the Diwata, \\"Dayang Makiling\\"-\\"dayang\\" being an Austronesian word meaning \\"princess\\" or \\"noble lady\\". Prior to the conversion of the natives to Christianity, Maria Makiling was already known as Makiling, an anito sent by Bathala in Mount Makiling to aid mankind in their daily tasks. The \\"Maria\\" was added by the Spanish in a bid to rebrand her as Catholic. Professor Grace Odal of the University of the Philippines believes there is a significant link between Maria Makiling and the mythical woman (Ba'i) for whom the town of Bay and the lake of Laguna de Bay are named. When the lady of the lake also became associated with the nearby mountain, the common description of her became that of the \\"lady of the mountain\\". ===Makiling: \\"crooked\\" or \\"bent\\"=== As for the word \\"Makiling\\", it has been noted that the mountain rises from Laguna de Bay \\"to a rugged top and breaks into irregular hills southward, thus 'leaning' or 'uneven.'\\" The Tagalog word for \\"leaning\\" or \\"uneven\\" is \\"makiling\\". This corresponds with the common belief that the profile of the mountain resembles that of a reclining woman, from certain angles. A less often mentioned possible origin for the name of the mountain is that the name describes the mountain as having plenty of the bamboo variety known as \\"kawayang kiling\\" (Bambusa vulgaris schrad). By this etymology, the mountain would have been named after the bamboo and the lady named after the mountain. ==Appearance== Descriptions of Maria Makiling are fairly consistent. She is a breathtakingly beautiful young woman who never ages. Lanuza describes her as having \\"light olive skin, long shining black hair, and twinkling eyes.\\" It is said that the abundance and serenity of the enchanted mountain complements Maria's own persona. She is also closely associated with the white mist that often surrounds the mountain. While in just a few stories either her skin or hair is white, in most tales, it is her radiant clothing which makes people who have seen her think that perhaps they just saw a wisp of cloud through the trees and mistook it for Maria. ==Home on the mountain== Unlike Maria Sinukuan and Maria Cacao who live in caves in their respective mountains, Makiling is often described as living in a humble hut. In some stories, this hut is situated in the village, among the people, where Maria Makiling lived before she fled to the mountains after having been offended for some reason. In other stories, the hut is up in the mountain and can only be found if one is allowed by Maria to find it. ==Legends of Maria Makiling== Because stories about Maria Makiling were part of oral tradition long before they were documented, there are numerous versions of the Maria Makiling legend. Some of these are not stories per se, but superstitions. ===Superstitions about Maria Makiling=== One superstition is that every so often, men would disappear into the forests of the mountain. It is said that Makiling has fallen in love with that particular man and has taken him to her house to be her husband, to spend his days in matrimonial bliss. Another superstition says that one can go into the forests and pick and eat any fruits one might like, but never carry any of them home. In doing so, one runs the risk of angering Maria Makiling. One would get lost and be beset by insect stings and thorn pricks. The only solution is to throw away the fruit and then to reverse one's clothing as evidence to Maria that one is no longer carrying any of her fruit. ===Turning Ginger into gold=== Perhaps the most common \\"full\\" story is that of Maria turning ginger into gold to help one villager or the other. In these stories, Maria is said to live in a place known to the villagers and interacts with them regularly. The villager in question is often either a mother seeking a cure for her ill child or a husband seeking a cure for his wife. The wise Maria recognizes the symptoms as signs not of disease, but of hunger brought about by extreme poverty. She gives the villager some ginger, which, by the time the villager gets home, has magically turned to gold In versions where the villager is going home to his wife, he unwisely throws some of the ginger away because it had become too heavy to carry. In some versions, the villagers love her all the more for her act of kindness. In most, however, greedy villagers break into Maria's garden to see if her other plants were really gold. Distressed by the villager's greed, Maria runs away up the mountain, her pristine white clothing soon becoming indistinguishable from the white clouds that play amongst the trees on the upper parts of the mountains. ===Spurned Lover=== In many other stories, Makiling is characterized as a spurned lover. In one story, she fell in love with a hunter who had wandered into her kingdom. Soon the two became lovers, with the hunter coming up the mountain every day. They promised to love each other forever. When Maria discovered that he had met, fell in love with, and married a mortal woman, she was deeply hurt. Realizing that she could not trust townspeople because she was so different from them, and that they were just using her, she became angry and refused to give fruits to the trees, let animals and birds roam the forests for hunters to catch, and let fish abound in the lake. People seldom saw her, and those times when she could be seen were often only during pale moonlit nights. In another version of the story, told by the Philippines' National Hero, Jose Rizal, Maria falls in love with a farmer, whom she then watches over. This leads the townspeople say he is endowed with a charm, or mutya, as it is called, that protected him from harm. The young man was good at heart and simple in spirit, but also quiet and secretive. In particular, he would not say much of his frequent visits into the wood of Maria Makiling. But then war came to the land, and army officers came recruiting unmarried young men. The man entered an arranged marriage so that he could stay safely in the village. A few days before his marriage, he visits Maria one last time. \\"I hope that you were devoted to me,\\" she said sadly, \\"but you need an earthly love, and you do not have enough faith in me besides. I could have protected you and your family.\\" After saying this, she disappeared. Maria Makiling was never seen by the peasants again, nor was her humble hut ever rediscovered. ===The Three Suitors=== Michelle Lanuza tells another version of the story, set during the later part of the Spanish occupation: > Maria was sought for and wooed by many suitors, three of whom were the > Captain Lara, a Spanish soldier; Joselito, a Spanish mestizo studying in > Manila; and Juan who was but a common farmer. Despite his lowly status, Juan > was chosen by Maria Makiling. Spurned, Joselito and Captain Lara conspired > to frame Juan for setting fire to the cuartel of the Spanish. Juan was shot > as the enemy of the Spaniards. Before he died, he cried Maria's name out > loud. The diwata quickly came down from her mountain while Captain Lara and > Joselito fled to Manila in fear of Maria's wrath. When she learned what > happened, she cursed the two, along with all other men who cannot accept > failure in love. Soon, the curse took effect. Joselito suddenly contracted > an incurable illness. The revolutionary Filipinos killed Captain Lara. \\"From then on,\\" Lanuza concludes, \\"Maria never let herself be seen by the people again. Every time somebody gets lost on the mountain, they remember the curse of the diwata. Yet they also remember the great love of Maria Makiling.\\" ==Modern sightings== Mount Makiling still abounds with superstitions and stories concerning Makiling. When people get lost on the mountain, the disappearances are still attributed to the diwata or to spirits who follow her. A common story is that of a group of hikers who leave their camp dirty with human waste and empty cans and bottles. Searching for water, the hikers find themselves befuddled, coming back to the same place over and over again. Only after they cleaned their camp did they manage to find water. In the University of the Philippines Los Baños, a university that sits on the foot of Mount Makiling, students still tell stories of a woman in white who is sighted walking down the long uphill road heading to the Upper (College of Forestry) Campus. Sometimes, the woman appears to be trying to hitch a ride down the mountain. Invariably, the observers are said to be frightened and just ignore the woman, believing her to be Maria Makiling. The unusual weather patterns on the mountain area are also often attributed to Maria Makiling. Often this means sudden rains whenever particularly noisy events are held in the areas near the mountain. Locals say that the diwata does not approve of the event. Acclaimed stage and screen actor and director Behn Cervantes relates a reverse version of this legend, during the launching program for the UP Alumni Association's Maria Makiling Foundation, an advocacy group formed for the protection and conservation of Mount Makiling: ==In art and popular culture== Maria Makiling is a common theme among Filipino artists, ranging from painters and sculptors to graphic novelists. *One prominent depiction of Maria Makiling can be found on the Seal of the Municipality of Los Baños, Laguna. It depicts Maria makiling in the foreground with the mountain in the background and water (representing Laguna de Bay) at her feet. *A statue of Maria Makiling was once put up in front of UPLB's main library. It depicts the diwata surrounded by various creatures of the forest, most noticeably a doe and some birds. The statue has since been replaced by that of the \\"Philippine Pegasus\\" or \\"Pegaraw\\". The original statue was moved to the road leading up to UPLB's College of Forestry, near the University Health Service. *Another statue of Maria Makiling was once put up at the boundary of Los Baños and Calamba City, on the boundary marker that identifies Los Baños as a \\"Special Science and Nature City\\". The statue has since been removed. That specific statue had been criticized by some members of Los Baños' religious sector because they said it glorified a territorial spirit. No official remark has been made, however, as to whether this complaint had anything to do with the removal of the statue. *The most recently unveiled statue of Maria Makiling stands in UPLB's Alumni Plaza, sculpted by Filipino artist JunYee. *At least three other statues in the UPLB campus are associated with Makiling, although not explicitly stated to be statues of the goddess herself. The oldest is the reconstructed pre-war statue referred to as \\"Dalambanga\\" (literally meaning jar bearer) near the Molawin River, depicting a woman (sometimes interpreted as Makiling herself, and sometimes called \\"Maria Dalambanga\\") carrying a jar — a reference to the legend of how Calamba, Laguna got its name. Another is the \\"Mother Nature\\" statue that serves as the facade of the Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau in the upper campus.http://erdb.denr.gov.ph/mother.php The other is Maria Pureza Escaño's 8-Foot Fiberglass Resin Sculpture \\"The Rose of Marya: Service through Excellence\\" intended as a \\"tribute to the women of UPLB who excel and serve.\\"http://puchetteescano.weebly.com/the-rose-of-marya-service- through-excellence.html *In Arnold Arre's graphic novel, Ang Mundo ni Andong Agimat, Maria Makiling is in love with a Katipunero (revolutionary). When her lover is killed by Zolgo, she loses her memory due to trauma. She wanders down to the city, with no clue on who she is. The graphic novel chronicles the efforts of the protagonists to find Maria and restore her memory. *To celebrate the launching of the UPAA Maria Makiling Foundation, an advocacy group formed by the UP Alumni Association to promote conservation efforts of the mountain, the Foundation held the Mariang Makiling Ecological-Cultural Festival. A highlight of that event was what UPLB Chancellor Velasco described as a relauching of the image of Maria Makiling—modelled at the event by television star and singer Karylle. Says Renowned theater director and UPAA Board Public Relations Director Behn Cervantes: Karylle was chosen by the organizers for her graceful demeanor and sweet image, her expressive eyes, and her luxuriant wavy hair that typifies long-held descriptions of Maria Makiling. *Maria Makiling features significantly in Karen Francisco's novel \\"Naermyth\\", a fantasy adventure novel set in a post-apocalyptic Philippines, where creatures of lore, folktales and the once-mythical waged a war that led to the human race's downfall. In the novel, the diwata are neutral in the war between men and naermyth, and Makiling is a major figure among them. *The character \\"Salome\\" (played by Mara Lopez) in Vim Yapan's 2013 film \\"Debosyon\\" incorporates the legend of Mariang Makiling, along with other prominent diwata from Philippine myths, such as Mariang Sinukuan, linking them to the legends of Daragang Magayon and to the mythos of the Virgin of Peñafrancia.http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/07/31/13/cinemalaya-review- debosyon-more-love-story At one point in the script the character acknowledges herself as the personification of the mythical beings, Makiling named among them, throughout the Philippine archipelago.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI-vbfoFFE *A fictionalized version of Makiling was portrayed in the 2018 television series Bagani by Maricar Reyes-Poon. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Master of the Filipino Madonnas in the 40s\\" - Simon Saulog's painting of Maria Makiling.

Located in the Misrak Gojjam Zone of the Amhara Administrative Region, it has a latitude and longitude of , and an elevation of 2,446 meters. ==History== === Origins === The city is named Debre Markos after its principal church, which was constructed in 1869 and dedicated to St. Markos.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 6 December 2007) Debre Markos was the capital of Tekle Haymanot, Nigus of Gojjam during his reign and as a result, Pankhurst notes, the population of Debre Markos \\"fluctuated greatly with the presence of absence of the army\\" of the Negus. He states that when the Nigus resided in the town, it had between 20,000 and 40,000 inhabitants; in his absence, between 5,000 and 6,000. The explorer Pellegrino Matteucci (b. 1850) arrived at what was at that time named Monkorer on 3 June 1879, explored the neighboring area, then departed 20 June for Adwa and Massawa. === 20th Century === The palace of Nigus Tekle Haimanot was remodeled in 1926 by his son Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot, in the style of European buildings after his tour of Europe in the party of Ras Tefari. In 1935, the town had postal, telegraph, and telephone service. The Italians arrived in Debre Markos 20 May 1936. Through an interpreter, Achille Starace, who had arrived by plane, told the surprised local inhabitants that he had come to free them from their oppressors to their thorough bemusement. Debre Markos was later isolated and practically besieged by a revolt in 1938. General Ugo Cavallero, with sixty thousand men and supported by airplanes and tanks, had crushed the revolt by the end of May. A major Italian fortification was located in the city during the existence of Italian East Africa, and captured by the British Gideon Force and Ethiopian Arbegnoch (or Resistance Fighters) 3 April 1941 during the East African Campaign. In 1957, Nigus Tekle Haimanot School in Debre Markos was one of 9 provincial secondary schools in Ethiopia. The next year, the town was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as a First Class Township. In 1960 a branch of the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority had started operation in Debre Markos. == Education == Debre Markos has Public Research University, Teachers College, and Private Colleges. == Climate == As typical of the elevated portions of Ethiopia the climate is subtropical highland (Köppen: Cwb), despite the proximity to the Equator.

Born in Melbourne, Bresciano played youth football for Bulleen Lions, before moving into the National Soccer League with Carlton. In 1999, he moved to Italian Serie B side Empoli, beginning a twelve- year stay in the country. In 2002, he moved to the Serie A with Parma, later playing for Palermo and S.S. Lazio. From 2011, he spent the final four years of his career in the Middle East, first with UAE Pro-League side Al Nasr and then Qatar Stars League club Al-Gharafa where he last played in 2015. Bresciano had a long career for Australia, making 84 appearances and scoring 13 goals. He played in three FIFA World Cups, two AFC Asian Cups (one victorious) and the 2004 OFC Nations Cup winning team. His goal against Uruguay in the 2006 World Cup qualification play-off sent the match to a penalty shootout which Australia won to qualify for the first time in 32 years. He previously represented Australia frequently at youth levels, including the 2000 Summer Olympics in Australia and the 1999 FIFA U-20 World Cup. ==Biography== ===Early days in Australia=== Bresciano grew up in Rosanna, Melbourne. He began playing football locally and later progressed to the first team of Victorian Premier League side Bulleen Lions in 1995 at the age of 15. He made little impact until his third year in the first team, scoring four goals in four league games and helping Bulleen to the 1997 VPL grand final. Bresciano's reputation began to grow and he was selected in an Australian Schoolboys squad that toured the United Kingdom in 1996. In 1997, he featured prominently in Australia's unsuccessful U17 World Cup qualifying campaign, scoring five goals. At the end of the 1997 season and upon completing high school at Marcellin College, he was offered a place at the Australian Institute of Sport, where he reunited with childhood pal Vince Grella. The players' careers would mirror in the coming years as the two supported their footballing endeavours on and off the field. He and Vince Grella signed with new National Soccer League (NSL) club Carlton for the 1997–98 season, but Bresciano was forced to wait until Round 17 to make his NSL debut. He then played every game for the rest of the year, as Carlton finished second with a place in the finals. Bresciano scored in injury time to win the elimination semi-final and put the club into its first grand final, which they lost 2–1. He stayed with the Blues for the 1998–99 season, scoring four goals in 18 games, but the club finished well outside the top six. In 1998 and 1999, Bresciano made a number of appearances for Australia in various matches at Under-20 and Under-23 level, including the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, where the Young Socceroos were eliminated in the first round. ===Move to Italy=== As for many Australian players, a career in Europe beckoned for Bresciano as he sought to develop his game and further his career. Bresciano and Grella had sights set on a move to Italy, spurred in part by their Italian heritage. The pair joined Empoli in 1999, who had been relegated to Serie B the previous season, and became regular selections in the first team. In Bresciano's third year at the club, he scored 10 goals and helped Empoli to a fourth position and promotion back to the top-flight Serie A. The pair also appeared several times in the Australian Under-23 team in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics, particularly in friendlies held in Europe. They were both included in the team for the Sydney Olympics, although Bresciano only saw limited action as a substitute. The following year, his efforts with the Olympic squad were rewarded with a call-up to the \\"Socceroos.\\" On 1 June 2001, Bresciano received his first cap for Australia in a Confederations Cup match against France, coming on as a substitute in the 78th minute for Josip Skoko. He made a further five appearances that year for the \\"Socceroos,\\" including another match against France in a friendly at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), again replacing Skoko as a substitute. In the summer of 2002, he joined Parma for €7 million, at the time a record transfer fee for an Australian player. \\"Moving to Parma was a big change in every way, not just money-wise but it is a big club. The structure of the club, the facilities, its popularity means you are under a lot more pressure to get a result,\\" he said following the close of the season, well aware of his profile. Though he was hampered by a series of injuries, his 24 appearances in 2002–03 helped Parma to fifth and a UEFA Cup place. With Empoli being relegated again, he was reunited with Grella who stayed in Serie A with a transfer to Parma. ===Goal scoring for Parma and Socceroos=== Setting himself a target for the 2003–04 season of five goals, Bresciano surpassed that with eight goals from 33 appearances, the most of any midfielder in the Serie A, as Parma finished fifth in the league again. Bresciano had also claimed a regular spot in the Socceroos line-up, justifying his selection with a string of goals, including a match-winning free-kick against New Zealand and the only goal in a one-nil victory against South Africa. Parma's fifth place qualified them for the UEFA Cup, where the club advanced through to the semi-finals before being eliminated by eventual winners CSKA Moscow. Their league performance that year was in stark contrast to their UEFA Cup form, as they were forced in to a play-off to retain their Serie A status by finishing 18th in the league. Bresciano and Grella were excused from the 2005 Confederations Cup by then- Australian manager Frank Farina to allow them to take part in the play-off against Bologna — Parma went on to win the tie and remained in Serie A for the following season. Both players returned to the Australian squad in September 2005, now under the direction of Guus Hiddink, for World Cup qualification playoff against the Solomon Islands, followed by a friendly against Jamaica where Bresciano scored the first of Australia's five goals. After playing the first leg of the CONMEBOL – OFC World Cup qualification play-off against Uruguay on 12 November, Bresciano scored the only goal in the second leg four days later. The 1–0 win levelled the playoff 1–1 on aggregate after extra time and the Socceroos won the ensuing penalty shoot-out to advance to the World Cup. Parma recovered well in the 2005–06 season with Bresciano playing the majority of games, finishing a respectable 10th by season's end in May 2006 (later rising to seventh and a UEFA Cup place after the Calciopoli findings). Bresciano described their resurgence as physically finding their form. Despite starting poorly, the team went from \\"strength to strength\\" as the season went on, with Bresciano himself becoming mentally tougher for the experience. ===2006 World Cup=== Buoyed by his strong club season, Bresciano played in Australia's opening game of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, being substituted before the team went on to score three goals and defeat Japan. He came on as a substitute in the second game against Brazil and, in the third Group Stage game, was instrumental in the 79th-minute goal scored by Harry Kewell against Croatia. The goal resulted in a 2–2 draw, a result securing Australia's place in the second round. Against Italy, Bresciano was judged to be in a scoring position in the 50th minute when fouled by Marco Materazzi, the Italian receiving a red card. Italy went on to win after being awarded a penalty in the dying minutes of the game, eliminating the \\"Socceroos.\\" After being identified as a key player for Australia, Bresciano's overall performance at the tournament failed to live up to expectations, described by an FFA writer as \\"solid without being spectacular,\\" although his role as a set-piece- specialist was highlighted. ===Palermo and Asian Cup=== Shortly after the end of the World Cup, Bresciano was signed by Palermo on a four-year-contract, and made regular first team appearances in the Serie A and Europe. In October 2006 Bresciano scored what some – including Socceroos Assistant Coach John Kosmina – have described as the greatest goal ever scored for Australia in a full international match. In an Asian Cup qualification match against Bahrain, Mile Sterjovski received a cross-field pass which was played first-time back into the penalty area, Bresciano reacting quickly to turn his body horizontally and strike the ball on the volley into the net. The goal drew comparisons to his first goal for Palermo in Serie A, two months earlier, against Reggina on the opening day of the 2006–07 season. Bresciano was on the pitch on 2 February 2007, when violence broke out outside the stadium in the Catania-Palermo match. He was affected by tear gas as it drifted into the stadium and afterwards described the incident as \\"completely terrifying\\". He scored his ninth international goal against China in March 2007. A hamstring injury suffered in May caused him to miss the final round match for Palermo, Australia's friendly against Uruguay on 2 June and hampered his preparations for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. However, he recovered in time for a warmup match against Singapore and played all of Australia's first two Asian Cup matches. He was substituted in the second half against Thailand and the quarter-final against Japan before the Socceroos' elimination on penalties. The Sydney Morning Herald rated the 71 minutes played against Japan as his best performance of the tournament, after average displays in the early matches. Bresciano returned to the national team in February 2008 for Australia's opening World Cup qualification match against Qatar, starting the match and scoring the Socceroos third goal. He also played a full 90 minutes in the second group match, away to China. The new campaign has also seen Bresciano change squad numbers, wearing '18' in the two qualifiers, as opposed to his traditional '23' which he has worn for the majority of his Socceroo career. ===To England and back=== On return from Australia's Asian Cup exit, Bresciano became a transfer target for Premier League club Manchester City. After confirmation from new Palermo manager Stefano Colantuono that he would be leaving Palermo for Manchester, the clubs agreed to a four-year contract with a transfer price of £5 million and he began training with the City squad. \\"I needed a new challenge and I wanted to get the excitement factor back into my game,\\" Mark stated in confirming his desire to play in England, also citing the chance to play under Sven-Göran Eriksson as a big reason for seeking to make the switch. However, talks between the two clubs broke down in finalising the move, with the timing of the transfer fee given as the primary issue – as City sought to delay payment – and Bresciano returned to Palermo to rejoin their pre-season preparations. As the transfer deadline passed and the deal was put off indefinitely, Bresciano continued training with Palermo. He came off the bench for their opening-day loss to Roma, and remained a regular selection under new manager Francesco Guidolin, although more commonly from the substitute bench. He came off the bench in the first match of the 2008–09 season to score a goal, although Palermo lost 3–1 to Udinese. He then established himself back in the starting line-up following the appointment of new head coach Davide Ballardini, playing both as a winger and a deep-lying forward for the rosanero, and also managing to score both goals in Palermo's second seasonal away win, a 2–0 to Sampdoria on 18 January 2009. ===Lazio=== On 3 July 2010, it was confirmed that Bresciano had signed for Lazio on a two- year-contract. Bresciano scored his first goal for Lazio in the Coppa Italia third round win over Serie B outfit Portogruaro on 27 October 2010. ===Al- Nasr=== On 9 August 2011, it was announced he had signed a contract with UAE Pro-League side Al-Nasr Dubai for free. ===Al-Gharafa=== On 6 August 2012, Bresciano joined Qatar Stars League side Al-Gharafa on a three-year contract. He unilaterally breached the contract with Al-Nasr in order to finalize the transfer. On 4 October 2013, Bresciano was suspended for four months and fined €1,377,000 after the manner in which he transferred to Al-Gharafa from Al Nasr, putting serious doubt into his chances for a third World Cup. On 8 January, Bresciano was cleared to play for the Socceroos in the 2014 World Cup. The ban was ended on 3 February 2014. Bresciano and Al-Nasr jointly appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to overturn the penalties imposed on both parties, however this appeal was dismissed.","title":"Mark Bresciano"},{"id":"2571788","text":"Alfred Beck Chapman (September 6, 1829 – January 16, 1915) was a Los Angeles real estate attorney and investor.

Later in 1858 he was sent to Fort Tejon, California, serving there from 1858 into 1859. There he was involved in the Mohave War scouting against the Mohave people, and was engaged in a skirmish at Beall's Crossing of the Colorado River, January 9, 1859. Three days earlier he had been promoted to First Lieutenant, 1st Dragoons and was then sent to Fort Crook, California, serving there 1859-60, and then at Fort Churchill, in Utah Territory (now Nevada) from later 1860 until he resigned, May 14, 1861, following news of the beginning of the American Civil War. Following his resignation Chapman moved to Los Angeles, in Southern California where he took up the practice of law in 1862.Samuel Armor (1921) History of Orange County, California, Historic Record Co, Los AngelesJames Miller Guinn (1915) A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles and Environs ==Attorney== Chapman married Mary Scott, the daughter of Los Angeles attorney Jonathan R. Scott, with whom he studied law. In 1861 he set up a partnership with Cameron E. Thom. In 1863 Chapman became city attorney of Los Angeles, replacing Myer J. Newmark, who resigned,Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials 1850–1938, Municipal Reference Library, March 1938, reprinted 1946 and in 1868 he was elected district attorney of Los Angeles County.District Attorney 1863-1864 & 1867-1869 He went into partnership with a boyhood friend, Andrew Glassell, when the latter arrived in Los Angeles in 1866. Colonel George H. Smith, a former Confederate Army officer and brother-in-law of Glassell, joined the firm in 1870. Their law practice was confined chiefly to real estate transactions, and they made their fortunes by handling the large partition suits. Chapman was the businessman of the firm. He took his compensation in land, and nearly every final decree in partition would find that Glassell & Chapman had acquired more property. Chapman and Glassell are best known in Orange County for being founders of Orange, California. The firm represented the Yorba and Peralta families in the partitioning of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana in 1867, and had received for a portion of their fees certain large parcels of land in the partition. He joined with one of his partners, Andrew Glassell, to develop a new community, Richland (which would eventually be named Orange). They hired the land surveyor, Frank Lecouvrier of Los Angeles, to map this tract, which they called Richland Farm District. 'Richland' was originally the name of the Virginia plantation owned by the father of Andrew Glassell in the 1830s. A large transaction by Chapman and Glassell was the legal suit known as \\"The Great Partition of 1871\\", brought against the Verdugo Rancho San Rafael properties on the Los Angeles River and in the Verdugo Mountains. The legal fees were again paid in substantial land transfers.\\"Adobes of Rancho San Rafael,\\" laokay.com He at one time also owned \\"practically all the land\\" where Glendale, California, and the suburb of Tropico were established. Chapman continued to practice law until 1880. After retirement, he devoted full-time to managing his rancho in the upper San Gabriel Valley, a portion of the Rancho Santa Anita grant, and became involved in citrus production. ==Family and later life== Chapman had six children by his first marriage to Mary Scott. He married again after her death in 1883, and had one child by his second marriage to Mary L. Stephens, daughter of a pioneer California attorney and judge. Chapman died on January 16, 1915, at the age of 85 in his residence near Sunny Slope in the San Gabriel Valley, \\"the result of heart failure following a severe cold.\\" Survivors were his wife and children A.S.

Emiliano Mutti was born in 1933 near the small lake Orta in northern Italy. During World War II his father Ido moved the family to the small mountain village of Nociveglia in the Northern Apennines. Surrounded by rocks and forests, Emiliano developed a love for the mountains that he has never lost. Later, when he realized that the rocks in this valley were turbidites, he returned to study them and produce classic papers on deep-water depositional systems. Emiliano completed a master's degree in geology at the University of Milan in 1959. His thesis was on the stratigraphy and structure of Tertiary Macigno turbidites in the Northern Apennines. From 1960-65 Emiliano was assistant professor of sedimentology at the University of Milan. In 1965, interest in research led him to accept a job with the Esso Production Research Lab in Bordeaux, the European affiliate of Exxon Production Research Company in Houston. Through this connection, Emiliano met Chuck Campbell, and the two of them did field work in Italy. After several weeks, Chuck invited Emiliano to the United States for additional training. The time spent with Chuck was a turning point in Emiliano's career. He describes the experience this way: \\"At that time I had a lot of experience in field mapping and knew turbidites quite well. Chuck realized that I didn't know anything else. He took me into the field in the States and taught me how to recognize fluvial and shallow- marine. Most importantly he taught me his stratigraphic approach\\" In 1969, Emiliano resigned from Esso to become a professor at the University of Torino. In 1971 he received his PhD and in 1975 he became a full professor. In 19sn Emiliano moved to the University of Parma where he was a full professor of sedimentary geology. Now he is retired. During his career Emiliano has mainly worked on stratigraphy and sedimentology of turbidite basins in fold-thrust belts, notably in the Spanish Pyrenees, the northern Apennines, and Greece. Much of his work is summarized in classic papers co-authored with Franco Ricci Lucchi, and Bill Normark. Since 1989 his work has focused on stratigraphy and facies analysis of flood-dominated fluvio-deltaic deposits and their relationships to turbidite systems in many tectonically mobile basins worldwide. Emiliano is a field geologist with a very strong passion for sedimentary rocks. Anyone who has been in the field with him knows that he is a master of observation and description. He always carries a sketchpad in the field; his sketches of outcrops are extraordinary for their detail and ability to sort out complex sedimentary relationships. All of' his papers are characterized by superb photographs, which are the result for his love of photography. Emiliano has received numerous awards and honorary memberships in geological societies. He has written over 100 scientific papers and several books on stratigraphy and turbidite systems. Professor Emiliano Mutti coached several geologists, mainly from Brazilian oil company Petrobras in various activities in the regions of the Spanish Pyrenees and the northern Apennines in Italy. In 2004 E. Mutti won the Twenhofel Medal from SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology), which is the highest medal of recognition to a career of excellence in sedimentary geology. ==Selected publications== E.
